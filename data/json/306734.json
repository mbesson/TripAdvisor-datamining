Booked half board but we were disgusted to find on arrival that we were only allowed a buffet breakfast and buffet dinner in the same overcrowded, dirty restaurant. At no time were we informed of that before we arrived. Seated at dirty used tables, having to beg for spoons and forks, and glasses for juice. We did manage four side plates one morning......we were amazed! The food was cold and lacked variety, not what was expected or paid for. It took four days for the staff to ask if we would like a drink with dinner, and that was because we had spoken to the manager before hand. That was just the food....now to sleep, or lack of. There are at least two OUTDOOR nightclubs that are raving away until 3.30 am at least five nights a week, hence the 18/30 notation.

Oh i nearly forgot to mention the air strip on the beach that had two small aircraft taking off and landing every twenty minutes or so with a full passenger load of skydivers. Staff look after the local ex-pat crowd that use the night clubs but seem to just take hotel guests for granted.

I was woken at 3AM every morning from their return of clubbing. I spoke to the desk in the lobby and was told these matters would be investigated, but if this happened again to telephone immediately. Not only was the noise on their return at 3AM, but it often led to some sort of domestic-violence, shouting, swearing, thumping walls and doors for around 1-2 hours. They then started smoking in the corridors, which came in through our ventilation system. I know the hotel is not responsible for the noise made by guests, but we felt they did nothing to rectify it.

The staff is clearly aware of this, judging their reaction when we complained (after three days of trying to ignore it and even getting ear plugs).

We arrived on 28th Dec to a chaotic reception, crammed with an oversized Gingerbread House, around 35 flashing Christmas trees and a plethora of loud Russian guests. Check in was a laboured affair, where organising 3 rooms took approx 30mins. 2 of our party (myself and boyfriend) were placed relatively quickly and driven down to our room on a golf cart. The other rooms were not yet ready, bearing in mind this was a 4.30pm check in after a late check out from Abu Dhabi. The other members of our group waited more than half an hour for their rooms to be readied. Our room; firstly, I can't fault our porter. He was polite and attentive, explaining everything we needed to know in detail. My only observation was he was perhaps too keen, but I'd rather they be this way than rude and uninterested. The hotel claims to be 5 star but sadly falls short on many counts. Our room was dirty; the patio windows were dirty/smudged, the net curtain stained, our welcome book had dirty marks all over the front, the room was dingy and smelly, the balcony had bird feces on from the hotel\u2019s many roaming peacocks, the bathroom stains on the floor. I wasn't overwhelmed. On our first night we ate at the Italian restaurant. The food was of decent standard and good portion size. We were entertained by a singing Duo who had a poolside stage. Little did we realise this entertain, which was quite literally looking over our room's balcony, would be going on for some time at considerable volume. We enquired with reception and they curtly told us it would end at 11.30. However, the poolside duo was nothing compared to the noise emanating from Club XL on the beach till 3am DAILY. The baseline from the club was awful; I've stayed next door to Es Paradis in Ibiza, and this wiped the floor with that! I was exhausted and so did fall asleep once, but awoke later to further bass. Additionally, on Tue and Thu, the open-air (between the two towers) Horizons bar has ladies night and has banging music till 3am, so you get a double whammy on these days. I am deadly serious when I say PACK EARPLUGS, or walk out of the hotel towards Le Meridien and there\u2019s a pharmacy you can buy amazing earplugs in \u2013 this is the only way to get close to a restful nights sleep. On our first morning we tackled the buffet. I say tackle because you have to fight for your life amongst the rabble of Russian guests who quite literally stockpile their food, bringing carrier bags to fill with pastries. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it: one morning we even queued for 15 mins to get a table. Lunch was more civilized and a very good quality. Although not well known, the hotel's beach is quite literally next to a runway where \u2018Skydive Dubai\u2019 sends up 2 small aircraft with parachutists in. You might not have gotten any rest the night before from the banging nightclub, and you certainly wont get much on the beach what with the take off and landings, combined with the stench of aviation fuel. You couldn\u2019t get a space by the pool \u2013 too many guests and not enough loungers. On New Years Eve various areas of the hotel had been sectioned off as they had private parties happening \u2013 it made you feel very limited in where you could go as though us as paying guests weren\u2019t of importance, and the external people were again getting preferential treatment. This is how the nightclub made us feel \u2013 they didn\u2019t care we had paid a lot of money to stay for 5 days, and instead preferred to cater to the bar and club scene. On our last day our room key stopped working at 11am, even though checkout was at 12noon. So, after being on the beach and desperate for the loo, we then had to run all the way up to reception to get the room key reset for an hour so we could shower and check out. When we did finally checkout we got a snotty Russian lady on reception who called housekeeping to check our room and minibar, and another wait ensued. Why they don\u2019t just take a card at the start of your stay, or ask you if you had anything from the minibar\u2026 maybe this is a reflection of how much they trust and respect their customers. All in all I would strongly recommend you not to book this hotel. It is a loud, dirty hotel, which doesn\u2019t value your stay. The staff are generally friendly, but totally overworked and under supported. If it didn\u2019t purport to be 5 star I could have forgiven its many shortcomings. The noise, however, is completely unforgivable. Sadly we came here directly after a stay at the Yas Viceroy in Abu Dhabi and the difference was night and day. Honestly, don\u2019t waste your money, find another hotel \u2013 we will never go back here.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cdubai prices!!\u201d", "Author": "philipsmith", "ReviewID": "UR122508873", "Content": "The 5* hotel ,although having 5* facilities, failed to meet my expectations.

From the moment we arrived at the Habtoor Grand it was effortless, we had a night flight and arrived early morning and fairly tired but ready for our 1 week stay. we did not expect our room to be ready until the afternoon but they gave us refreshments and we sat in the foyer and said our room will be availible in 30 mins. Again we seen on trip advisor that some people were concerned that they asked to put 2000 Dhs on a credit card for your stay, which i have to say is normal and actually a great utility to have at hand. Now the noise issue, we was aware of this before we arrived , I have 2 young children under the age of 11 and we had a family tower room on the 15th floor inside over looking the Horizon Bar. Now this was our only negitive part of this hotel and holiday, Yes the music did play until 3am in the morining which was very annoying. However i know the hotel did move some people that night as we spoke to some other guests here who were not happy with the noise either and they demanded to be moved which the hotel managment kindly did. For the rest of the week there was no noise coming from the bar below after midnight which we could live with as we were not going to bed until then anyway. The hotel does need to think about thier policy with this as most of the family tower rooms are on the inside overlooking the bar below. Also to clarify there is a night club on site which is a magnet for the younger generation but this nightclub is on the beach which is quite a didstance from the main part of the hotel and we did not here any noise coming from the area. The service from the staff was over and above from what i was expecting, we do not get this level of service and respect in the UK. If you are seen carrying a bag they will take it from you and ask you where would you like it to be taken. If you wanted a taxi they would get one fro you straight away, The pool bar waiters were very polite and at hand when ever required for your drinks or food. This plus point out weighed the negitive from the noise coming from the Horizon Bar. The swimming pool is great for all ages, the kids loved the slides and it was very clean and tidy. The Private beach was great also, we had a fantastic view of the sky diving which is at the end of the beach. Some Tips, If you are on a budget, Try the resturants around the corner on the \"The Walk\" there are plenty of places to eat but will not serve alchohol which are cheaper than the hotel resturants. Alcohol is very exspensive at the hotel, do not drink bottled beer, drink draught beer which is only Hineiken which is cheaper than bottled beer. We found It was quite chilly at night during the month of December so take something to keep warm. There are quite a few Russains who stay here who treat the staff like slaves so ignore them, but there are alot of Russains in Dubai so where ever you stay you will see them Overall this hotel was excellent and we would stay here again.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cA stopover\u201d", "Author": "ayrbrain", "ReviewID": "UR122043083", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights enroute to Australia.

I had read the reviews about this hotel before I booked and the main concern we had was the negative comments regarding the noise from the night clubs. I emailed the 'director of rooms' 6 weeks in advance of our stay requesting to be allocated a family room \" as high as possible\" in the tower to avoid being disturbed by the music.On check in there was no record of this request but I had printed the email ( and response ) I had received so showed it to the check in staff. Thankfully they had a room on the 23rd floor ( there are only 25 floors ) so we were feeling pretty smug. Only problem was housekeeping were still cleaning so \" take a seat madam it will be 15 to 20 minutes \". 45 minutes later we had been forgotten about so my husband went to the desk to be told it was ready so we were shown to our room but the luggage was not in the room - another 30 minutes was wasted waiting for our swim wear so we could get to the pool. Pool was lovely , plenty of free sunbeds and very clean. Once we returned to our room from the pool I checked on my daughter who was showering only to find the drain was blocked and water had flooded the bathroom. After 2 calls to reception who said they would get an engineer to our room but didn't, I asked to speak to the duty manager. As promised he phoned me back promptly but offered no apology , only another shower that we could use in a different room !!!!! No surprise that we declined and said this was not appropriate and not what we had paid for. He said he would get on to housekeeping and then phoned back 10 minutes later to see if they had arrived - they hadn't Eventually the engineers came and cleared the blockage but failed to clear up the flood so my husband took on the role of chamber maid himself. Obviously we did not want to spoil our holiday in Dubai with this nuisance and we did like our room - having said that , even the 23rd floor was horrendously noisy - the only saving grace was the fact my husband said \" the music was good\" We also had to ask the manager to provide towels , mugs etc to our room for 4 people and not two. The hotel was predominately full of Russians who went to dinner en masse making it a pretty unpleasant experience as they barged their way around the buffet restaurant giving it a ' cattle market ' feel. . Buffet was not great either and defintately not 5*. Communication was severely lacking at the Habtoor - it seemed once they get your money the service and customer care is pretty non existant and do not expect ANYTHING to be done with any urgency. Eventually we persuaded the manager to give us some free drinks for all the upheavel we endured which did little to compensate for the time we wasted waiting for our luggage and flood to be sorted. Drinks by the way are ridiculously expensive \u00a34 for a small glass of soft drink and approx \u00a36 for a pint of draught Heineken. Hence the fact that we saw barely no other guests drinking at the restaurant or around the pool. So ............... I would go to India next time where the people are so hospitable and actually care if you enjoy your stay !!!!!!", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMix reviews!\u201d", "Author": "bintheredondat", "ReviewID": "UR121610156", "Content": "The hotels has a resort area and the towers.

I came away feeling stressed, sleep deprived and generally quite annoyed at my treatment at the Habtoor Grand. Stayed here a few years ago in a resort room and actually quite enjoyed the trip, but this trip was just terrible. I checked into the hotel and even booked / paid for an extra night's accomodation to avoid the usual Dubai hotel arguments about rooms not being ready when arriving on the early morning flights from UK. The greeting at reception was lukewarm at best. The resort rooms, pool area etc are also looking quite shabby now too. However, my main issue is the noise and even worse the hotel's response to my complaint (and trust me, I am not a born \"complainer\")! My room was adjacent to the staircase and opposite the accounts office. The cleaning staff seemed to also \"park\" their vacuum cleaner outside my bedroom door on most days. The room was very dark as the \"view\" from the bedroom was the wall of the hotel, overlooking the cobbled \"service route\", used by staff for wheeling porters trollies around. I politely put up with all these disturbances until the Thursday night of my stay, when at 11pm the music started up at the Ladies Night party opposite my bedroom window... I love music and work in the industry, but REALLY... I don't stay in a hotel room in an evening to listen to the booming music vibrating through my bedroom when trying to sleep.. if I wanted that, I would get up and go out. So I called to enquire to guest relations about when the music would finish, and was told 2am.. I couldn't face 3 hours of it and had to be up early the next day so I politely asked them what they could do to assist. The reply... wait for it... \"what do you want me to do about it.. everyone's always complaining\"!!!!!!!!! After asking to speak to the manager at this stage, and asking why they were making me feel bad for wanting a night's sleep, I was told they would see if someone could call me back... 30 minutes later no-one did, so I got dressed and went to reception and I was reluctantly moved without even so much as an apology. I am not some old fuddy duddy, nor am I prone to complaining, but the icing on the cake was the response \"what do you want ME to do about it\" was so unbelievably rude, that I felt compelled to write this review. Not even a small apology at any stage. That's terrible customer service and the hotel management needs to address the noise and service issues.

This hotel has loud music and loud customers crammed into every corner. Aside from the screaming and shouting there were literally people falling down drunk in the corridors. I checked in and was given a 'resort room'. This was in what must have been the older part of the hotel. The rooms have recently redecorated so at leas that was something...however the pumping club music could be heard as if being played inside the room. A call to reception provided the key to another room down the hall that also had the same loud music issue. This time a trip to reception provided a third room also in the resort area right next to one of the night clubs. The previous occupant of this room had also been smoking cheap cigars in there. This room was also rejected. Another vist to reception and some discussions with a shift manager Johan led to another set of viewing rooms, this time dispersed through the two towers. All of the rooms faced the other night club but the sound proofing was slightly better. During the walk around from room to room Johan was trying to explain that Dubai was a party place and that this is what we should expect, additionally he was trying to convince us that 'resort' meant that loud music 24x7 !! For those of us lucky enough to travel a lot this is clearly rubbish. Having finally selected a room we settled down to wait for the music from the clubs to finish at 02:30, only to be confronted by the noise of all the AC units on the roof and the rooms below rummbling through the night. Other points to note: Shower leaks all over the bathroom floor as does the sink. Lights in the room switched themselves on in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. The hotel grounds are not very clean and smell like old booze and stale cat litter. The rubbish pumping Euro Pop club music does not stop even during the day by the pool. The pool side toilet facilities are unclean. There is no cold runnng water in the bathroom in the bedroom. The hot water is scalding hot and the 'cold' water is only a few degrees off boiling point. Lets be real, if you are looking for a crappy old resort with a Benidorm type feel this is the 3* place for you. If you are looking for a 5* luxury Dubai experience you WILL NOT find that here..

We had no complaints about dishes being cleared away or the staff during our stay. This hotel is very heavily promoted to the Russian tour industry, it has its own in house translators and tour bookers, and consequently a large number of the residents are Russian..you may want to take this on board if deciding on this hotel!

This is the ONLY GOOD POINT of this hotel. We have just returned from a 4 night break to the Habtoor - 2 adults and 2 kids in a family room and 2 grandparents in a garden room. Rooms 401 and 121 for the room manager who will no doubtedly return his standard comment on this review but not actually do anything about it! On booking I realised I had made a serious mistake and emailed the hotel to ask if we could have 'quiet rooms' away from the loud music that everyone refers to. They put us on the 4th floor (above the entrance to the Horizon Bar which opens until 2.00am) and my parents in room 121 (next door to the outdoor disco called XL Beach club which opens until 3.00am). Complete disregard to my emailed request. On arrival in the early hours, despite requesting two rollaway beds in the family room on booking there was only one. After the third request (and someone trying to sell us an upgrade!), eventually a housekeeper who seemed to be ill informed of our request turned up with some sheets and advised that we could use the sofa bed shoved in the corner of the room. This is supposed to be five star and certanly not what we have paid for! On checkin we were given no details about the hotel, facilities or how to find them etc. We made our way to breakfast the next morning and my small child wanted the toilet. On asking the waiter for directions he just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know. On the second day our bath mat for the bathroom disappeared leaving the bathroom dangerous for small children (shame they didnt take the shabby looking towels as well!). On the 2nd night my husband was trying to find some ice for the icebucket in our room. He eventually went into reception with the empty bucket and was told someone would bring some up to the room - to this day it never actually arrived. It also seems rather odd but our room was not made up until well after 3.00pm each day. Breakfast rooms are always busy in a morning however they ran out of plates and the fruit juice glasses were always warm? I dont even want to begin on removing used plates from the tables in a timely manner. There seems to be no staff training whatsoever. Horrendous loud music problems on EVERY NIGHT except Mondays and Wednesdays until sometimes 3.00am. Guest relations just shrugged their shoulders once again! It seems to me that this hotel needs a massive refurbishment to bring it anywhere near Dubai usual 5 star service. The loud music is aimed at 'locals' rather than guests and on these nights there is no care or attention to the paying guests. We even had to stop our taxi on the main road and walk with our small children as we couldnt get anywhere near the hotel due to the large numbers of taxi's dropping off the locals to their entertainment venue. No where is this mentioned in their holiday literature or website! The music is so loud (ex clubber in my time) that it would be heard anywhere in the hotel and therefore no changing of rooms would have made any difference. I would advise anyone who has booked to try and change their booking as this hotel should not be able to operate in its current format. I am extremely annoyed that guests are lured under false pretences. It was probably a very nice hotel at somepoint in time. The staff/management seem powerless to make any changes.

Although hotel seems to be pretty old now, and interior requires some renewal, this is still looks very nice.There are no wifi internet in the room and it cost about 30 dollars per 24hrs, so be ready to pay for this. Breakfast was very reach, variety of choices. We stayed on the half-board rate, so we could choose to have lunch or dinner at the hotel, very convinient if you do not want to go outside of the hotel when it's +40 at the street. Beach is very clean and safe, the only inconvinience of the beach is remotness of the beach lounges from the sea, you need to walk about 100 meters to the beach lounges after you walk out from the sea, so we had to put our towels on the sand, and stay on the shore without umbrella. Infinity pool is a life saver in the sunny afternoons, because the water is cool and you can enjoy the shade on the roof.Hotel's location near JBR the Walk, make it a good choice if you want to have a beach at the hotel and have your meal outside of the hotel, there are variety of restaurants on the Walk, so you could choose one for every night out. The only big minus of the hotel I can think of is russian speaking staff of the Elixir spa, which is located on the ground floor of the hotel, the russian speaking lady that was on the Spa reception, is very unhelpfull, not giving any information, and her style of customer communications leaves you to desire a better service. She pretened to not understand any russian and the moment we approached her, than she insisted that she would only tell us about the spa if we take a massage or somthing, it left some unpleasant momories.

When we arrived at the hotel we noticed that our dark musty room near the pool was close to a new outside bar and the room boy recommended we upgrade as it would be noisy. We ended up in a nice upgraded room in one of the towers which we had to pay extra for and looked forward to the remainder of our holiday. However, we had not bargained for the nosie from the nightclub between the towers, which is a franchise ,and the hotel has no control over. The noise levels were unbelievable and even with ear plugs we could still hear it well into the early hours of the morning. The manager was very apologetic and confirmed all he could do was offer us another upgrade at no cost. He confirmed that we would still hear the noise!!

The facility's were great just a shame we didn't make the most of them all, we did use the gym which was lovely and clean and very good equipment. My favourite has to be the horizon pool, it was higher up and over looked the beautiful sea and twinkling buildings in the background! There was always a nice guy to welcome you and bring you a towel. They other pool was very large and had a pool bar. Next to it was a few slides (even fun for us big kids) There are many places to eat and drink within the hotel but were a little expensive but this was to be expected. The grounds was beautifully maintained and had good security! We had no problems with any other guests and never heard any noise from other rooms at night due to solid Walls! NIGHTLIFE....the hotel is quite renowned for the nightlife mainly the XL beach club, this was set a little away from the hotel towards the beach. There is another bar tho which could be heard at night from our room mainly because we overlooked it, it didn't bother us in the slightest as we were all up for the nightlife (to other guests this may be a problem if you go to bed early and are a light sleeper) I'm sure the hotel if possible would move you?!

We arrived at around 7am in the morning and the reception informed us that check in wasn\u2019t until 2pm but they would \u2018allow\u2019 us to go to a room \u2013 like they were doing us a massive favour. With an overnight flight and the time difference added on we were shattered and just wanted to go to bed so I chose to ignore this apparent attitude and being made to feel as though we were a huge inconvenience. Room: We got taken around the hotel in a golf buggy and the driver pointed out where things were, which was a nice touch. Then we arrived at our room, opened the door, and the bathroom ceiling had obviously been dripping for a few hours as the bathroom was flooded, we presumed there was a leak on the floor above. My husband rang reception who said they would send maintenance. We then had a 2-3 hour nap and maintenance had not showed up so my husband walked up to the reception and told them again. On our return from the beach later on the bathroom had been sorted and the leak didn\u2019t come back luckily. Apart from that I was happy with the room, apart from it being on the ground floor when we had requested a high floor. It was a lovely size, clean and had a nice view of the gardens. There is a turn down service every night with a little chocolate placed on your pillow and 2 complimentary bottles of water every day. Also cleaned daily, bed made and towels changed. Hotel: The hotel has lots and lots of different bars, we didn\u2019t get to visit them all but if you do you have to shout to hear each other over the music. There are also 3 restaurants that you can book and have to pay extra to eat there. We looked at the menu for Luciano\u2019s (Italian) but weren\u2019t that taken with it so didn\u2019t bother with any of these restaurants. If you like to go to bed early I wouldn\u2019t bother, the music is ridiculously loud and once in your room a constant boom, boom, boom can be heard. We went to bed around 11-12am and luckily our room wasn\u2019t too close but we could still hear it, although not enough to bother us. After reading other reviews I think we were quite lucky with our room allocation in regards to the music! Beach and Pool: Due to the ridiculous amount of children at the hotel and in the pool area (running around and screaming!) we decided to spend our time on the beach. The staff here were fabulous, made sure we had a bed with a shade etc and just generally helpful. I know certain nationalities like to \u2018save\u2019 sun beds by placing their towels on them, this didn\u2019t happen. The guys moved any towels left for long periods of time to allow other guests to use the sun beds, something I totally agree with! On our last day I went parasailing with the guys on the beach and it was amazing being able to see over Jumeirah Beach from the air. We also spent some time in the infinity pool on the 3rd floor as it is over 16s only so was nice and quiet! This pool is extremely clean and warm and when the marina is finished it will have a tremendous view! Food: We booked B&B but were upgraded to HB and thank goodness we were! The food and drinks prices were EXTORTIONATE!!! I am not a na\u00efve traveller and I have stayed in other 4 and 5* hotels all over the world. I knew Dubai was going to be expensive but I was still shocked at just how bad it was. It was around \u00a36 for an orange juice, \u00a312 for a cocktail and \u00a39 for a bottle of Corona!! As there aren't other restaurants around the hotel and it is a dry country so no bars (and restaurants don't serve alcohol either) they have you over a barrel and can charge what they like. It was about 30-40mins in a taxi to the city centre where all the restaurants are so by the time you have paid that you may as well eat at the hotel and save messing about. Most things cost either 50 or 100AED which was roughly \u00a39 or \u00a318. One day for lunch we got a baguette each that came with either fries and wedges and it cost 100AED, insane!! The food in the restaurant was OK, nothing to write home about. There does seem to be a lot of choice but once you look it is all similar/repeated dishes. I did love the pasta station where they cooked it in front of you and you choose your sauce, type of pasta, and what you want in it. Breakfast was absolutely ridiculous, the staff clearly couldn\u2019t cope and get tables ready quick enough and I don\u2019t feel the time slot is long enough to cater for the vast quantity of people staying at the hotel. I was so disappointed that they didn\u2019t have pancakes, something you expect to see, and what they did have was cold (waffles and French toast). The orange juice ran out as soon as it was topped up because guests where getting up to 4 glasses at a time, probably to stock up on liquid so they didn\u2019t have to pay for a drink in the next couple of hours!! At lunch or dinner when you order a drink they bring a bill, you then pay for it and sign the sheet, or so we were told on the first day by the waiter\u2026.. Our flight to Kuredu was at 10am so we had to leave the hotel at 7am. On checking out the receptionist claimed we had a charge against our room for 2 drinks we had had in the restaurant the night before. My husband had paid cash for these, as we had for everything throughout our stay, we did not charge anything to the room. He argued for a bit then got his manager. My husband was getting extremely angry and irritated as we had to get to the airport and this was now 20minutes later. The manager said that you only signed the slip of paper to agree to the charge been put against your room. We were not told this and now think that some of the waiters are pocketing cash used to pay for things and then running the charge to your room, I\u2019m sure some people wouldn\u2019t notice, but as we had charged nothing to our room we knew it was their mistake. The manager then rang the restaurant staff manager and wanted to speak to somebody who had worked last night, but obviously they weren\u2019t in as they did the night shift so he disappeared to try and ring somebody at their home! We were furious and made to feel like criminals, also worried we were going to miss our flight. He then came back and said it \u2018didn\u2019t matter\u2019 and got us to sign a customer discount card that they swiped through the till, so who knows what happened when he disappeared! It spoilt the end of our trip as they were extremely rude and acted as though we were trying to rip them off. Would I stay here again? Probably not, it is too expensive for what you get, I certainly didn\u2019t feel as though we got our monies worth. We wanted pure luxury with it being our honeymoon and I would only describe this hotel as \u2018nice\u2019. We went on the dolphin trip to Atlantis which I would highly recommend, this includes entry to the water park and the swim with dolphins, although it cost almost \u00a3250 each! All of the trips are super expensive so if you are planning on doing any make sure you take plenty of money. My husband also got a massage in the spa which cost about \u00a380. I would also recommend a trip to the city centre to see the fountain show next to Dubai Mall, and the mall itself is huge!! Defiantely worth a look! One thing that did irritate me is that an old school friend of mine stayed here 8 months before us for her honeymoon and they upgraded her room, put a fruit basket in their room and invited them to a free evening meal which should have cost around \u00a3400 including drinks! We didn\u2019t get any of this, or any other special treatment for being honeymooners which I was disappointed about.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt's getting old...\u201d", "Author": "MrsKRR", "ReviewID": "UR110902132", "Content": "We went to the hotel for four days in May for our honeymoon.

We arrived to a room which firstly appeared nice but upon further inspection you noticed was ageing. There was a handle missing from the bathroom door. You could see where things had been glued back on. There were marks on the walls. We were only supplied with one bath robe and when myhusband put that on, it had large holes in it. The towels were hard and although the room was clean, attention to detail had not been paid. When we arrived there was blue gel all along the bathroom wall and this had been left there and remained there throughout our stay. We were left with no toilet rolls one day. The pools close too early, a late night dip would have been lovely in the heat. As for the salon, I found that appauling. I had a pedicure and was left in immense pain. The stool which the beautician was sat on was held together to cellotape. The salon itself looked and felt very cheap. The spa however was lovely, though it was a shame my husband and I couldn't have treatments done together. In all, on first impressions the hotel looks lovely and our stay was quite pleasant, however, we were hoping for romance and exquisite surroundings but instead got a room which we could hear music beating every night and no rose petals left on our bed.

The manager stated that this was an excellent room which was very quiet and away from all the noise! Luckily, after a heated discussion, he managed to get us moved into the tower, which was quieter and we had a better view as well. As it was a saturday night, we could still hear the music, but it wasnt so bad - the other nights, the music was very quiet as was the hotel (maybe all the reviews have put people off from staying here!). I dread to think what its like on a friday and saturday night though! Definately the priority appears to be with the nightclub and bars and not the guests The rest of our stay here was pleasant, food was ok, staff were very slow (but got there in the end), rooms need some paint and more functional items, but on the whole it was a good destination to stop at. However, if we stayed in the annexe, then I would have been extremely disappointed and have asked for all of my money back, I wouldnt recommend putting animals in there to stay! Also, please DONT book any excursions with the chimps at the hotel - they are well overpriced and a waste of money - instead speak to the concierge who will give you a Dubai map, and local companies that can offer exactly the same things for half price.

We booked the holiday through DreamDubai (dreamticket.com) travel agent. Our requirements: 5 star hotel on Jumeriah Beach, kid friendly, non-smoking room, with one king bed. Prior to paying for the holiday, the travel agent was initially fantastic helping us sort out air and hotel. We had seen the negative reviews on the hotel and were extremely hesitant but a colleague in the travel agent's office vouched for the Habtoor Grand. We further requested seats on the plane before the wings as my boys get motion sick and the forward seats minimize the problem. After we paid for the trip, I noted the final confirmation had noindication of non-smoking room but with two double beds (when we travel we co-sleep so not accepatble). I called and e-mailed multiple times but from the day we paid until a week after the trip never heard from our travel agent . Note we did speak to another representative the day we flew out but had no reassurances. We also contacted the hotel ourselves. Problems: - Seats in the back of the airplane (and one of my boys did get sick) - Not only did we not get the early check-in we requested ;we didn't get our room until nearly 6 pm (check-in was 2 pm) - the hotel upgraded us to a suite, so it had a king bed but it was SMOKING (I would have preferred our friends room that had just king bed, no sitting area, but no smoking either) - the room and anemities are dated; carpet needs replaced - looks like 1970's - the shower was broke, soaking the entire bathroom floor (never fixed despite several requests); had to roll towels outside the shower doors to act as dams - the phone was broke, so light was constantly blinking (particularly annoying at night - again never fixed) - the common areas of the hotel was nicer and the hotel was generally clean - meals were convenient bu chaotic; not enough glasses to get drinks (regardless of when you ate); nor cereal bowls for breakfast - became a running joke with our families - further half board didn't cover drinks; so we spent over 500 on juices, water, soft drinks - no personal touch (had to serve own drinks; clean up own plates) experiences wouldn't expect of a five-star - my kids take piano lessons and on the last night was rudely removed from the piano that they had played multiple times, usually recital pieces (I'm specific because they weren't \"banging\" on the piano - put up a sign if you don't want people playing your piano) - concierge was no help; for example when we enquired what we needed to book a dolphin encounter, we were told to \"look it up on the internet\" or wait until the excursion agents returned the next day (desks manned by companies); my questions were generally to the tune of how long it took to get to a location or the opening hours... - when we did ask the next morning about the dolphins at Atlantis, we were informed fully booked; we went to Atlantis anyway and got tickets immediately Helpful HInts - Wild Wadi: take your own towels (charged 45 to rent) - Ski Dubai: pack gloves (not a rental item; had to buy in store next door); where helmets in the snow park! - Burj Kalifa: buy tickets on line before you leave (no tickets available on day of entry) Overall, we had an enjoyable trip but no thanks to our travel agent. Our friends were able to organize the air and hotel themselves for the same cost as the agent (actually lower; agent then threw in half-board, which in hind-sight tied us to the hotel.)

Our room was great...we had views of the sea, harbour plus 3 of the best landmark hotels, the atlantis, burge and the burge khalifa. The pool area is fantastic, plenty of comfortable sun loungers where you collect fresh bathing towles each day to use. The infitity pool on the 3rd floor is gorgeous too for a bit of peace and quiet. Leading from the pool area is the gardens then the beach which has plenty more bathing areas and bars to chose from.

The salamar bar is is a must to try before or after dinner (you can also eat here) The atmosphere is so relaxed and in suberb surroundings to just chill.

As it was my birthday during my stay the hotel staff brought up a gorgeous birthday cake and birthday cards signed by everone at the hotel which was very thoughtful! One disaster i did have whilst my stay at the hotel was at the hair salon. I wanted my hair pinning up for an afternoon tea at the 7* burge hotel as it was my birthday. The service here was shocking. I left in tears as the hairdresser was terrible and had no idea what he was doing (even though they advertise wedding hair!!) I ended up just doing my hair myself. DO NOT USE THIS SALON!! There is plenty to do, a free shuttle bus goes to all the big shopping malls, i recommend the dubai shopping mall, its amazing, you can see the underwater zoo, go up the tallest building plus if you have dinner here, from 6.30pm, every half hour they have the splendid dancing fountains (far better tan the bellagio!). I also reccommend the safari, dinner cruise, atlantis day trip and big red bus tour. Aslo, always wear a seat belt whilst travelling...the road safety is horrendous! Sad to leave, will definately recommend this trip to anyone!", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel for good price\u201d", "Author": "moscowolechka", "ReviewID": "UR100123106", "Content": "I really loved this hotel.

I have to say that on reading the reviews I was a little concerned - however, I am happy to report that the majority of the reviews on here are rather unjust based on what we experienced! Perhaps there has been a change in the way they do things but we really enjoyed our stay here! We arrived at the hotel around 8am and understandly our room was not ready. We had requested one of the family rooms higher up in the tower having read about the nightclub on here. We were offered a drink whilst the staff member tried to find out when the room would be available. When it looked like it might be an hour or so we were invited to have breakfast. As it was, halfway through breakfast the staff member (I wish I'd made note of his name!) came through and told us that our room was ready when we were. Whilst on the subject of breakfast - its what you would expect in terms of a buffet breakfast with people walking around and a seemingly high turnover on tables but the staff were very quick to clear down tables, the food & drinks were regularly replenished and they seemed to appear from nowhere to replace clean cutlery (my youngest dropped his spoon the floor). The food was tasty and fresh and the banana cake was a particular favourite with my two. The room was clean, had a great view of the beach and the bathroom was very clean and tidy. We did overlook the Horizon Bar nightclub, which did concern me, this would be my ONLY criticism - on the Thursday and Friday night the music was very, very loud and seemed to get incrementally louder after midnight til around 2/3am. Unfortunately I am a light sleeper and once I heard the music found it very difficult to tune it out. The rest of my family however slept through it undistrubed. Saturday night there was no music at all. The pool was lovely and clean, the staff very friendly and attentive and the food from the pool bar was of a good standard and price. With regards to the food at the hotel - I can highly recommend the Salamar restaurant (hope I've spelt it correctly) Sat on the decking in the evening, the whole ambience was very relaxed but quite special. Our waiter (Islam) was very friendly and attentive, the food was amazing *cooked to perfection* and even the chef came out to speak to us. Their signature bread was freshly cooked and delicious and my steak just melted in the mouth. We also dined in the Bonsai on the 25th (?) floor - this restaurant is amazing! We sat on the terrace which looks out towards the palm, it was a little breezy (but we were determined) and the waiter bought out a couple of pashminas for my daughter & I to borrow. The decor and ambience of the restaurant is fantastic! Once again the food was delicious - my children throughly enjoyed the soft shell crab starter and the puddings were out of this world!! The one thing that struck me with the food is that it is all freshly prepared and cooked - they take real pride in the presentation of the food. It was also the little things like the pashminas, ensuring the children had their food in a timely manner and keeping them entertained, that just made our stay very very enjoyable. It was nice to go somewhere where the children aren't treated like parasites (I have two very well behaved children) and where they are proud of their service. I would happily recommend this hotel to anybody - although if it was a family with young children I might add a caveat about the nightclub, but even then I think the good points far outweigh the loud music, the food, service and friendly staff make this a good place to go.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "smanteghi Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR99379029", "Content": "When we arrived room was ready.

I had e mailed the hotel earlier asking for a quiet room, and this was. ( It may have been that we were lucky to miss a disco night!) We had 2 great nights at the Habtoor, excellent staff attention in the restuarant, reception, concierge, house keeping, pool area etc, could not be faulted. Good choice of food in the main restuarant for lunch, dinner and at breakfast. Good choice of bars and restuarants throughout the site. Food and drinkis not cheap, but of good quality. Nowhere in Dubai is cheap! We really liked the division of areas e.g. pool area, grassy area with sun beds etc and the beach. There is still a lot of work going on around but nothing obtrusive and if you know that before you go then it shouldn't be a problem, everywhere in Dubai there is ongoing works. The only negative would be the lack of free Wi Fi in public areas which this day and age should be a must for a 5 star hotel. We enjoyed a trip on the Big Bus (catch a minibus from the Royal Meridien) for about \u00a335 per person all day around the sights and sounds of Dubai, well worth it. They run shuttle buses to the main malls from the hotel, and The Walk is approx 15mins walk away with masses of restuarants and shops. Plenty of taxis available outside, and the nearest metro is only 15mins walk away if you want to get around by that.

At around 1pm we were allocated our room, on the 4th floor a tower room with sea view. It wasn't a high floor but the view we had was amazingly breathtaking. One window we had a view of the sea and the other was of the infinity pool. Our room was located near the Horizon bar, which at times had loud club music playing until 2am, it didn't bother us but for others it may have. Breakfast was served between 6:30am to 10:30am, as it was peak season we were smart enough to realise the later you go, the more likely you would end up waiting so we regularly ate at 8:30am. There was no queue and plenty of space. The food was a slight disappointment, the fruit was just watermelon at times and the range for the cooked breakfast was limited, however the range of bread and pastry were endless. The pool and beach was beautiful, at times it was busy but it was never impossible to find a sun lounger even at peak times. The pool bar staff were friendly and regularly checked to see if we required drinks or food. Even the lifeguards were friendly, acknowledging and greeting us all the time. On one day of my holiday I was taken ill, and once requesting to see a hotel nurse, the nurse arrived at my room within 20minutes. The hotel staff even wrote a get well card and left plenty of juice for my speedy recovery. The hotel staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, always greeting us when we passed in corridors and offering assistance. The tours operator always gave us his honest advice on which tours were definitely worth going on, and would make the conscientious effort to catch-up with us afterwards to ensure we fully enjoyed ourselves.

When we went to the bedroom we were not able to sleep until about 2 am due to the noise from the bar area outside (we were on the 7th floor!).

My largest complaint was that the noise was not coming from an offsite club that they had no control over, they allow this party to go on disrupting the guests on that side of the hotel. I was surprised they allowed that to happen. The other complaint is the location seemed far away from the attractions however, cab rides aren't TOO expensive if you really wanted to stay there. The breakfast buffet was great that was included with the room. There was also a lunch charged to our room that was not us. When I complained, reception removed the charge immediately.

Our first vacation at One and Only Royal Mirage was so great that our hopes were really high, but...Our sea view rooms were okay even though we didn't get connected rooms as requested, there was a corridor between the rooms. This was okay. What wasn't okay at all was the fact that there was a very loud party with live band just under our windows and we had to stay awake until 2.30 AM the first night because of that. We called the reception and complained, but the loud bass sounds just continued. Kids were miserable! The next morning we demanded new rooms and were given rooms without sea view from the resort. We accepted them even when they were old and in much worse condition than the newer tower rooms. We just had to get sleep, vacation without rest is a nightmare. The most depressing experience about the room change was the fact that the hotel asked us to sign a paper indicating that we don't have any claims for reimbursement, since the new rooms were cheaper, but we had asked for the change ourselves (!!!). We didn't sign that form even when it was asked for three times so the new rooms were now 100 dirhams cheaper per night as compared to the sea view rooms (being 2000 dirhams/night/room). The biggest disappointment however was the fact that the female hotel manager who gave orders to the person who negotiated the new price with us did not take any contact with us, unhappy customers, who have waited for this one week vacation for months. She just spoke with her employee and seemed annoyed with the fact that we had been complaining. New year's eve celebration included a lot of suffering as well. As a tourist it is almost impossible to leave the hotel at that date because of traffic and it is actually compulsory to buy the dinner package if you stay in the hotel. (Well, we should have joined the party at the nearby Le Royal Meridien that obviously had much nicer party, but we didn't know that). The dinner package was really expensive and even our 16 year old had to pay for the adult price including all the drinks even when he cannot drink alcohol at that age! We selected the Lebanese restaurant and the service was extremely slow, main course was cold and it arrived at 23.45 so in order to see the fire works at the beach we didn't have time for the cold food. The music was extremely loud and due to the loud speakers it was also of very lousy quality. There was another restaurant nearby and they had different music so we had to listen to both. Our 11 year old was really suffering, because we couldn't even hear each other over the table without shouting really loud. And then the fire works at the beach...we didn't get there in time, because there was only one admission point to the beach and the restaurant didn't give us the wristbands so that we could have enetered and we didn't have time to go back to get them.

This is common with other reviews and I would strongly recommend that you take heed. For 3 nights of my 6 night stay the noise from the outside nightclub (which is placed between the 2 towers for maximum disruption) was truly deafening. It was so loud that you couldn't hear your TV, ear plugs were ineffectual and this went on to 2am and beyond for 3 of the nights. Bear in mind I was on the 12th floor with double-glazed windows and maybe this will give you some idea of how loud this was. Complaints were ignored and frankly it ruined the holiday.

Drinks in Bartini are expensive but staff are very friendly and the cocktails are great! As mentioned in several of the reviews, the music from the Horizon bar is very loud and does go on till 2am most evenings. They had a party night on both our first and last evenings which had a live DJ and were attended predominantly by the rich locals - worth experiencing to get a sense of the brash millionaire's playground that is Dubai.

All the previous comments regarding noise levels are true. We had a room on the 22nd floor and could still hear the music. If we went in one of the bars I would say perhaps 50% of the time we were made to feel like we were intruding so for 5 or six nights we went out and drank in other hotels nearby. It's only my opinion but I think the hotel is more interested in locals or Arabian people. As holidaying westerners we were given the cold shoulder. We experienced nothing like this in the other hotels. The food quality was excellent (but very similar every day) and the hotel location is great, but these are the only good things I can think of. The day after returning I received an e-mail from guest relations hoping I had had a good stay and inviting me to comment on Tripadvisor. I think they should be getting reviews back to them where someone can be put in charge of doing something about it. I see this as another sign that no one is really bothered. Walk in the Meridian next door and you get the wow factor.Walk back in the Habtoor and you feel disappointment. That's the difference. With the prices they charge, and the competition round it together with it's location the Habtoor needs to take a long hard look at itself.

Having stayed at the Atlantis last year i worried as to how 'tired' this hotel really was. I travelled with my mum and two young children ( 1yr & 3yr) and stayed at Habtoor for 5 nights on half board basis. We stayed in a tower room which was spacious enough for the kids to run around in and thats with having a cot in the room. Two bottles of mineral water were daily placed into our room complimentry along with a fruit platter. The staff were all fantastic and attentive in every respect. The staff were extremely good with the kids especially Savio who we saw regularly at breakfast and dinner. All staff we came across were more than willing to help with bags, buggy etc. The hotel itself is comfortable and what makes it extra special is that you get the personal attention which you most definately don't get in bigger hotels such as the Atlantis. The kids were welcomed by staff in hallways, lounge, swimming pool area etc by their name which i thought was really nice. The beach is a little walk away but there are plenty of loungers along the way that you can rest upon if needed. I had a twin buggy and it could have been very tricky getting to the beach had the staff not been there to assist in carrying it up and down stairs for us. If you fancy a stroll to 'The Walk' its a 10mins walk from the hotel. In fact its probably less than that as thats how long it took us with a double buggy. The only negative point i would like to point out is that there is an open air 'club' that has music blasting into the early hours of the morning EVERY NIGHT!! This was a real nuisance and i really do think that the hotel should consider limiting this to a few nights a week as it caused us real disturbance. I has requested prior to us going to the hotel that we were put in a room that was not affected by this noise as we had 2 small kids with us.

Arrived early at the hotel (7 am) and were told our room would not be ready until 2:00 pm. However, Concierge could not have been more helpful in taking in bags, providing somewhere for us to change. etc. We were able to use all the hotel facilities and were quite happy to crash out around pool until check in. On checking in, we were informed that we would be immediately upgraded from our bed and breakfast package to half board, which we could take as lunch or dinner in the buffet restaurant.

There was always a vast selection to choose from, always cooked well and plenty of it - there was certainly something to satisfy any palate. Having checked in our room, a tower room with sea view, was clean, well decorated and suited all our needs - we had to wrestle with the Concierge to stop him trying to unpack for us! All the staff within the hotel and grounds were very attentive throughout our stay - and perfectly happy to cater to our every whim. We had a bit of a mishap on the first night when on arriving back to our room we found the shower door had somehow smashed all over the bathroom. We called security and were immediately upgraded again and moved to a tower suite on the 23 floor - this room was something else again !!! Contrary to what i read on here before we went, the room was serviced 3 - yes 3 - times a day with water replaced whenever they came in. We received fruit, always had our bed turned down, chocolates left and curtains drawn and room thoroughly cleaned and tidied.

The staff are great and overall its very good apart from one small but important feature. On the 3rd Floor there is an open air bar between the two towers. In the daytime its a great haven for a swim and a drink. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays they have very loud , high bass driven dance music, which starts about 9pm and carries on until 2.30am...... If you are unlucky enough to have a room facing the bar on either tower you simply can't get to sleep until 2.30am at the earliest. As a seasoned traveller, even with earplugs I just could not get to sleep. Fine if you want to party, but if you have to get up and work the next day, then its not great at all. Customer relations told me they get complaints about this every night they party and the owners won't do anything about it as it's a concession, not part of the hotel and it makes big bucks for the owners of the hotel. If you have kids they will hate it as the windows vibrate its so loud. After calling the duty manager he apologised but said he could do nothing abou the noise level. Customer relations offered me a buffet meal in compensation and some fruit....... But as the hotel was full they could not move us. If you do stay there I suggest you specify a room not facing the pool or find somewhere quieter if you need a good nigts sleep. We really liked the hotel, beach, various resteraunts and the staff were very good, but on a business trip you really do at some point need to sleep and when paying five star prices, you really don't want to be limited to 4 hours sleep a night. This happened 3 out of the 5 nights we stayed. Although I liked it, I would not stay there again.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSimply The Best\u201d", "Author": "Debs099", "ReviewID": "UR85994828", "Content": "What can i say, this hotel has to one of the best we have stayed in.

The weather this time of year is perfect - 35C and sunny everyday and would highly recommend a holiday to Dubai at this time of year. However, we are still undecided if we would return to the Habtoor. The positives: Great facilities - 2 swimming pools (we particularly loved the horizon lounge and pool), tennis courts, gym, lovely private beach( amazing sunset), a great variety of water sports and excursions (would highly recommend the sunset desert Safari - considering how expensive things are in Dubai this was really cheap), 12 different restaurants and bars and an excellent buffet restaurant. We stayed half board and always enjoyed our meals their - with plenty of variety. With half board you can choose each day whether you have lunch or dinner which we thought was great. We also loved to have lunch at the beach bar - really comfy chairs and huge portions. We often would share. This also cut down costs. The service around the pool and in the restaurants was always very good. The rooms were very spacious and the beds are huge and incredibly comfy. We upgraded when we arrived to a tower sea view room and are so pleased we did - lovely views of the palm and atlantis in the distance. Ok the negatives: On the Tues and Thurs of our stay their was a ladies night and another themed night in the horizon lounge. We went along to the ladies night where I had 3 free glasses of champagne and had a great night. Its a great party atmosphere but the booming music and I mean booming goes on until 2am! So basically if your room is near that and most are you literally cant get any sleep. We got back to our room at 11:30 and it genuinely felt like we had music playing in our room. To cut a long story short we asked to change rooms which they happily did but when Thursday night came we had exactly the same experience and the new room wasn't anymore quieter. As a gesture of good will the hotel did refund the room upgrade for the nights we were inconvienienced but after feeling totally relaxed half way through the holiday I ended the holiday feeling shattered as had little sleep on our final night. If you like to sunbath somewhere quiet and peaceful then the main pool in the afternoon really wont be the place for you as again they play pumping music from the pool bar and when im on holiday in Dubai Radio 1 really isn't what I personally would choose to listen to. However, on a positive the beach, grass area and horizon pool are all lovely areas to sunbath and relax. And finally our last little gripe was that the fruit wasn't replaced daily in our room - it was a little hit and miss and our beds were not always turned down in the evening, Which are minor things but expected in a 5 star hotel. As you can see there are so many positives with this hotel and if you were able to get a room high up and away from the horizon lounge then I would prob recommend it as it is one of the more reasonably priced 5 star hotels on Jumeriah beach. If you want total luxury and dont mind paying a bit extra this probably isnt the hotel for you.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hallandale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cStay inside the club zone\u201d", "Author": "arigatous", "ReviewID": "UR85330362", "Content": "We stayed in the club room. + Great room with great view + Breakfast on the 25th floor + Personal consierge was really helpful - Balcony was a bit small - Sea could be closer (You can use that golf cars, though.

All in all - a great stay - and I would have no hesitation on recommending the hotel to anyone - even when travelling with teenagers!", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guernsey", "Title": "\u201cSome Good Some Poor\u201d", "Author": "harleyfamilyGuernsey", "ReviewID": "UR75263606", "Content": "We've been going to Dubai for 10 years & have stayed at many hotels along Jumeirah Beach. We've seen the construction work totally transform Dubai over this time but the last time we visted was in 2006 so it was a huge shock this time round to see just how much was still going on. There is a lot of work going on in the area of the hotel & it does take the edge off things when you are entering / leaving / looking out of some windows / walking along the beach so whilst this is not necessarily the hotel's fault, just be prepared for it. We booked somewhat last minute and had limited choice of hotels & given some of the comments on this site, we would have chosen elsewhere if we could have done - to summarise now, in relation to my stay I certainly recognise some of the positive and negative comments here. Firstly, our treatment on arrival was excellent - we arrived at about 0830 & the room was ( understandably) not ready but we were put on a priority list & they promised to get the room ready asap. In the meantime, the receptionist noticed that on our final day, we'd be leaving too early to have breakfast so \"transferred\" it to our arrival day. As such, by the time we'd gone through check in formalities & had breakfast & a little snooze on the couches in reception, our room was ready & we were in the pool by 11.30. The room was fine & I don't recognise any of the cleaning / decor / room standard issues mentioned in some reviews. Air con was set too high but a quick chat with reception & they adjusted it straight away. Only real criticism is (i) spare bed for my son was about as soft as granite and (ii) pillows almost disappear into nothing when you lay on them ( ask for more & they'll gladly oblige though) There are only about 10 rooms on each floor so the corridors are quiet. I've seen some comment about noise from the bars at night but I didn't hear a thing ( we were tower B, floor 16) The pool area is tatty & basic - the concrete it shot in many places, some of the slabs around the pool are loose and the loungers could do with a good scrub. Plenty of loungers around so no need compete with the Germans! A few irritating things (i) they seemed to be painting / varnishing something most days & there was a bit of an overpowering smell at times and (ii) whilst I enjoy music round the pool, they might want to consider that not everyone does - if they turned it down from level 10 then some people may be able to enjoy the pool area more. (iii) lifeguards have a job to do, no doubt about that but they are a little whistle happy for things tht really are no big deal Going towards the beach - it's a bit of a trek but no big deal. There are some nice gardens & grassed areas if you want to lay there. Big let down is the work they are doing - they are building sun shelters & all you can hear is a concrete mixer & power tools all day. The management should take heed of this & put themselves in the place of the customer as it really takes the edge off it. The building work outside the hotel is very noisy at times so be prepared to listen to machinery & general banging & crashing. Restaurants - in general these are expensive given their quality. Forget the evening buffet, its about \u00a330 a head plus drinks and there is a limited ( and bizarre!) choice of hot main courses & unless you are a huge eater, you'll not get good value from it. They have a free kids menu ( as long as an adult has a main course) but our son is used to more sophisticated choices than chicken nuggets so they could think about re-vamping this. We used room service a lot ( why don't they extend the kids menu to this as well?) and went out to the malls ( etc.) to find a far far better choice. Breakfast is fine - it's a buffet with a reasonable choice to cater for most tastes. At some times it was a bit busy but nothing that bothered me ( and I'm an impatient so and so!). To summarise, whilst this place was OK & I had a good relaxing time, I wouldn't go back partly for reasons within the management's control & some outside their control. It looks like more substatial building work is about to start right next to it ( & I MEAN RIGHT NEXT TO IT!)& this would be nothing short of a nightmare!", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201c'' excellent''........................\u201d", "Author": "car_0_liner", "ReviewID": "UR74677104", "Content": "we arrived early and the staff gave us our room without waiting at all, room was clean and exactly as described, our first visit to dubai and we are definitley going again, first class service/staff/food/ and to top it off the best weather we have ever had on holiday..........", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cPoor guest relations\u201d", "Author": "Honesty66", "ReviewID": "UR74387532", "Content": "This was supposed to be a romantic getaway for our anniversary night and i had specifically booked a tower room sea view facing for the purpose.

Yes the drinks were expensive but everything else made up for this.

This was part holiday/part catching up with friends who live out in Dubai. Having read the reviews, I was a bit concerned about the cost of meals and drinks, both in the hotel and elsewhere, and I have to say, this is without doubt the most expensive place on earth. You do have to put things into some sort of perspective though. Given that we went during the oppresively hot months, we managed to get a 10 night stay (B&B) with flights for about \u00a31,500 total. Which seemed very reasonable. So, you would think a few expensive drinks and meals is fair enough. Think again. Our exchange rate was about 5.1 Dirhams to the \u00a31, which meant that.... Can of Coke from the mini-bar was an eyewatering \u00a35, small can of beer from the mini-bar a staggering \u00a39 and a small packet of crisps \u00a35. Don't think that it gets any cheaper in the hotel's other bars and restaurants. These prices are more or less the same there to. If you want lunch at one of the bars/restaurants, you are looking at about \u00a316 for a sandwich and chips. Don't even consider drinking wine - \u00a335/\u00a340 for a bottle of cheap wine. The hotel has free wifi, but if you don't have a laptop with you, the internet access next to the lobby is \u00a310 per hour!!!!!! Now I fully expect the Manager to respond to this by saying that the prices are the same at other hotels, and you know what, he's right most of the other hotels are even more expensive. We went to the bar at the Westin and paid \u00a311.50 for a pint!! I am sure that this is all due to the import taxes etc. but it did ruin our holiday because we were constantly arguing about what we should eat or drink. We were fortunate that our friends cooked for us on a few occassions, otherwise we would be bankrupt. Turning to the hotel itself, yeah its pretty smart, nice gym, nice restaurants etc. If you are the kind of people that have money to burn and what to stay somewhere nice then maybe try one or two other hotels along this strip. The Habtoor is certainly not one of the more impressive hotels. The Westin was absolutely stunning, but probably more expensive. The staff at Habtoor are ok, some really do go out of their way to help you, but the phrase \"too many cooks spoil the broth\" springs to mind. I have never been put through to so many departments and on hold so often just trying to order a cheese sandwich. When we arrived we were put in one of the cheap rooms overlooking the gardens. Plumbing problems in the bathroom meant that we needed to move rooms, which again \"too many cooks\" meant that we lost half a day sitting around waiting. Then, the air-con in our new room failed to work properly for the remainder of our stay. Although both the engineer and reception staff were quite forthright in telling me that I was wrong and that it was working. It never dropped below 26 degrees. If you like boutique hotels, then this is not the place for you. This is not a 'special' hotel. As a place, I can't really see the attraction to Dubai. The beach is dirty, littered and manmade. The shopping centres are impressive, but no cheaper than over here. I would however recommend the water park at the Atlantis Hotel. Lots of fun, albeit \u00a350 a head to get in!!

Undergound bar was a good venue, ( but reminded us of home to much so wanted to avoid the typically English places.) Breakfast was good, plenty of choice,our room was a sea view tower room, nice and big, bathroom clean and they serviced the room twice a day, nice little touches like turning the bed sheets over at the top and leaving a chocolate by your pillow every night made it that little bit more special. I emailed them a few days before our arrival to tell them we were on honeymmon and on the second day they gave us a free bottle of wine and a nice cheese board with bread and grapes ( very much appreciated as wine is about 25 quid a bottle) I'm not sure if they offer it but dont take an All Inclusive option. Yes they have plenty of places to eat, but it's really easy to get a taxi and go to a different place every night. Make sure you get a copy of the Time Out Dubai magazine, we got one on the plane but they did have one in our room as well. It's a weekly mag that has loads of really useful info in. The main reason to get this is that the hundreds of Restaurants in Dubai will all advertise their offers on meal deals so well worth a look. Spoil yourself and go to the Burj Al Arab. yes eating a 3 course meal there is very expensive, but we went for the cheaper option of late afternoon Cockails. It cost us 185 dirims each( about 30 quid each) and we got 2 cocktails and a nice appertizer. They gave us a nice card with congratulations on your honeymmon and treated us like royalty. This is THE place to go in Dubai and when ever you see a programme or a magazine reveiwing Dubai, a photo of this iconic hotel always comes up. The experience was well worth 60quid.

Booked it with the holiday rep at the hotel, got pikced up and dropped off by car. Buffet food and soft drinks included this was about 40 quid each. 2. Went to the Dubai Museum and fort which gave a really good history of Dubai and also the plans for the future. It's all air conditioned, audio and visual exhibits and was very interesting.

We stayed at Habtoor Grand for 4 nights. We really did our research before going on this holiday and wanted to pick a good hotel and good location on Jumeirah beach. I don't think we made a mistake. just like the name the hotel was grand. Like all of Dubai the hotel was spotless from early morning to late night. Litter was swept up before it hit the floor. People are cleaning all day long. We travelled with our 11month year old daughter. It was our first holiday with her and we were quite apprehensive about going to Dubai because of the hot weather and were worried if there would there be adequate facilities to cater for her. We had no problems what so ever. It was hot between 39-42 degrees during our stay but Dubai is more then well equipped to cater for the heat. The only place you feel the heat is when you are outside walking. Our daughter did not seem to mind the heat at all but we were careful not to stay out too long. We would call room service if we needed to heat up her baby food or sterilise her bottles in the microwave and they were more than happy to do this. We requested extra bottles of water and we were given them. Staff were always helpful. We were late getting up on our first morning and had missed breakfast however the restaurant manager allowed us to sit and have what was left which we thought was nice of him due to the little time in between the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch service. The hotel provides you with robes, slippers, toothbrush, paste, cotton buds, cosmetic wipes, shaving cream, razors and plenty of towels of varied sizes. Rooms are cleans twice a day. There is a bar on the 3rd floor which does play music quite loud until about 2am. We stayed in a tower room on the 9th floor and could hear it quite loud but it did not effect our sleep because we did not sleep till 2am anyway. It did not effect our little ones sleep either. If you are a light sleeper is would most likely bother you.If we were any lower down in the tower it would have been too loud. We found the music was louder on Thursday night, maybe due to it being the weekend. There was building work near the hotel but it did not effect our stay. Some people have said that they have had to pay a deposit when checking in, we were not asked to do so. The receptionist did ask my husband for his credit card details but we said that we will pay as we go. That was accepted. I have read reviews on her which state that people were charged for items from the mini bar when they had not had anything from it. So we thought best not to give them a card to charge anything to. We did not used the mini bar as it was expensive just like anything you buy from hotel. We has 2 teas, 1 coffee, a scone and a slice of cheese cake at the hotel lobby and that cost us \u00a325. There is a little mall called The Walk a 10min walk from the hotel where there are a few restaurants and a supermarket its much cheaper than eating at the hotel. Taxis are a good price similar to UK if not cheaper. You would pay a lot for a London cab. Some people have said that if the hotel gets a taxi for you it cost much more but that's not true. The Dubai taxis are the best, its the other private hire companies that charge more. There are 70,0000 Dubai taxis so you don't need a private hire company. one. The beach is beautiful and was not busy when we went. There are many water sports to do but are a bit expensive but thats Dubai especially if you are staying at Jumeirah. Arranging excursions yourself can save you between \u00a310-\u00a315 per person. I found out about some excursions in the Gulf Today newspaper available in the restaurant at breakfast which were cheaper then what the hotel was charging. There is a in house phone where you can call all Dubai landlines for free. The hotel is a good location, not far from many of the sites, Burj al Arab, burj dubai, various malls. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. Its a good hotel for young families. We would visit again.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Introduction to UAE\u201d", "Author": "MissGGalway_Ireland", "ReviewID": "UR68737757", "Content": "We stayed here for four nights during Ramadan in September.

The items that were snapped up quickly were promptly replaced, we were seated quickly, and staff were on hand with tea or coffee, and to cater to our needs.

Ok, there is a lot of building work going on around the hotel, but it does not affect your enjoyment of the amenities. The hotel is situated within walking distance of many other restaurants, and shops, which we frequented at night for a leisurely stroll. Yes, you did have to walk to the beach from the main hotel, but it did not bother us in the least, with the pool and the beach being away from the main building, you will not be disturbed if you are looking to have a sleep in. Rooms are large and clean, with a particularly spacious bathroom, and a lovely shower. We would return to this hotel. We found the staff very helpful, especially the bell-boys and concierge at the front of the hotel. They brought us to our room on the first night, and were especially helpful. Bottled water was replaced daily, or more often if they found the bottles to be used during the day. A turn-down service was included every night.

Previously we have always stayed next door at Le Royal Meridien (LRM). We have watched the marina area of Dubai grow before our very eyes and also seen the towers at the Habtoor being built. The reason we decided to stay at the Habtoor this year was because we felt that the service at LRM was not as good as in previous years. Yes, we understood that Dubai had suffered some financial blows like the other countries, but we didn\u2019t expect the service to drop at the hotel (not when we were still paying similar rates to stay there as in previous years). In addition, with the credit crunch and low exchange rates, we thought LRM may have offered more \u201chappy hours\u201d and other special offers on food or beverages. We had looked around the Habtoor on previous visits to Dubai and we really enjoyed the Underground pub; they offered 20% off beverages, a good value menu and excellent atmosphere. On this basis, we decided to give the Habtoor a try! We arrived at the hotel early and were disappointed that we were not offered a complimentary fruit juice whilst we were checking in. Not important really, but it would have been a nice touch (this is after all a 5* hotel). Our room was ready early (11am) which was appreciated. We stayed on the 22nd floor in a tower room and were very impressed with the size, d\u00e9cor and facilities in the room. The bathroom was lovely with a walk in shower (at LRM, you only get a separate shower in the tower; club and standard room have over bath showers). We had a good view overlooking the grounds at LRM, the Gulf, the horizon pool and the marina. We had two complimentary 50cl bottles of Emirates spring water and the concierge said if we needed any more we should ring room service. Later that day we phoned for more water and we were told that we are only allowed two free bottles a day (at LRM you get about six bottles a day \u2013 the more you drink, the more you get). Part way through the holiday I noticed that our room was in the Grand Club. This means that guests can take advantage of the Club Lounge. We asked at reception if this was the case and we were told that we could use the lounge only once \u201cto get a flavour of it\u201d. We thought this was very odd; when our room has been upgraded at LRM we have also been able to have full use of the advantages that come with the upgraded room. Needless to say, we did not use the Club Lounge on principle. On our first evening we had a variety of complimentary fresh fruit in the room. This was a one off. We had to take fruit from the breakfast buffet for the rest of our stay (at LRM you get three pieces of \u201cfruit of the day\u201d each day). You should expect your room to be serviced twice each day; once in the morning (make the bed, tidy up, replenish tea/coffee etc) and then early evening (draw curtains, draw back bed, leave chocolates, replenish tea/coffee etc). This was very hit and miss. Our room was only serviced on five out of ten evenings. We complained to housekeeping the first time it happened, but the next evening the room was still not serviced. Again we complained. In the end we gave up; if the room had an evening service it was a bonus. The room was very noisy during the night. Six times we were awoken by loud music which went on until 2.15am. We think it may have come from the bar on the 25th floor, or the bar on the 3rd floor, or the tent by the horizon pool. Regardless of where it came from, it was very loud and even earplugs did not help. I would have hated to have stayed in a room on a lower floor. We first sunbathed at the horizon pool; on the third floor between the two towers. This was very quiet and pleasant with good views across the Gulf. For the remainder of the holiday we stayed by the main pool. Luckily the hotel was very quiet so the lack of parasols was not an issue. I would estimate that there was one parasol for every fifteen beds. You can sunbathe in the gardens, but there are even less parasols there. The main pool is part of the original Habtoor hotel (which consisted of the garden rooms and some of the restaurants). It is dated, but it is adequate. It was disappointing that the hotel did not bring round cold face towels \u2013 at LRM they bring them round twice a day in addition to cold water sprays and a small glass of flavoured slush (very welcome when temperatures are 45oC)! There is a pool bar and you can also order snacks. A 70cl bottle of English spring water is 25DHS and bar snacks range from 40DHS for a cheese sandwich to 65DHS for a chicken salad. A pint of lager is 38DHS and, if you\u2019re feeling flush, you can buy half a bottle of Johnny Walker for 400DHS! These are normal prices for Dubai. Breakfast was very disappointing. It was served in Al Dhiyafa (the international restaurant). The tables were very close together and this gave it a \u201ccanteen effect\u201d. You were not shown to your table; a waiter would hold his hand in the air to beckon you across the room \u2013 not very 5*! The buffet selection was poor, for example, the cheese platter had one type of cheese on it. The jams were served in large bowls (rather than small individual pots) as were the yoghurts. The worse thing was that no pork was served, so you could not have sausage or bacon with your cooked breakfast. They did serve veal bacon, beef or chicken sausages but they tasted awful. Pork was served in other restaurants in the hotel so I find it hard to understand why it wasn\u2019t served in their \u201cinternational\u201d restaurant. They can\u2019t say that they don\u2019t serve pork for religious reasons because you can be sure that they served alcohol on an evening in Al Dhiyafa! The gem at the Habtoor is the Underground pub. The staff are very efficient and friendly. The menu is varied and value for money by Dubai standards. We also ate at the Thai, Italian and Lebanese. All restaurants were very good and very informal. Our friends have stayed in the Habtoor on numerous occasions and have always enjoyed their stays there. They last went in 2007. When we told them how the hotel is now, they were shocked and said that the standards have certainly dropped. What Dubai hotels must understand that is most people go to Dubai to experience the luxury and attention to detail one would expect from a 5* hotel. Standards are dropping yet prices aren\u2019t. This needs to be addressed if Dubai wants to continue to be at the forefront of luxury holiday travel.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "walsall", "Title": "\u201cNot bad..\u201d", "Author": "DavdH", "ReviewID": "UR67879394", "Content": "Just returned from a weeks stay at the Habitoor.We are regular visitors to Dubai,must say this hotel was \"nice\" but not as\" exceptional \"as others we have stayed in.Bit confused why the need to put in tempory bar in the quiet area of the infinity pool ? especially as there were plenty of other places to drink and watch the footy.Though I found it quite amusing watching the workers trying to pin down the walls of the tent and errecting flags and curtains ! a bit \"too many cooks spoil the broth guys !\"However this did not spoil our stay.

We only ate the once, in the Underground and the food was great .... I would definitly recommend the Vegy Platter. The Location is fantastic. Only 3 mins by foot to the \"Walk\" which has dozens of restaurants and shops. It is also only about a 12min walk to the Metro. We spent most of our time lounging in the Horizon Pool, nice and relaxed as families with kids stayed down by the Main Pool. Ok...... now for the gripes! ..... We were given a late check-out of 14:00 instead of the usual 12:00. But at 12:30 when I went to the room, the key-disc wouldnt work. Recetion quickly fixed this, but I got the impression this was a common occurance ..... maybe a wee spot of Staff Training needed? On the Friday morning, I asked the concierge about the Metro and I was told they come every few minutes ....... my wife and I wasted a 25min round trip walking there and back in 40 degree heat, as he didnt say it didnt open until 14:00 aaagggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh! Whilst there is a booking service at the Hotel for trips, it would be a good idea to maybe have some leaflets displayed showing the route to the metro, times etc. Also some leaflets on the various museums in old Dubai. The price of drink is extortiant at \u00a37 a pint, and whilst this can be justified by a high import license? ...... A can of coke costs 20p in the local shops, yet \u00a34 in the Hotel?????? The Pool around the Horizon desperatly needs a make-over, the cushion covers have dryed in spills and the whole area needs repainted. The Room Manager - Osama - reads the reviews on Trip Advisor and the Hotel are listening! One of the common complaints is the noise at night from the Horzon Bar. 2 weeks ago, when we were there, they had started covering the area with a thick plastic tent thing to reduce the noise levels. ....... maybe in reaction to reviews on here? Overall I would agree with reviewers that this isnt a 5 star hotel but a very good 4 star hotel. It is exceptionally clean and the staff friendly and attentive. The Location is excellent and it has all the amenities you would ever need. I would defintly reccomend this Hotel to freinds.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hornchurch, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI must have stayed at another hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Angelaphilomena", "ReviewID": "UR67099450", "Content": "After reading the reviews on this hotel for the past few months, i was a bit hesitant about going there.

Our daughter lives in Dubai so we wanted to spend some time with her. We had a garden room and didn't see any rooms in the towers. The room was very large with two single beds pushed together. There was a seating area and fresh fruit with complimentary water. The bathroom was on the small side but clean. Shower was over the bath with a shower curtain(a bit of a pet hate of mine). Furnishings were traditional and along with the deco were a bit tired. A/C was very efficient. Garden pool area was crowded and lots of small children. Beach was a fair walk from the hotel. I agree with another review that it is a bit reminicent of Benidorm in the 1970's. Adults can use the 3rd floor sun terrace and infinity pool which is much nicer but the view of the ? dock /harbour airport is a little odd. We tried to take our daughter to both the beach and the pool area and were told in no uncertain terms that she would have to pay \u00a3 20 to sit with us even if she didn't use the facilities. We were shocked, I know they have to keep out the general puplic but we were guests and this was our daughter. We had breakfast in the restaurant the first day and were not impressed. Then we received an invitation to the club lounge for breakfast the second day where the food was hotter and more acceptable. Dubai is very expensive - we went to the Meridian next door to the Habtoor on our last night to their fish restaurant - two courses each for three people and a bottle of wine was \u00a3260. The only places to drink alcohol are the hotel bars and they make the most of it. It feels strange to eat at a pavement cafe and not be able to order a bottle of wine. The Habtoor is well positioned for local eateries and the beach but is probably not the best hotel in the area for the money, so its worthwhile doing your research.Unless you are very wealthy you will need to take a mortgage if you want to really enjoy all that Dubai has to offer.

One night they provided a buffet seafood and you had a choice of a range of shell food including lobster. Very tasty. My four year old couldn't get enough of the desert table. It was very impressive.

Location - very good and convenient for everything. Downsides - Breakfast - tasty but very busy. Drinks - so expensive \u00a37 for a beer and \u00a310 for cocktails by the beach.

They did even offer to send a bell boy up to pack all our things for us so we didn't have to do a thing! The shop in the hotel costs a fortune \u00a327 for sun tan lotion!

This is a 5star Hotel on Jumeirah Beach, wich is what we were looking for alongside other hotels, however this one came up as the cheaper deal for us, and as we are not super rich we went for it on a half board basis as it was \u00a31200 cheaper than the rest in the vicinity. (more shopping money!) I then came across tripadvisor and read the reviews and became really worried about the Horizon Pool Disco Noise as mentioned in most reviews becuase i was travelling with my mum and my son, i did not want this to be unpleasant for them. I emailed the hotel right away and expressed my concern about the room and the noise, i was mailed back straight away and told that they would do everything they could to accomodate my request for a quiet room and exceed my expectations. fine, so i wait until we get there and to my surprise they had upgraded me, great!! it did take a while to alocate the room but i think thats because we arrived at 9:30 am and officially cheack in isnt until 2pm but we wanted to settle after a long flight, anyway after talkin to my contact Osama, who was such a nice man we were sorted with a beautiful tower sea acing room at 1pm. This room was on the 11th floor underneath the Horizon Pool (3rd floor) in the same tower (there are 2 towers) but i thought this is such a nice room, lets see what these reviews are actually talking about.. Well pleasantly suprised the disco DID NOT keep us up we were sound asleep and only ever heard the first half hour of the music, and yes it was on every night, however depending on what you expect from the hotel and the price you pay, you need to remember that this hotel does have the Bar on 3rd floor and plays open air music, I was really worried about it but actually it was never a problem to us, my mum never heard it and my son wouldnt even notice it ater a long day out, it was fine. Be realistic if you want and expect NO noise on this holiday then Pay \u00a32000 more and stay somewhere else like the jumeirah Beach or the burj if you are lucky..,even then cant guarantee any noise!!!.. This hotel is ina fantastic position, right by shops and bars and has free shuttles to all the malls, even better, the staff are amazing especially Cathy and Savio in the restaurant, i mean i could not have asked for better hospitality and believe me i am Fussy and do expect good service, the place is CLEAN and rooms are cleaned Twice a day, what more can you ask for?.. free water is left everyday in the room and fruit and cakes, blimey this is somewhere you can put on weight!! they spoil you... We also went Half board highly reccomended as the food is delicious, so fresh and tasty, honestly you are spoilt for choice!! no bacon but who wants english breakfast in dubai?? I you have kids like myself they will be spoilt rotten, staff love them and there is a great pool and waterslide for then as well as the private beach. Yes there is building work all around,Dubai is Construction city!!! if you do not want to see it or hear it then dont come. here.. half the buildings still need to be completed.. and their building more... this hotel may sufer more from building noise than say the hotels in the middle of jumeirah beach but its hardly noticeable when you are having on playing on the beach or just relaxing but the pool with music. Peoples reviews on here are unfair to the hotel, i think they have been very unrealistic, at the end of the day as i said before, if you pay less for a 5 atar than another 5 star then what do you expect? this hotel done more than enough and more, exceeded my expectations and therefore we had a fantastic holiday and did not want to leave, we will be back Habtoor, this was the best trip we have had and we woulfd like to day Hi to Osama, (Cathy, Savio and Mohammed in the restaurant,) they work so hard and always have a smile on their face,thats what holidays are all about, making you feel comfortable and welcome and thats exactly wat this hotel done.

Throughout our entire stay at the hotel the manners of bell boys, room service staff, waiters, receptionists could not be faulted. Our room was very clean and spacious, it was on the 4th floor and overlooked the Horizon bar and pool on the floor below. In the distance you could see Atlantis, infact it was a lovely room with a lovely view. That was until night time when the Horizon bar and pool became an open air night club. It was impossible to sleep until the music finished in the early hours of the morning. However we were assured it wasn't open every night, just Tuesday and weekends. We were only staying 3 nights, so it wasn't a problem, we would be away before the weekend. Unfortunately, staff higher up the ladder seemed to have the chip on their shoulder. This was first realized on the day after our arrival Mum suffered from severe sickess and diarrhoreoa. She was too poorly to get out of bed so I went to breakfast on my own. Before leaving the restaurant I asked the waiter attending my table if I could take a couple of slices of melon to the room for my Mum as she was unwell. I was told \"certainly\". As I walked out of the restaurant I was stopped and frankly humiliated in front of a very busy restaurant by a maitre de (maybe) and told I could not take food from restaurant. I explained my Mum was poorly. He told me I had to order breakfast from the in room menu. I didn't want breakfast I only wanted a couple of slices of melon. He spoke to another man in a black jacket (another maitre de maybe) who was standing a few tables away and told him I was taking food from the restaurant and it wasn't allowed. By this time I had actually started to cry, mainly from embarrassment. The other man came over, again I explained that Mum was poorly in bed and I only wanted to take a couple of slices of melon, he said no problem and put them in a small container for me. Later that day Mum was admitted to hospital suffering from severe dehydration caused from a virus of some kind. On my arrival back from the hotel, I found a basket of fruit and a get well card in the room from room service staff and bell boys. This was a wonderful kind gesture. Reception also phoned to ask after Mum and assured me if I needed anything to just ask, she also offered me to be driven to the hospital in a courtessy car as and when required. Also a very nice gesture. We were due to check out the next day but arranged with travel agent to extend our stay for another 3 nights while Mum was in hospital. I requested to change rooms so it wouldn't be as noisy for Mum when she got out. I was told there was a room on 23rd floor, still overlooking Horizon but assured it was quiet. It was NOT!!! I asked to move room again and even offered to pay for an upgrade to move from a tower room to sea view. I was told that was impossible. Mum was discharged from hospital. I went to collect her in hotel car but was charged for it. On querying this at reception they knew nothing about the offer of a courtessy car. There was also a very expensive hair extension of Mums that strangely just disappeared. I accidently left it in our previous room, on speaking to a manager I asked him to check the room to which he replied there were guests in the room. He assured me no room is let out to guests until it is thoroughly checked. I asked him to check with his staff to which he replied (very patronisingly) I should check our luggage. I told him I was not happy with his attitude and he told me to go to the police. Very disappointing attitude from the staff, especially under such horrible circumstances with Mum being in hospital.

There was no prob getting a lounger if you went before 10am, grab your towel from the hut and get ready to chill out. We saw a couple of celebrities around the pool (who I won't mention!). We were on half board basis, so had breakfast and dinner in the buffet, the variety of food at breakfast was really good with pastries, hot stuff, fruit, toast, eggs how you like them, pancakes, waffles, french toast etc. The downside to breakfast was how busy it was, once we saw a queue of people waiting to get in, it seemed a bit chaotic. Dinner was much better and really quiet in the restaurant, quality of food was good, I seemed to eat smoked salmon, steak and sushi the whole 6 days!! I can also recommend the fresh orange juice, it was gorgeous. It had a nice romantic atmosphere, and the lights were really dim which made the place all cosy. It was nice to sit at the window and look out to the Burj Al Arab and Atlantis hotels. We only ventured out two days to the malls, we used the shuttle buses to get there and got cabs back, they were massive and you need a couple of hours there depending on how much shopping you want to do. It was good to see the Burj Dubai tower a few days before it officially opened, its massive. My husband used the gym most days which was large with all the modern equipment. We did go to look at the other bars/restaurants in the hotel but they looked a bit trendy and pretentious, lots of glamorous young people there, which made us feel a bit underdressed!! Transfer back to the airport was smooth (in a nice Lexus), and it was back to the UK on Emirates, who are great too! Nice modern 777, great ICE system, good legroom and lovely food, 7 hours flew by!

It is also confusing that they insist upon charging your credit card upon arrival for an estimated amount for food and drinks for your stay then adjusting the balance when checking out. I have not encountered this before usually getting charged for a tab upon departure I can only guess that the hotel has been subject to people running up big bills and then leaving the country without paying. The hotels restaurants are on the expensive side especially for drinks even for a Dubai hotel .On our first night we discovered the delights of the horizon pool bar on the 3rd floor. The hotel has 2 towers each with a side facing the bar. On regular occasions this bar is hired out for private functions and turned into a full blown outside nightclub going on until 2-30 AM which is fine if you are part of Dubai\u2019s large 20 something banker set but not for the vast majority of the hotels paying guests. I complained early and we were able to be moved others were not so lucky, in fairness the hotel apologised and gave us a free meal in their restaurant during our stay. I would strongly advise anyone upon check in to insist that they have a room facing away from the horizon pool bar unless that is what they want from their stay. The hotel also has a pub with football and draught larger also best avoided unless this is what you go to Dubai for, I would have thought these guests would prefer the Costas. There are a few other gripes , the shades on the beach sun beds are either torn or missing there are not enough sun beds around the pool area for the number of guests so they get reserved with towels before breakfast \u2013 annoying ,it gets very busy at breakfast and the restaurant struggles to cope.

They also wouldn't warm up my kids milk in the morning and bring it too me. So i put boiling water in the ice bucket and that worked just fine. beach- this hotel is big, so it takes a couple of mins to get to the beach and the beach itself is big. so its not a beach/pool hotel, you need to pick one to sit on adn then make an effort to got the other one. you can hear the construction on the beach, but it didn't really bother anyone. you can't hear it at all on the pool. -Overall it was a nice hotel in a good location. it was clean and the pool and beach were nice.

For what we wanted from the hotel it was fine, we knew we would be busy in Dubai and not spending much time in the hotel. We were given a room down by the pool in the 2 storey buildings. It was a large room and nice as quiet as it was away from the main hotel and the bar area. I just wouldn't say it compared to other 5* hotels I have stayed in and certainly doesn't compare if you go to some of the other 5* star hotels along Jumeirah Beach. It looked a little tired and the bathroom certainly needed an upgrade, the silicone around the bath was all brown and the fittings needing replacing as most had gone rusty. The mirror had clearly been there for years and was all black around the edges. I actually thought about complaining and asking to be moved but it was 2am and I just wanted to get to bed, we knew we wouldn't spend much time there so decided to just stick with it. It is very disappointing when you are on honeymoon though. I read something while I was there about how the owners pride themselves on their attention to detail, this is exactly what I would say was seriously lacking in our room. The hotel itself is again, nothing like some of the others. The pool area did not really look like a 5* and there weren't any manicured grounds to walk around. The beach in front of the hotel is lovely and the sea was lovely and warm and clear. We could see the building work from the beach but never heard any of it, think that was one of the benefits of not being in the main building as I know other people could hear it from their rooms. While in Dubai we visited the Royal Meridien Hotel next door which we preferred, also visited the Madinat hotels, Atlantis and One & Only hotels, all were nicer than the Habtoor Grand and considering they are all supposed to be 5*, I would say the Habtoor is a 4* at best. If we went back we would not stay in the Habtoor Grand, I would want to stay in a hotel that is a true 5* and has a beautiful pool to laze around and lovely gardens to explore, one where they really do understand the meaning of attention to detail. As we were there for only 3 days we were out every day so it didn't cause us any huge issues, it was literally just a place to sleep, had we been there longer we would have asked to be moved. Taxi's are very cheap in Dubai, you can pay what you want for food. If you want cheap snacks you can find them, if you want top class meals in top class surroundings you can find them too. If you enjoy Mexican food then I would definitely recommend the Maya restaurant at the Royal Meridien Hotel next door, has an open top bar for drinks first which has great views and the food was just fantastic. We did visit the open air bar at the Habtoor grand late one night, it has really good views and a good cocktail menu but the music was really, really loud so felt sorry for the people whose rooms in the towers literlly looked out onto the bar! We have come home and looked at the prices of the other hotels that seemed much more luxurious and were surprised to see that some of them are virtually the same price.

Dealt with efficiently by Reception, received a welcome drink while paperwork processed. Unfortunately they didn't seem to realise we had a Club Room, but it was dealt with smoothly and we went to our room on the 16th floor. CLUB ROOM WITH SEA VIEW: The room was large and spacious with a decent sized bathroom. We had fresh fruit, dried dates and bachlaava delivered every day. Views from the balcony over the back of the property where the pool and beach were situated, could also see the Burj al Arab and The Atlantis hotels in the distance from our balcony. CLUB LOUNGE: Because we had a Club Room we were able to access the Club Lounge on the ground floor for breakfast, high tea and drinks and canapes in the evening. Although there is a difference in price we agreed that it was well worth the upgrade as the food and drink provided meant we spent virtually no money at all. Breakfast was very nice with a good selection of dishes, service was excellent, atmosphere was nice and quiet and relaxed, same again for high tea in the evening and was surprised with the constant drinks topping up when we went for drinks and canapes in the evening. Realised afterwards that I had managed to polish off an entire bottle of wine myself due to the diligence of the staff! Hubby took a quick look at the main restaurant on the ground floor and reported back that it was extremely busy and a bit of a free for all, so we were delighted with the rather more sedate atmosphere in the Club Lounge. POOL & BEACH: Spent most of our time at the main pool which was relatively busy most of the time, but not enough to put you off. Never made it to the infinity pool on the third floor unfortunately so can't comment about that. The hotel had access to a reasonably large section of the beach (albeit with a empty baracaded section that looks like it will have construction work on it at some point, but during our visit nothing was happening). The sea was extremely salty, if you have any kids that want to swim in it make sure they don't mind getting salty water in their eyes (if they do, make sure you take some swimming goggles for them). SHOPPING: We only visited Mall of the Emirates which both of us found to be slightly disappointing. Harvey Nics & Debenhams were both in evidence, the rest of the shops were very expensive designer stuff so nothing really worth bothering with. THE WALK: Met up with my brother and his family for a day and a half and was glad to discover this shopping/eating area was within a 5min walk of the hotel. Restaurants are significantly cheaper than the hotel so unless you have more money than sense, its worth eating out rather than eating in! CONCLUSION: Very happy with the hotel and where it was situated. Only a minor complaint that the bathroom was a little bit less than expected with some questionable DIY'er being let loose in there (i.e looks like somebody took a large hammer, smashed a load of holes and then fitted the electrics without grouting round afterwards). However, this didn't bother us unduly and didn't spoil our holiday or our opinion of the hotel.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "norfolk", "Title": "\u201cdont stay here\u201d", "Author": "roz1812", "ReviewID": "UR48579026", "Content": "I have just returned from a week in Dubai staying at the above hotel.

The dinner buffet main courses were limited and when my son wanted a plain cheese burger, he got melted cheese on a roll! The food was really not very good either except at the Italiain restaurant which if you like pizza or pasta was quite good.

The service from the staff was excellent and cannot be faulted. My only other comment was the expensive internet access - \u00a310 for 1 hour and no free facility to simply do on-line check-in for flights. I would expect free access in public areas and chargeable in the room.

It's just lower 4 star niveau. Starting with reception: when you arrive no one opens the taxi door and takes out the suitecases. Then reception is very complicated and takes a very long time. Why is it nessary to talk about prices which were all defined in the booking? All in all the reception was very poor and it was the first five start hotel I visited which has not offered a welcome dring nor a cold refreshment towel The room: The first room had only a bad sea view, was above the gateway and had sharming airconditionings view and no balcony. After our intervention we were upgraded to the 17th floor but still there was no balcony and the room was a bit noicy. The service was poor: you receive a free fruit platter only on the first day and they room service left the dirty platter and tissue on a table for two days. Except two bottles of water everything costs (The Merdien offered one bottle of wine per day for free!) and also small things like filling up ice cubes and little coffee bags, cottons pads were not done. Furthermore also cleaning was not perfect like the soap holder was never cleaned. Breakfast: The room was loud as a food court of a big shopping mall and there was no possibility eat outside Service in general: the business center was very expensive (internet was free at Meridien), even though we asked for a 'normal' taxi they wanted always to called us the much more expensive private limousine service, beach: basically there is no service at the beach, in generall most of the staff does not give the guests the feeling that they do everything for their hospitality which is our understanding of a five star hotel Check-out: The evening before check-out we asked for a one hour late check out but at 12 o'clock the room was looked! It took 25 minutes to open the door and no excuse nothing! Because of this we then had to hurry very much but other hotel in this situation would send someone to help you with the bags proactivly not at Habtoor! Instead in the looby every one smiled when they saw us carring the suitecases, helping would have bein to much! Again the check-out was terrible slow and in my point of view they comitted a big blunder: they told my girlfriend the price of the stay even tought I told them during check-in that it's my present for engagemen and of course the bill was not correct! As well we complaint very much about the whole stay and the only answer was a frosty 'we are sorry' but not more.

But two things really ruined it for us; the excessive prices for food and drink given the standard of the hotel and the disinterested attitude of the staff. A continental breakfast of little more than a croissant and some toast cost 25$, a glass of ordinary house wine in the bar was 14$. The Italian restaurant is managed by an aggressive young lady with a gestapo attitude to customer service - don't go here!

This was my 3rd trip to Dubai and to the Jumeriah Beach area. Both hotels I have stayed at previously have impressed me with their service and attention to detail....the standard of hospitality in Dubai is very good and I was expecting the Habtoor Grand to be no different. We had some issues travelling so my sister ended up arriving before me. She is not particularly well travelled so when she arrived at the hotel exhausted she dumped her stuff in the room, sat outside on the patio and fell asleep. When she woke up the room had been turned down.....she checked the money she had changed at the airport (non of which had been spent) and discovered that 500 dhs was missing. Yes, she should have secured her valuables in the safe but this wasn't the best start to the holiday! We stayed on the third floor and had immediate access to the Horizon pool. The whole area was very dated and rickety - certainly no where near 5 star! The pool was OK but didn't seem particularly clean. The lifeguards and staff were very friendly but I was horrified when I saw them using a large square sieve to collect a buildup of sun tan lotion from the corner of the pool. I saw people that has sat on the stairs into the pool and their costumes were covered in this build up of silt and grime. We only stayed by the pool for 3 days, after which we were too disgusted to use the pool - we paid to use the facilities of another hotel instead. The gym facilities are excellent - there is an abundance of space and equipment which is in good condition and a great selection of machines and weights. The room was a good size with all the facilities you would expect. The bathroom had a large glass enclosed shower. On the second night I heard an almighty crash at about 12pm - my sister went outside to see what had happened - the shower in the room next door had just fallen over with the glass smashed everywhere - luckily there was no-one in it at the time - I am sure it would have been horrific given the amount of glass that shattered. On the 3rd night a funny noise started to come from the bathroom....the water was sloshing around in the toilet.....then the smell came. The stench was unbearable. This exercise with the drains happened every other night and was disgusting. The breakfast buffet was poor - although there was lots of food, the selection never changed and was just left sitting there all morning (the cheese platter was sweaty and curled as you would expect after 4 hours on the side). I had an omlette and it was cooked in so much oil I couldn't eat it. I was not impressed with the quality of the food especially compared to what I have eaten in both the Sheraton and the Mina Seyhai. I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel - the service is poor, the facilities (exc the gym) are second rate.

The hotel has a bar pool which is ideal for those who want to relax in the water and grab a drink at the same time, for people with children they do have a water slide which looked really good as well. The beach is linked onto the back of the hotel and it can be accessed by a path from the pool, we went at the beginning of September and it was scorching hot! The sand was so hot so make sure you wear your flip flops and dont burn your feet. The sand is gorgeous and when you get into the Gulf Sea it is really nice and you just want to stop in it all day as its really warm. Water sports are available as well. The room was spacious with a Plazma TV and also has a mini bar if you feel thirsty or hungry. The Bathroom was very clean and modern.

I only chose it because my mother was travelling out to Dubai for a family reunion and had booked a room there and I was planning to meet up with her. When I checked in, the staff insisted on pre-charging my credit card Dhs 1,000. I have never experienced this before - normally, a swipe of the card is enough to show you are good for the money. All I can guess is that this is what happens when you book through a website and pre-pay, as opposed to booking directly with the hotel itself. I guess they thought I was planning to eat, drink and be merry and then run off without paying, with a bathrobe under my arm. As it happened, my only expense was one buffet breakfast, at a cost of Dhs 100, so I am currently waiting for the balance of Dhs 900 to drop off my card. They told me it will take two days, but we will see. So, this set me off on the wrong foot for the visit. However, the room itself was very large and luxurious and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was enormous, although some of the designs were not practical. The sink is a glass bowl, set on a sheet of glass, sitting out from a mosaic wall. If you are a splasher, as I am, the water goes out of the sink, on to the glass shelf and then pours off the back of it on to the floor. In addition, the toilet is at right angles to the glass shelf, so if you were to get off the toilet at the wrong angle, you would be in danger of banging your head against the (sharp) corner of the glass shelf. I almost did it myself. The first morning I had the buffet breakfast and it was extremely average. Plus the tables were so close together that my mother and I felt uncomfortable chatting as we were inches away from another lady sitting on her own. It seemed like the hotel wanted to pack as many guests into the space as possible, which was not conducive to a relaxing meal. I vowed not to eat there again. We took a taxi to the Dubai Mall. Taxis are waiting outside the hotel in a queue, but they are not the regular Dubai taxis, but what I call Hotel Taxis. Inotherwords, although they have a meter, the meter is adjusted so that you pay around twice the price for the journey. It takes a couple of times using them before you are aware of this and it is such a rip-off. For example, the journey to the Dubai Mall cost Dhs 72 in one of these taxis, yet when I caught a regular taxi to the airport on my departure, it came to Dhs 62, yet the distance is around double. Can you imagine if they did this in London? There would be an outcry. Check-out is 12 noon, as in most hotels in the world. And as in most hotels in the world, everybody leaves it to the last minute, meaning there is a run on the front desk just before 12, including me. I would say around six couples were standing, waiting to be served, with three ladies working behind the desk. Each of these three ladies was having problems with the person they were checking out. Soon two of them disappeared, leaving only one lady and a crowd of increasingly grizzly customers. I had to leave in the end, as I had a brunch engagement. When I came back after 3:30 to finally check out, they had 8 staff working then. Perhaps they should all have been available at noon?

We were on a halfboard basis, food was a very high standard .. downside you cannot take anything out of dining back to your room, even a piece of fruit which i felt was a very extreme measure from a supposed 5 star hotel. Food/drink prices are very expensive at this hotel, suggest eat out or get an all inclusive. Just to give you an idea, a glass of coke cost \u00a36, kids chicken nuggets and chips meal cost \u00a35 and two scoops of ice-cream cost \u00a36. The hotel itself is very well maintained, but the area around the pool is very run down .. could do with a lick of paint. Around the pool you have loud music played during the day and on thurs/fri/sat evenings, very loud music was played till late to cater for the more younger crowd .. grateful that i was in a tower room. Without trying to sound a snob, you had the true Brit element there which i was keen to escape .. brought down the tone of the hotel.

Our first room was OK, it was near the beach and pool. It was VERY dim, just a few lamps here and there, and a small bathroom. It was extremely clean. The double bed was 2 single beds pushed together. You get a lot of noise on a Thurs & Fri night in these rooms from the Munchi bar, that goes on until 2am. We had a (locked) door going through to the next room, and after 3 or 4 nights some extremely noisy russians moved in. They seemed to shout instead of talk, and had their TV on full volume. It was unbearable. On complaining, we were upgraded to a tower view room, which was a lot better than the 1st. A lot lighter, bigger, and a big bathroom with walk in shower. Unfortunately, just as we were about to go to sleep about midnight, the volume from the bar below (the infinity pool moet bar) suddenly went up to a deafening rate. It was like trying to sleep in the middle of a nightclub, even with ear plugs in. This was to go on until 2am. My partner went to reception to complain, where there were several other couples doing the same thing, one girl in tears as she was so tired and hadn't had any sleep for several nights because of this. The manager told my boyfriend 'Well it's the summer, people are here to party'. We got moved again, higher up the tower, where the noise was more bearable. This room again was very nice but no balcony on this one. This one also had a proper double bed. You get a free bowl of fruit on arrival in the rooms, and 2 or more bottles of water delivered free each day. You also get free tea and coffee facilities in each room, although there is no milk provided. There is a shopping centre and small supermarket a 5 min walk up the road where you can get some. The walk from the hotel is through a load of construction sites, but it only takes a few mins. The Staff are very efficient, if anyone's been to the Carribean, it's the opposite to that! Any problems are sorted out extremely fast. The whole hotel is very clean as well. TV in the rooms isn't very good, the only channel from England is BBC News Worldwide. There is also some American channels like Fox movies etc. The plug sockets are the same as the UK so you don't need any adaptors. Taxis are cheaper outside the Meridian, but to be honest, the hotel ones (a lot nicer and safer drivers!) are reasonable prices. It was only \u00a38 to get to the Mall of Emirates. The beach was nice, but huge! It took ages to walk from the main hotel down to the water. It gets very busy around the pool and on the beach on a Fri & Sat (their weekend), as the locals who have membership to the hotel all come in. I couldn't find a spare chair around the main pool on the Friday, and there were only 2 available at the infinity pool. The walk in shower in our room flooded the whole bathroom. I don't know if that was just ours or if they were all the same. The drain seemed to be blocked or just very slow at draining water so you end up stood in water up to your ankles. My boyfriend accidentally left a new bottle of aftershave in the old room, when we were in a rush to move, which was never handed in to lost property (either stolen or thrown away). When we checked out, we were given a bill for some drinks from the mini-bar which we never had. They did take them off the bill in the end though. The main let down of this hotel was the extortionate prices. \u00a35 for a can of coke. A glass of wine about \u00a39 (very small glass!). The same for a beer. \u00a310 an hour for the internet (must be used within 24 hours & quite slow). I would highly recommend walking down to the local shops and restaurants for dinner (of course you can't drink alcohol outside hotels though as it's a dry country). A meal and bottomless coke is a LOT cheaper than the hotel in the local restaurants, the mexican was very nice. If you go to the 360 bar (part of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel - very nice hotel!), the drinks are a bit cheaper, and NEO bar in the city, on the 63rd floor, very posh, next to the world's tallest building), is cheaper alcoholic drinks than The Habtoor!! If you like a drink, get some wine from the airport on your way in. Overall a great stay, but you need money. If I went back, after having seen the Jumeriah Beach Hotel, I would stay there instead.

This was our first time to Dubai and our first choice hotel was the Westin but at the time of booking they were still investigating the Legionnaires disease outbreak and we didn't want to take any chances with our baby (the hotel was subsequently cleared). The Habtoor hotel was very clean and our seaview tower room was quite large and nicely decorated. The staff were extremely good, particularly to our 18 month year old who finished the holiday assuming their job was just to play with her all the time. Service is probably not as attentive as in other 5 stars hotels in the area but it was still good and all staff were very friendly. More so than the Westin which I visited. The kids club was great and the staff there very nice. We used baby-sitters twice and they were good - the baby-sitters are always employed at the hotel which made us feel more comfortable using them. The hotel location was not great as the hotel is surrounded by building works but apart from being unpleasant to look at from the front of the hotel we weren't disturbed by them. The hotel is a few minutes away from a restaurant/shop area called The Walk which provides much cheaper alternatives to eating in the hotel. I can't find too many faults with the hotel - kids play area should have a shade, tower blocks are unsightly but not out of place in Dubai, some items in the room weren't 5 star such as the curtains and the balcony's are too small and high up to be useable. The food in the hotel was good but both food and drink is very expensive (\u00a37/8 pint beer, \u00a39 glass wine). This is the case in all hotels in Dubai - Dubai is in danger of pricing itself out of the tourist market as a holiday destination. The hotel restaurants have 20% off nights which makes a difference. Breakfast got a bit busy towards the end of the holiday when the hotel was almost fully booked. All in all we had a lovely holiday.

Having stayed at the Marina area last year we were well aware of the building works all around but when you are at the main pool you can't hear anything. However in the Tower rooms you can hear some general building noise from about 7:30 am on workdays. The Rooms were spacious and very clean - however if you want to use the DVD player I suggest you take your own DVD's with you - it appeared that the Hotel didn't have a library - we could find no information on this. STAFF All the Staff (and there are a lot of them) in general were very friendly when everything was ok but not quite so when we had specific queries! FOOD We were on half board basis i.e. breakfast then lunch or dinner in the BUFFET restaurant. But only when we asked we were advised we could get 70 dhms each off the food bills in the other restaurants on the complex (except The Grill room). The Thai restaurant was fabulous and the 25th floor restaurant and bar are also well worth a visit. We found the food in the Underground Pub was pretty good value and was tasty too! Give the Lebanese Restaurant a body swerve though! Every night when turning down your bed the staff will leave you with a discount voucher for THAT NIGHT in one of the restuarants- not much use when its bed-time! FACILITIES Looked like a fairly well equipped gym but the spa element was sadly lacking. A handful of specialist shops were in the hotel but suggest you get out to the malls for some real shopping! Dubai Malls is filling up nicely! NOW THE BAD NEWS....... We had previously agreed with our Travel agent to have an early check-in and late check-out (95% guaranteeed - subject to AVAILABILITY) having travelled overnight we too arrived to have to wait hours until our room was ready. We were advised why not go and have some breakfast! Considering we were already on half-board we thought ok - I wish we hadn't - on check out we were billed 260 dhms for the 'pleasure' (with current exchange rates this works out at over \u00a350!!!! ) so don't get caught out like us - having raised this issue on check-out it took 4 people to get a reduction of only 60 dhms. Then when we asked them to honour the late check-out we were advised that this wasn't subject to availability - it would cost us money to hold our room for more than the alloted time. We did however get 4 extra hours in the room (free) but that still left us 7 1/2 hours to kill! With the \u00a3 exchange rate being so bad it really is expensive to have a drink in this hotel a half decent bottle of Sancerre would have cost \u00a3100! Happy Hours also aren't what they seem - only some of the drinks are included. We echo other comments re our Eastern European cousins - as a generalisation they are very loud and brash and have no manners and they are in abundance at this hotel! Finally - don't let the hotel staff get you a taxi at the door - they use the more expensive \"Private Hire\" type taxis which cost almost double the price of the official Dubai Taxis . You can pick up a Duabi taxi at the entrance to the Le Meridien next door.

We booked a Tower Room, we were aware there was \"some\" construction work nearby, but not to the extent that we found. From their airport the taxi wound its way through the numerous construction sites on every side of the hotel, the hotel itself was very nice, very palatial and very grand. We arrived at the Habtoor Grand at 6am, after a long 11 hour flight from Cape Town, South Africa. We were tired and just wanted to sleep, but were told we couldnt check into our room until 2pm... another 8 hours! We sat in Reception waiting for 5 long hours, we were eventually given our room at 11:30am. We booked through Trailfinders and the room was exactly as pictured on their website, large room, large marble bathroom, king size bed, flat screen tv, sea view. After the long flight and the 5 hour wait for our room we just wanted to sleep. Within 5 minutes of getting into bed, Room Service turned up to COMPLETELY EMPTY the mini bar! When we asked why (we may have wanted a drink!) we were told there was no credit card swipe when we checked in - we werent asked to provide one!, we would have if we had been asked to. Bearing in mind we had paid in advance for our stay (\u00a3262 a night), we thought this extremely rude to say the least, certainly not what you would expect from a 5* hotel. The hotel obviously doesnt trust its guests. We had been asleep for an hour when the hotel fire alarm went off, which was broadcast loudly via a tannoy in the room \"Warning Incident, Warning Incident Evacuate the Hotel Immediately\"!. We rang Reception to check this was correct, and were told it was just a staff fire drill the Receptionist thought it was funny - we didnt. Our patience and impression of the hotel was by now wearing rather thin. Drinks in the hotel were very expensive \u00a35 for a small coca cola at the poolside bar. The hotel's only saving grace was dinner in the Private Dining French Restaurant on the 25th floor, on the roof terrace overlooking \"the Palm and Atlantis\" with stunning views of the Burj al Arab. Excellent service, excellent food, we would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic candlelit dinner, with fantastic waitress service with stunning views, a great photo opportunity. Breakfast was buffet style in a large restaurant with plenty of choice. We noticed the other guests were mainly eastern european, sadly whose manners left a lot to be desired, nor do they understand the concept of a queue and were rude to the waiters. There were a large number of small children and babies staying in the hotel, which made breakfast rather noisy, not what we expected of a 5* hotel. Inside the hotel is very attractive, large, palatial, and luxurious, with acres of marble corridors and staircases. The staff were pleasant. But the beach wasnt clean, lots of litter, there was construction going on all around the hotel, on both sides, the air was dusty and \"smoggy\" from the building work. You cant go for a walk outside the hotel due to the building sites, you need a taxi to go everywhere. Taxis are easily available from the hotel concierge within seconds. We were disappointed with Dubai, its basically a huge building site with cranes everywhere, and half built glass tower blocks, do visit the \"Mall of the Emirates\", for tax free shopping. We wouldnt return to the Habtoor Grand Resort, we thought it was overpriced with extortionate drinks prices. We were glad we were only there for 1 night.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent customer service, pleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "rainbowbriteuk", "ReviewID": "UR24640452", "Content": "After reading the other reviews here I was a bit concerned about this hotel, but my experience couldn't have been more different from some unlucky reviewers'.

Also, I am shocked to read all the negative comments about the staff at the hotel. My family could not have been treated with more courtesy and friendliness, especially when my toddler became very unwell with an infection (nothing to do with the hotel!). The hotel nurse was summonsed to us and was lovely, transport was provided (free) to and from hospital, they even sent packages of food from the hotel restaurants for me when no food was provided by the hospital. And when we returned, fully recovered, a few days later my son was treated like a celebrity and welcomed back by loads of staff who made a fuss of him and were fantastic.

We had an early arrival as we flew in from Bangkok. The room wasn`t ready, but we spend some time around the horisont pool i the 3rd floor. Actually the staff had been looking for us at the other pool because the room was ready for us much earlier. We got a very nice sea view room in the tallest tower in the 21 floor. Very nice and clean with dvd player, flat screen tv and fresh fruit every day and complimentery water. Bathroom was big with both a shower and a bathtub. The hotel garden was very nice with a huge beach and gras area with tennis playing areas. By the beach you could go for a ride on a camel, it was funny! By the big pool there was always sunbeds available even if we came late. At the beach, the big pool, horisont pool and in the gardens there were places to have a drink or eat. We liked the location, but you must take a taxi to the malls or the city. Around 80-90 dhs to the airport. The Lexus taxi from the hotel? is around 20 dhs (to the mall) more expensive than the regular taxis. The malls provides free shuttel bus from the hotel, we would like to recommend Mall of The Emirates, because in the Dubai Mall a lots of the fashionshops has not been ready yet! For nightlife the Buddah Bar is situated at The Grosvenor House across the road/building site, make an appoinment because it`s very popular! And if you wan`t a drink in the Sky Bar at Burj Al Arab, be sure to make an appoinment first or you will not get access to the hotel at all. The drink prices are almost the same at the Habtoor hotel, but if you want to see the view over the city and sea, we recommend you to go for an afternoon tea, because we didn`t see much in the evening. When you visit Dubai, be sure to book a desert safari, the dune bashing is very funny!

Our room was terrible, damp and peeling walls, old fixtures and the view from the balcony was a wooden fence. Be warned the only thing 5 star about the resort rooms is the price! I would rate the rooms as a 3 star at the very most. Just make sure they specify if you have a resort room or tower room when you book. We requested to move rooms and because the hotel had availability were moved to the tower where the rooms were much better. Having said this we were woken at 7.30am by internal drilling and hammering. On calling reception they maintained that no work was taking place in the hotel. We had to go and investigate ourselves to find internal works in the hotel. It took 4 calls to reception for them to send someone to stop the noise. They were apologetic but did not understand our point that internal building work should not take place at that time of day near guest rooms. Lastly ensure that you are charged the correct rate on checking out, our room rate included airport transfers but these were added to the bill separately so increasing the bill by \u00a370.

In a European destination it would be a very good 5 star, but in Dubai it is considered a good 4 star. Service is very good and staff are friendly. Gym is excellent and free. Rooms are of a nice size, well decorated and furnished with nice bathrooms. Water is complementary and we had complementary fruit. There is a turn down service and they leave nice chocolates on your bed! Robes, slippers and pool towels are provided. Friends of ours stopped next door at the Royal Meridien, and this was a 5+ star. The only reason we didn't stop there was because they didn't do a 4 bedded room for 2 adults and 2 children. The pools have lifeguards and they are on the ball! Water slide is great. Better than the Wild Wadi park as they are free. Wild wadi is \u00a340 p/p even children over 1.1mtr!! and there are only really 5 rides! The grill bar in the hotel tried to charge us \u00a360.00 per steak They showed us a steak that wasn't on the menu, we thought it was so we ordered it thinking it was only \u00a327.00 per steak. (they offer the same cut of steak from different countries/ grades) When the bill came we about choked! The waiter tried to say he confirmed the price beforehand, but he didn't or we wouldn't have ordered it. The manager was called and just deducted the over charge. Be careful and check how much you are paying before you order. Children are not allowed in bars that do not serve food ( must be over 21). Bars and restaurants not attached to hotels do not serve alcohol. Alcohol cannot be bought from suprmarkets. Drinks prices range considerably approx \u00a36-11 for a pint or bottle of beer.

Building work is carried out 24/7 so there is a constant background noise, but you do get used to it!

This was something we knew about only it was worse than you can imagine. It's a shame you are not compensated for this and given a better deal on the room rate. Dubai is in danger of outpricing itself. We had to quite literally suffer \"check in.\" Our 8-year-old daughter was very tired and only wanted to go to bed. Firstly we were accused of queue jumping, as you can imagine at that time of the morning there are hardly any people before you. Then we had to deal with staff who hardly knew their job. We were then left standing there while all of reception went and dealt with a gentleman complaining. I finally found someone who was free and pointed out to him that it was very late and we wanted to get to our room asap. Finally we got to our room to find our daughters bed wasn't in the room. We waited for housekeeping to bring one. The whole episode had taken over an hour and it was now past 2:30am in the morning. The room itself was nice and big and fortunately for us we didn't overlook much building work. In the morning we wandered down to breakfast to experience the whole \"package deal\" scenario. I have never been to what is supposed to be a five star hotel before and had such treatment. Thank goodness the food was okay because otherwise I would have been checking out. On a plus note, our daughter had a great time swimming all day,every day. The pool area was very good and the weather was fantastic. The food and service in the Underground Pub was very good and the the Italian restaurant was very pleasant too. However, the hotel does not fit my expectations of a five star establishment; average four star is more like it, with the breakfast scrum-down a three-star affair. On the whole our holiday in Dubai was okay. We've been before and so were unpleasantly surprised by the cost of everything! The first year we went, only 3 years ago, we paid \u00a3100 a night for our hotel and this time we paid \u00a3300! As I said earlier, Dubai has become very expensive.

But all that worry was pointless as we do not have one negative thing to say about the hotel, staff or our stay. We were staying in a Club Room and our airport transfers were included, we had a lovely and comfortable transfer with our friendly driver who pointed out all the changes since we were here last year. We checked in with no problem, the lady was friendly and we were taken up to our room with our luggage following. The room itself was very spacious and better then we expected, the bed was huge and there was plenty of wardrobe space for all my clothes. There was fresh fruit on the side with a bottle of water each every day. It was cleaned every day and very well kept. And I loved the chocolates on the bed every night. The bathroom was lovely and big too having both a bath and shower and all the amenities you need supplied and re-stocked each day. We stayed mainly round the main pool. We never had trouble finding a sun longer, we went down about 9am each morning and it was pretty empty at this time. There is a separate kid\u2019s area with a little pool and a slide \u2013 which I decided I was too old for. The pool area was always clean and they were very good at taking food and drink orders. The food round the pool is of a higher price but it is good food. We had walks on the beach most afternoons and there is a bar at the top. The beach is clean and not that busy. We ate at a few restaurants at the hotel and never had one bad meal. The steak place at the side of reception was lovely! The prices were very reasonable and the food was very nice, and make sure to tell them if it is your birthday \u2013 it\u2019s very entertaining. The Thai restaurant by the beach was great, the food was so nice and the service was great again the price was very reasonable and if we had time we defiantly would have returned here. Our favourite place was the restaurant on the 25th floor. The food was at such a high standard and the service was first class. The selection of food is very good and my partner even opted for the Kangaroo. The chef came to our table to make sure everything was ok for us, which just topped off the meal and amazing views from the balcony. Included in the club room was breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour drinks. Breakfast was great; it had such a wide selection. We never made afternoon tea. But happy hour \u2013 we defiantly made that. The lounge was such a nice setting for drinks before going out for dinner. There was a choice between wine and beer with a small selection of finger foods on the side. I would defiantly recommend taking advantage of these perks. Worth mentioning though men must wear trousers and close toe shoes to the lounge at night. No rules for women. We did find that the taxi\u2019s that the hotel used were a higher rate then the normal taxis, so if a normal taxi was there we jumped in. There is construction work going on all around the hotel, it is close and can be heard. But if I am totally honest after the first few minutes of the first day I never noticed it again. It became less then a back ground noise but I can see why people can find this a problem but we really didn\u2019t. It\u2019s to be expected in Dubai and construction work surrounds most hotels in the area. One of the highlights of the holiday had to be having a top 10 in the world women\u2019s tennis player staying in the hotel. Ana Ivanovic. We used to watch he practice on the tennis courts during the day and before we went up to get ready at night. Not many people recognised her so the court was pretty empty which was good. She didn\u2019t have any problems with people watching.

As in all hotels they do ask for your credit card to cover any extras but we decided to politely decline and this was no problem at all. It simply means that you have to have cash on you to pay for things as you go - personally I find this an easier option. Our room was very nice, large bed, complimentary water, fruit, chocolates etc. It was very clean and was cleaned daily by the staff. As we were staying in a Club room this enables you to use the Club Lounge on the 25th floor.

We ate in three of the restaurants, the Lebanese, Italian and Grand Grill all were nice and we enjoyed the food. One word of advice here though if you like a glass of wine with your meal be aware that its not cheap. I had two glasses of wine in the Grand Grill for 130dhs approx \u00a320. The beers and spirits are more reasonable. The pool area is nice but is very busy, we tended to use the beach more as was less busy and only a short stroll through from the hotel.

If not, then I'd stay clear. We paid a sizable amount to stay in the Habtoor, and despite having been upgraded to a larger room, we were still not overly impressed with it. The decor was dated, and the room quite shabby - a chunk of floor was missing, the curtains were half falling down, and the bathroom was positively basic compared to a hotel of the same rating we'd stayed in just days before. It must be said that the pool and grounds, and beach are all beautiful. We ate at one of the restaurants (Luciano's by the pool) and found it to be quite overpriced (this was our opinion of all the restaurants/bars/room service) at the hotel, and the food wasn't overly impressive either. We saw the Habtoor advertised for quite a good rate on lastminute a few weeks before we ended up booking, it was gone when we went to book so we went directly through the hotel (for a lot more than lastminute was displaying the room). I imagine that the hotel would be passable and acceptable if you'd got a good price, and possibly an all-inclusive deal, which I believe some of the clientele may have had, as it didn't quite add up that 90% of the people by the pool looked like they'd be more at home at Holiday Inn than a 5 star resort and spa in Dubai. Overall, I've stayed in worse places than the Habtoor, but also much better places. If you get a good deal, and don't expect a 'full 5 star experience' (in terms of quality of rooms, food and customer service) then I would recommend the Habtoor, however I'd definitely recommend checking out what other options there are before settling on this one!", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cfantastic hotel will defo be going again, loved it\u201d", "Author": "x87harrietx", "ReviewID": "UR20642578", "Content": "Really enjoyed staying at the hotel, i went with my sister and they had no twin beds so they upgraded us to a different bigger room straight away were there was two beds this was really nice. great views from our tower room which was on the 14th floor room 1401. service is fantastic. cant say a bad word against the hotel, will defo be going again.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva", "Title": "\u201cAbominable service!\u201d", "Author": "Neuch7", "ReviewID": "UR20479007", "Content": "The hotel is ok.

We stayed in a tower room which was so spacious and a fabulous bathroom- we were put into a smoking room even though we did not request same but it did not make any difference as the air conditioning in the hotel and rooms was fantastic. To sum it all up the hotel was a 5 star hotel worth every star- the cleanliness and the service of the staff was unreal could not fault it. The hotel itself is lovely with so much to offer pools and the beach is so close. A lovely pool lays on the 3rd floor so worth a visit. Outside the back door are restaurants and the italian one is lovely the thai one is meant to be lovely too but we did not visit. Be wary that the food is not cheap it is quite expensive and the Drink is a joke the price of it. You wil pay \u20ac34 for the cheapest bottle of wine out there and that would only cost \u20ac7 at home, a glass of wine is \u20ac9-\u20ac10 euro and a pint is \u20ac6.50 -\u20ac7 but beware that a pint bottle of cider is \u20ac11.00 so alcohol is very expensive but as we were on holiday we had no choice but to pay it. There is so much construction in Dubai it actually puts you off the place whilst it does not annoy you sound wise it s just offputting. There is no where to actually walk outside the hotel and that is a pity- But we did find a lovely noodle bar 5 mins walk away its lovely does not sell alcohol and its quite cheap! also if you keep walking down that area there are lots of shops and restaurants we only were made aware of this the last few days of our trip! so its worth walking around past that noodle bar. We took a trip to see the 7 star hotel which i must say is lovely but its not really worth the money- they reckon that there is a six star beside it and that its better and its free. you have to book online from your hotel to get tea or dinner or cocktails at the Beirge Hotel. I would recommend the desert Safari loved it and it was quiet cheap. The shopping centres are fantastic and the clothes are more expensive than England or Ireland but it worth a look there is a ski adventure park there but be aware you can only ski there if you are experienced otherwise you would have to take lessons. We had a great time the weather was 44 degrees and you would melt but the great thing is the air con it saves you.

I'll start by saying that I have visited dubai four times in the last year. I have stayed at both Jumeira Beach hotels and less luxurious ones in the city, all different but all wonderful! None with the problems that we encountered at the Habtoor. I could write a five page review but I am going to keep it as brief as possible. PLUSES:- Hotel is beautiful, nice grounds, gym facilities, turn down service erm? that's it! Arrived at the hotel and was checked in and informed we were being upgraded to a tower room. We were also given the interconnecting rooms we requested, good start! Then we were informed that we would have to pay \u00a31500 pounds to be able to use the hotel facilities, we were alarmed by this as in my experience the most we have ever been asked to pay as a deposit at any hotel is \u00a3250 for a party of 6. I declined and opted for a \"pay as you go set up\" Not the usual set up for a 5 star hotel? It was an inconvenience having to carry my handbag with me to the pool so I could pay for a drink or food for the kids... I will point out at this stage that this hotel literally was full of english people. I say this as I found it unusual for Dubai. It's almost as if everyone had flocked to the Habtoor. I stayed at the Ritz Carlton last year August which is on the same Stretch and it was a million miles away in respect of class, service and quality! I am english and by no means a snob but I don't go on holiday to mix with \"chavs!\" If I wanted to do that I would have gone to Butlins for a fraction of the price. There was not any noise from building work but lots of dust. I left my bikini to dry on the hotel balcony, when I took it in it was covered in dust and had to be washed again. Everytime I had a request for ice or towels from room service the staff would overtly expect tips. I spoke to some different guests at the hotel. Most were of the opinion that the hotel had terrible customer service and some had appaling problems (luckily we left relatively unscathed, just feeling slightly short-changed) another couple I spoke to thought it was great, as they were grateful to be on holiday and were the type of people that didn't mind if their room had not been cleaned! I suppose it takes all sorts!!! My point is the hotel is mediocre at best - the biggest downful of the Habtoor is the management's attitude. I think that while they have so much building work going on around the hotel they are just glad to be filling the rooms with people and will try and re-establish themselves as a good hotel (which I hear it once was, all but a year ago!) when the Marina development is completed in a couple of years and they market the hotel to more up-market clientele. I still love Dubai but it is getting very expensive, which was once a pleasure in return for the most amazing service and treatment. I will be going back to stay at the palm at the end of this month for the opening of the Atlantis. This trip will either redeem this country as my favourite holiday destination or be the end of my love affair with Dubai. WATCH THIS SPACE!!! To sum up I would never go back to the Habtoor. We chose his hotel because of the so called kids club, I took my 7 year old daughter there once and she was bored to tears along with other children I met that had been there.

Location - by the beach, taxis are plentiful and affordable so easy to travel to other locations. Hotel - Bright modern hotel with great open spaces. My Room - was situated on the 10th floor with two large windows facing over the beach, great design and very clean. *Warning* - I was very happy with the location of my room, however the hotel is located in an area where a considerable amount of construction is taking place and at check out I did hear some guests complaining about construction noise in their rooms. General hospitality - warm and welcoming. Food - Breakfast wide variety and friendly service ate in one restaurant which leads onto my tale of customer service... Customer Service - most of the staff I met were very helpful and friendly however - I ate at one of the restaurants specialising in Lebanese Cusine (there is a belly dancer there most evenings). I was dining alone and when I requested the set menu, I was advised that the menu would be too much for me to eat, and that they would suggest some dishes for me, which I agreed to. After the many starters arrived, I advised the manager serving me that I did not think I could manage my main course (I did check that it was not already prepared) and he said no wait and have your main course. As I thought that I was still having a smaller selection of courses from the set menu I conceded. I was therefore amazed to find out that the cost of my meal was considerably more than the set menu. I did advise the manager, but he did not pay any attention. As a female dining alone I felt that I had been unduly pressurised and also ripped off. I complained to guest services that evening and I had to follow up the following evening as my complaint was not responded to. Now the point that adds insult to injury. Whilst explaining my complaint to the Head Manager of the restaurant I noticed that he was clearly distracted and asked if he was listening he was not - two minutes later he excused himself spoke to someone else was in a discussion with them and then walked off without saying anything else to me! I waited for him for a further thirty minutes to return, the customer service girls were very good and I could see embarassed by the rudeness of their colleague. Eventually the assitant food and beverage manager was called and apologised for her colleague and attempted to resolve the situation by offering me another meal at the hotel which I declined. I eventually received 50% off my food costs at the restaurant, however the total lack of customer service from the restaurant manager just spoilt my entire view of the hotel.

Innitially the hotel appeard very good ,the bell boy and porter greated and took our luggage, all seemed well, once we entered the hotel it was nicley decorated with a very big lobby. We went to reception they upgraded our room but then asked for a ridiculous amount of 7000 dhs , which is around \u00a31500, they wanted this so if we used any facilities that charge they would retract this from the balance, however we objected and said we would rather pay for things when we use them. LUCKILY THAT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE. As they charge you for absolutley everything and many other guest whre charged for things they hadnt used, and for them they only saw what they had been charged for when they checked out, by then it;s to late to put up an argument. We met a few people who checked out early for the ridiculous behaviour of the reception staff, who are VERY UN HELP FULL AND RUDE. what ever happend to the customer is always right. We had to wait about 4 hours for our room.Once the room was ready we where told we where down graded back to our tower room, due to \"maintenance issues\", very strange seeing as there was no problem before hand. The reception staff said we could have lunch in the hotel as part of our half board basis. Which we found out the day later they had a big bill waiting for us in regard to this we immediatley took it up with reception. Had we given them our money this we would not have found out about till the last day. Therefore i do recommend no one gives there money to the reception, it will cause you more problems. The facilities of the hotel are good and excpected for a resort, however no indoor pool is a downer. The beach is very big and it is tiering to make it to the end. the garden is very beautifull and big, The food at the hotel is good and the chef's are very friendly. However i do advise you to not have dinner on these themed nights,:Arabian, chinese, bbq, and sea food(if your not a fan). Indian and carving where the most enjoyable dinners at the hotel, the rest not so much. Lunch and breakfast is more or less the same each day. I MUST SAY THE DESEARTS ARE AMAZING. The maintenance staff are helpfull, but slow on occasions we found at times our rooms werent clean till 2 or 3 in the afternoon. The shuttle service is good, but they didnt always arrive at the shopping centre to pick us up. All in all it's a nice hotel and there are good elements, but i would advise the hilton, habtoor is over priced, and they charge you ridiculous prices for every thing for example it was \u00a38 for and hour of internet use, and \u00a34 for a bottle of water. Its ashame for the cooking staff who where very nice and helpfull and many of the staff where nice, but allot of the bad staff let them down, it's a real shame, because with a reduce of prices, and helpfull recetion staff and some better cuisine the hotel would have fallen very nicely, but thats not the case", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cWe Loved Dubai\u201d", "Author": "KJMacScotland", "ReviewID": "UR19290928", "Content": "I was very nervous about going to Dubai especially after reading some of the reviews on this page but it was the most amazing holiday I have ever been on.

We were booked into the Tower Family Room for our stay. Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to the Club Suite Room. Staff are friendly and courteous. Breakfast was superb, everything you could want and again staff were excellent. Rooms were always kept clean and there was always a constant supply of newspapers, bottled water and fruit provided free when they cleaned our room. Conciege services were good and again nothing was too much trouble. If you have kids they will love the pool area and my two spent most of their time in the pool, pool attendants will set you up wherever you wish and there are great views of the garden and surrounding area. Negatives The Habtoor are willing to charge you for everything if they can. I stayed at the Hilton last year and the Hilton provides better value for money. As an example I wanted to use the internet for 10 minutes and the Habtoor wanted to charge 50 AED (\u00a37) for an hour, whereas the Hilton let you use it for free. The Hilton also had a free kids club where you could take the little ones to keep them amused. The Habtoor again charges 140 AED per child per day (\u00a320). Habtoor also like to use a local company for taxis which are very expnsive when compared to the beige taxis, they will however ask for a beige one if you instruct them to do so. The walk to the beach is LONG!! it will easily take you 10 minutes to get to water edge, kids were knackered before we even got near the beach. Overall A good hotel with attentive staff, they make your stay enjoyable and relaxing, could be better if they took a common sense approach to their charging policies.

Well to cut a long story short.....after HOURS arguing with the dopey Ukranian so called customer services manager called Jana - and around one hour on the phone to Barclays - it became apparent that the money had in fact come out and that not only were we going to have to have this money coming out - we would also be charged for using a debit card abroad, we would also be charged an exchange fee and also if it went overdrawn - a fee for that too!! Jana sent us off in good faith that she would sort it and even though it was Friday (their weekend) it would be sorted by close of day - and this was before we had even checked in!!!!!!!! We were then told that check in might not be till 2pm - so after a night flight and arriving at the hotel at 8am - we would have to sit around for a room!!!!! After all this hassle, the reception said we could book in early at 10 am and made it out to be some great priority (when in fact we found out later that everyone else who was waiting got a room at the same time!) We also found out that some other guests who arrived at around the same time - got to have b'fast - this we weren't offered! The end of the day came and still no news - so we hot footed it to reception to see if the money situation had cleared up! Jana had gone onto the Barclays website and found a random fax number and sent all our info over and not even chased it up to see if it had arrived - well it resulted in us ringing Barclays ourselves and then having to have our debit card cancelled - and then to be sent a new one to our home address.....on holiday with no card! The hotel did nt apologise once and made no effort to recompensate us for their error. The hotel room was lovely we were in a garden view room overlooking the pool - and the room was cleaned well and stocked with fruit and water every day which was great! The pool however was disapponting - the downstairs pool was like a scene from Benidorm revisited and it just wasn't what you would expect from a five star hotel - the music was loud, and the atmosphere was not how I envisaged it would be, i'm not a snobby person but it really was \"Chav city\" - the horizon pool however on the 3rd floor was great though - really relaxing and it seemed like a million miles away from the chaos downstairs! The beach was disappointing - the sunbeds were miles away from the sea and when you did eventually reach the sea - the beach was very stoney compared to other hotels along the beach and also there was alot of litter scattered about. We stayed on a b& B basis and the b'fast was excellent - there was a really good selection. The hotel has a shuttle service to mall of the emirates, ibn battuta mall and the burjuman centre but these get really crowded - so get a taxi as they are cheap!!!! (If you get a taxi ask for a local one as the hotel cars are a rip off!) As somebody else also commented....our minibar was emptied 2 days before we left.....these guys seriously have trust issues... Which brings me onto drinks prices.......absolute rip off! 20 dhs ( just under \u00a33) for a can of coke.....just to put this into perspective - at Carrefour at the mall of the emirates you can buy 6 cans for 5 dhs (under \u00a31) - they seriously rip you right off! Do like we did and buy a cheap cooler from Carrefour and then get the bar men to top it up with ice for you every day - they happily do this! Last little moan....we had an early flight on our way home - I asked the previous day for an early morning wake up call at 5.30 am - they never rang! It was just lucky that I also had my mobile phone alarm too as otherwise we would have missed our flight!!! The guys who work on reception are amateurs..... This hotel will be in a prime location in about 5 years for the marina....but at the moment it is SURROUNDED by building works....I was expecting it...but it seemed worse than I remember from the Sheraton....one woman was hit in the face whilst sunbathing from debris that flew off a nearby building site roof....it really is THAT CLOSE!

We paid extra and had the club rooms. This allows free transfers & the use of the 25th floor for breakfast 7am till 11am. and afternoon tea 3pm till 5:30pm and drinks from 6pm till 8pm. As a club member all this is free. We had Tea twice and drinks three times. I did breakfast every day and the service and manners where exelent, plus the view of the gulf and palm, from the 25th floor club area is spectacular. We also recieved a free up-grade to HB although we never took up this offer as the restaurant meals where buffet type and is not a meal type we would use. The HB option can only be used in the restaurant in the lobbie. the other 6 restaurant are private and you must pay for these meals. We did have few problems, they do not take debit cards and this meant we had to put down a \u00a3500 & a further \u00a3300 security, but we had \"naggie\" problems with this arrangement, we where questioned when charging things to the rooms and even though we had a 1600 dhs credit (\u00a3250) they refused to allow us to charge to the rooms the last two days. They even cleared the mini bars while we where at the pool two days before we left. The admin at this hotel is very, very petty and we found the same problem at the Met. Hotel run by the same group ( Habtoor) in Dubai. So please bear this in mind, they trust no one check every last detail in your room and charge, every last dime and cent to you. You can see this penny pinching attitude, every where, and it can be a problem. The 7 restaurant in the Hotel are great the Grill is very good and cheap \u00a320 - \u00a330 per head the wine was \u00a318 per bottle not bad and the service is great The lebanise restaurant has a set meal \u00a322 and you will have more food than you can shake a stick at. All very tastie and fresh, watch out for the belly dancer she is very pretty and likes to get you up for a belly dance is quite a night and not a place for a quick bite. The Hotel run buses to the mall ( The Emerates and Batuta) but the cost of a hotel taxi is about \u00a33 so it not worth the wait ( it does a 30min tour of 3 other hotels to pick up ). You can get a local cab from the hotel next door if you want to save 50p. These malls are about a 20min away and have loads of shops a ski slope and nice restaurant. Batuta mall is a bit more intersting and I think cheaper The Marina complex 700m, a short walk at night but too hot during the day has a suppermarket ans a small number of shops to buy a few things. It also has 7 more restaurant including a couple offering a \u00a310 buffet lunch an American style dinner and a nice Italian restaurant. Plus a frankies and Bennies ice-cream parlur. The horizon pool is just great and the view is lovely the other pool is good and has a pool bar and water slides very good for kids. The beach is a good walk and quite a hike at noon as the path ways are red hot. The beach it nice and clean and a sea wall is about 250m from shore which has millions of fish of all kind and 50dhs rental, buys you the use, of Fins, Mask and a snorkal. On the whole this is a good hotel nice staff good service from the staff and good location. The Admin staff are under strick instructions to check and charge every thing.

For those of you have not been Dubai,it really is a building site and especially around the Habtoor ,at the moment.There is building work right up to the door.Just something to be aware of. It was a bit of a suprise at first but it did not take away from our stay,at all. The hotel lobby is really nice and lots of staff available to help.We had an ocean view in one of the towers and it was a good size.It was stocked with fruit and water daily. We ate in all the restaurants at one stage or another and they were lovely.The food in the 25th(top floor restaurant) was exceptional. We shared our time between the main pool and the infinity pool.The main pool caters for families,lots of lifeguards on duty and they just to spent the majority of their time making sure the kids did'nt come to any harm.It would be reassuring to parents ,I'm sure. there is also an infinity pool which seemed to have the hardcore sunworshippers,so it was alot quieter.But both were again well staffed. There is also a private beach which was excellent also.The water was the warmest sea water that I ever swam in,although not much of a suprise considering temps.were in early 40's. A free shuttle pick up at hotel for most of the major shopping centres. Overall I must comment on the staff,there were so helpful & friendly.One instant is as follows.I lost OUR camera (apologies Suzy) during our stay.We reckon that we lost it in a taxi.Using CCTV footage,the hotel helped us trace the driver,reg plate ,unfortunately the taxi company were not helpful at all.A special thanks to the conceirge,Nehru(I think) who was curteous,friendly,helpful and patient.However we never recovered it but that just meant that we were able to buy a replacement for half the price that we would have had to,at home. We both used the spa which was really professional and relaxing.We both full body massages and it was excellent. We did a city tour which is only a half day and it was a good introduction.We took the option to have buffet lunch in the Burj and it did'nt disappoint.It was more like a dinner,as the selection was huge. Just a quick word on Dubai itself.It will be fabulous when its finished.I will go back but I will probably wait for a few years until the building work subsides.

The rooms were kept spotless and we had so many bottles of water left by housekeeping every day (was suppose to have 3 - there was my husband, daughter and myself) but they were always bring in more. Fresh fruit every day. The breakfast was very good, so many different fruit juices. Well recommend all the resturants in the hotel especially the Grill.

The holiday started well as we were in a lovely Tower Room which had sea views and easy access to the pool. We spent our days relaxing by the Horizon Pool which was quieter than the main pool where there were plenty of noisy children! The pool staff were very friendly and helpful as were most of the staff but not others.... We had booked half board and this meant we had one meal included in our room rate each day. When we checked in we were told by reception staff that we could eat in any of the hotel restaurants excluding the Steak House. We used our half board deal most evenings but one night decided to go out with friends so took lunch in the restaurant by the pool expecting this to be included. After we ate lunch and requested the bill was put on the room as half board we were told we were not allowed to use our half board meal rate for lunch. We felt really annoyed as this is not what we were told when checking in. The reason for not including it as half board was because the Horizon Bar was not a restaurant but a bar, this could have been explained to us! Anyway we contacted Reception and asked them to confirm things and they said there had been a misunderstanding and it would be excluded from our bill. However when checking out, the meal was listed on the bill so we explained to the reception staff that we had been told a few days earlier that this would be taken off. The lady on reception was very rude and said we were lying so I asked to see the Hotel Manager. The Hotel Manager kept us waiting for 20 mins, he finally came to talk and we explained the situation again to him however he would not back down and would not accept that his reception staff had given us false information. We asked if he could remove the food from our bill and he wouldn't do this for us. It was only for about \u00a320 but to us it was the principle of the matter! The Hotel Manager was extremely rude to us and made us feel like we were in the wrong, so much to the customer always being right! For a hotel with over 400 rooms, \u00a320 would have made no difference to him and wouldnt he rather keep his hotel guests happy - Apparently not! I have never met such a rude man, he had absolutely no desire to keep his guests happy. We left the hotel feeling really upset about the end of our holiday. We would never go back there as both the reception staff and Hotel Manager made extremely bad Habtoor Grand memories.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot a Dubai Fan!\u201d", "Author": "eattravelandbe", "ReviewID": "UR16235518", "Content": "We went to dubai at the end of our 3 week honeymoon, after 2 weeks in the Maldives (Komandoo & Kuredu) The first thing you notice when arriving in dubai is the building sites and the huge skyscrapers.

I have to say I was very apprehensive before we arrived, as after we had booked our holiday, I read the reviews on this site and was more than slightly concerned! We arrived at the hotel in the evening and were quickly shown to our room, which was a welcome relief after the long journey. Therefor, I was dismayed to find we had been given a smoking room, despite requesting a non-smoking room??? The hallway on that floor was heavy and stale with the smell of smoke. Oh, 'hear we go' I thought. However, I have to say that after we complained we were taken back to reception and after a search that took about 40 minutes (the hotel was near full) we were found an alternative room on a 'smoke-free' floor, in the same class, which was a tower sea-view standard room. The room itself was impressive and very spacious, especially so for a standard room. We had a lovely bronze mosaic and granite bathroom, with a double walk-in shower and large bath. We also had a 6 ft+ bed, a chaise lounge, flat screen TV and arm chair. We were lucky that we had a nice view of the beach and could see the Palm to our right. I am glad that we paid the extra \u00a3150 for the sea-view, well worth it, as the back of the hotel has a lot of building going on behind it, as the whole of Dubai does! Overall, our stay at the hotel was very pleasant. We couldn't really fault it. The restaurants were good, although expensive, as most hotel restaurants in Dubai are. We paid \u00a370-90 per night for 2 adults and 1 child, with one bottle of wine! I would highly recommend the Italian, Luciano's and the Thai restaurant, Munchi was also good. The staff were nice and friendly at all times. My daughter loved the kids pool with two slides and the life guards who kept watch, who kept her and the other kids entertained. There was a kids club but we didn't even have to use it as she had so much fun in the mini pool. The adults pool was equally nice with a bar with water stools, but I do think the pool area could be improved further with more lush planting and the sun bed cushions were looking a bit tired and in need of replacement, but despite this we enjoyed our time around the pool side, and I can honestly say we did not hear any building work that others have mentioned while we were there. Yes, we saw building going on, but noise was not a problem for us, which was a bonus as we had expected to hear some. Other plus pints, we used the free shuttle from the hotel to go to the Mall of the Emirates, which is a short ride away. Breakfast was good, although a little on the busy side at times! Well equipped gym and private beach. In comparison to other hotels in Dubai, I would say that the Habtoor Grand is a good four-star establishment, not the five-star it is sometimes given on holiday sites. We went to the Meridien, which is right next door for a meal, and that really highlighted the difference between the Habtoor and the 'big guns'. The Habtoor is 'good', but they are 'luxury'. The Meridien in comparison to the Habtoor, is aesthetically more pleasing in terms of lush gardens, more open space and grand marble decor. We had considered staying at the Meridien but it was \u00a3650 more for the six nights, and yes it is a superior, more luxurious hotel, but I'm glad we didn't spend the extra as we really enjoyed our holiday, so would it have really been necessary? On top of that we ate in the \"Primerib' at the Meridien and paid \u00a3180 for 2 adults and a child, with one bottle of the cheapest wines on the menu and no desserts! We were 'gobsmacked' and slightly relieved that we didn't opt for the Meridien as we could have ended up paying double what we did at the Habtoor. In summary, if you are looking for a child-friendly, good service and value for money hotel, then the Habtoor is a good choice. If you are looking for luxury and sheer opulence then perhaps try the Meridien, One & Only or Madinat complex, but expect to pay almost double for it!", "Date": "April 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha, Qatar", "Title": "\u201cI have mixed feelings about it\u201d", "Author": "Tropical_Beach_Bum", "ReviewID": "UR15128036", "Content": "The hotel was quite good, my room was large, but it was not up to the standard of some of the other 5 star establishments I have stayed in on the same strip.

We chose the Habtoor as we didnt want to stay at the 'chain' hotels in the same price bracket- the sheraton and the hilton, both very close to habtoor... it was the RIGHT decision! The habtoor has an arabian feel to it, not the 'clinical' feel that you get in the hilton etc. The staff are exceptionally helpful (almost TOO helpful!) and the facilities are excellent. I particularly loved the 'Horizon pool on the 3rd flr- no children up there so great for singles/couples without children. Fab views of the Burj in the distance! The hotel has a fabulous selection (14 i think?) of restaurants- we ate in 3 of them and all 3 were lovely. THe breakfast buffet was fantastic- fresh juice, fruit, croissants, fry up, omellets, porridge, cheeses, you name it, it was there. Breakfast, however, was chaotic. YOu had to Queue to get a table, adn then sometimes it was difficult to get a bowl for cereal etc.. The hotel has an exceptionally good gym- a gym that would do as a full time gym- plenty of high tech equipment.. it could do with being colder though, but that's just a small complaint! the Spa is also excellent although book a few days in advance. It was much nicer than i expected. Location- it's not the best location (in terms of seeing the rest of dubai) BUT, it's a mere 5 minute taxi ride (off peak) from mall of emerates, madinat, ski dubai, jumeriah/burj etc.. it's a bit on the outskirts of dubai, but it is right on the beach.. it's also very close to the Grosvernor House, home to Bar 44 AND Buddha Bar, 2 of the best bars in town (along with bar 360 out on the sea near the burj) In summary, i believe the Habtoor is the best hotel in it's 4 star class/ value for money. It's not 5 star luxury, it's not the Meridien or the Madinat etc., but it was thoroughly enjoyable and great value relatively speaking. I would stay there again without a doubt, and having seen the hilton/sheraton pool areas (they are similar price ranges) the Habtoor is far superior.

It overlooked the pool and it was really relaxing to wake up to such a beautifull view. Did not hear any construction noise at all so maybe the ground floor villas are the preffered rooms. Yes there is construction going on in the beach area but cant say it bothered us one bit, the beach and hotel is a large area so was able to avoid even seeing it. If seeing too much construction will spoil your holiday then i would wait another couple of years before comming to Dubai as you cannot avoid it.But there are more than enough completed buildings now that more than compensate what is still going up. The pool at the Habtoor is beatiful , we ate in the Italien restaurant and the meal was exceptional. The spa was geat, try the recovery head massage , my neck felt relaxed for the first time in ages.

Anyway would definitely recomend this hotel, unless of course you have the money to go to the Jumeira Beach hotel or even the Burj el arab, yes of course that is a totally differant level but the Burj is someyhing like \u00a3800 per night plus, We payed \u00a3 700 for a double room for three nights, including breakfast. While in Dubai , the open top bus ride is great for getting to see all the sights, you can pick it up daily outside the Royal meridian, just to the right of the Habtoor Grand. Also a great day and evening is the Desert Safari trip, a bit scary speeding up and down the sand dunes, but if i can do it (bit nervous) any one can, and the evening in the desert camp was good fun, camel rides, watching the sun set, nice food, belly dancing.

It was v. v. child friendly. There are 2 jacuzzies in teh pool, one where everyone can go and an adult heated one. The pool was also heated. The kids clubs were great, although our little girl didn't go in them, every night she chose 2 DVDs from there to watch in our room (which came with DVD player!) The staff were excellent, very attentive. The gym which I use regularly was absolutely fantastic, the same as my Esporta gym at home, with same equipment. However, the air conditioning was useless so it got very hot. I had 2 spa treatments, a facial (not very good, they left me for 15 minutes whilst my mask worked and kept banging the door), but my Head Recovery Massage was brilliant, really deep and got rid of all my knots.

However the hotel failed to declare that a huge construction project is underway on the beach in front of the hotel. This isa 24 hour construction site and there is no escaping the noise, dust and constant trail of lorries We had arranged directly with the hotel a limo collection from the airport upon arrival. This failed to materialise. My pre booked treatments in the spa were infact never recorded so on arrival that was most disapointing. I was also over charged for treatments - not the relaxing start to the holiday we had hoped for! We were unfortunate to be in dubai during freak rain which resulted in us using the room more than usual.

What a contrast, butler service exceptional restaurants, the opportunity to use the Royal merdian beach across the road,all for a cheaper price. definatley worth looking at. We continued our stay at the royal mirage which was a far better option for a beach holiday. Just be cautious about the Habtoor Grand. If you have high expectations of a five star hotel avoid it llike the plague.

What a sight - magnificent with lovely Christmas decor, the floor was shiny, and the greeting staff and smiling faces makes you want to smile back. My eyes well up with pure delight that we have chosen this beautiful hotel. We arrived at 8.30am. Check in was not til 2pm. Our early check in request was granted at 10am. We arrived in a our room which was very spacious in the Palm Tower. As we waited for the luggage we looked out of the window and could only see part of the 'sea view'. The corner room of the towers view was not to our satisfaction. We called reception and explained that we had paid for sea view. The exchange of the room went smoothly. We arrived on the 11th floor of the other tower with a balcony. WOW! What a sight! The New Years Eve Gala was fantastic. The food was out of this world - fresh, great presentation. Each table had their own waiter. Our glasses were never empty. Great entertainment for the kids. The staff overall were very friendly and the concierge were most helpful. They couldn't do enough for you. 'Your wish is my command' and very respectful. My son fell ill on my birthday early hours in the morning and reception was great when I asked for a doctor. He arrived as promised and thoroughly checked him over - pharynigitis. My son was given 2 injections as a quick fix. Reception even went to get the prescription for me. I was then woken up with telephone call wishing me a Happy Birthday and if they could bring up my birthday cake. A great surprise. My second birthday cake was from the Burj Al Arab. Oh My God!! What an experience that was. We dined in the new Junsui buffet restaurant. The Maitre'd really looked after us. Because my son was not well and didnt eat much they did not charge us and made sure he was ok. We felt like royalty - amazing service. Dubai overall is amazing - yes there is construction but in 10 years time it will be the worlds biggest holiday resort. The shopping malls - got to do it. The gold souk is a nighmare. Don't do what we did - come back with nothing. We went to 5 shops and got fed of looking. Advise - go into one shop, pick what you like and haggle. There is no way you can visit 360 shops!! Go to experience Safari Desert. Only transport taxis but cheap not like the beer. But you do need to respect their muslim culture. They do not serve alcohol on special Islamic days.

A few hours later and over the course of the afternoon, I received more than 8 calls from the hotel management claiming that there was a 'technical error' and the suite would cost an additional US$2,000! I insisted that I have the confirmation in writing and my booking is guaranteed for $500. In total arrogance, they said that although it was their mistake they would only be able to offer me a small room in the old section of the resort for US$700, else I should dish out the extra $2,000 for the suite! Of course I refused and insisted that I would show up as planned to claim my reservation at the confirmed rate. In the early evening, I received an email cancelling the original 'guaranteed' reservation without me having requested a cancellation!

Perhaps its because im only young and i havn't seen much of the world yet, but i can safely say that Dubai on a whole is such a beautiful place and is one that you have to see to believe it's real. I have to admit, when i got to Habtoor, flying all the way from England, me and my family were so tired and just wanted to go to our room and and rest, but our room wasn't ready. Before we went, we read that the check in time for the hotel was 2 o clock, but we thought it couldn't make much difference could it? In fact it did. we arrived at Habtoor at 10 or 11 am and didn't get a room til 1. I was so furious about this because, it's not everyday you get to go to paradise and we were only staying for a few days so i valued the time we had, and yet i spent the first few hours of my holiday sitting in the lobby, dirty, tired, from all the travelling. it was not pleasant. But, me, my brother and sister decided to go and kill some time by checking out the pool and beach and let me tell you something. Once you set your eyes on that amazingly white sand and your foot sinks into the hot and softness of it, you forget about any problems you have. At that point I thought to myself, I LOVE IT HERE !! After that, it wasn't too long before we got our room and the holiday was....im too lost for words...i cant describe it... All i can say is, just experience it for youself. Save up lots of money(because you've got to have quite a lot to have a good time there). Yess i would suggest you have MORE THAN ENOUGH money before you go, so tthat you can enjoy all the amazing activities Dubai has such as the Desert Safari, which is a priceless expereince. So although Habtoor had a few flaws, I think it's definitely the best hotel I'v ever been to, everything about it was luxurious. The whole atmosphere of the hotel just makes you feel excentric, it really is paradise..I cant express it anymore. The beach is honestly, truly, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING YOU'LL EVER SEE, truly spectacular. So I say DEFINITELY !

The hotel was proposed to us by our travel agent and I have to admit I had some reservations after reading some reviews here, but fortunately this has not stopped us from staying there. We arrived at the Habtoor around midnight and the check-in process took only a few minutes. We discovered that our tower sea-view room was at a non-smoking zone although we had requested a smoking room. The hotel acknowledged the fact that it was their mistake and they immediately gave us a Club tower sea-view room (12th floor-tower B) at no extra cost. CONSTRUCTION: Yes the Habtoor is next to the Marina construction site and the Palm construction site. There is also construction going on behind the hotel. There are no pavements and walking outside the hotel is not impossible but not particularly easy. Nevertheless, I cannot see any reason why should anyone walk outside the hotel as there is nothing much to do at walking distance. A visit to the Malls, Jumeirah town, City centre and the Creek requires car transportation and taxis are cheap and always available. Noise from construction is not bad and certainly you hear nothing while in the hotel whereas the noise in the tower rooms (facing the beach) is barely noticeable. While on the beach there was a helicopter flying above the construction site from time to time but this was also not annoying, I would say it was a rather spectacular sight along with the skyscrapers along the beach. Moreover I can't see why someone who would be annoyed by construction at the Habtoor would not feel the same in the Meridien or the Hilton which are a few hundred metres away and share the same beach. I think that soon after construction has finished, Habtoor will be at the very best part of Jumeirah beach so future visitors keep that in mind. THE ROOM: The room was very big with superb view and had a beautiful bathroom and a balcony. It featured a great king sized bed (maybe only the mattress at home would feel as comfortable), a sofa, a large LCD TV and DVD and a safe. Decoration had an Arabian touch with some beautiful paintings, vases and carpets. Complimentary fruit, water and chocolates were delivered daily. Room was made up twice a day unless you pressed the \"do not disturb button\". Temperature in the room was very well regulated by the A/C system, but coming from a warm country we found the A/C not necessary for most of our staying there. Even with the A/C switched off and 35c outside, room temperature was 24-25c, very pleasant for us. POOL and BEACH: The hotel has a great pool with water massage and a separate jacuzzi. The maximum depth is 1.5 metres so obviously diving is not allowed however for me this is a big advantage as you can swim and relax without the noise and the splashes from diving champions' wannabes. Lifeguards are everywhere so kids and adults alike can feel safe there. The Horizon pool is also very nice for those who prefer a very quiet spot. We tried both pools but for me the beach was THE place to be. A few minutes walk from the pool, the Jumeirah beach stretches as far your eye can see, with its white sand and clear waters. Water temperature was around 25c so you actually wanted to stay in the water for hours. Sun beds were always available and the hotel staff was always there to help you. I would recommend the beach as it offers you more space than the pool and the breeze from the sea makes the atmosphere less humid compared to the pool. ELIXIR SPA: The spa located in the hotel offers a wide range of services. My wife had a hand and nail spa which according to what she told me was excellent. I am not an expert on these issues so I will not say more but there was a brochure with all the things you could do there and I have to admit it was impressive. One of them was some treatment with cosmetics based on chocolate. I admit I was tempted but I did not try it. RESTAURANTS AND BARS: Do try the South African Grill restaurant and the bar on the 25th floor of A tower. THE STAFF: Being one of the stronger points of this hotel, the staff is always there to help when you need them. Always polite and friendly. I wish I could thank each of them personally once again. It's true that the staff is also human beings and will respond better to someone who treats them as such. OVERALL: I would definitely recommend the Habtoor Grand Resort and I look forward to visiting that place again. OTHER HOTELS: I will only speak about 5-star hotels in Jumeirah since I do not think that I would like to stay in the centre (unless I was a business traveler). From this perspective, there are 3 classes of such hotels: the Burj (vanity class), a class of its own which you should visit for an afternoon tea maybe but overall it is a very boring place (I have to admit that gold plated trash bins are not my style). The second class consists of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, the Madinat and the Carlton which are on the beach, they are excessively luxurious and justify in that way the higher prices they charge. The third class includes hotels like Habtoor, the Hilton, the Royal Meridien etc which are ideally located on the beach, provide a wide range of amenities and a very high level of service at a more reasonable cost. They are luxurious but not the fairy-tale type like the ones in class 2. THE CITY: It is hard to ask for something from a holiday destination that Dubai does not provide. Stable warm weather (end of October was between 37c and 29c), a feeling of security, excellent beach, first class services, delicious international food, shopping malls, reasonable prices and bargains, a large number of activities (do NOT miss the desert safari and the dune dinner), a variety of restaurants and bars and friendly people. Now to be fair, there are a few things Dubai does not have. One is rich history and antiquities, however since we are from Greece we did not not mind. A second thing a tourist cannot find easily in Dubai is locals, so forget about getting deeper into Arab culture and traditions and enjoy the international atmosphere. One last thing you may find annoying in Dubai is traffic as the lack of an extensive network of public transport makes everyone use a car and you may need more than an hour to get from Jumeirah beach to the city centre at times. TIP: Take some time to speak to people living and working there. They come from so many different countries. They will tell you about real every day life in Dubai, things you will probably will not hear from a guide. They will talk to you about their cultures, their hopes and dreams, their working conditions.

The thai/chinese restaurant Mun Chi at the pool side had gorgeous food and they do cater for veggies aswell. The Underground Pub is quite smoky and if ur not into English football and that type of atmosphere i would avoid it. The gym is also well equiped and the spa facilities are of a very high standard. Bar 44 in the Governor House Hotel just across the road from Habtoor is very nice and has amazing views of the skyline, and has fab cocktails!!(though they can be expensive) I would also recommend doing a desert safari, they are such good fun, and you can book them from the guest services in the hotel lobby.

This time we stayed at the Habtoor, and I wish we hadn't. The amenities were good, the (sea view tower room) was nice and clean, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom very nice. There was the usual choice for breakfast, but they very promptly removed the food at 10.30. Service was atrocious. You were lucky to get a cup of tea by the time you were half way through your breakfast, and the table was regularly missing a cup, glass, fork, etc. Every enquiry to provide the missing item was met with 'Yes Ma'am', and then nothing happened. Be prepared to ask 3-4 times for each item, and to get up from your table and hunt for someone to listen. Staff are very good at ignoring you. Room was quite often not cleaned before 3 - 4 pm, and turn-down service only happened occasionally (which is when they provide more bottled water - the water to buy was quite expensive). We had booked half-board - the buffet was the same every night, and again staff seemed to be unable to cope with the two tables that were occupied - they showed you to your table and then turned away without asking whether you would like a drink. Water comes with the buffet, however, you need to know that and ask for it, otherwise they will sell you one of their expensive bottles (once you've hunted them down to order a drink). Food was very average. Staff tried to overcharge us 3 on three occasions. When we asked staff if we could take the half board allowance to the other restaurants within the hotel, we got four different answers. Therefore, surprise, the final bill was higher than expected, and only when challenged, did they agreed that they had overcharged us. Pool: plenty of sun beds, which were fine. Very loud dance music, more suited to a club or an 18-30 holiday in a 2 star in Spain. But maybe that was to drown out the building works. Toilets were sometimes quite dirty, and a lot of the little kids were not wearing aqua-nappies. The pool on the third floor is adult-only, but is really prone to the building noise from the Marina, and there were also kids (sans aqua-nappies) in this pool. Although the hotel boasts that it has got 13 restaurants, half of them are only snack bars, and they all serve the same (over-priced) menu. The noise from the building of the palm was really noticeable at night (the beeping of reversing trucks), and if you need to use the internet for checking your flight, be prepared to pay for a whole hour, which is their minimum. Service at the pool was slow, you would have to go and remind them that you had ordered something once in a while. When someone more important arrived at the pool, space was made at the front of the sun beds, and tables were taken away from other people to provide to the new comers. When reading some of the other reviews, I really wonder if we stayed at the same hotel? At a 5 star you should not have to ask several times for something, the atomosphere should not be 2 star Spanish hotel, and staff should not be ignoring a simple request such as a drinks order.

Having stayed at the Hilton just along the beach last year, we decided to try thr Habtoor this year.We booked a tower sea view room, ( we upgraded from a garden view, after reading some of the comments on this site). We were not disapointed. the room was twice the size of the one at the Hilton and very palatial.The staff were very friendly, and helpful and could not be faulted. Now the be aware part. Dubai , especially the new marina section ( where the Habtoor is located) is just one big construction site. The sea view consists of the beach, then 100m into the gulf they are constructing new jetty's, breakwaters etc. so there is a continueous stream of diggers,trucks, sea crane, and barges dumping rocks just off the beach. To the land side is the construction of the Marina developement, high rise blocks, roads, etc. So if your going with a view to peace and quiet, do not stay anywhere near here. Having said that as long as you are aware of everything that's going on you won't be disapointed, you may even get used to all the ambient distractions. Eating out.

We arrived at 1am in the morning and we were met with smiling faces and a wonderful member of staff called \"Oliver\" he greeted us and showed us to our room personally and explained all the amenities. The level of customer service remained top notch through out the week stay. not one bad apple amongst the whole staff from morning noon and night it was constant smiles!We had heard that the garden rooms were not up to standard so we paid more for the sea view tower rooms. we were pleased we had done this as we met several guests who had booked the garden rooms and had refused to stay in them upon arrival as they were apprently not 5*. The tower sea view rooms are lovely and have ample room.We also booked B&B and the breakfast was superb, everything from fresh fruit to eggs sunny side up! The hotel has two pool areas, one by the sea and one on floor 3. We stayed on the floor 3 area as it was much quieter. The pool boys were fantastic! The hotel has several resturants, we like dthe Munchi resturant by the sea area, it serves great sushi and is open all day. The 25th floor restuarant always looked quiet and had no atmosphere. You can not walk out out of the hotel due to building construction everywhere but cabs are really reasonable. The building work is astronimical, everywhere you look there is a digger and building going on, but it didnt really bother us, however in the tower room you can really hear the buliding on the beach area as it goes on all through the nite!!!!!We loved the Emirates mall, lovey shops, and great starbucks! But our best find was The Dragon Mall, only 15 mins by cab and sells EVERYTHING!!!! from phones to bath plugs. It is all chinese copies of original items but they are fantastic and so cheap!!!! Another good find was the Madinet hotel, it is a great afternoon out, lovely hotel with gondolas and bazaar type atmosphere. We booked the dessert safari in the hotel, it was the most scary expereince of my life, horrific!!! not one of the guides spoke english and it was extremely dangerous! everyone on the trip was pertified! we complained the the rep in the hotel but she was as much use as a chocolate tea pot! so think twice about this tour, and it is definately not for the faint hearted,it is an accident waiting to happen! Overall i would highly recommend the hotel and would defiantely go back, mainly due to the level of customer service extended to us.As for food, try to go to local places, we went to kumar shopping area and found a fab Indian restuarant, ate 5 courses for \u00a35 each and it was fantastic! also an Iranian resturant called Par Iranian, great grilled food!", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cit was soo great have to go back!!\u201d", "Author": "Babyd0ll", "ReviewID": "UR8707555", "Content": "Habtoor grand was luxurious!! they had very welcoming customer service! and always greeted you with a smile and a \"hello madam\" we stayed for 5 nights and 6 days and we were all girls! we stayed in a tower room which was fabulous, it had a hair dryer and a great shower room and the beds were very comfortable, room service was great and on time. even though there is construction work going on, you cant really hear it at night you can only see it! the pool and beach was amazing, the only problem was there is construction work going on around the beach but you can go to other hotels to also use there facilties.. however you have to accept that it is a tourist attraction and there building beautiful bulidngs and hotels, its just amazing.

One of the previous reviews probably got it about right when they said that you should not expect too much when you are paying good prices, however the hotel is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. We encountered good points and bad points with the hotel. The bad points will mean we do not return here in the near future! Okay, bad points include: > garden rooms, we booked two of these, and had to be moved after checking in as both rooms had strong smells of mould. We moved to tower rooms with sea views. > Main pool played \"benidorm\" sort of music, the loungers cusions had seen better days, the water temperature was too high, and I was not the only person to get an ear infection from it. > The hotel is surrounded by building work very close on 3+ sides. You cannot escape it. Especially between the hotel and the mouth of the marina, work continues 24 hours a day, with reversing earth movers \"beepers\" going all night, which can be clearly heard from inside the rooms. Not to mention the noise from the building of the 3rd Habtoor Grand tower. > The breakfast dining room felt more like a cafeteria, I think you could have booked an executive package and dined in a better room. > The \"underground pub\" which was aimed at the british tourist who is missing watching football, smoking and drinking, is not what we wanted from a 5 star hotel in Dubai! The good points include: > The rooms in the tower were of a good standard and clean. > Staff were all friendly and did their best to assist, especially the barman Freddie ! > Squash courts, Gym and tennis courts- excellent > The horizon pool on the 3rd floor was good > The physical location of the hotel is close to many nearby attractions (wild wadi, marina walk, Buddha Bar (excellent) and Burj al Arab, Ski Dubai etc...) Our checking in process, due to the mouldy rooms, was lengthy and required all 5 of us to spend the night in one room, before they found two rooms the following day, this was not a good start! We ate once at the hotel, which was average, so we ate out on all other occasions, lots of goods places close by (by taxi though - absolutely no walking possible!)

We arrived at the hotel at 8am, having paid for the night before so that we could check in and go straight to our room to get a couple of hours sleep before checking out Dubai. This seemed to cause the receptionist some confusion and when eventually resolved we were just handed our room swabs. We were told nothing about the hotel, breakfast times, what we could and could not use for free eg, the sauna, steam room etc - or where to find them. It did seem to us that it depends on which receptionist checks you in as I did overhear another couple checking in at the same time who were being given a lot of useful information by that lady (whilst eavesdropping is not particularly polite this is how i gained the information we needed to know about the hotel!!!) Each of the 4 times we had breakfast (at different times each day) we found the tables to not be laid properly. We were often missing a teaspoon, side plate and glass for the fruit juice. Most of the time the cutlery had been left from the people before us if they had not used it - lets just hope they hadn't used it anyway!!!!! The napkins were also left from the previous people on 2 occasions and given to me as new/clean napkins - tell tale sign was the fresh jam on it!!! disgusting!!!!!!! Our seaview room in the tower was ok, until upon closer inspection the bed sheets had holes in them (no excuse for this no matter what 'star' rating the hotel is!) Whilst our bed was made each day, the bathroom was bearly wiped round and on leaving we noticed a pile of dust had formed around the washbag we left on the side where clearly they had not cleaned this area at all. To summarise, as others have said, the junior staff, the conceirge, doorstaff etc were all very pleasant and helpful. The reception staff could do with being more welcoming and the general cleaniness and service standards leave something to be desired. We were sold this hotel on the understanding we would be treated very well but the levels of service were not better than something i would expect from a 3 star hotel in Europe.

Due to the comments on this site I felt a little disheartened beofre arriving at the Habtoor Grand. I will have to agree with the previous email. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Habtoor Hotel. I have stayed in the Burj al Arab, The Jumeriah Beach, The Royal Meridian so I believe i am a good person to listen to. Remember you get what you pay for. I think some of the travellers are living in a dream world. I recommend the hotel for couples and families with young children for the kids club aged 4-7 year olds for that is the only thing that i would say needs some attention. My son is 11 and went in once for 10 minutes. At the Jumeriah Beach Club I couldnt get him out not even to eat. I have filled in my comment card to give my suggestions to improve what i feel they need, after having been to some of the best hotels in Dubai so i know what i am talking about. Dont pay Butlins prices and then expect the very best. Pay extra for the executive package, do not have the garden rooms, Have rooms in the tower with a view, use the executive lounge for breakfast and afternoon teas. Use the government taxis not the hotel private taxi's it is more money you will be tempted to travel in style but you will pay for it. They will tell you it is the same price it does also have a meter but the luxury car meters tend to tick faster and charge you much more than the regular taxi's (Others suggested this on this site) Exchange money in Dubai near duty free where you collect your luggage (others suggested this on this site) Do check your bill at the end i had a discrepancy (Others suggested this on this site). Jumeriah Beach is my first love but i would definitely come back to this hotel. If you are a skywards member at the Wafi Shopping Centre give customer service desk your Skywards number they will hand you a discount booklet whilst shopping dont know if it is a promotion at the minute but worth checking out.

In side the rooms were good , all had lcd screen tv's and a dvd player with good airconditioning. There i a lot of maintenance work going on in the hotel as it is being updated, but it never got in the way or disturbed me. The restaurants were ok but a bit pricey. The swimming pool arae is nice for kids as there is a huge slide for them and for adults the pool has a nice swim up bar. All in all I think people have been unfairly harsh to this place. Yes its a bit older and is a bit weathered in parts but the service , staff and facilities are good as is the location. I have been to dubai before and stayed at le royal meridien which was a better hotel but I don't think you would be disappointed staying here. It is more like a good 4 star rather than a true five, but giving this hotel 1 or 2 out of 5 is utterly ridiculous. I have stayed at several 5 star hotels around the world so i have high standards.To summarise I think that if you have been to dubai and stayed at one of the top rated hotels before then you may be a bit dissapointed here but if it is your first time and your on a budget , this hotel is fine.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Epsom", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "MoffyEpsom", "ReviewID": "UR7852686", "Content": "Stayed here at the end of May and have to say I was very impressed. I had read the previous reviews about the property and was concerned, however if you book a room in the Tower then you are guaranteed a great stay. As they say, you pay for what you get! The garden rooms by the pool are the last minute deals offered by the tour operators and they have not been part of the overall upgrade of the hotel, so hence they are cheap. Book and pay for a Tower room and you get a great size room, with a pretty amazing bathroom in traditional arabic style. My friend and I have stayed in most of the 5 Star hotels in Dubai for business and this hotel is certainly upto scratch - for the helpfulness of the staff alone I would give it 5 stars as Jumeirah Beach Hotel is great, but very impersonal. Plus every Friday, they have a good club scene on the 3rd floor of the hotel.....very San Tropez and its free to guests, 6pm til midnight! One recommendation I would give to anyone staying there is to try and get out of the hotel to eat. There are so many fantastic restaurants just a taxi ride away. The Madinat Souk has a great noodle bar and loads of other restaurants and bars, plus clubs for those night owls. Check out the roof at Trilogy. The Mall of the Emirates - not just another shopping centre! Has an excellent restaurant area and good value for money - try the Lebanese or Turkish. Take a taxi to Dubai Creek, and visit the Boardwalk - great views over the creek and fab food all reasonably priced.

Worth paying extra for club rooms as you get the use of the club lounge (complimentary pre dinner drinks and canopes and breakfast included - cooked to order if required.) Beach was wonderful, clean blue water (very warm), lovely white sands and not overcrowded. Is near some building work but not at all instrusive. No jelly fish at all and very safe to swim - water sports available as well. Pool area very good - waiter service all the time from the pool bar so you don't need to move from your sun lounger - pool very good size and never overcrowded. Several restuarants available on site - we used the main one which offers different themed nights - Arabic, Mediterranean etc - the food was very good - huge choice from a starters buffet, freshly cooked main courses and a mouth watering dessert table including chocloate fountain !! This restaurant was on an 'eat as much as you like' basis with drink included for about \u00a328 per person - wine, spirits, beer all free but have to pay for soft drinks. Didn't use the spa as quite expensive - about \u00a370 for a massage but looked beautuful and the horizon pool is very quiet and underused. All in all a good hotel - worth going to the the older part of Dubai - we hired a car for the day which cost about \u00a370 - worth it - went to Deira Creek, on a water taxi to the older area - very interesting with all the mosques calling people to prayer. Be warned though, do not stay in the garden rooms which is where most of the complaints come from - these are by the pool, noisy, smaller , dark and not attached to the main hotel.

It was replenished well before running out. The whole beach/ marina area is under massive construction of numerous buildings, and whilst we did not experience any adverse noise from our 21st floor room, it did make getting around on foot very difficult, as some roads were closed or blocked off. Whilst there are numerous tours and trips offered- the Public Bus service was never mentioned. We discovered that it is possible to travel to the Dubai museum and Batiskiya also Wafi City and the Burjuman centre, the Gold and Spice Souks in Deira and even Abu Dhabi for a fraction of the price of a taxi. The down side to this is the time taken travelling- but if you are not tied to time you certainly see more.

The pools were great especially for children with daily activities and toys to play with. The beach area was lovely it was a nice walk down from the pool area, and there was a nice bar area with a huge lawned area which again was great for kids to play around and burn of some energy without upsetting other guests.

So we went there for 8 nights, booked in resort garden view rooms. Check-in took ages, the staff was unfriendly, acting as they are working there for just one season and didnt care about anything at all. After arriving at the hotel at 10am and finally being led to our room at 4pm, it was not the room that we booked. So it took another few hours to sort things out after calling our travel agent, her calling the hotel, etc. as the receptionists refused to let me speak to the hotel manager directly. So we basically lost the whole day until we got settled. Then a few days later the hotel had problems with the sewage. The smell outside the room was imbearable and inside the toilet was overflowing with water. It was not fixed in one day as promised and we were advised to go to the main building to use the toilets. That caused additional stress, calling again back and forth to our travel agent. Finally we managed to speak to the hotel manager who agreed to relocate us to another room in another building. In any case, another day was lost by constant waiting, arguing and waiting again. The breakfast was average, fruit selection poor, rooms quite small with a tiny old bathroom. The worst of all was the staff - unfriendly, unprofessional, slow. My mom left a cardigan in the main hallway and the hotel staff was not very much willing to help us find it. Check-out took about 45mins instead of the usual 5-10. The receptionist tried to charge us for the minibar which we didnt even touch. If the hotel dropped 2 stars and charged half the prices, I would probably not mind staying there as I would know what to expect. Otherwise, I do not recommend anyone staying there if you would like to have a nice stress-free vacation. Le Royal Meridien next door is not much expensive than Habtoor but so much nicer and definitely worth staying at.

Any way they said to leave it with them and we should come back around 2pm when they would hopefully found our booking. So we went out by the pool and had a wonderful morning. We went back around 12pm and they had sorted out our booking and also upgraded us to a Grand Club Room, in the smaller tower, which was very acceptable. We cannot fault the staff they were very, very polite and helpful at all times. They also went out there way to ensure we were having a good holiday. The hotel itself if very clean. My children had a wonderful time here. On a Friday the pool area can get very busy, as this is like a Sunday in Britain. So plan to go out for the day to Wild Wadi (waterpark), which is amazing fun. Again you cannot fault the staff, very helpful and very pleasant to everyone. This is so clean and tidy. We also booked through the hotel the Safari trip, which was absolutely amazing fun and never experienced anything quite like it. However, if you don't like fast cars and surprises, then this isn't for you. The whole trip is well organised and great fun. I've never heard my daughter laugh so much. The food in the hotel is very good. My son is a bit particular in what he eats and the restaurant by the pool serves wonderful pasta, pizza and seafood, highly recommend. However, the food they serve for you to eat at the pool isn't very good quality. We also eat at the restaurant in the hotel by the reception area, sorry forgot its name, but is also very good. However, we did go to the Mall, by taxi which costs around \u00a35. They have everything you can think of to eat. Not expensive and a good experience as this is where Ski Dubai is. If you are thinking of booking lessons then do this as soon as you arrive as they get very busy. However, we did go during the Easter holidays which is a busy time. This is another amazing experience and highly recommend. Well organised again and very friendly staff. Going back to the hotel. We went to the beach several times and did variours water activities, but be careful there are alot of Jelly Fish. Not sure if they sting but didn't take any chances, especially with children as this would spoil your day. It gets very hot on the beach so choose your time and where shoes. You will need high factor suncream to protect yourself but found the sun not to hot even though it was 37o most days. It was a very pleasant heat. We had a truely amazing holiday and would go back in 2010 when all the building work should be complete. This is one thing i will say we have never seen so much building work. It is every where, but doesn't make to much noise but they do work 24/7. On alot of reviews we read about it being noisy, but it didn't seem to bad.

Con's: Only small things - estetically it is not as beautiful as many other Dubai hotels. The hotel felt more like a 4 star then a 5 star. We had a good stay but i would probably stay somewhere else next time. It just lacked that little extra for it to be great. Other hints and tips: Highly recommend Net tours for Desert safari's - had a great time dune bashing, camel riding etc with them. When arriving in Dubai - grab a taxi outside. Cost's around 70 Dirham one way whilst the hotel charges 200 Dirham one way", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West London UK", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel as good as 7*\u201d", "Author": "MaidaVale-7", "ReviewID": "UR6920249", "Content": "Booked room (B&B) on lastminute.com.

Once you are on the beach you get the excellent hotel staff riding around on a little golf buggy so you can order any food/drink saving you from having to move!

The breakfast is great as were the three restaurants I tried - Italian, Mexican and 25th Floor (must go here even if you do not stay at the hotel for the view alone). As most UK flights seem to get into Dubai at about 7/8am your room will most likely not be ready as check-in is not until 2pm, (we did get a room by 11.15am) so I'd suggest pre-booking a treatment or massage in the Spa - where you can sample the delights of the relaxation room!!

I wasnt impressed by the quality of the roo. It seemed like it was \"aging\" if you can catch my drift. The hotel pool was overcrowded. The beach front thogh, was very nice and you could get a good idea of what is being built in Dubai as the whole beach side is full of huge skyscrapers! Very impresive. The good thing about the Habtoor is its location. The 25th floor restaurant and bar is a joke and I wouldnt recomend the hotel restaurants, there are so many others to go to Dubai! For example, there is the Grosvenor hotel right next door were the \"Budha Bar\" is simply magnificent! And the Indian restaurant \"Indago\" is a treat as well. Both of these were recomendations of the concierge desk of the Habtoor and we were vey much impressed with the excellent service they offer. We left the hotel with a bad taste, though. Upon checking out, we were asked the typical question \"have you consumed anything from the mini bar\". When I said \"no\" they wanted me to sign a paper that what I state is true!!!!!! Something which I denied to do, so they went to my room to check it out. I can understand the reason they do this but the way they did it is tactless and insulting. It would be better to not ask at all (they have my credit card details anyway) and check the room while I check out without me knowing.

The credit card machine in the restaurant wasn't working or what became apparent was they couldn't figure out how to use it. I eventually paid at the pool bar after 20 minutes of waiting. When I got home to find that I'd been charged twice, I can only assume I'd ended up paying in the restaurant and at the pool bar. I tried emailing the hotel but after 3 emails I'd not received 1 reply, so called them where I was asked to email a different email address.

Seven months on and I'm still getting the run around. I'm getting no response to my emails. For a 5-star hotel I'm hugely disappointed by the distinct lack of customer service I've received.

Things didn't start off too well when I arrived and they couldn't locate my booking even though I had a confirmation number. This took around 30 minutes to rectify while I waiting in the foyer.

Took forever to connect the wifi (LAN cable wasn't working) then had to proceed through the most complicated login despite repeated calls to the business centre that went unanswered and what's more they wanted AED100 for 24 hours, remember I was already paying more than AED3,000 for the room only!

Well they tried to charge me an extra AED15 for a cappuccino which I have never had to pay for in a so called 5 star hotel. I then complained when the bill was present for AED95 just for cereal and fruit. Three visits later from the restaurant manager and a lot of talking and the charges were waived all together.
