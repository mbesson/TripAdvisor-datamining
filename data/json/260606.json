This is not what you will find here..at least that was my experience. On the first night when I went to get into bed I noticed a strong urine smell and when I pulled the covers back further to investigate there was a pubic hair on the bed frame. There was also no matress pad yet there were pads, like you would expect on the beds, in the other room. Not to mention the fact that the sheets and towels are the quality of a motel, seriously. Rough feeling and not at all considered luxury. When someone came to change out as much as they could late at night I went to sit on the couch and almost sat on someone's fingernail clipping! They came the next morning and pulled up the rug around the bed and the smell was gone. Then the next morning I woke up and went to the kitchen and almost stepped on a dying roach and some kind of worm in the hallway. Went to get scissors and knife and they were dirty. Went to use the flashlight and it didn't work. The next morning I had to use the plunger because the toilet stopped up and almost vomited because when I pulled out the plunger it had been sitting in poop water for who knows how long and there was a dead roach in there. After leaving 2 messages in 2 days for the GM I finally got him by accident when I was calling the concierge and he said he hadn't received my messages. He did end up taking off a night of the $1400 a night we were paying for the quality we weren't getting. I was paranoid to sleep or sit on anything. There were supposed to be beach attendants but they were rarely there and when they were they acted like you were bothering them to ask for anything. There was also broken plastic that I am guessing is from their cheap plastic chairs and cig butts in the sand around the cottage porch. Zina, a concierge was horrible to deal with. In fact I dreaded anytime I needed she answered because she acted like you were bothering her. She failed to tell our party to be looking for a smaller ferry(different from what we had used all week) and when I went in to ask about it she was a horrible witch to not only me but one of the restaurant employees who tried to help.Then after we were already running late we didn't end up having a cab waiting for us.

Sunset Key has one restaurant, Latitudes, and it is set right on the beach. At night with white table cloths, lit tiki torches and gas light fixtures it is a romantic location for dinner. Latitudes services a beach bar at the pool and you can order food either at the pool or on the beach. The restaurant has food runners - the pool bar isn't a separate facility - but Marcus will take good care of you by the pool. The food is fantastic and the restaurant is worth a visit for its lovely atmosphere even if you aren't staying as a guest at the resort. Sunset Key's sister resort, the Westin on Front Street has several other dining options, but note that you need to take a short ferry ride to get back to its location on Mallory Dock. Sunset Key has limited options on site. It is basically the cottages, the one restaurant, the one pool, and a tennis court. On the other side of the island there are private houses where the owners tool around in golf carts. My advice if you chose to stay is to consider it more like renting a condo in a lovely tropical location rather than staying at a full service resort and that way you won't be disappointed. The concierge service, bell service, room service are all unreliable. More often than not, you receive voice mail when you call the front desk. There is generally one person doing double duty as receptionist, bell man, and concierge and that accounts for the unavailability. Here are some tips if you stay at the resort: 1. There is no service before 7:00 a.m. No one answers the phones. There is no coffee service in the morning. You make your own or there is breakfast at 7:00 in the restaurant. I called shortly after 7:00 with a request for more coffee packets and I was told \"We don't open until 7:00.\" Seriously? I said \"It is after 7:00 and we would appreciate coffee,\" and she reluctantly agreed to have someone bring us coffee packets. If you don't want to get dressed and go to breakfast make sure there is enough coffee in your room. 2. There is no true concierge like you would find in a New York hotel or in a Four Seasons. Those individuals have built relationships and know how to fulfill requests. Sunset Key does not have a real concierge. We asked for bicycles and were told we would be met back at the dock on Key West. We arrived at the dock. No bikes. We walked to the front desk at the Westin on Front Street. The concierge there called the Sunset Key concierge and naturally received voice mail. With the frustrated concierge on Front Street unable to assist us, we had a nice walking tour of the island. We asked the Sunset Key front desk for a taxi to meet us on the Key West side to take us to the airport. No taxi. We queued up with everyone else in front of the Westin on Front Street. 3. There are no transfers between the airport and the Westin. We called before our trip and were told \"Take a taxi.\" We weren't advised to check in at the Westin on Front Street (how would you know?) and they will take your luggage onto the small ferry boat that makes the short 10 minute trip from Mallory Dock to Sunset Key. We were not offered help with our luggage and we carried our own luggage from the dock onto and off the boat and all the way up the flight of stairs to our cottage. We could handle it, but it wasn't the service we expected. 4. The luggage transfer is unreliable. Stay with your luggage even if they have it on a rolling cart. In the confusion of arrivals and departures at the Westin on Front Street I watched as the bell man started rolling our luggage back in the direction of the Ferry. I stopped him in time, but we otherwise would have missed our flight. 5.Note that there is no grocery store, retail shop or pharmacy on the island. This gives the island a peaceful quality, but if you don't want to take the ferry back into town, bring whatever you need with you. 6. The resort has breakfast baskets with a few muffins and pieces of whole fruit (banana, apple) that they deliver around 8:00-8:30. We made a request to have it earlier, but they resisted the request and accommodated us for one day, and the next day it was back to 8:30. We prefer to have a hang out morning on vacation and not get dressed for the restaurant. When we realized the resort wouldn't accommodate our request we went to a small grocery store on Key West and bought a few items for breakfast. In summary, I would have given the resort five stars if it had decent service. I shrugged off the few negative reviews (even on the Westin's website) thinking they were just cranky. If you travel a lot for business or pleasure and stay at nice hotels, you are certain to be disappointed in the service at this resort. Adjust your expectations downwards, treat it like you are staying in a condo with a few amenities, enjoy the pool and the wonderful food and you will have a pleasant stay.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTruly a piece of Paradise\u201d", "Author": "claudiasil", "ReviewID": "UR124539452", "Content": "There are not enough words I can use to describe Sunset Key!

These cottages were built on top of dredged up sea floor so that the massive cruise ships can come and dock between you and Duval Street, definitely not romantic. The Navy used this landfill for holding the oil tanks, hence the true name Tank Island. The few guests we spotted were geriatric and probably are not filling out the favorable reviews you read here, so I highly suspect all the glowing reviews are fake and invented by the marketing machine from the Westin. In fact, I am pretty sure the reservation manager spends his time filling out fake reviews rather than helping customers. We travel quite a bit to Europe, Caribbean islands, Hawaii over the last couple of years and generally stay at five star properties. At the price we paid ($1000 per night), we were sadly misled on several points. First, I booked through Starwood SPG. I was told we were getting 35% off rack rate, so with taxes, a bargain $1,000 USD per night for 5 nights for a partial ocean view cottage. As a Gold SPG member I asked for upgrade at check in if available, but this request was not honored, the girl that checked us in wouldn't even check availability. I was tired from the flight, so I didn't make a fuss. Well, just out of curiosity, I checked online for the rate and found that I could have booked online through Westin and got $850 per night. So I was charged over the internet rate when I was suppose to get a \"deal?\" When I brought this to the attention of the front desk and then SPG, nobody is sympathetic, what would you expect, I am the sucker that got scammed. Then the Sunset Key Westin property itself, quality of Comfort Inn service dressed up in Westin garb. At the Four Seasons everyone smiles and knows your name. Here, everyone seems miserable, no smiles. The lone person \"tending\" the beach acts like he is doing you a favor and wish you would leave his beach and the dreadful pigeons that litter the small sad beach. The 50% gravel 50% sand beach is not combed at all, littered with cigarettes everywhere, really quite disgusting. We spent ten minutes and left. Nobody goes to Key West for the beach anyway, but this stretch of gravel is not worth walking on. The sand was supposedly brought in from the Bahamas, of course they had to, since this resort is built on landfill without natural sand. Well, over time the imported sand has eroded. Then the Sunset Key Westin cottages ... there is a serious ant problem. Small little critters came to visit as we checked in. They swarmed to any residue toothpaste, which was leftover from the last occupant. This tells you how much house keeping pays attention to details. We have a video of the ants swarming, which I will post to You Tube later. We called the front desk about the ants right away, and the girl was not surprised. But to our dismay, they also did not take care of it during our stay so the ants visited reliably every night. The Sunset Key Westin cottage is stocked with junk food at the standard gouge rate, just pick something up at CVS on Front Street and save a few hundred bucks. The room service and the restaurant Latitude are very average hotel food, the expected gouge price, with view of the neighboring petite landfill (just check Google earth to see for yourself), better you hike on to the island and have a real meal at A+B. The positives ... the ferry captains are nice guys, the pool is fairly empty as the island appeared fairly sparsely occupied. I learned this lesson the hard way, the waste of money really pales against the waste of time I spent at Sunset \"Tank Island\" Keys. The sun set on this mistake of land development sometime ago.

The island is one of the nicest most secluded, peaceful, secure experiences that we have found in our travels catering perfectly to our family. We try to visit two or three times a year and have both driven and flown to Key West to stay there. The family uses the island for their base of operations to explore Key West while I am working during the day. We have literally stayed in every one of the interior cottages near the pool, both 2 and 3 bedrooms and have seen every change from decorating to staff to facilities. It took some getting used to when they changed the pool from chlorine to salt and we miss several of the menu items that the pool bar Latitudes has gone through over the years but we have embraced all the changes and still love the experience. You can ask anything of the staff and they will attempt to do it. There are a great many Eastern Europeans employed on the island and there are some cultural gaffes which I think explain some of the complaints of other travelers. The room service is from their restaurant and is excellent. I do agree that the rooms are getting more and more pricey and during holidays can be prohibitive for the experience but that may be because we have seen the lower pricing. They do run specials on the website that lower the nightly stays. The rooms are not large or well appointed but who wants to stay in the room with where you are?

The cleaning service is really bad after the 2nd day, I'm not sure if they don't like the tips i left there or something, I see electric wire \"suddenly\" appear on my carpet after they cleaned our room, let alone the choclate wraps were still in the snacks basket on the day we check out...(August 12th 2011). Also on Wed August 10th 2011, a guy barged in and come up halfway of the stairs to ask us if we need service at around 9am... (check out time is 11am... ) I am not a frequent traveller, not sure if that's normal, but I havent have that experience before and I found it very rude. The beach... it's beautiful but it's WAY TOO SMALL, you can't swim in that beach, which is next to the ferry dock as the other user saigeey pointed out, and there are lots of broken shells and rocks near the water. The pool guy was cleaning the sides of the pool trying to remove the black mold according to him, but I was upset he has to do it at 10am where almost 15 ppl including kids were in the pool.... he did nicely told me those white powder he used is similar to chlorine which will not hurt our skin if small amount was used, but we decided to move to the beach instead. One bright spot for this hotel is the restaurant, the Lobster bisque was the best I've ever tasted. Overally, I paid 600USD a night and I think it's not worth it, unless you think the ferry ride and nice atmosphere is worth 600USD, hotel is beautiful, but the room is not that luxury as I expected.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DFW", "Title": "\u201cAs Great as Ever\u201d", "Author": "acesn28", "ReviewID": "UR116170399", "Content": "I took my wife for her birthday, along with 3 other couples for a 5 day stay at Sunset Key guest cottages.

You don' have to track someone down for your bags; it is all taken care of by the staff. When we walked in our cottage there was a huge basket of flowers, a card, and Champaign (the champagne I requested and paid for) on the table for my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. It was like everyone that worked there knew it my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday and went out of their way to tell her. 2 of the maids were headed back to Jamaica and stopped by to give her a hug and a sincere Happy Birthday. The island itself is beautiful. Each Cottage, the pool, the beach and even the walkways are incredibly manicured and maintained. The beach is amazing by Key West standards, easily one of the best beaches there, and I have never seen it crowded. Swimming or sitting in the hot tub at night you can see millions of stars through the palm trees swaying in the wind. Beside the service, one of the best things about the island is how secluded it is. It is nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of Key West and Duval Street when you want. Of course, it is only a 15 minute ride to get back when you want the action too. Latitudes rivals any restaurant in the keys on service ambiance and quality; and no one has a better view of the sunset. The surf and turf was my personal favorite entree, but the Wagyu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 flank steak and the Mahi were amazing too. We also found the food from the pool restaurant to be great.

My wife and I love this place. We traveled with her parents on this trip. Sunset Key is an amazing little island, it is a 10 minute ferry ride to Key West. We would stay on the island all day and then go into town for dinner at night. The Island landscaping is superb, they are always trimming and watering and planting it really is a lush tropical island makes it feel more secluded than it is. The views for Sunset are better than anywhere on the actual Island of key west. The food at the restaurant for dinner or for lunch is excellent not cheap, but great food and you get what you pay for. The bar tender at the bar Marcus (spelling may be wrong), is the best bar tender we have been around. Very professional friendly, my drinks were always great and I never even had to ask for another he just knew. My wife would just tell him kind of what she wanted and he would make it perfect every time. He is the kind of employee that most companies would dream to have. I hope they appreciate his service as much as we did. Only big problem for me was the concierge (One person to be exact). I had called her and told her that we were getting in early the next day and wanted to know if we could get an early check in. She told me that we could check in at 12:00 as she knew the party that was staying in our cottage was leaving earlier., (This was the day before we got there). We get to the Island at 12 and she greets us, I explain that I talked to her on the phone and she tells me that she did not say 12, but that our cottage would not be ready for another 2 hours. These cottages are not even 1000 sq ft, I am a home builder and have cleaned hundreds of houses I could have cleaned the cottage in 30 minutes. We ended up waiting for 2-1/2 hours for our cottage. Once we got to our cottage, I went around and looked to see how many cottages were vacant. I would say that over 30% of the cottages (low end) were vacant, but they made us wait for 2-1/2 hours after traveling all day. This would be ok if I was staying at a $200 per night hotel but not a $1000 per day resort. She did not care and was flat out rude to me. Further more our luggage was lost by our airline and I explained to her that we needed some assistance with this matter. She did nothing to help, she did not even make a phone call, I watched her for an hour sit at her desk online. She did not even call housekeeping to try and speed up the process. After this our trip was great, until we had to deal with the concierge on our last day. Our flight did not leave key west until 6:00 pm so I called and asked her if we could check out at 2:00 pm to enjoy our last day there. She said no way we had to be out by 12. I went to the office to ask her about this, she told me they could not and that the house keeping manager and told her she could not have any late checkouts today. I asked her if I could speak to the manager of housekeeping. She reluctantly called her and the manager came to the office I explained my circumstance and she said no problem. I recognized her, because she was the old concierge and was great at her job. I can't believe that Sunset Key hired this concierge as she has no clue to what she is doing. I will go back but will talk to a manager before I book another trip. We stay at Westin Resorts all the time and love them, and get treated better at much cheaper Westins than Sunset Key. Great place that I will go back to but this one person was horrible. I would like to know what Justin's response is to this.

Unfortunately, anyone who has stayed at other high-end properties (Four Seasons, Ritz, etc) will quickly see that Sunset Key does not offer a luxury experience. First, the good stuff: The island itself is gorgeous and the cottages are nice enough. The food was fantastic. In 7 days I don't think I had a bad meal. Now, the not-so-good stuff: The resort seemed woefully understaffed. One of the biggest issues was the lack of full-time staff at the pool and at the beach. Both areas were very \"do it yourself.\" Get your own towels, find your own chair, etc. I've never had to do that at similarly-priced hotels, but no big deal. I can do that. The problem is, however, that this allows for lots of \"chair saving\" to the extreme. The resort was very full and several parties were \"saving\" beach chairs by throwing magazines on them at 8 am and then returning several hours later when they were ready for a dip. One day I counted over 15 chairs that clearly were not being used, and yet they were being \"saved\" by a single flip-flop or People magazine. As a result, some days we literally could not find an open chair at the pool or beach. I would expect this sort of thing if we stayed at a mid-priced hotel on the mainland, but here we were paying over $1,300/night and my family of 3 had to share one chair some days. We brought this issue up with 2 different staff members (one at the pool and one at the front desk) but nothing ever changed. And yet if the pool & beach had full-time staff setting people up with towels, clearing chairs when people left, etc then it wouldn't be an issue. Instead, they had one guy intermittently standing by the towels (he split his time between the pool & beach) and the poolside restaurant employees picking up the slack when they had time. Another pool/beach issue, was a lack of towels period. If you were lucky enough to get a chair, you might or might not have a towel because half the time the towel caddy was empty. And because there was never anyone working at the pool, it was impossible to get any assistance. On two occasions we had to ask the poolside restaurant staff and one time my husband had to call the front desk from his cell phone. Each time we wait over 45 minutes before any towels actually appeared. The restaurant also seemed very understaffed. While the food was delicious, service was slow and unpredictable. During one particularly slow morning, we were told that our waiter had actually gone to deliver a room service meal and that's why we hadn't seen him in a while. Really?? On one of the busiest weeks of the year, why do you have waiters splitting their time between serving restaurant guests and delivering food to the cottages? One last issue I'll mention had to do with boxed lunches. We had booked a seaplane trip to the Dry Tortugas one day and I decided to order boxed lunches from the restaurant. The dining guide indicated that the lunches must be ordered 24 hours in advance, so I made sure to do this. I explained to the person taking the order that we needed them at 8:45 am sharp because we needed to be on the first boat out in order to make our seaplane departure time. That morning at 8:30 am I reminded the hostess at the restaurant (while we were eating breakfast) that I was picking up boxed lunches and needed them by 8:45. She said \"sure, no problem.\" At 8:45 we settled our breakfast tab and I approached her to grab the lunches. She asked me to wait a minute while she checked in the back. Then she came back out and said they were still making them! I ordered them 24 hours in advance and even gave them a reminder at 8:30! In the end, they got them to us at 8:55 and then we ran with them down the pier to catch the boat before it left. Why was this even an issue? I just don't understand. So those were some of the bigger problems we dealt with while staying on Sunset Key. In general, it just did not have the service you would expect at a luxury property. Everything just seemed so inconsistent and stuff was constantly falling through the cracks. While we were there, I read the other reviews here and noticed that the management frequently responded to criticism by saying \"you should have spoken to someone here and we could have made things better\" so my husband did walk down to the desk to discuss all these issues with a staff member. The woman was listened very genuinely and was very apologetic, but it didn't change anything. They sent us a fruit basket which was a nice gesture, but then the next day we were still fighting for chairs and/or towels again at the pool. There really wasn't much they could do. They couldn't hire more staff in the remaining time we had there, or re-train the ones they had, so obviously not much could be done. All in all, we had a great time on this trip because we love Key West and we loved the location of the resort.

We were looking for a place with a kitchen (bc of our dietary restrictions) and the cottages looked really good. We brought our assistant/caregiver with us. Prior to our arrival, I emailed the concierge a couple of times with questions. When I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any reply I called them directly. They apologized for not answering and promised to be more diligent. I requested a portable fan for each bedroom and removal of all scented products including toiletries from the cottage (we are sensitive to perfumes). We booked one of the four bedroom cottages at the hotel. They are both next to the restaurant. I requested the cottage that is further away from the restaurant because of the possible noise. I called a day before confirming all our requests. The day we arrived, we checked in at the Westin before going to the boat. We both have a chronic medical condition and have a difficult time walking even a short distance. They walked us to the boat ramp through a parking garage (not very scenic!). We both had to take a break sitting down on some old mattresses at the dump in the garage questioning our decision to come on vacation (we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been in couple of years). But after resting, we made it to the boat and finally got to the other side! There we were met with a golf cart that took us to our cottage. We got the one next to the restaurant in spite of my request! We thought the other cottage was already booked for the stay, but every day that passed we saw nobody in the other cottage. So, that was definitely disappointing. For the other requests: they did place portable fans in every room, but did not remove any toiletries which were pretty smelly! The four bedroom cottages opened in April of 2010. Our cottage looked brand new. There was one bedroom downstairs and 3 bedrooms upstairs. It had a very nice kitchen with everything you needed to cook your meals. I cannot comment on the housecleaning as we only used them to change towels and grab garbage. The cottage had a small pool in the back with a fountain. The fountain was pretty loud (probably built to block the sound from the neighboring restaurant), but they were able to turn it off when we requested. Also, the other cottage has a better backyard; more space and gets much more sun in the winter than ours. We had a huge palm tree blocking a lot of the sun. The food at the hotel was delicious. We had one dinner and 2 lunches at their restaurant and the quality was really good. Room service was super fast and they were able to accommodate our requests with no problem. The menu though didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change for the whole stay so it would have been nice to have more options. The spa was right next to the cottage. I got an updo and mani/pedi. Both services were excellent. The spa carries Jane Iredale make up which I was really happy to see as it is one of the more natural lines out there. It also carried some vegan hair brand though I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name of it. We went to the public pool once. The pool area is quite large with lots of seating and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bar in the area. One complaint I have is the loud music being played at the pool area. It is not very conducive to relaxation. Plus everyone in this day and age has their own ipod if they want to listen to music! The beach area is very nice with lots of lounge chairs and little huts to provide shade. However, I do have one complaint. The shuttle boat that comes every half hour to the island goes right next to the beach and you get a nice whiff of gas fumes every time that happens! On the same point, while we were at the pool at the cottage you could smell the gas fumes depending on the wind direction. So we had to go back inside the cottage every time the boat came. For the last 3 days of our trip, the wireless internet stopped working. The concierge couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give us any details on when it would be back. They did try to assure us that they would fix it fast, but even on the last day of our trip, it still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. The day before our departure I requested a wheel chair for my husband on the other side as he had a lot of trouble walking when we arrived. The concierge said no problem. When we checked out, I asked the concierge about the wheel chair and she said someone is waiting on the other side with it. So, I thought no problem. When we arrive on the other side, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wheel chair! I ask the boat captain and he says that nobody told him about the wheel chair. They start calling the hotel and it seems nobody knows what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening. There was a guy in a golf cart around the area and the boat captain asked him to drive us to the front of the hotel. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he works for the hotel. He looked like someone taking care of the broadwalk area.

The staff at the hotel and on the fairy were all very prompt and polite. All of our belongings were taken to and from our rooms, and nothing was ever lost, stolen or broken. The cottage was very comfortable (not even comparable to a hotel). The place was quite roomy and really felt like a home. Any problems (couple of minor things) were fixed with a simple phone call. The only thing I noticed was that the place could have used a couple of repairs/upgrades. For instance, the door frame to our room was falling apart. It wasn't really an issue, but it just seemed like it should be fixed, especially for the amount of money you pay to stay there. The Island was beautiful, and very relaxing. Though I did not get a chance to visit the pool or spa area, my wife and her friends absolutely loved it! They spent quite a bit of time at the pool and on the beach. My friends and I all went fishing off of the beach and on the docks. Fishing was great, as long as you had the right bait. One thing I absolutely did not like was the staff at the restaurant (Latitudes). The first night we all (all 3 couples) decided to place an order and pick it up to bring it back to the room. The first person we spoke to seemed pretty nice, but we could not understand him so we had to speak to a second individual. If I'm not mistaken, the next person on the phone was a manager? However, they were very rude to my wife and friend on the phone. Any questions that were asked, had a very short and rude answer. Simply asking about sides and portion sizes seemed to upset the manager. I'm sorry, but when I am spending right at $200 for dinner, I expect to be treated nicely in return. When my wife and her friend went to pick up the dinner, they were also treated very rudely in person by the woman (maybe manager?) that tended to them. As much as I hated to do so, we placed another order with them the next night and had room service deliver it to our cottage. That time, the staff were a little nicer to us (after having to complain previously). Even though we were treated better on the second night eating there, If we were not all so tired, we would have left the island and eaten elsewhere. In the end, we had a great time staying at the island. When we go back, I don't think that I will be able to stay at a regular hotel or bed and breakfast after being in such a nice comfortable place like one of the cottages. One other great thing about Westin is that they were able to refer my friends and I to a great fishing charter, Captain Bill with Giggling Tarpon.

The oceanfront cottages were Amazing! Jessica, one of the concierges made sure our stay would be a memorable one. I surprised my wife and her sister with a pre-arranged one hour in cottage Swedish massage. We were all surprised by a post massage delicacy; amazing strawberry dipped in chocolate platter. The masseuses were punctual, professional and fantastic! The Island was Immaculate filled with gorgeous variations of bougainvillea and other floral gems. There is always an oceanic breeze wherever you go; a subtle reminder of why you came in the first place. The pool/jacuzzi was very nice. The bar was great. The beach with its hammocks and soft sand was as good as it gets. Our cottage was impeccable and had all the amenities one can hope for. Key West Victorian Architecture, high ceilings throughout, 3 full bathrooms, ample sized bedrooms, full kitchen and living rooms. The daily breakfast wicker basket delivered to your front door contained a newspaper, fresh fruit, variety of danish/muffins and in our fridge we had bottles of freshly squeezed orange juice waiting for us each morning as well as coffee. What a great way to start the day! They are building a new facility for the Latitudes restaurant and a shopping arcade (looks to be ready in a couple of months). We did not experience any construction noise as others have indicated. The exterior of the new structure is completed that might explain why. Latitudes was magnificent (compliments to the chef), the ambience and food were 1st rate. On a side note, you must make it to Blue Heaven Cafe in Key West for Breakfast during your stay, well worth the wait! The ferry was very convenient (my girls loved it) and the entire staff throughout the Island was very friendly and helpful. Once you familiarize yourself with the schedule, you never have to wait. If you are looking for either a romantic getaway or just a quiet, serene family retreat this place is for you. Even though the Island views are incredible, I would still recommend watching the Sunset at Mallory Square, there is something spiritual about that place. The sidewalk entertainment, the aroma of fresh conch fritters, street music is second to none. Watching hundreds of people clap after the Sun goes down speaks for itself.

Our two- bedroom cottage overlooked the shore, with its' own hammock strung between two palm trees. Nothing was more satisfying or relaxing than laying in the breezy hammock watching the sailboats on the clear, bright blue waters of Key West. The hotel gardens and lawns are picture perfect with lush tropical flowers and greenery. The pool area is lovely as well, with a pretty waterfall and laid back atmosphere, where the drinks and appetizers are delicious (I highly recommend the stuffed shrimp!) and the wait staff friendly and accommodating. As for the cottage, the beds are comfortable, even luxurious and the place is well designed for relaxed enjoyment in an upscale setting. The launch that transport you back and forth to Key West is handy and available from morning to night, and the staff aboard the launch are friendly and helpful. The only downside of this hotel is that for the huge price of a room in April, the service was less than stellar. It wasn't what I would expect from a 4 star hotel. When we arrived, the woman showing us around and to our cottage stated that we wouldn't get a reservation that night at Latitudes, the only restaurant on the island and where we had planned to eat. It was \"slammed\" with reservations that night, according to her. We called anyway to check, and they got us in. Hmmm... The coffee pot in our room was broken and the coffee that was available was enough for two people only. There were four of us in this two bedroom cottage. When we called to report it, after first trying to make coffee in vain, the staff sounded indifferent and said they would send someone to look at it. (How about \"Sorry, we'll bring you a new one with enough coffee for 4 people\" or \"We'll send room service over with a pot of coffee\"-- like we thought you said you were going to do in the first place, but apparently we misunderstood!) Anyway, noone came with a new pot or anything else, so we called room service and we were charged $20 for a pot with exactly four very small cups of coffee in it. Gee thanks. The fresh muffins and fruit that came in the morning were wonderfully delicious, but the lack of coffee was annoying. That afternoon we received a new pot, but we had to again request enough coffee for four people. It's like this--the pot was a ten-cupper. The coffee pods each made one large cup, according to the package, and there were only two of them. They don't know that? They never looked? They can't figure out that a 10 cup coffee pot isn't really compatible with a one cup coffee pod? Or that four people need at least one pod each or they will be very disgruntled when the $20 pot of coffee shows up? It was very delicious coffee for $20, I must admit, but a four star hotel with a high price tag should do better. If this were Travelodge I wouldn't even comment on it, but for over $1200/night, it's worthy of comment. To be fair, the restaurant staff and poolside sevice staff were great. The problems seemed to be with the hotel's office staff, concierge and room service, which seemed indifferent and were sluggish to respond, and often had to be called twice for the same request. The result was less than impressive sevice at a beautiful, unique beach hotel in lovely Key West. If you can accept less than four star service, this hotel is memorable and enjoyable for it's beautiful location and well maintained, pretty cottages and grounds.

Overall, the physical property is great, but the service is not what it should be. Though it is expensive, I think it is worth it. I would have given the hotel five stars, except for the service. Let me start with the property itself. The island is beautiful, truly unique, and the cottages are very nice and spacious. Each morning you get a muffin basket around 8:30, which is nice. Internet is free in the rooms, and I found the prices of things (e.g., laundry, minibar, etc.) to be reasonable. The pool and beach are nice with towel and chair service, and neither was very crowded. There are tennis courts on the island and you can get racquets and tennis balls from the concierge. For any spa services or the fitness center, you have to go to the mainland Westin. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fitness center,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd however, are not really worthwhile. The fitness center is tiny (only a few machines), and there is no spa (only a small dinky massage room off the fitness center). The boat ride back and forth is fun, but make sure you pay attention to what time it is! The boat leaves on the hour and half hour from the island and on the 15\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and 45's from the mainland. If you miss the boat, you will have to sit around for a half hour. After hours, you must call for the boat, but no big deal. The boat ride is about 5-6 minutes, and is quite fun. When you check-in, the bellmen take your luggage in a wrapped-up cart on the boat, and the concierge meets you and escorts you to your cottage. My biggest upset was the service. As other reviews have said, when you are paying over $1000/night, you expect things to be perfect. First, there seems to be a disconnect between the mainland Westin and Sunset key. Certain things are handled by the mainland, and some are handled by the staff on the island. In one situation, we booked a couples massage and it was completely screwed up. The mainland concierge told us that no second masseuse was available, so my wife decided to get a massage alone. Apparently, the concierge was able to find a second masseuse but forgot to call us back to tell us about this. My wife only found this out when she showed up for the massage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like I could just run downstairs and join my wife, given the boat schedule! When I talked to the mainland concierge about the situation (who arranged it), they seemed indifferent and didn't care. The concierge on Sunset Key appeared to care, but only offered me a few hundred Starwood points (which amounts to about $5). A second incident came when I asked the concierge to put rose petals on the bed on my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. They were able to accommodate me, but they managed to completely blow the surprise for my wife when they called the room about it!!! You have to be kidding!!! Though, to be fair, once they actually did the rose petals, it came out very, very well (candles, rose petals throughout the cottage, etc.) Lastly, and I realize this won't apply to 99% of the people reading this, but I had a box delivered to me for work while staying there. I had proof that FedEx delivered it, but none of the staff could find it for two days. The mainland kept blaming the island, and vice versa. Completely disorganized. I realize most of these sound like nits, but when you stay at a place like this for a special occasion (wife's birthday), and you pay the high rates, you expect certain things. And, when you do bring it to their attention, you expect a sincere response, not a blow off. I notice that the management responds to these reviews on occasion.

Great secluded location and wonderful accomodations. We had reserved a 1 bedroom garden view cottage and got a one story locked out unit right next to the pool called \"Blue Heron\". From the kitchen and the porch, there was a limited but nice view of the ocean. The cottage was great but the service was a little weak. Nothing to get concerned over, just not 5 star service. For example, the kitchen faucet leaked, the floors were never swept or cleaned during our stay, housekeeping didn't leave additional shampoo, conditioner, etc. each day unless you specifically asked, no turn down service (although they do drop off chocolate and water). The pool was perfect. My husband & I were traveling with our 2 year old and loved the 0 degree/ beach style entry on the shallow end. He could play in the pool while we laid out in the sun and watched him. The temperature in the pool was sufficient. The other good thing about the pool was that it seems like it is almost split into 2 sections. In the shallow end, the people with kids gathered. In the deeper end (still only like 4 foot) the adults/couples gathered. It seemed like my kid splashing around and giggling was less of a bother to those who wanted the privacy because of the seperation (maybe they would disagree ha ha). Also, they have float mats for the pool which were very nice too. The service at the pool was also subpar. No towel attendant, no waiter until you go order at the bar and then they'll come out but won't pick up your dishes afterward. Again, not a huge deal, but definately not what would be expected from a nice full service resort.

Beautiful grounds and landscaping. The beach was as nice as it gets in Key West. A little rocky but not too bad. It was great to swim in the ocean, and have a gorgeous ocean view. Our first cottage was a two-bedroom; very nice and clean and a beautiful porch and view. A little raggedy; the upholstered furniture stained and aged. The kitchen appliances dated. Bed ultra-comfortable and bath big and clean with excellent bath products. It was hot as hades, but the ceiling fans on the porch made it very nice to sit outside and enjoy the view and ambience. Our second cottage (we had to move because of flight problems and a lack of vacancy in our first cottage) was a three bedroom that was spacious but dark and very very much in need of a makeover. Carpet stained, furniture stained and the overall impression was that a few years ago this place was nice, but now it is just plain tired. The biggest problem was the uneven service. At over a grand a night, off season, one would expect stellar service. Not to be; room service limited, and very slow, not to mention outrageousy expensive. The food was very good however. Housekeeping late in the day and not up to standards of other 4-5 star properties. The mini-bar guy was a joke. He literally was absent some days. You may think this unimportant but there is nothing to be had on that island after 11pm in terms of alcohol or snacks. They have 24 hour roomservice that the security guy is in charge of!!!!! and the times I tried to reach him, the Westin said that had to page him. But he cannot serve any alcohol and I never heard back. So, if you miss the minibar guy you are essentially without an evening cocktail or beer. We were there 10 days and 5 out of 10 we saw no minibar guy. Apparently he is from the Westin across the water and he is only available a couple of hours a day for Sunset Key. They will say it is because of a \"privacy please\" sign but that is a blatant lie. The beach guy was very rarely there and provided very little service. I had to go to the beach hut and get towels out of the linen bags that were in the back. Every day. The fact that they charge 25.00 per person for a resort fee should assure that there is good beach service. The pool scene however, was terrific. There was no pool service per se, as far as anyone laying out towels etc. but the pool bar /restaurant was run by two very hard-working nice guys. Jan and Marcus. Stellar service and friendly. Oh, and back to the service; we had lunch at Latitudes our first day there to the tune of almost $200 and our waiter wore a filthy shirt and was obviously bored. Almost like we were an imposition.

They installed wireless internet in the cottages while we were there which made it nice to not have to be wired to the wall with my laptop. It was great to have a 3rd bathroom.

The only other inconvenience was the electronic lock system on the doors. It took a little while to figure out how to lock the doors correctly and our keys had to be reset a few times during the week. I think part of the problem might have been phones deactivating the keys??? The pool and beach were both great and not too busy which was nice. The Flippers bar was perfect for lunch most days and pretty reasonable priced for a resort. Lattitudes was great for dinner one night. The shuttle boat was fine to get to Key West several times a day. I only missed it once and had to wait a half hour to get off of the island. The only real complaint with the resort is the exercize facility. There is only a workout facility at the Key West hotel so you have to take the shuttle to get to it.

Each morning the hotel provides a complimentary basket filled with fresh fruit and muffins which was a really nice touch.

Immediately after checking in, the people for turndown service came into the room and were asked to come back 45 minutes later after we had a chance to get settled and had gone to our scheduled dinner. Instead, they showed up about 20 minutes later and let themselves in while we were showering and getting ready for dinner.

It was their quiet period, but for 2 days we were the only ones at the pool, and the beach never had more than 10 people on it. The waiters came around with free drinks, free fruit kebabs, glasses of ice water etc - nothing was too much trouble for them.

We would sit out most nights after staggering home from the Key West restaurants and bars and enjoy a nightcap while looking at the ocean. The launch was running every 30 minutes, which was never a problem. We were only given a safety briefing once - which was when the coastguard were patrolling the waters. This may be why other reviewers were asked for i.d. The launch was air conditioned and very comfortable. We went to Key West 19 years ago, and it has definitely \"tamed down\" a little since then.

After seeing an episode of the Travel Channel's \"Great Hotels\" that featured Sunset Key, my husband and I decided to give it a try as a special getaway before the birth of our first baby. Sunset Key seemed to fit the bill for the things we wanted. We wanted a unique, private, upscale, quiet place (not some high rise hotel with throngs of people everywhere) with tropical weather, a beach, a great restaurant, a pool for days we didn't want to go to the beach, and we wanted the destination to be on the mainland. Once in Key West, it only took about 5-10 minutes to ride the shuttle boat from the Westin to Sunset Key Island. It's a beautiful ride with friendly crew members. There are only 37 cottages on the island for guests (not including the residences on the island) which made us feel like we were 2 of a small number of guests. It wasn't crowded at all...and we liked that very much. We stayed in cottage 701 (Sanctuary -each cottage has a name) The first night we were there, our bedroom air conditioner conked out. I called the front desk, someone was there in less than 2 minutes and replaced the entire unit. They also opened up the 2nd bedroom of the cottage just in case to make sure I had a cool room to sleep in that night (in case the replacement was faulty)! That means a lot to a woman who is 6 months pregnant, believe me! (We rented a one bedroom - so the other half of the cottage that included the 2nd bedroom was locked and closed off) I was impressed with their promptness and professionalism. I was told twice by the concierge, \"We just want you to be satisfied.\" The next day we got a basket of muffins and pound cake with fruit for breakfast with a newspaper. I liked having that each morning. The fridge was well stocked and there was also a basket of goodies on the dining table to choose from. We liked having the kitchenette, a TV in both the bedroom and the living area, and having an extra bathroom besides just the one off the bedroom to use. I liked being able to fill out a grocery list and have our groceries shopped for by someone before we even arrived. Nice touch! I read negative comments about Sunset Key beach service before but we did not experience anything bad at all. We found the beach employees to be very attentive, we did not have to wait for towels or lounger pads, and we were asked many times if we wanted drinks or food from the restaurant. One bit of advice is to buy Aqua socks or beach shoes (not flip flops) to wade into the ocean. The beach, beginning at the water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge, is very rocky and I saw many people painfully wade in and out wishing they'd bought something to protect their feet! The beach is small but nice......the only thing I wish is that Westin guests were not allowed on the Sunset Key beach. I think Sunset Key guests are paying prices that should give them beach exclusivity. We never used the pool but did drop by to look at it. It was very nice and well landscaped. The one restaurant on the island was wonderful. We ordered room service many times and also ate in the restaurant as well. We found the food to be excellent and got great service with the exception of one rude waiter one night. The rest of the time, the staff couldn't have been any nicer or more friendly. My favorite was the lobster duo and mixed green salad. Yummy! We took the boat shuttle over to Key West several times. We were glad it ran every half hour. Being pregnant, I couldn't participate in Key West bar drinking, but my hubby and I had a great time going to different restaurants and touring. Key West reminded us of a whole city of Bourbon Streets (New Orleans). That's what was great about Sunset Key. You can take the shuttle boat and be involved in all the hub bub of Key West but go back to Sunset Key for peace and quiet. And you can do as much or as little as you like. Other points: I liked the large showers, comfy mattress and fluffy soft bed linens. The robes were wonderful as well. We liked the turn down service - they were always cordial and friendly if we happened to be there. The concierge was always a big help when I called them and have a computer in their office for guests to use to check email. They also have DVD's for guests as well. I liked the gift shop and again experienced friendly service there. We liked coming in every evening to find our dishes washed in the dishwasher including the coffee pot. We also liked having the outside showers by the back porch of our cottage to rinse away beach sand from ourselves and our clothing/shoes before going inside each evening. My husband certainly appreciated the staff checking with him to see if he needed restock of the alcoholic drinks provided in our cottage as well. Only one other maintenance occurrence happened....we had a toilet that wouldn't flush one day and a sink that was clogged. Again, after calling the front desk, someone was there within minutes to fix both things within a 30 minute period. I would recommend Sunset Key to anyone.....my husband and I thought it was such a special place and we came home totally rested and recharged. We loved spending late evenings on our cottage porch in the rocking chairs feeling the ocean breeze blow. I was so sad to leave! We will remember our babymoon at Sunset Key as being a very special one!
