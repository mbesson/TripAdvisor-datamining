{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Bargain Basement Accommodation For the bargain price we paid for this room, I'd like to give this property a glowing review. Given the rate of $95 in the summer months, with internet and parking included, it's hard to complain. But, alas, it's often true that you get what you pay for. The suite is just basic, very basic, and that's what you're paying for. All the furnishings are quite dated but adequate. It was great having a full kitchen for cooking, but the cooking utensils, plates, cups, glasses and silverware were all very limited. It's a good thing we brought along our own glasses! Of course, the number of utensils and such may vary from room to room and if we had asked, we could have perhaps been offered more forks, more glasses, or best of all, perhaps even a serviceable cutting knife. If you're planning to cook, check out your kitchen cupboards right away and ask if you can get additional items which were definitely lacking in our particular suite.As others have mentioned, the location is great, especially if you're specifically visiting the U-District, and there are numerous ethnic restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores within easy walking distance. The University Motel Suites is definitely a throwback to another era when compared it to the surrounding modern multi-story apartment complexes.I would recommend this hotel if you're on a tight budget and aren't looking for the deal of the century. It's old, it's dated, and it has that musty apartment building odor that just didn't do it for me, but might not be noticeable to the next guy!", "Date": "Jul 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR392610897", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Patcee"}, {"Content": "Great value I stayed here with my teenage sons. The suite is very spacious and well equipped. Shops are 2 minutes walk away in quiet suburb of Seattle. The staff were friendly and helpful. Next time I stay there I'll request not to be near the laundry though, as the smell was a bit strong sometimes. This hotel is very well situated - only a few minutes off the main freeway.", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR258521738", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nzbiggles"}, {"Content": "I'm sending all my friends Clean, convenient, quiet, everything in the suite works.Basically an apartment building run as a hotel. The suites cost less than you would pay for an average hotel room (I paid $81 on the Fourth of July weekend).The colours and appliances would all have been chic forty years ago, but everything worked just fine.I rattled around in my unit; this place would be great for a group of people or somebody staying a while. It's very well equipped.People who live in tony suburbs might find the neighbourhood a little gritty, but my friends and I thought it was great. A real urban vibe. Tons of restaurants, coffee shops, and brew pubs on the University Drive strip nearby.I'd go back anytime. My only fear is that the area is gentrifying and this building may not be around forever.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR209960701", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kalamalkared"}, {"Content": "Great Value Synopsis:Rates: Easily 1/3 less than anything else in townRooms: Enormous (they are all converted apartments) with complete kitchensLocation: Quiet, less than five minutes from I-5, walking distance to several movie theatres and two grocery storesCaveats: There are two other hotels with University in their name nearby, both much more expensive. The website here is [--]Full Details:From the outside the property looks like the vintage 1960's/70's apartment building it once was. . .the entry hallway is equally unprepossessing, with slightly faded carpet and a color scheme that runs to harvest-gold and avocado green with the kind of paneling you associate with your old rumpus room.When you walk into your room, however, you realize what a fantastic bargain this place is. Each room is, literally, an apartment, with a full kitchen completely stocked with utensils and equipment, a large dining area, spacious living room and a bedroom with enough closet space for a family of four. The bathroom in my place had brown and green linoleum and lime green ceramics, but it was spotlessly clean and everything worked perfectly. The beds are great and the walls have the original artwork--you'll see what I mean. It's comfortable, quiet, and if you order a suite you'll have enough room for four people.The location is perfect: you are two blocks from a Safeway and across the street from a large drugstore, but are on a quiet side street with little traffic. The entire University District is just four blocks away, and you can be on I-5 in less than five minutes. This is perfect for a longer stay, of course, but since the rates are easily $20 to $40 less per night than other hotels in town, it is a bargain for anyone. You will pay less than anywhere else, but you will get MUCH more.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR690858526", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kenai_joe"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d618927-r17770240-University_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html", "HotelID": "618927", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
