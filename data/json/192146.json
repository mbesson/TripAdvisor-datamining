The location is fantastic. A fairly residential area near enough the Gloucester Road Tube Station, a variety of excellent restaurants, several groceries and a walk to Hyde Park. (Try Rocca di Papa for dinner - just a 5 minute walk. Wonderful service, prices and food and the hotel staff made reservations for our party of 14.) The lobby is small, but comfortable and WiFi works there. The rooms are a reasonable size for Europe, but VERY basic. No extras like additional pillows. The windows open, and we needed that the last night as London was unseasonably HOT. We really were very uncomfortable in the almost 90 degree heat, so think about that if you are going to be there in the summer. Fortunately, it is a fairly quiet neighborhood and the street noise was not terrible, but the heat was oppressive! The triples we had our teenagers in were very well set up and a decent size.. Bathrooms are basic and anyone with mobility issues will need to take care getting in and out of the bathtub. The multiple, very heavy fire doors in all the hallways make going to and from various areas of the hotel or getting to the small lift or stairs a bit of a challenge for anyone who is not fairly agile and able to push them open. (My 80 year old parents had to really push to get through.) We used the stairs mostly as the lift is small and slow. Fortunately we had some big teenage boys with us to haul luggage! Breakfast is cereals, toast, some fruit, cheese, yogurt, juices, coffee and tea. Very adequate and convenient. Overall, for the price and location it is a great choice. If you are looking for extra frills such as fluffy pillows, A/C, more than the BBC on the TV, WiFi in your room, you will need to spend a LOT more cash in London.

It was never too hot (windows opened in any case, so either way it would have been fine) or too cold. The beds were comfortable and I slept well.

The carpet was old, worn and none too clean. The bathroom was adequate, but tiny. Some genius installed a shelf/towel rack contraption at head level in the very narrow shower. I can't remember how many times I hit the side of my head on it. Needless to say, no real shower, just a hose type handheld shower, with some hooks on the wall to hold it. The bed was my main complaint. I like firm beds and have one at home. This bed, though, was just plain HARD! It was so old that the fabric on the box spring was torn, the wood frame clearly visible. Needless to say, I did not sleep well while there! I asked if there was an internet connection available for guests (I left my laptop in order to not have to deal with two carry-ons). I was told by the front desk clerk that they'd had one, but somebody had broken it. Which left me thinking that, considering the prices they charged, what was their excuse for not immediately replacing it? As stated, unless I get a specific recommendation from a trusted source, from now on I'm sticking to the American chains when in Europe. I bet they're no longer American to begin with, being open to investors from all over. And better to pay a bit more and know what you're getting. Perhaps when they start feeling the pinch of lost business, the locals will start offering a bit of quality to go along with the high pricing.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foshan, China", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location\u201d", "Author": "bookowl1000", "ReviewID": "UR75520730", "Content": "Excellent location in Kensington.

The lift was very small and 3 of us with bags could not fit in at the same time. Our room was light and spacious but was dated and shabby. It looked like it had not been decorated since the 80s; flowery bedspreads and curtains, pink walls with a flowery border, fake plastic marble in the bathroom. There was a lack of attention to detail, e.g. tv with fuzzy picture, a bedside light not working, marked and chipped paint work, tarnished taps, rusty plug holes and the enamel in the bath was coming away. The more you looked, the more you spotted. There were only two, quite thin pillows and I had to put a folded bath towel under my pillow to get comfortable. I did then sleep well as the bed was clean and comfy. We had a room overlooking the road but there was no noise as there was very little traffic. There was a hairdrier at the dressing table. A self-service breakfast consisting of cereal, toast, and yoghurt was included in the room price. Cooked breakfast was available at an additional coast, e.g. fried egg \u00c2\u00a31.50, full cooked \u00c2\u00a37.50. There were papers available to read over breakfast. There is a bar near the lobby that serves bar food. There were no tea and coffee facilities in the room, which is unusual for a British hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to someone after a romantic getaway or those who like luxury; if however you just want a place to lay your head in an excellent location and would rather spend your money when out and about, then this hotel is for you as it is good value for where you are staying.

By London standards the room rates are reasonable; I paid \u00c2\u00a375 per night for a single room. The multilingual reception staff was most helpful and friendly.

They were helpful with concerns about the room safe and the 110v electrical outlet. Kudos to the staff! The breakfast buffet was good but not incredible: coffee, tea, juice, cereal, toast, etc. Hot toast and soft margarine was a nice change from the cold toast and frozen butter often served at breakfast in London. About six cereal choices, but no Weetabix (probably the most popular cereal in Britain). Only two juice choices, orange and apple. And no croissants. I've had worse breakfasts in Britain, but I've had better, too. Then there's the lift (elevator) -- possibly the world's slowest, and definitely one of the smallest. It says capacity is six persons, but surely that's a joke, right? Then there's the beds. I stayed in two different rooms on separate stays at the beginning and end of a three-week visit. Very small -- what would be called a twin size mattress in the US. And unquestionably the least comfortable beds of the seven hotels I stayed in during the trip. No, make that downright lumpy and uncomfortable. The room itself was tiny by American standards, but not unlike other single rooms in Britain. Lighting was adequate for reading and writing. Low-flow shower head and water-conserving toilet were annoying. Calls to British 0800 numbers from phone in room were free. No access charge, no per-minute charge.Unusual among UK hotels.

My biggest bugbear in a hotel room is an inadequate shower, and this was a poster model - an over-the-bath extension with calcified holes in the head and a wildly veering temperature.

The rooms were clean and well serviced every day. The buffet breakfast included in the rate was dismal, but you can't really complain considering that it was free. The location is GREAT, and there are a lot of good places to get food, even for those on a tight budget, such as Tesco's. In all, I probably would consider paying a little more to stay in a better hotel, although this isn't a terrible choice.

We always try to stay in a different area. This time Chelsea/Kensington seemed the right choice. We generally book our hotels over the internet. However Cranley Gardens Hotel turned out to be a bit of a disappointment: it is worn out and needs some redecoration. The breakfast was included in the room price, and a good thing too - it was certainly not worth spending extra money on. Very basic and in our opinion the breakfast room needed a good cleaning. We had asked for a twin room at the back (quiet) and got what we wanted. Matrasses could do with some overhaul and the blankets were a bit worn - room and bathroom equipment were pretty basic. But, on the other hand, the room was large to London standards. Reception staff was friendly and helpful but staff at breakfast could have been a bit more cheerful - this is certainly appreciated in the morning ! Location is great though, very near to 2 tube stations (South Kensington and Gloucester Road) and to the Museums & Harrods, and lots of restaurants.

The hotel provides excellent value for the cost. The location is great, as is the staff. If the provided breakfast isn't to your liking there are many inexpensive options within a 5 minute walk of the front door. Our rooms were clean with some rough spots around the edges. The mattresses were lumpy, but we were expecting that based on other reports (we were in 106 and 108, the connecting rooms.) We did take our own pillows, which made a tremendous difference. If you don't want to blow your budget on a bed consider this hotel. We wanted the kids to experience quaint and quirky; we didn't want them to feel like they were staying at Holiday Inn in Orlando. Eddie Manning (Google will find him) collected us from Gatwick and delivered us to the hotel with the utmost efficiency and reversed the trip at the end of our stay. If you are traveling as a group of 3 or more he works out to be about the cost of the Gatwick Express with a cab on the city end.
