The secret is I paid too much, not really, I guess it was worth $79, maybe. First was the check-in, a woman who talked entirely too much took almost 20 minutes to check us in to two pre-paid rooms and much to my surprise there is a $7 per night charge to park your car!!! When I asked why I was told it was because they were close to the airport. I was then told the restaurant had been shut down a couple days earlier and there would be only donuts instead of the usual \"continental breakfast\"....hmmm......do I think of the Health Department??? The beds are clean and the view of the bay is on the 5th and 6th floor maybe NOT on the 4th or below. I noticed they sold the bay view as an extra so thought I'd mention something. The ice maker on the 5th floor was broken and the one by the pool dispensed ice 1 cube at a time, drop on make on drop one make one. Gave me time to look at the pool that changed colors at night and was very cloudy during the day. The room service made the bed. and emptied the trash cans, that's it, no replacement coffee, no replacement wash clothes or towels, the old paper coffee cups were left where they lay. No replacements, I wanted some water so I went looking for an ATM and was told rather sarcastically \" we are located right behind a bank\" so I walked to the bank for cash, then I had to ask for change, the woman didn't have access to the \"drawer\" so the older gentleman had to look, of course we were interuping him from his trip to where ever he was so we did have to wait.......ok no change......go to the bar Railey's very loud techno music, very nice bartenders and younger 20's people dressed to the nine's ready to party, they did look like thugs but we didn't feel threatened however I was glad the car was parked in the garage, which by the way had a gate that was closed once and nobody seems to be responsible for opening it, I guess that is why it was only closed once. Overall, it was OK but a constant joke. The halls smell like something I can't put my finger on. The bedding was clean, no bugs. The rooms, not so much, the service, not so much, did I mention after all that trouble the bottle of water was $2 and finally the biggest laugh was the paint job, our room door and the bathroom door were painted a dark maroon, only one coat, kinda like a 4 yr old did it.

The hotel was dismal and depressing, but I tried to cheer myself up by saying it was just one night. I was so wrong! Just as I was falling asleep, I felt something crawling on my arm. I was horrified to see a bedbug. Looking around, I then saw that there were bedbugs everywhere: in the seams of the mattress, on the sheets, on the headboard, in the grout of the bathtub, on the desks, and (worse) infiltrating my suitcases. What a horrific experience! I caught the bedbugs in a ziploc bag and showed the desk clerk. Of course he was apologetic and vaguely helpful, but he wasn't able to contact the manager. When I got home, I had to spend days doing laundry to decontaminate my clothes, and I had to hire a bedbug expert to come in and inspect my house to make sure the bedbugs hadn't spread. If this experience isn't enough of a turn-off, there's more: I then asked the hotel to reimburse me for the expenses I had to pay because of this bedbug infestation, and they wouldn't return my calls. They wouldn't even apologize, much less own up to this problem. Even if (let's emphasize, *if*) they've gotten rid of the bedbugs by now, I can hardly see why anyone would want to stay here. Maybe if threadbare carpets, clunky elevators, scummy pools and funky smells are your thing, this would be your kind of place. But don't forget that if you come home with unexpected insect guests, what starts out cheap comes out expensive in the end. Every hotel these days has to deal with bedbugs, but the difference becomes what kind of support they provide customers if it happens, and what kind of system they have to prevent outbreaks like that.

This was the first family vacation with all 7 of us and I thought I was just going to break down and cry the moment we walked in! When we first walked in the rooms where so hot you immediately started sweating and smelly. The TV in the living room was gone and they did not know when it was going to be replaced. I will list the Pros and Cons for this place: Pros -close to Sea World and downtown / Zoo -Large rooms for a family of 7 -Quiet (for being next to the elevator) -Pretty comfortable beds -did not see any bugs like the other reviews Cons - AC did not cool the rooms even after being on for 4 hours (on high) straight, had to call the front office and get 2 fans so that we could sleep in there. Had to put my makeup on in the car because the room was to hot and all you would was sweat. - No fan in the bathroom / very humid and the bath tub filled up when you took a shower and would take an hour to drain. -Stunk very badly (like a huge wet dog) and the carpet was always wet around the bathroom which made the smell even worse -$225.00 a night for 3 nights (was a complete waste of money) -Could never use the pool because of the time they close it (9pm) -Was not a clean room when we walked in and things stuck to the end tables and you had to rip them off, destroying whatever it was -the windows did not open so you could not get any fresh air -the parking garge was horrible and you had to pay 5.00 a day, which they did not tell us until we checked out. I could not figure out why they charged for parking, it is not like there is a lot of things around there and they were trying to keep the garge for hotel guests only and there was no security down there. And there were low hanging pipes all over the garge and there were a couple that we almost hit with our mini van as the hung down so low. -It would take years of renovations before this hotel would be up to code. -refrig. did not work -nasty and horrible furniture -no door on the bedroom leading to the living room, had to change in the corner of the room where our 5 boys could not see me (no privacy at all ) -only 1 bathroom for 7 people, had to go to the lobby to use the bathroom if someone else was using the room bathroom -no one asked us how our stay was when we check out or I would have given them and ear full. Just wanted to get out of there. We really should have left and went to another hotel!!!!!!!!!!! -Was not comfortable to come back to after being at the zoo and Seaworld for 14 hours. -Curtains had holes and cut marks in them -Carpet was wet around the AC unit and it looked like it was going to fall out of the wall. -Very few cable channels -had to share the tv with the kids because the other room was missing one Overall, this hotel is not worth any money and I would never stay here again no matter how much they fixed it up. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. This place really does need to be shut down and I might look into trying to get my money back ($764.00) based off of false advertising on their website.

We cautiously entered the foul smelling small dark box of the working elevator, and slowly arrived at our floor. The smell was nauseating. Our feet squished through the soggy carpet. Our hotel door looked as if a wild animal had clawed at it for at least several hours. The wet carpet continued throughout the room and their was moisture discoloration halfway up the walls.
