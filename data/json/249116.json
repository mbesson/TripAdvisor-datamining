The stuff are very helpful and try to do their best for you. The BAD thing is the internet is not free as compared to the surrounding hotels of the same star and the heating system was not working at all in my room and i was freezing and they couldn't even fix it. the decorations are nice but the hotel is old. the downtown is 10-15minutes walking from the hotel and the old city center of Venice can be reached by taking the bus from station behind the hotel and it will take you like 15minutes to reach there. for the arrival from airport, there is a bus stop in front of the hotel directly so you don't have to walk alot. overall its a nice place to save money and be in the middle position between downtown and Venice island.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arad, Romania", "Title": "\u201cVenice accomodation\u201d", "Author": "Georgeana", "ReviewID": "UR119198364", "Content": "This hotel is in Mestre, near Venice.

It's in Mestre nearby Venice. However, it's the best choice 'cause every hotel in Venice is too expensive, no matter the season. The hotel is located near to a bus stop where you can get a ride to Venice (about 15-20 min) and the cost is low (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac 1,20). The neighborhood is quite and clean as well as the hotel. Although the breakfast is included, maybe you'd rather eat a little more... Good news, there are some grocery stores next to the bus stop so you could get some provisions before arriving to Venice... it's up to you! By the other hand, this hotel has flaws: There is not elevators, so you must go upstairs carrying with your heavy luggages.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jessica C", "ReviewID": "UR99230596", "Content": "Cleanliness & rooms - The hotel is very clean and quiet. The rooms are a good size and are cleaned every day. Towels are changed every day as well. Room decor is outdated but room was very cozy with heating which you can control. Unfortunately there were only 2 electric plugs one for the fridge and one in the bathroom. Service - Very good. Staff spoke English and were helpful when we asked for information. They also gave us an electrical adapter to use for our whole stay. The breakfast was between 7 and 10 and it was very good and abundant. Everything was freshly made. We checked out early at around 8 am on the last day and went back for the luggages at around 1pm Location - There is a bus stop just outside the hotel where you can get a bus to Mestre centre and the train station. Behind the hotel there is another bus stop where you can get a bus to Venice Piazzale Roma every 10 mins. Buses are less frequent at night and if you're staying for Carnival it would be ideal to book early and find a central hotel in Venice and not in Mestre, as it will take you about an hour to reach Mestre (get a water bus from Piazza San Marco or Rialto to Piazzale Roma and then a bus to Mestre). On the other hand, Mestre is ideal if you want to do some shopping (H&M, Benetton, Clarks etc) and if you want to travel to other cities such as Verona. In terms of value, we paid 360 euros for 4 nights for 2 persons. Considering that it was Carnival, it was quite cheap.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cFront Desk Serive is not ideal and toilet lock needs to be replaced\u201d", "Author": "SylviaGwee", "ReviewID": "UR70581201", "Content": "We booked a few triple rooms as that was the room type that was available during our internet booking.

We were trying to find a deal, which lead us to staying in the city of Mestre. The city is great!- It was a 25 min. walk from the hotel to the city center- where there was an abundance of stores and restaurants. As for the hotel: 2 blocks from bus that will take you to venice, great customer service and breakfast. Now the down side: no working AC, tiny rooms, uncomfortable beds- more like a hostel in my opinion.

If you are coming via train, get off at the Mestre station. It may require a cab ride, but it should not be far. If you are going out by air, or arriving by air. There is public transport. This hotel is convenient to the bus stop into Venice. The rooms are large and there is a safe and mini-bar. The bathroom's only problem is adjusting the temp of the shower. The breakfast is more than adequate, in fact it is above average for Europe. This hotel is immaculate and has a small little bar. Venice is very pricey, food and drink. The establishments around San Marco are the worst. Two drinks (wine and a spritz) were about $40 US. The Harry's Bar, of fame sells drinks for 19 Euros, each. WOW. We packed a daily lunch. Lots of parks in Venice to stop in. WHen staying in this hotel, avoid the restaurant nearest to the hotel. The food is good, but if you order the Tourist special, you will not get it all, but be charged for it. This is not a big deal, except that the price was 28 Euros each. Ouch! The desk at the hotel recommends nearby restaurants, stick to their guide. If you take the train into Venice, you will have to cross three bridges with your luggage to get to the bus station.
