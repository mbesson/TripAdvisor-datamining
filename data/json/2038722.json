(As mentioned in previous reviews most of the taxi drivers are not keen to take you to or from the Dubai Mall - however there is finished pavements and pedestrian crossings so that you can safely make your way there and back and will only take 5 to 10 minutes) *The hotel staff were all very pleasant. *The rooms were clean, well presented and comfortable. *The sun deck was good, although the pool was a little small and the outside bar wasn't open (but staff were always on hand to take drink and food orders). There is a slight bit of noise from the roads nearby but not enought to stop you relaxing and enjoying the sun. *The gym was excellent. *The breakfast was lovely, and the meals we had by the pool were nice, but we didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment on that.

We specifically enjoyed the bar on terrace - good view and good service. The only weak thing we got to point out - coz of construction works in Dubai, a way from Dubai Mall to the hotel takes literally 3 minutes by taxi - and taxi drivers hate getting that tiny pay-per-trip - so they charge taxi's minimum which is some 10 dirhams (3 bux) - but same time you cannot walk by feet this distance because there is no pedastrian road for these 3 minutes drive/walk. So you MUST take a cab. An opposite way - from the hotel to dubai mall for example - takes some 15 minutes (by car_ becauase again, coz of the construction works, you cannot drive directly.

I knew the area was a bit akward but as it was towards the end of my trip I knew I would manage. As others have mentioned it is in an akward position, Dubai mall is a 10minute walk along the highway which we did one day but would not like to do the journey at night or if you have lots of shopping. The hotel has a shuttle bus which is fine but goodness knows what will happen if there are more than 10 people wanting to use the bus. My issue is coming back. Taxi drivers are not keen on doing this very short trip from dubai mall and made it well known they were not pleased, if you have had a long day shopping of if in the height of summer walking back is not an option, so you either have to be totally reliant on the shuttle bus or be prepared to walk. I did not have any meals at the hotel so can not comment, the pool was freezing which is a shame as the hotel I stayed in previous had a lovely heated pool, the room was clean and of an ok size. The disappointing part was the floor I was put on, I was on the 24th floor, I can only assume they use this floor as overspill rooms as the common area is disgraceful. The carpet is tatty remnants and not the same as on the other floors, dangerous exposed carpet grips, dirty internal atrium windows. I am a Carlson member so was really disappointed with this and can only assume it was because I booked the room on the radisson sale rate which is a major bug bear of mine as they should not offer the rate if they treat the guest as second class. The rooms on this floor should not be let out due to the state of the common area, with that said though as mentioned the room itself is ok. I needed a rollaway bed which was actually on my booking notes, it took 3 hours to come and this was first requested at 7pm when my toddler wanted to sleep. I got a very low rate for the time of year, so didn't feel too bad about things however had I paid more or the non sale rate I would have been very very disappointed in this hotel.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cHotel, not bad...

I think that by now (15 Oct 2011) the access road is very likely open, but I consider myself lucky to have had the chance to ride through the desert and Dubai building project to get to the hotel .... all great fun when taken in the right spirit and for what it is .... a great city being built before your eyes.

To be on the safe side the new lasagnas came over cooked. Asked the reception to prebook a taxi to the airport. We were told several times that it was ok and on its way. No car showed up. Starting to lack time, we insisted that the hotel sorted this out as we were literally stucked in the desert and the construction site. No such help was given.

The hotel is right in the Dubai downtown, a couple of kilometres from the Dubai mall. However, it is located just off the main highway. It is a nightmare if you are driving to the hotel as the detour will take you miles round and round the downtown. Also, there are no properly marked signs (although they erected one the day I arrived) to help you reach there. The whole place leading to the hotel resembles a construction site adding to the confusion. As this is a new property, most of the cabbies are not sure of the exact route. A drop from the airport which should have costed 50 AED costed me 100 as none of us were sure how to reach the hotel. Hence, it makes sense to call up the hotel beforehand to enquire about the directions. However, the hotel itself is very fresh and nice. The staff are very well trained and are eager to help you and make your stay nice. There is a swimming pool and a gym, but I did not get the time to use them. The rooms are nice and practical- something the Radisson Blu chain stands for. They do provide a free shuttle to and from the nearest metro stations and to the Dubai Mall.

It opened 3 days before my arrival. Billed as 1km away from Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa. Since it was a new property, I downloaded the map displayed on their website. Arrived at Dubai airport, jumped in a taxi and we drove around for an eternity - the driver could not find the hotel. He called several times for directions and we appeared to be driving through non existent roads, but service roads through building sites. Out of frustration, we asked the taxi driver to let us out near a metro station and the hotel told us they would send a driver to collect us. The driver turned up around 10 minutes later. We were impressed by the hotel for doing this. This lasted momentarily. It was no wonder the taxi driver could not locate the hotel, it is in the middle of a building site with no infrastructure in terms of a road. Unless you knew the hotel was there, you would never find it. In short - the hotel has opened ahead of time, with no main road access. The hotel is glass and steel, minimalistic. Apart from myself/partner, there appeared to be around 10 other guests that we saw - Mostly Russian. The breakfast buffet was poor. Granted, with so few guests, wastage needs to be taken into account, but with more staff than guests, the sensible thing to do would be replenish little but often. This was not the case. A European Head Chef, clearly visible, who has not taught the ' egg station ' how to fry eggs. not count, since 2 fried eggs over easy are in fact 1 egg and crisp frisby's. I understand there are teething problems when a new hotel opens, but c'mon, a European Head Chef can oversee a handful of guests and the staff to offer a better quality experience. Rooms are nice, fresh and as usual with the Radisson group, internet access is free. The bathroom was foolishly finished with a tub and a shower attached to the taps. Zero water pressure. The hotel as a whole, is glass and steel and lacks any warmth. The pool area is large, but simply concrete surrounds. The hotel has views over the entire area, which is simply a building site. Food at the hotel, a cafe to speak of, was expensive. 55 dhs for a panini is ridiculous. The feeling is of imprisonment. The mall is 1km away, but there is no read access. The hotel, savvy to this fact, provides a shuttle service to the mall. ' As and when Guests need it '. Not so. It also seats 7 people. I needed to visit a friend in Satwa, I asked the reception if I could take the shuttle to the mall where I would pick up a taxi. They assured me the hotel limousine was ' slightly ' more expensive than a taxi. I am very familiar with Dubai and ' slightly ' was in fact triple, the meter starts at 8.5dhs before you leave the complex, a taxi starts at 3dhs. My taxi ride was 60dhs. From Dubai Mall, the ride is actually 11dhs. When I returned to the mall, I called the hotel for a shuttle pick up and was told I would need to wait one hour, the shuttle driver had a previous appointment taking a guest to ' The Address '. My understanding was the shuttle only takes guests to and from the Mall. I took a local taxi and directed him through the building site, which due to the navigation adds mileage and so you pay accordingly, if the hotel opened when the road was complete the taxi fare would be a few dirhams. When I arrived back at the hotel, since it's new, Radisson have clearly sent some European employees to oversee it's opening. I approached Reception and detailed the limousine experience. I know hotel limousine's are more expensive, but was assured slightly more expensive .... in my mind, that does not mean triple. Since you cannot call a taxi, you are reliant upon them. The money was not the question, being lied to by a 5 star hotel - clearly integrity isues. I was told the shuttle had no fixed time and Guests would be taken and picked up as their needs required. I explained this was clearly not the case. The response was apologies and ' What can we do to make it right ?' You tell me. Am I to suggest a complimentary stay, a refund of the limousine fare, an upgrade for my next stay .... not forthcoming and as a guest, not for me to suggest. Whilst I was relaying my grief, another guest, female, was at the reception having gone through the same experience as I, only the local taxi she took, dumped her on the roadside, refusing to drive any further through the building site. As a business traveller, she was late to all her meetings. I returned to my room, only to find that in the 4 hours since I had left, despite leaving the ' Please Clean my room ' card on the door, my room had not been serviced. I returned to reception and at this time, the European employee I had met, was now speaking to the Hotel Manager and relaying my experience. The Manager did not speak to me. I was staying on a discounted rate. It was a rate offered by Radisson, that does not mean I am not a Guest regardless of what I paid. That evening, we climbed over the temporary wall and walked through the dust to the main road and onto the mall. There was no way we were going to wait an eternity for the ' shuttle available as and when a guest needs it ' to take us there. I was told that they have no control over roads being built. Granted. But you cannot open a hotel with no infrastructure, access to the hotel is reliant upon a road being completed. Having checked the website again, there is still no mention that the property has no main road access. We checked out early. Once the public road into the hotel opens, there is no question, the location will be great. My experience lacked integrity, a lack of being able to win back a guest and with so many hotel rooms in Dubai now, needs to up it's game a great deal. I am a keen Radisson guest, and will continue to be, but this property lacks in every respect.
