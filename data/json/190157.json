The TV in my room did not work - not a big deal - but would have been nice to have been able to watch the BBC news whilst resting after a big night out. One downside is that the hotel charge almost 4 euros a night for a key for the safe in the room. A bit cheeky to charge in a supposedly 4 star hotel. The corridors can be confusing to navigate (its a bit maze-like but you soon get used to it) and the lifts (elevators) can be tempremental - on more than 1 occasion I got fed up of being in the lift and having to get out as it would keep re-opening the doors and refuse to move.

The bathroom had a lingering odor of cologne and sewage intertwined which was already present when we first walked into the room and remained until we checked out.
