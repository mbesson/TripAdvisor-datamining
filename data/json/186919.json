The advertised jacuzzi tub didn't exist in either bathroom (both of which hadn't been renovated in 40 years, and included mould below the sinks at no extra charge).

I had only ever stayed in a nice King suite. I've stayed at this hotel numerous times and have recommended it to lots of people. Boy, am I embarrassed. Now that I live close to Toronto, and attend school downtown, I was planning on staying here more often as my little place in the city for late nights at school, winter storms, and conferences--in fact, I stayed for 4 days last week because of a conference I was attending downtown. Anyway, long story short, I found a great deal on the hotel's own website for a King room (not suite); I've only ever stayed in the suite before but the pictures looked nice and I naturally assumed that the standard king room would be the same as the suite, decor- and quality-wise, just much smaller without the living area and second bathroom. I was horribly wrong. I even requested a quiet room away from elevators so I could sleep and study. Upon checkin, I added an extra day to my stay (another big mistake, I should have looked at the room first) and had to prepay it to get the same web rate. I was sent up to a room on the 4th floor. This room looked like it belonged in a horror movie. It was horribly ugly, with faded pink fabric and decor, pink stained carpets with a moldy blue-black tinge around all the baseboards AND it was right next to the air exhaust from Wai La Heen (Chinese restaurant downstairs), so not only was it noisy but it STANK horribly too. I called downstairs and asked for a new room. I had to PAY to upgrade to a king suite because it was so bad. And since I had already prepaid for the room, including the 4th night now, I couldn't go anywhere else. Plus, the hotels downtown were booked up for various conferences. I feel like I was ripped off, like it was some kind of bait and switch scam and although I complained, nobody would do anything for me. This went from being my favourite hotel to the WORST hotel and I could never in good conscience recommend it to anybody again. I am kind of sad because it was my favourite hotel in Toronto--I've even received letters from the manager thanking me for my positive reviews and comments from the checkout survey. And I was a good, loyal customer; I always ordered room service and tipped well, and recommended the hotel. Well, to anybody thinking of staying here, I say BEWARE. I stayed here to save a little money from the official conference hotel and I now ended up paying a ton more than the conference hotel and for far inferior quality.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "CanadianSoloGirl", "ReviewID": "UR124136426", "Content": "The location is great. the price is right, but this is not a luxury downtown hotel.

It's not like the York Hotel, It's not Like the Sheraton Hotel. It's nothing alike to compare with the Metropolitan in Vancouver. Inside decor of the Metropolitan Hotel is more alike a Super 8 Hotel. I wish I would have been charged the Super 8 Hotel Price. Therefore, I am still upset I will never go back to stay at Metropolitan Hotel, when the Sheraton Hotel, and York Hotel are booked full. I would rather stay at the Quality Inn Suites at the Airport then go back to Metropolitan Hotel - 108 Chestnut - Downtown, and II don't care if I have to rent a car and drive to town back and forth t'll go back and stay at the Quality Inn Suites at the Airport, I loved!

My answer to Mr Clareco nom intelligent coment(http://www.tripadvisor.com/members-reviews/clareco) I feely sorry for him for been used to be a frequent customer of Super 8 Hotel paying Shangrilla price and never been to One Shangrilla Hotel. His non intelligent remarks proves that he dosen't know what a hight quality hotel of 4 stars is all about. I strong belive the old say \"quotes\" apply to him \" what one never had one will never miss\" I truly feel sorry for his egnorance. In case he is staff of Metropolitan, he is trying to do his job by mislead people to make belive the hotel is a super hotel which is not for the price which charge the customers.Metropolitan Hotel is a rip off and I rest my case.

Check-in was bumpy because our first room reeked of cigarette smoke and we had to come back down to request a second room. The woman at the front desk was polite and helpful and we ended up storing our luggage for about 3 hours. Second, the not-so-good points: furniture in room very dated, peeling paint and damaged/stained carpet in room. Our room did not match the lobby, another example of a disturbing trend in hotel renovations: spending $$$ on hotel entrance, lobby, and public spaces and merely spending $ on the actual rooms. I would also warn folks with large SUVs that the hotel's underground parking lot is incredible narrow and hard to navigate. We were in a standard size car and found the lot quite tricky. Note: when you enter the parking garage you have to take an immediate hard right. Final analysis: We paid $129 for our room via Expedia. For that rate this hotel is certainly a decent value and credit is warranted to the great restaurant staff. If you can get a similar rate then this hotel will serve your needs nicely.

On July 19/2011 we checked in at around 3pm, parked and if I can go on forever on how awful the parking situation was I would. Parking spaces are absolutley tiny and if you drive a SUV or larger sedan GOODLUCK GETTING IN A SPOT. Parking was 21$ which wasnt too bad but to have to squeeze in a little hole it's frustrating to say the least. When you walk in it's very out dated compared to other 3.5 star hotels in downtown toronto, the carpets are gross and damp, wallpaper looks like its from the 80's, tv is a huge tube tv like it was the first ones ever made. We booked our hotel through Hotwire last minute and got a rate of 110CAD incl taxes and after our experience wouldnt even pay 20$ to stay there. After our night out I was in the bathroom getting ready to go to sleep while my boyfriend went downstairs to get my suitcase from the car and I walked out to get in bed and seen a HUGE NASTY BEETLE LIKE COCKROACH ON THE WHITE SHEETS ON THE BED. I WAS SO DISCUSTED. I immedietley grabbed a drinking glass to put on top of it, changed, packed all my things and checked the hell out!! We called the front desk ( this was all in between 2-3am ) and she sent security up to look and the bug was still under the glass, he took it with him and we checked out. The night desk clerk was really rude and so unhelpful, she didn't offer any compensation nor any empathy for our situation as if it was something that was normal. Parking was re-imbursed and Hotwire refunded our night from hell's stay. At 3am in the morning we were left with nowhere to go but start driving to our destination 6 hrs away in Montreal. Absolutley discusted with the service and cleanliness of this hotel and I'm not picky at all. PAY AN EXTRA 30$ FOR A BETTER HOTEL!!! While we waited for security to come we took pictures.

We had a very quick check in and the concierge, [who recognised us from 8 months ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a memory!]. He saw to it that we received an upgrade. This was very much appreciated as we needed the space to relax in the coming week, after visiting our sick family relative, in the last days of their life. The front of house staff made us feel very welcome and are great ambassadors to the city of Toronto and the Metropolitan Hotel. Jing and Ronnie were a great source of ideas. They made us feel that we had made a good friend and always had a wave for us whenever we came in. They certainly deserve huge credit for making our trip a very special one, considering the circumstances. Others who deserve special mention are the bar and restaurant staff. Yet again, they made us feel very welcome, and part of the Metropolitan family. The friendliness and interest in our visit, was a great source of comfort. Our thanks go to these 2 very special members of staff. We shall miss them both very much indeed. Naturally, in any organisation, there are unsung heroes of staff who deserve praise for their service:- Our room was cleaned daily to a very high standard, The kitchen staff, who provided such lovely food for us to experience, certainly deserve recognition, and The doormen, who always greeted us with a smile. [This was very welcome after returning from the hospital]. Finally, we thoroughly recommend the Metropolitan as a superb venue to explore downtown Toronto.

Gail, at the front desk even upgraded us to a suite with our asking!!! Gail also went over and beyond. Friendly, polite and very accomdating. I would definately recommend this hotel to everyone.

When I booked the rooms I told them my husband and I were bringing our daughter and her friend for a night in Toronto for her 17th birthday. I was very clear that the only thing we really cared about was a room together on a high floor so that their room would have a view of the city. She promised to mark that on our reservation We got to the hotel at 2 pm. We tried to check in but he said there were no rooms on the same floor together unelss we wanted the 5th floor. I asked him to check the reservation as we asked for a view and the 2 rooms on the same floor. Then he started saying we were checking in early and this is why. I asked if we waited until 3 would it make a difference. He said no, there's no guarantees. I thought mentioning my daughter's birthday and how all she wanted was a view of the lights in the big city might help but he couldn't care less. He eventually assigned us to 2 different floors and her view was of the other side of the hotel (or at least an equally high building).

The rooms are lovely and tasteful, with framed Chinese textiles on the walls. Some people have called the decor dated, but I think it's charming; it's boutique hotel style, rather than the sleek big corporate hotel look. But there are a couple of things that I wish the hotel would fix. One is the parking garage. At the bottom of the first ramp from the street, can they not put up a sign telling guests which parking entrance to use? I drove to one entrance, only to see a little sign that it was for condo residents. I backed up and drove up to the next entrance, only to see it was a dead end. Finally I went to the right entrance - not even a small sign indicating that it was for the hotel. Secondly, the breakfast buffet is decidedly sub-par. In a hotel of that quality you expect something more. The food is about the quality of a free breakfast in a cheaper hotel. Unripe fruit, cheapo cheese, crummy pastries, poor bread choices, icky sausages... the coffee wasn't even hot. And it's expensive. They need more selection, and they need higher quality food.

Had the smell been anything but cigarettes,say air freshener or perfume, it would have been overwhelming causing coughing and choking, but we were told by the hotel staff that because it was cigarette smoke in a smoking room, it somehow made it okay. They were unwilling to put us up at any other affiliated hotel, saying everything in the city was booked or refund us for the night. We ended up having her stay with us in our one bedroom condo. The room should never have been offered. It was disgusting. We understand that smoking rooms still exist, but they should still be required to be clean. Clean should mean that the smell in the room is tolerable to the average person, but this was beyond reason. The treatment we received, where the staff were completely unhelpful and unwilling to refund the night or even offer a discount for a room they admitted wreaked of smoke (but that it was okay because it was a smoking room), was totally unacceptable.

I booked a standard room and was upgraded to an Executive Suite, so my review is based on my experience in their best suite. I arrived late at night from the Caribbean and was exhausted, but the staff were super friendly and helpful. The kitchen was closed, unfortunately, and I hadn't eaten all day and was craving a pizza (after a month digging in the Caribbean) and I was dirty and not exactly dressed like someone that should be upgraded to a suite, but the staff were SO FRIENDLY and accommodating and helped me order a pizza (God, how I miss Pizza Pizza in Ontario!). The room was AMAZING, best sleep I ever had in a hotel except maybe the Sofitel de la Cloche in Dijon. It took me a couple minutes to realize that what I thought was my room was just the sitting room (jetlag/cultureshock much? LOL) and the door at the end of the hall lead to a big beautiful bedroom with the most comfortable king sized bed, and amazing view, and a second washroom! I don't really understand the bad reviews here, but then again maybe because I was staying in a higher class room that I had a better experience (I was under the impression the hotel was renovated ca. 2005 so I don't know why ppl say it's outdated--I'm assuming by the pics posted that perhaps they did not renovate the standard rooms?). Frankly, for the price difference, you're better off upgrading to at least a class above standard. I'm visiting Toronto again in a couple weeks and have booked the Exec. Suite again for 3 nights (check out their Stay for 3, Pay for 2 deal--it's basically the same price as a Std. room for 3 days!) and I will post an updated review then. A tip to all travelers from someone who worked (briefly) at a hotel: don't bother with the auction sites or third party sites, you're usually better off to book directly through the hotel (websites usually have the best deals) or ask for their best rates (the first rate offered on the phone is the \"rack\" rate, or full price). You might pay a little more extra, but hotels get very little from the third party sites (often much much less than half the rack rate) and will assign you the least desirable rooms (next to the elevator or in a noisy area), and won't be very helpful if you want to change rooms. Not to mention, you usually have to deal directly with the 3rd party site if you have any issues or need to cancel!", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cMade up for a rough start...\u201d", "Author": "vealaw1", "ReviewID": "UR66257162", "Content": "Friends and I booked our room a few days before we needed to stay.

My room was small, though entirely adequate for my purposes - a small wardrobe, a king-sized bed, a TV, a comfortable chair and desk. The wardrobe did make the entrance a bit cramped which made for an awkward moment when my dinner was delivered. (I had to hold the door open with one arm while backing into the bathroom so that the delivery guy could squeeze by me to set the tray on the bed.) The bed and pillows were, by the way, extremely comfortable and I enjoyed one of the best nights of sleep that I have ever had while staying at a hotel. On the downside, however, it's true that the hotel is a bit worn around some edges - marks on doors and walls in the hallway from luggage or furniture scuffing against them, slightly peeling wallpaper in certain corners. I also had to wait longer than I expected to check much luggage at the concierge desk in the morning, despite several attempts by the check-in/out staff to get the concierge's attention (he walked away, never to be seen again, after offering to take the luggage of the woman in line behind me?). However, the staff, level of service and comfort made for a very pleasant stay overall. The hotel is also extremely well located - right next to Toronto City Hall and Osgoode Hall (where I was attending a conference) and just a block from the Eaton Centre.

The wifi service is not lightning fast, but it is more than adequate... especially considering it's free. The rooms are very clean and spacious enough. The closets I've had to date in my rooms have been a bit of an oddity, but they do the job. (The are not deep and you hang your clothes \"front to back\" so they don't hold much.) The bathrooms have always been spotless, though on my last stay, I did notice a little bit of tile grout in the shower/tub area that could use replacing or a good deep-clean... ditto for the shower head... but nothing distressing at all. The beds are incredibly comfortable - pillow-top matresses, duvet cover, soft pillows (and plenty of them) - with soft, white sheets. The room service is fast but the prices are too high. I know that room service is never cheap, but $24 CAD for a simple bowl of pasta and $12 CAD for a slice of cheesecake? At least the service was fast and the food tasted good. I've never tried the Chinese restaurant but colleagues have and they've said it is very, very good. I did stop at the bistro one night for a plate of appetizers and digestifs - it was all good, including the bistro's atmosphere with it's colourful, subdued lighting.

NOTE: this hotel has no double occupancy rooms - only singles and \"suites\" (one queen bed and one pull out couch). The only redeeming qualities were the location (right downtown Toronto) and the daytime bellstaff who were very pleasant and helpful. We requested a late check-in when we made reservations, because our flight would get in late. We arrived to find that not only had our rooms been given away, but the front desk staff (who blamed us for being late) were surly, inexperienced and uncommunicative. There are no staff on at night other than the front desk. We were finally given rooms, which were small, poorly laid out, and reeked of smoke. We had reserved for one double occupancy and one single, but the front desk mixed up our keys, sending myself and my coworker to share the very small room with one queen bed, and our other co-worker to have the office suite to himself. Eventually this was rectified (now 1 hr after we checked in) however it took three calls to the front desk and 40 minutes of waiting to get bedding for the pull-out sofabed I was forced to sleep on. Eventually it was the front desk person who arrived with the sheets and was content to have us make the pull-out couch up for me until we demanded that he assist us. I had to sleep on a pull out sofa because they had no double occupancy rooms (the standard 2 queen bed rooms that every other hotel has). It turns out that though we booked and paid for double occupancy and they had none at all to offer. Their \"office suite\" was the next best thing, and it was a very poor use of space. Business travellers will find amenities, but they are not helpful, and the internet is very slow. There were some attempts to provide service to business travellers - including a printer & paper, etc. but fax costs were prohibitive, and the printer was old enough that they didn't have USB cables. the internet - whether wired or wireless was terrible. The room we had had a new-ish fan/heat/ac system, which worked well, however the beds lacked basic warmth/weight blankets. both my colleague in the real bed and myself felt that they were stingy with the blankets - when we requested them, the front desk person told us to turn the heat up in the room, with a smile on her face.

Located on one side of Nathan Philips Square the hotel is ideally located close to all events which take place on the square from massive charity walks and concerts to various cultural concerts and markets, wonderful!! The hotel itself is nestled nice on Chestnut Street opposite a residential apartment block and the student residence of the University of Toronto. Don't let this put you off however. The street is neither bustling nor overly loud, so sleep will not be disturbed. From the outside the hotel is very 'concrete' and plain with a simply canopy of the front entrance. At first glance it is very pleasing. Once inside the hotel is wonderful and almost boutique looking. There is a medium and spacious lobby with a large flower display in the middle, which always looks fresh, to the far end is the reception area. As soon as you reach the reception area it is like oyu have been entered in to a lottery. You either receive a pleasant, cheery and welcoming receptionist or sadly you are presented with a tirey, grumpy and stern staff member. Again it is sadly luck of the drawer. For the most part however, staff on the front desk seem to be pleasant. I have stayed in the hotel approximately 30 times this year so far. A lot of these times I have stayed on business as I work as cabin crew. Other times I have stayed as a general guest because there have been some reasonable deals. I have found a very clear case of elitism in this hotel. When I am uniformed and checking in I receive a golden service 9/10 times. When I check in as a regular guest it's hot or miss I'm afraid. Again the type of room you are given also seems to be hit and miss. I have been given twin rooms (2 Queen beds), single rooms (1 large Queen bed), deluxe rooms and even a double sweet. All rooms are pleasant, however some do venture more towards to small side and some what dated. There is no continuity between rooms either. My golden tip for this hotel regarding rooms is to do your research before booking. If you are in Toronto during a major event such as the film festival, fashion week or arts festival you should always book early. This way you are not only guaranteed a room but also escape receiving one of their 'last minute' rooms. These rooms tend to be VERY close to air conditioning units and are very very loud and disturbing. The lottery regarding this staff (mentioned earlier) also comes in to effect here. When you call down to the front desk it is again hit and miss whether or not your problem is sorted or whether you receive a sarcastic answer. The bathrooms do need updating considerably but are usually very clean. I have only ever had a handful of cases where I have had to complain regarding the bathroom, all of which have been resolved quickly. All rooms have some form of view, whether it be the CN tower, Nathan Philips Square or other views of the city. Some great photos can be taken from your window. The other nice fact is that your are literally 2 minutes walk from the shopping, which in my opinion is BRILLIANT!! the Eaton centre, which is literally around the corner hosts all the shops you could wish for catering for every need. Back to the hotel and we now explore the facilities. The swimming pool is small yet pleasant. For a hotel this size, with major competitors on its door step you would expect a wider range of facilities or at least more luxury facilties. To one side of the pool is a small jacuzzi bath, which again is pleasant and exactly whats needed after a long day shopping and dining. If swimming is not your thing, the hotel does have a small fitness suite, which is very much to be desired. It sadly offers just a couple of machines to help with various levels of fitness. Again if fitness and swimming is not to your desire and you would prefer to dine then The Metropolitan offers a couple of restaurants, which are actually very good. As I am a flight attendant I eat in restaurants all over the world and in many outstanding top class restaurants. I have to say that although these restaurants are no Michelin star establishments they are actually very good. The Hemisphere restaurant is delightful at all times of the day, at night it is especially nice with its mood lighting. fHere you can enjoy a east for all the senses, Hemispheres blends an eclectic and innovative menu, an exhaustive wine list and glittering atmosphere into a unique experience. Again duing busy times in the city, this restaurant can become very busy so booking is advised. Next is the Lai Wah Chinese restaurant. I have to say this is a fantastic place to eat. I would definately go as far as to say it rivals many of its counterparts in Hong Kong. The restaurant offers some amazing decor also, which you find yourself taking home in your mind ready for a make-over of your living areas. Overall the hotel is a great place to stay and offers accomodation exceptionally close to many of the attractions. The staff and rooms are again part of a lottery but either way I am sure most will not be too disappointed with what they receive.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem", "Title": "\u201cVery unsatisfied--there are better options in Toronto\u201d", "Author": "ashsem", "ReviewID": "UR22522654", "Content": "We have stayed in this hotel twice and had the same ho hum experience both times.

The hotel is very busy and the service is very good. We arrived at 9:30a.m. and our room was already for occupancy. That was great since we didn't have to store our luggage until the room was ready in the afternoon. We had asked for a room with a view of the CN Tower from an upper floor when I had booked and they said they would try to accommodate us. We were put on the eighth floor facing an apartment building where people hung their underwear in the windows each night to dry. The room was small but it was quiet and we weren't distracted by noise from other rooms or from the street. They classify this as a 3 1/2 to 4 star hotel but it isn't. The room we had was in dire need of upgrading. The tile in the bathroom needed replacing and the carpet was filthy and needed to be replaced. I don't think the windows had been washed all year and the curtain rods were pulling away from the ceiling. The bed was comfortable and the linens were soft, white, and cozy. My wife got a strong electrical shock from the make-up mirror in the bathroom when she turned it on with wet hands. We told the desk about that on our departure. The dining room serves wonderful food but is very pricey. We ate in the bistro one night and had breakfast the morning we left. Again, $9.00 for two danish and orange juice is pricey. The atmosphere of the hotel is very nice when you enter. The lobby and the dining areas give you the impression this is a well cared for hotel until you get to the rooms.

Being North America's only 4* Chinese Restaurant/Hotel Venue for weddings, we expected a whole lot more for the money that we spent above and beyond the cost at other venues. Here is our review of the hotel 1. We were extremely dissatisfied with the level of service we (my family and friends) were given with respect to the hotel rooms. All of our guests had difficulties in obtaining their rooms in a timely manner. Moreover, upon receiving their rooms, they were extremely tiny and unsuitable. My brother was offered a smoking room for him, his pregnant wife and two children, which to me, is unacceptable. Upon declining this room, he was offered a really tiny queen size bed (apparently more like a double) for the 4 of them to sleep on. At this point, he was frustrated, as his wife was extremely stressed and physically suffering (her feet and legs were swelling due to the stress of the room situation and heat). Consequently, he accepted this room to allow his wife to relax her feet and legs. In my opinion, this is not acceptable. That night, they checked out at 3am because his wife had contractions. After spending a night in the hospital, it turns out that the contractions were caused by stress - in my opinion it was very likely that the accommodations at the Metropolitan Hotel greatly caused this stress. They were then discharged to go home. Another bridal party member was also offered a smoking room, of which he declined because his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e is allergic to the smell of smoke. The entire point of getting a hotel room was for him to relax (i.e. go swimming, etc) while we were out in the limo taking pictures, without having to go home to his North York house during the day. As the room wasn't ready and he had very expensive professional camera equipment on him, he had no other choice but to drive home, drop off the equipment and come back, which totally defeated the purpose of getting the room. Had he had known this would have happened, he would not have booked the room. By the time he got back, the parking lot was full and he had to pay for parking again. Furthermore, the room was extremely small and smelled disgusting - I didn't believe him when he told me, so I checked it out in the morning.. It was not up to standard in my opinion and I did not agree with how the hotel could have put him in that room. Another friend waited all afternoon for her room in the lobby - she was hoping to be able to catch up on some of her medical research she was working on, however she feared that if she did not wait, she would not get a room. I did not find out about any of this until June 8, 2008. Upon discovering the deficiencies in the hotel accommodations, I decided to address the issues with the Front Desk Supervisor. Of all of the hotels that I have stayed in, I have never been spoken to the way he spoke to myself. He told me, \"It's not that your wedding is not important, it's just not a priority. The airlines are a priority.\" As soon as I heard that, I was saddened. The list goes on.............. I expected a lot more from the Metropolitan.. So much for having your wedding at a hotel to convenience your guests.. 2. I was totally disappointed with the level of service at the wedding reception. The food was not adjusted as previously requested at the tasting. The rice was hard as a rock and noodles mushy. The rest of the food was just ok, but you have to expect that for how much you pay. The votive candles went out and were not re-lit and they threw away the rose petals that we bought for the bathroom. I cannot believe that they threw out my wedding cake. As per the contract, they were supposed to cut the cake for all of the guests and serve it. Instead, they cut one slice for the 'Cake Cutting' ceremony and that was it. The rest went to the garbage. As for the sweet table, it was a complete waste. They were kindly asked on 4 occasions to pack up the remaining sweets from Senses (at least 4 cakes and dozens of mini pastries) and they did not, as asked. They did not follow any instructions. Clearly, the Metropolitan did not uphold its' reputation and did not even try to rectify these discrepancies. Can you believe it??? North America's only 4 * Chinese restaurant / venue of its' kind..

He seems to know a lot about shows in downtown! After he explained what was going on in the city we decided to go for the musical by Queen \"We Will Rock You\", and he not only booked the tickets for us, but got us a 50% discount! Before the show we wanted to get something fancy for dinner because we were on a short getaway for our anniversary and were trying to make the most of our time away, and the same concierge made reservations for us at Adega, a restaurant near the hotel that he said was one of his favorites. We got there, and I guess he had told them it was our anniversary, because they gave us a nice gift as we were eating dinner! When we got back to the hotel after the show he was still working, and he addressed us by name and asked us how the dinner was. This is what I consider 5-star service...professional and caring from beginning to end. The trip went very soothly, and we pretty much had everything organized for us while we were there! After our city tour the day we were leaving, the airport car we had ordered was on time and ready for us, which made getting home hassle-free.

I was in Toronto for 6 days for a conference at the Metro Convention Center. The Metropolitan is a non-chain hotel that is further away than most of the bigger chains, and costs about the same -- at least at conference and government rates. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was that they advertised personal service that the big chains don't, especially free limo service anywhere in the downtown area. When I got there, I found out that was not exactly true. The limo is only available for a 3 hour period in the morning, by reservation a day in advance, and only if no other guest had already reserved the only car at the same time. And it doesn't run on weekends. So I wound up fending for myself on weekends, afternoons returning to the hotel, and one of the mornings when it was already reserved. And it doesn't cover the airport. The two restaurants at the hotel are well acclaimed, so if you're into eating at hotel restaurants, that might be a plus.

We were reallocated to a twin double bed room on the 21st floor which had recently been refurbished. The room was lovely - complete with mini bar, free water provided at night, turn down service - all of which were not provided in our previous room. Ok the bed was small but it was ten times better than our first room. We thought the area was fine. There is a street a few blocks away called Elm Street which has a number of nice restaurants aand pubs, and it is only a stones throw away from the 'entertainment district'.

The woman at the front desk apologized and said the the hotel was having some updates done and that we must have been in an older room, but was not very helpful or sincere. The second room was exactly the same -- dingy, run down, and a little smelly. When we returned to the front desk and said this just isn't up to 4 star (or even 2 star) caliber, the staff tried to say no cancelations and keep our deposit. After some discussion we were able to leave with not charges. We drove around the neighborhood, found an internet cafe and got a nice price for the Westin Hotel right on the water. It was lovely and had even better views. Try not to do what we did and just skip the Metropolitan to begin with.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cannock, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "JanieP", "ReviewID": "UR5602649", "Content": "I must admit that I was worried about visiting this hotel having read the reports on this website after I'd already booked it in England but was pleasantly surprised with the room that we were allocated on arrival. This was our final hotel in our \"holiday of a lifetime\" to Canada and the one where we were to spend the most nights, and so, on gathering the good points made by other visitors, I took pro-active action before arriving and cheekily emailed the hotel asking for a high room with a CN Tower view. I must say that the hotel delivered!! The reply was courteous and quick, the reception staff were polite and and the room (2312 for information - any rooms ending in 12 would have the CN Tower view) had a splendid view! I can see why some people are disappointed as the room was considerably smaller than others on our trip (it had only one queen size bed in it) and the carpets weren't regularly vacuumed BUT the bed was very comfortable, the linen clean and fresh, the bathroom spotless & supplied with the usual toiletries/facilities and was it nice to have use of a free fridge and room safe (not always the case in other hotels). The desk was rather crowded with coffee/ice bucket/food purchase stuff which would limit the room for a business visitor, but for a tourist, it was ample. The only complaint we had was that they didn't really replenish the tea/coffee used and we had to ring down to ask for more BUT again, the hotel responded admirably and sent someone up and we picked exactly the type and amount of extras we required with miminal fuss - no problems. The location of the hotel was reasonably central and personally we didn't have any problem with walking 5 mins to the nearest tube station ($2.75 per journey whatever the length). It was only a 20 minute walk to the CN Tower and the hotel concierge supplied a very comprehensive map which showed the major tourist sites, PATH walkways and Subway stations so we were able to get to everywhere we planned to visit. There was a shop opposite the hotel (open 8.00 am to midnight) and the nearest food court and sandwich shop was literally around the corner on Dundas Street so getting food was no biggie. We didn't dine at the hotel but did look in on the gym and swimming pool which both looked well maintained and comprehensive. On a whole, we really enjoyed our visit to Toronto and the Metropolitan. Maybe we got lucky with our room, especially as we didn't mind it being small ( we only used it to sleep in), and our only advise to other travellers is to be cheeky like us and take your chances.

I requested that, and got a room at the end of the hallway on the 10th floor. Once I arrived, the room definitely did not look like the picture on the website. The room looked a bit old and run down. Also, my room faced an outdoor skating rink. It was playing loud Christmas music, which I could hear clearly from the room and was quite annoying. I phoned front desk, and they immediately switched my room for me without complaint. I was impressed by the efficiency of the staff. With the room switch, I got upgraded to a luxury room on the 22nd floor. This room did look like the one on the website. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, and everything was really clean. The turn down service was nice, and I appreciated the bottle of water that they included as part of the service. The furniture looked about 10 years newer than the room on the 10th floor. I later checked the price on the internet and the luxury room is about $30 more.

I also had breakfast at the Hemisphere's Bistro at the lobby. I wasn't impressed by the staff there. They barely gave me any service when I told the waiter I just wanted a bagel, instead of the full breakfast buffet. The food was overpriced and not that great. The location of the hotel was not bad.

Because we booked our seats the night before departure, we were not eligible to take advantage of any of the ferry's getaway packages that included hotel arrangements. So, I researched as many hotels as I could, to try to find a price that would come approximately close to the bargains we would have gotten had we been able to book a whole package. I booked The Metropolitan through Hotels... I am not sure if I got a better rate through them or not; it cost $134.54 + $19.48 for taxes & fees, so all told, I paid $154.02 American. (I might have paid $171.00 Canadian if I'd booked through the Metropolitan's web page ... probably comes to about the same thing). The main thing was that the total of the hotel, plus round-trip ferry fare for 2 people, came to about the same as one of the packages that I'd missed out on. Also, for some reason, I was bent on booking a place that had a pool ...and The Metropolitan has one. Unfortunately, we never found the time or energy to take a dip, so I cannot comment on the pool or sauna in this review. After booking the hotel, I read the reviews here on TripAdvisor and just about had a heart attack!! The reviews here seem to be hit and miss, so I crossed my fingers and hoped that we would have at least an okay experience. We were relieved to find that The Metropolitan turned out to be much better than many of the reviews posted on this site would lead one to believe. So, if you have made reservations at The Metropolitan and are now kicking yourself for that decision, relax!! It's not going to be as bad as you think. The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and friendly. We were greeted with smiles all around -- everyone had a great attitude. When we checked in and took the elevator to our floor, I for one, after reading the reviews on this site, was relieved to find that the carpeting, while not brand-new, was also not completely run-down. I could detect a spot/stain here or there, so it wasn't pristine, but it wasn't \"Barton Fink\" decrepit and drecky, either. People, \"worn and tired\" is the St. Moritz in Lake Placid ... this place is perfectly acceptable compared to an old dive like that. Our room was just as tiny as advertised, but we were not in Toronto to hang out in our room, we were in Toronto to get out and see the sites. It sure was a tiny room, though, relative to anything I've stayed at in NYC. The bed was ridiculously wonderful, overstuffed with sheets, very comfy and cozy. The room and the floor we were on and the hotel all smelled JUST FINE. Someone wrote that the hotel was \"smelly\" so I was concerned about that ... but there was nothing to worry about, thank goodness. Our room had one unfortunate major defect ... right outside our window was a roof ventilator. When we walked in, I heard its low rumble and mentioned it to my boyfriend, but he dismissed it as \"city noise\" and we were soon out on the streets and off to the ROM. When we came back from our excursions to freshen up for the evening, however, the insistent \"RAAHRRMmmmmmm RAHHRRRRRMMMmmm\" of the ventilator disturbed even my boyfriend, so we called the front desk to see if they could put us somewhere quieter. They happily complied and found a room for us on the floor above our current one. This exchange happened almost instantaneously for us, we didn't have to wait longer than 30 seconds for them to call us back and tell us what room number they had found for us. They told us that the bed in the other room was Queen Size, not King Size, and asked if that was alright. We said yes and it was off to the 9th floor for us, in a corner unit. It was the same size as our previous room, but had a much better view and the rumble of the roof ventilator was almost undetectable. I personally really missed our King Sized bed, but as we were only flopping for one night, it was perfectly fine. The Queen bed was still quite comfy (though I'm not sure that a white comforter was the best accessory with my post-midnight attack of the Toblerone chocolate bar, greedily snatched from the mini-bar). Bathrooms in both rooms were not in horrible shape, but I was a bit let down by the bathtubs. Both tubs that I saw were very clean -- esp. around the drain where I can usually detect a shoddy cleaning job -- but both tubs had stains that couldn't be removed. The bathtub in the first bathroom had a couple of spots (nothing scary or human looking), and the second bathtub had an imprint of an old bathmat on it that obviously couldn't be scrubbed away. While not the worst of crimes, I didn't feel particularly like taking a bath in either tub. The showerheads were fantastic, however, and the water pressure that came out was excellent! We had a good night's sleep, and in the morning, went off to see the concierge to see if he could give us good directions to the Toronto Zoo via public transit. Short answer here -- he couldn't!! He was sweet, friendly and very well-intentioned but he gave us extremely lame advice as to how to get to the Zoo. The route he found for us was one of the more indirect choices ... we only discovered this when we found our own route on the way back, by hopping on a different bus that brought us to a different subway station that had way fewer stops in general than the the line we'd started out on. (BTW -- the Toronto Zoo is well wortha trip, but be warned, if you don't bring or rent a car, it is really \"out there\" -- I think it should be renamed the \"Hour-And-A-Half-Away-From-Toronto-If-You're-Lucky Zoo\" -- eesh! ) Overall, we had a great time at The Metropolitan. It is located in the heart of downtown and its central location makes sight-seeing a breeze. The staff is ready to assist you with whatever you need addressed (but take the Concierge's directions to far-flung locations with a grain of salt, grrr!). I would definitely stay there again as long as I can get a good rate and it is a bargain compared to the other, better hotels in the city. I am pretty sure, however, that for $171 Canadian or $154 American, a more lavish experience can be had elsewhere.

We had read in our guidebook that this was a boutique hotel in the heart of Toronto. I was expecting it to be a chi-chi small hotel, so I was pretty disappointed when we drove up and saw a grey concrete high-rise amidst a bunch of businesses advertised with neon signs. The location isn't bad. The neighborhood, although a strange mix of cheap ethnic restaurants, convenience stores and tourist shops, certainly felt safe, and wasn't too far a walk from any of the Toronto sites we wanted to see. It was about a 20 minute brisk walk to the waterfront, and a 10 minute walk to the entertainment district. But it is the only hotel right in the area and is pretty far away from where most of the other hotels are located, so it feels slightly isolated. The room was even more disappointing. The carpet was so worn and dirty that I didn't want to walk around without my shoes. The bedding was okay, but not luxurious like I expected in a so-called boutique hotel. The bath products were nice, though! Service was fine - no complaints though we didn't have too much interaction with staff members since we were out much of the time. There are so many hotel options in Toronto that I don't think I'd stay at the Metropolitan again and would try someplace else instead.", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, UK", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "popstarz2000", "ReviewID": "UR3937298", "Content": "I checked in late and the staff was just miserable.

First of all, we requested a non-smoking room and found ourselves in a room that reeked of tobacco. We called the front desk to be relocated. They stated they would arrange our room and call us back, but after 15 minutes with no return call, we went down to the lobby ourselves and our room still wasn't ready. After waiting in the lobby (again), we were placed on the 11th floor, with no apology. The carpeting in the hallway was dirty and stained in its entire length. The carpet in the room was also dirty. The room did not smell, but the bathroom was disgusting. It smelled like bad mildew/body odor that you could smell from the door. We were tired after driving, so we decided to just deal with the room because overall, it was \"better\" than the first room. The bathroom looked clean so we never figured out where the putrid smell was coming from (?shower curtain/tub?). Even after the cleaning ladies came in the morning, the smell remained. The A/C is extremely loud, so we had to turn it off at night just to sleep. The mini bar had some empty bottles that someone had drunk and put back. The saving grace about this place was the location. We also obtained a decent rate through expedia.com.

In the past, I have stayed at several other well regarded hotels in the city and the Metropolitan remains one of my top three. The pros are a great downtown location. It is very easy to get anywhere, as the subway is 1 block away, and a taxi to most anywhere downtown is under $10.00 CDN. There are great shopping venues (anything from clothing to grocery to liquor), restaurants, and spas, within walking distance. The food at both restaurants in the Metropolitan is excellent and the wine selection is very good. The wait staff are prompt and attentive. There is a very nice bar downstairs, off of the dining area, where one may eat or just relax. The rooms, while small, are of adequate size, well appointed, and are always clean. The linens are very good and the beds/pillows are comfortable. Service, whether it be room service, maid service, or concierge, have always been friendly and of high quality. I find the price to be very reasonable; I see some notes of $300 CDN or more per night - I have always found rooms for $225 CDN or less. I book direct by phone; I'm not sure if that accounts for the difference. The cons are: that I cannot request a specific room in advance, there is no loyalty or rewards program, and the air-conditioners tend to be noisy. Ask for a room away from the elevator as it too is very noisy - calling out each floor in an electronic voice as the doors open.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weston-super-Mare", "Title": "\u201cTop Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Allan-Paula", "ReviewID": "UR3576018", "Content": "This hotel is everything you could want for your visit to Toronto.

Other than a king bed which filled the room, there was a smallish desk in the corner with a desk chair...so you and your guests only had the bed to sit on! Imagine...$205 a night for not much more than a closet. Way overpriced for what you get. Big disappointment and it's no wonder they don't show the room on the website or nobody would go. When I checked in the AirCond wasn't on and it was about 100 degrees or more...and it took ages to cool off and only then marginally bearable. The air conditioner is a noisy single unit like you find in cheap motels. Forget sleeping during the day - the drapes are short (not to floor) so when the sun rises so do you - last time I saw this was an old Holiday Inn motel. Reservations was a problem - they only gave me a confirmation number and were reluctant to email me confirmation. They did it the next day, after I had left for Toronto, but there was no problem checking in. Room Service was good, and quite reasonably priced. The mini bar was also more reasonable than normal - $3.50 for a coke for example. If I was staying there again I would upgrade to a suite for about $100 more - but that puts the hotel price in a different category where you might consider a better place, like the Marriott Eaton Center, Hyatt, 4 Seasons, etc. I did not find the location as good as other reviewers...kind of a seedy area predominately Chinese.

Now thats out of the way I can talk about the good stuff: Staff- The staff were polite and helpful and there was always someone avalible. Rooms- Although small, my room had a great view of Toronto which included the CN tower. Every room has cable and movies and games can be bought. In each room there is a coffee maker, CD player, three telephones, heater, mini bar, safe and the biggest beds ever. The bathrooms are nice with HUGE mirrors, a bath, shower, sink, toilet and great shampoos, conditioners, soaps, shoe buffers, shower caps and the like. Restauraunts + Bar- There are two restauraunts in the Hotel, a Chinese and a just all round food place which serves great burgers/steaks and lots more. The Chinese place is a little expensive but the food is excellent. In the morning you can either choose from a set breakfast or have a buffet. I had the buffet every day, its more food than i've ever seen in my life: bacon, sausages, ceral, bread, toast, potatoes, scrambled eggs, pastries, fruit, and thats only about half of it. Other stuff: Great swimming pool and jacuzzi which are usually empty during the day (because this hotel is mainly used by buisness men/women who work during the day). The pool opens at 8am and stays open untill 8pm. In the changing rooms there is an unlimited supply of towels, and a number of lockers. Also in the changing rooms there is a sauna and some showers. Right next to the swimming pool there is a smallish gym, with lots of machines and TVs. If you want to go to anywhere in the city or further afield then you can go to reception and they will sort it out for you and make any bookings.
