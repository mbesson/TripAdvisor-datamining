The room was nicely decorated and everything about it felt quite new. It was of good size and had a queensized bed, an armchair, desk, flatscreen TV etc. The bathroom had a tub, but was quite small. Also the closet was minimal! The room had free Wifi, which was perfect for us. We didn't try the breakfast there (18 euro per person in march 2012), but chose to eat at the next door caf\u00e9. Even though the room faced the street it wasn't too noisy, but I suppose a room facing the courtyard would've been even better.

The metro stop is very important for business travelers commuting to the La Defense CBD, who don't want to stay in La Defense. The hotel is very clean and neat. I can't say enough about the staff and how helpful and friendly they were. While my French is not so good, they made every effort to communicate in English when possible. Additionally, I left my suit jacket in the closet upon departure. They kindly wrapped it and mailed it to me (for 19euros). The 2 negative things i would say are that the climate control system in the room sucks. It is either on or off, and since it was well below freezing outside the room was like a furnace. Also, if travelling with your wife, don't expect her to be \"wow'd\" by the accommodations. While nice and very, very clean, it does lack luxury.

Rue Washington is a fairly unpromising looking road, but the hotel is close enough to the CE end (200 metres maybe?) located amongst a smattering of cafes, restaurants and offices. The reception doesn't look much like a hotel with just one big desk in the middle of the room which is brightly lit and coloured and fronted with a big glass window. The look is uncompromisingly modern and very bright, but scratch a little deeper and things don't seem quite so 'new' (The life for instance creaks and rattles). My room, on the 3rd floor was quite roomy for Paris (where the norm is SMALL!) and comfortable. The bathroom was newly refitted and there was a large double bed, decent sized wardrobe and a decent sized TV with a good picture (not always true in Paris, I find). The selection of channels was disappointing as usual for an English speaker (and French TV seems pretty dire on the whole from what I've seen, especially if you don't speak French). Breakfast was served in the basement as a fairly generous buffet (juices, coffee, croissants, cheeses, cold meats, etc - and boiled eggs). The room again was bright and colourful, but did feel like a basement, I'm afraid. I slept well the two nights I was in the hotel (although the walls aren't that thick - I could clearly hear the TV in the room next door on the second night) and found it generally comfortable and conveniently situated for the Champs Elysees area. However, despite my generally positive experience nothing made me feel I want to stay in the hotel again. I certainly won't mind if I do, but I won't be asking for it specifically. Perhaps part of this was down to the staff. They were all courteous, but totally business-like (except the Porter who grabbed my bags without asking and then pointedly hung around my room until I tipped him - Everyone has to earn a living, but I can carry my own tiny suitcase...) and with little friendliness. I've given it 3 stars, although that seems a little harsh, even to me. The rating really reflects the price and the hotel's supposedly 4 star rating - Although nothing was bad about it, it just didn't leave a really positive impression on me.

My girlfriend and I stayed for 3 nights in room 3 and loved it from the moment we arrived. I'd read many reviews of people moaning about the size of the rooms/lobbies/lifts in Parisian hotels, but that's all part of the charm as far as we were concerned. Yes the lift is only big enough for 2 people but this isn't a problem as a member of staff takes your luggage and meets you at your room. Yes the room was compact but our bed was large and very comfortable, the decor funky, the layout ergonomically ideal, the bathroom was very spacious with his and hers vanity sinks and a double shower, the carpet thick and soft and above all the whole room was very clean. It didn't matter which member of staff was present at reception, all were incredibly accommodating, friendly and spoke excellent English for those of you who may be reluctant to dabble in conversing 'en Francais'. The hotel is an ideal base to explore Paris, turn right out of the hotel and walk 50 yards and you are on the Champs Elysees; turn right again and you are looking straight at l'Arc de Triomphe. From here you are 10-15 min walk from the Eiffel Tower. Turn left on the Champs Elysees and you are 10-15 min straight walk from le Louvre and 25 min walk from Notre Dame. The hotel is situated in one of the most affluent parts of Paris which makes it even more of a bargain in our opinion. Le Lido (highly recommend) is just round the corner, Louis Vitton (for those of you who wish to queue to look at a handbag!) is opposite on George V Avenue so lots of good shops, funky bars and restaurants with the Metro, taxi rank and bus stop virtually right outside the hotel. On booking my girlfriend had notified the hotel it was my 30th during our stay. On returning to the room on our first night from le Lido, the hotel had left a magnum of champagne on the bed with a greeting card wishing me a pleasurable stay. A very nice touch gratefully received. If you are looking for a comfortable hotel in a great location, with excellent staff who are willing to do that little bit extra, we highly recommend this place.

When we returned from Versailles tired and ready for bed, we found out that the unit was not fixed and the room was boiling hot. We had to sleep with the windows open and heard all the street noise below. Needless to say, they never fixed the unit, which is a shame since it is suppose to be a 4 star hotel.

As i said the location of the hotel is great, but if you have a room on the main road, then your gonna have some trouble since right in front of the hotel is a Iranian restaurant which turns into a club at night...your gonna hear it! The staff were not that great..not too friendly and seem to like to pass any request to the next guy on duty if possible, had to request a booking for a restaurant three times cuz they keep passing it to the next guy in line. All-in-all i would say its not that bad..but i would look for another hotel on my next visit to Pairs.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bari, Italy", "Title": "\u201ccolourful, excellent location, friendly atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "PaoloBA", "ReviewID": "UR64246427", "Content": "Very close to the metro.

The rooms are clean & brightly decorated, but a bit cramped in size. (Some would say the norm for Paris).
