From the first meeting of Gani Akel of Aura Suites it felt like coming back to an old friend. The place is modern with everything one needs. It feels like home rather then a hotel. The place is well appointed with areas divided into work, pleasure and rest areas. Well done and very happy.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexceptional service!\u201d", "Author": "steven r", "ReviewID": "UR127126870", "Content": "My family and I visited Istanbul recently and we decided to stay in Gayrettepe near some family friends who live in the area, we found the Aura suites online and decided to book as it was so close to our friends apartment. We were absolutely amazed, not only at the clean, comfortable, luxurious accommodation that we were given but even more so the friendly staff that were so kind and helpful, they really made our visit to Istanbul an absolute pleasure and we will definitely return later this year!! I can highly recommend these apartments for couples and families alike! The staff's helpful and professional attitude really made a special difference to our stay.

Aura Suites is highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience a luxury stay without paying luxurious money. Great suites, clean, relatively large, and noise free. Yes noise free is a luxury in Instanbul. Gayrettepe is a little bit far from touristy sites such as Sultanahmet but its well worth it bc our other family members who stayed in the Sultanahmet area complained about the noise level constantly. Although Gaytrettepe is not far from Bebek, the Georgetown (Washington, DC) of Istanbul. More over the staff at aura suites is 5-Star! Derya, Denniz, and the others are extremely helpful and hospital, I would stay there just for the quality of the staff!", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Shasta, California", "Title": "\u201cA Gem in the Big City\u201d", "Author": "Victoria L", "ReviewID": "UR120716856", "Content": "My week's stay in Istanbul was incredible and Aura Suites was outstanding as my \"home away from home\"...My one-bedroom penthouse suite was perfect in every way.

There was a moment when I had to plan a trip to Istanbul on a short notice and none of the big 5* hotels were available and this is how I found Aura Suites. To be honest I was a bit skeptical but I was impressed with what I found - very clean and cozy place, everything is brand new, it does feel like home and I couldn't see a lot of difference compared with the big 5*. Yes, there is no mini bar and no room service but most of the time I had dinner with my colleagues so it really didn't matter. And it does come with a price that the big 5* hotels can't beat (aprox. half of the price of a 5*). The personel were always nice and ready to assist. I had a great time at Aura and I will go back.
