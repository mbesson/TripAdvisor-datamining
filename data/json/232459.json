It is located next to the major city park, so the surrounding area is tranquil but also convenient to the museums and to very nice shops and restaurants. It's an easy walk to a major square (Leidseplein) where you can catch a tram to the center. However, it's also easy to walk the 15 minutes to the center. The staff is helpful and all speak excellent English. The better rooms are in the NEW part of the building, so be sure to ask for that side. Also, the deluxe rooms are worth the extra charge. Rooms are modern in design and a decent size, especially for Europe. Breakfast is extra at E15 - hot and cold food.

In all, if you seek this location and don't drive, consider the Piet Hein and book it online to save money and include breakfast, which I didn't have. There is something about the atmosphere that is inviting, especially the location, lobby, lighting, and service--and none of the narrow steps common to Amsterdam. The Piet Hein is on top of Vondel Park, the museums, good bakeries, and pretty good restaurants. Parking (and driving) are an Amsterdam disaster: bikers rule, costs are high (4 Euros/nearly $6 per hour) and tickets are frequent. You'd be wise to park at the Olympic Stadium for 8 Euros/day and tram 10 minutes (free) back/forth to the hotel. Americans will find rooms typically European smallish and dimly lit amidst the wave of \"green\" initiatives. Room decor and color are unexciting. Furnishings are typically sparse: a fair-sized table-desk & chair, a small vanity \"closet\" with a handful of hangers and a safe, and two small night tables. Some rooms have space for a small chair. Beds are comfy and low to the ground unless you upgrade to a higher, debateably oversoft bed. I was invited to compare rooms before choosing--typical of the excellent 24/7 service. Bathrooms are clean and compact with excellent water pressure and hot water--and the troublesome European moving shower head on a rail that faces out and sprays the curtain (and floor) barring extra caution. Counter space is so-so. WiFi is very come & go. The two lobby computers are often open and work well. Typical of mid-priced continental Europe, expect no extras such as a tram map, microwave, mini-fridge, tissues, or TV instruction or line-up, though the TV is good with many channels.

At check-in, we were cheerfully greeted by Nora, who was swift, efficient and friendly. She offered us a map of the city and to answer any questions we may have. It was a great first impression! Later, we interacted with Martin, who was just great. He was very outgoing, offered great suggestions for us first-time visitors and made reservations for us at a wonderful restaurant. Our room was quite nice. The contemporary nautical decor was pleasant and well-coordinated. Everything was in great shape and functioned flawlessly. The bathroom was small, but quite adequate. We are cold-natured, so I loved that we could open the windows to regulate the room's temperature. Had we not been able to open the windows, it may have been too warm. I suppose that suggests the heater worked well too. The only non-positive comment I have about our room was that the \"queen\" bed was actually composed of two pushed-together twin beds. This arrangement is awkward for those who like to sleep close to their significant other because the beds wouldn't stay together... Not a major problem, but one that detracted from our overall experience. We thought the hotel's breakfast was perfect. The food and drink offerings were excellent and varied, and the room in which it was staged was quite clean and pleasant. The staff who tended to the breakfast were attentive and diligent. Their breakfast was a great start to a long day of walking and sightseeing! Service at Hotel Piet Hein was excellent. There were several occasions where I called down for extra towels and they had them at my door in less than ten minutes every time. We once called down for hot water for tea and they brought up an electric carafe with tea cups, sugar, and spoons. That was more than we asked for and I thought it was great. Every person with whom we interacted at the front desk or in the breakfast room was fantastic. It was clear to me that they gave the comfort of their guest a high priority. As first-time visitors to Amsterdam, we weren't sure about the location, but it turned out to be a great one... Right by the peaceful Vondelpark and a short walk to the Leidseplein. It's a great comfort to know that when we visit Amsterdam again, we already know which hotel at which we'll stay...

I arrived late in the evening and only stayed one night, so can only judge the room and the breakfast. The room was clean but small with no view to speak of. It had an appropriate nautical theme since the hotel was named after Piet Hein, a famous Dutch admiral who conquered the Spanish silver fleet in 1628. The furniture consisted of a roomy bed, narrow table, narrow wardrobe and chair; there were no bedside tables. The bathroom had a comfortable bath and was very clean. It had a hair dryer but no accessories like bars of soap or little bottles of shampoo etc, only two liquid soap dispensers, shower cap and shoe polish and plastic cup. The wardrobe contained a portable safe and luggage stand and several hangers. The sheet covering the mattress was too small and could not be tucked in properly. For a longer stay this room might be too Spartan. The breakfast was excellent with crunchy croissants, warm boiled and scrambled eggs, cheese, different kinds of bread, tomatoes, yoghurt, fresh fruit salad and good coffee. The service at reception and in the breakfast room was very friendly. The location of the hotel is excellent in a peaceful, superior part of Amsterdam. It is beautifully situated along the Vondelpark, named after the most famous Dutch poet and playwright of the 17th century. The Vossiusstraat runs parallel to the PC Hooftstraat, one of the most fashionable shopping streets in Amsterdam. The Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum are only a short walk away, and the Concertgebouw is around the corner in the Van Baerlestraat. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Americain with its beautiful Art Deco interior is just across the canal near the famous Leidseplein. Transport facilities in this area are extremely efficient. Bus 197 goes directly from outside Schiphol airport to the Leidseplein in 20 minutes, with the stop Museumplein just opposite the Concertgebouw. Trams 5 and 2 take you to and from the Central Station. Canal cruises leave from Stadhouderskade, a few minutes from the hotel.

Hotels around IBC are generally expensive and get booked up very quickly. Hotel Piet Hein was recommended to me by a colleague around three years ago and I managed to book in last year, 2010 and made an advance booking for 2011. This year I booked for 5 nights but shared them with a colleague as I could only stay 2 nights Thursday & Friday. Last year I was in a very nice twin room at the front of the hotel on I think the second floor but this year in what appeared to be a relatively new single room at the rear overlooking the open patio. Both rooms were quiet; the hotel is just off the main street and I enjoyed good nights sleep on both occasions. (I do wish other guests could be a bit more considerate and not let their doors slam particularly late at night. It's not the doors by the way it's the guests!) I take B&B and the breakfast room is clean and efficient. The two or three friendly ladies appeared to be the same as in 2010 and actually bake the croisants & other rolls fresh. I normally have cereal and fruit but they have cooked and cheeses & ham too. There's no evening restaurant but the two nearby restaurants recommended to me have been excellent; this year it was the very good 'non-tourist) Pepper & Zout (Salt!) about five minutes walk away. The other was one of Amsterdam's best again 'non-tourist' steak houses about ten minutes walk away - also recommended to me by some Dutch friends. I've forgotten it's name but the Piet Hein receptionist will tell you. There is a friendly, vibrant bar which I used on both nights actually for a cup of Earl Grey tea before bed! There is free guest wifi which worked in my room(s) but on my iPhone I found it slightly frustrating as, unless your phone is doing something, it tended to forget the connection and you had to re-logon. I also found that I had to use the Gmail Safari page rather than the iPhone app possibily due to the hotel protecting their (& your) network security. There are also 4 good PCs in the bar / lobby area which I also made use of and never saw them all in use. If you're attending the RAI you can walk it in good weather in about 25mins or get to the centre of Amsterdam in around the same time or less dependent on where you're going.

I actually called the hotel to secure the reservation, making sure an executive double was available. It was to be the last stop on our 3 week trip to Europe and we planned to spend 6 nights there. We wanted to end on a high note. This would be our most expensive hotel at just under 200 Euros a night. Our taxi driver could not find the hotel but this is not an uncommon phenomenon. The hotel is situated on Vondelpark. The public entry is very stylish with a nice seating area, chic and busy small bar and a few computers near the front desk for the clients' use. The lobby has a young, business traveller feel. We were shown to a room on the top floor. All white. It was just large enough to hold the queen size bed and allow the room door to open. An attic room, the ceiling was slanted and a small beam ran down it so that in bed one would hit one's head if turning towards one's partner!! There was a small window looking out at the park. The bathroom was of almost equal size but had been modernized (but several things were in disrepair). I realized this was not the room I had seen on the website and thought an error in booking had occurred. Not so. This WAS the executive double. I urged the young man behind the desk to visit the website with me. I showed him the room that was pictured/offered and that I thought I had booked. \"I want that room!\", I said. It doesn't exist. The photo is a mock up that is intended to give a \"feeling\" of the style of the hotel!!!! I was furious. This was a clear case of misrepresentation. Much drama followed. We booked somewhere else and I threatened to slam the hotel on the internet. Finally 2 new behind-the-deskers worked with me to find a quiet, much less expensive \"older\" room. We ended up enjoying our stay. The reduced rate helped a lot. Breakfasts, included, are very good with ample amounts and choices. The staff were helpful with giving directions and calling cabs.

Unfortunately I couldn't find my email, so I reluctantly paid my bill and decided to just try and get the refund through management at a later time. I communicated with the hotel via email when I got back to the US, even forwarding the email proof, but to no avail.

You can walk to the centre of the city in 10-15 mins and there are many restaurants and bars close by. The decor of the hotel is fairly modern and stylish.

The breakfast was lovely, plenty of variety, great quality. The reception staff were very nice - they provided us with a map when we checked in, and marked the hotel location on it as well as some directions for us to get to various locations we might want to see. We later asked for restaurant recommendations, and we ended up in a fantastic place - I'm afraid I can't remember what it was called, but it was an excellent choice. They also helped us with the metro. The barman was also great, very friendly and chatty. There was free internet access in the lobby area.

I had booked us for a Tulip Time River Cruise for 9 days on Avalon Waterways. (that will not be reviewed here, other than let me say Hendrick, the cruise director we had made our experience first class.) We actually had two stays here. One for a couple days prior to our river cruise which we booked through Hotels.com and post-cruise I had booked directly with the hotel. I had many communications with the hotel staff prior to our arrival, since I wanted to make sure of many things prior to our departure from the U.S. They were always very prompt and courteous in responding to all my questions. Most times they responded within a couple hours, but certainly always within a day. (Don't forget the time zone changes from when I was writing them and actual work hours for the main staff.) On both of our stays we were roomed in the front of the hotel (the \"old part\") which faced Vondelpark. It does face a side street and I was concerned with street noise but that was absolutely not an issue. (Also remember we were there in April, so the windows did not have to be open due to warm weather. If you are visiting during more \"summery months\" and you're disturbed by noises, you may want to consider upgrading to a room with air conditioning.) We arrived quite early into Schiphol and caught a Connexxions hotel shuttle that dropped us off directly at the hotel. It was a great alternative for someone that doesn't want to pay taxi fees and you don't have to mess with the wonderful mass transit buses with a bunch of luggage. The shuttle dropped us off at Piet Hein well before the posted check-in time. I cannot say enough positive concerning the front desk staff! They were very kind to us and when they saw the haggard appearance of myself and my mother from the flight, rushed to have our room readied hours before the posted check-in time. They held our luggage in a secure room while we went out to have breakfast. Upon our return from getting food into our bellies the room was prepared and they offered to assist us with our baggage, however they were very busy at the time with other guests so I got mom into the room and then I made a second trip to the luggage room for our remaining bags. The room was on the smallish side, compared to U.S. hotels, however it was decently laid out and had all the amenities we needed. The room was quaint, with a nautical feel, befitting a country that is \"of the sea\". The bathroom was very modern with a double flush toilet (little flush/big flush) to conserve water. As found in most European hotels, they provide an \"all purpose\" liquid soap that is used for hand washing and bathing/washing hair (it is wonderful and unless you have special skin concerns, works superbly.) Note however, I had asked them if they provided wash cloths for bathing and they assured me they did. (My mother asked me to check on this, as when her mother went to England years before mentioned they are not supplied.) Through translation they didn't understand what I was asking and there were not wash cloths. There were hand towels, regular bath towels and a bath mat, but not a hand cloth to be found. **PLEASE NOTE** If you book through any hotel booking service other than directly through them the morning breakfast is NOT included in the cost of your hotel stay. Since the first stay was booked through Hotels.com breakfast would have been extra. We opted to catch something to eat at one of the many places in the vicinity. On our stay after our river cruise, which we had booked directly with the hotel, breakfast was included and we found it more than sufficient with the variety of items and the quality of the food provided. We loved the location of the hotel. Close to many of the museums we were interested in, overlooking Vondelpark and away from the hustle and bustle that we experienced when nearer to Centraal Station. Upon our return from the river cruise we had the room directly over our previous room. This had even more space in the room due to where a single closet was placed. It made a huge difference, even though the closet in the first room only took up approximately 6 sq feet near the beds. In the second room that closet was positioned near the entrance door and made a world of difference. When we were on the river cruise the boat did have wash cloths, (confession time) and one of them came up missing in our stateroom, which later served us well when we returned to the hotel. The section of the hotel we stayed in had an elevator making access to the rooms easy. I took the stairs many times and enjoyed the small amount of exercise going up and down. However the steps tend to be quite steep and my mother would have had difficulty in walking the stairs. So, again, fellow traveler, if this might be an issue for anyone in your party, check with the staff ahead of time to make sure this will not be an issue. In a review I had read, the traveler mentioned their room had a step or two from the floor of the sleeping area and the bathroom. I consulted with them prior to our departure to Amsterdam that our room would not have the steps, as my mother sometimes gets up in the middle of the night and I didn't want harm coming to her. In closing, is this the PERFECT hotel? No, one can always nitpick any accommodation apart. However, if one is looking for a reasonably price hotel, convenient to many of the museums and Vondelpark, a great desk staff that is more than willing to help you plan your day touring Amsterdam, and beds that are very comfortable, you could do MUCH worse than staying at the quaint Hotel Piet Hein.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cawesome and affordable\u201d", "Author": "interbum", "ReviewID": "UR16006209", "Content": "stayed there for 1 night in a double room. very pleasant atmosphere and helping staff. room was pretty big, but cousy and well decorated (if anyone finds it important). bathroom was clean and shiny. the place is well maintained, clean and smells good :) breakfast was the best I ever had in mid range hotels. the only downside is the 10 minute walk to tram. though in walking distance from major museums, and the near Vondelpark is a nice walk. an overall great hotel for the price (paid 100e inc brkfst), if this is your price range definitely take it.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "b'ham", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel\u201d", "Author": "babash", "ReviewID": "UR15605270", "Content": "Booked this hotel as a last minute deal for Queens Day.

It is a very modern-style boutique hotel, very well presented, and reasonably priced. They bill themselves as a 3 star. In a sense they are because it is relatively basic in facilities (such as no minibars), yet the overall impression is of a higher caliber. Call it a 3.5 star. My first night, I was on the top floor back, which is very quiet, overlooking a commons and the back of other buildings on the block. Personally, I rather like that sort of view. The room was a bit small, but had a nice bathroom and a nice double bed. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the heating system, so I was upgraded to a wonderful front room for my second night. It was larger, with bay windows overlooking Vondelpark. On the downside, the front rooms do get some street noise (cars, trams, buses), but it dies down after midnight. The beds were comfy, not quite as firm as I like, but fine. The rooms are modern, with some nice non-hotel feeling furniture, so in spite of being modern, there is some character to the rooms. There seems to be a nautical theme running through the place. The lobby is attractive, has a bar, a sitting area, and free internet access. If you are a business traveler without heavy demands, you will like this place. In fact, a lot of business travelers seem to stay there. I didn't try the breakfast, but it appeared to be a standard simple cold breakfast selection of bread, cereal, fruit cocktail, cheese, meats, hard boiled eggs, etc. Freshly toasted cheese and meat sandwiches were offered, though. I can't say enough good things about the staff. Anything I needed or wanted to know, they were on it. My only negative comments have to do with the bathrooms. The toilet paper dispenser, in my room anyway, was a bit of a reach, and the control fixtures in the shower were counter-intuitive. Being \"modern\", it took me a few minutes to get the hang of them. One knob is for water flow, the other is for temperature mix. But now I'm prepared for the next time I stay there :-). The Piet Hein is in a great location, 10 minutes or less walk from Leidseplein, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and high-street shopping.

I took the train from Schiphol to Central Station and the #5 tram from the station to the hotel. Public transportation in Amsterdam is excellent... user friendly and inexpensive. I arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the sight of scaffolding and the sound of power tools. The hotel is currently in the midst of extensive refurbishment, half of the ground floor is closed and under construction. The reception staff, situated at a table next to the bar, were efficient and professional. I was initially fearful when I was directed to my room in the basement, two floors down. I was traveling alone and expected my single room, (#204), to be small... and it was. The room was an ugly, dark shade of brown but was made much brighter by the very large window/door that opened onto the garden. Wow, what a surpise. I was thrilled to have outdoor space. The garden was lovely and well maintained. I was never bothered by construction noise in my room, (although it was audible during the day), simply closing my window/door blocked it out. I chatted with a couple of guests who were not as lucky. The room was clean and well presented. The twin bed was comfortable. I stocked up on bottled water and a few snacks from the Albert Heijn supermarket just a few blocks away so a refrigerator/mini bar would have been useful but there was none. The room did have a working safe and decent television reception. There is no restaurant in the hotel but breakfast is served and was included in my room rate. I'm embarrassed to admit that I was never up in time to take advantage of that. The lone piece of art on the walls was a sailing print, not bad for hotel decoration. The bathroom was a mixed bag. On the upside: it was clean and modern looking, and there was space to move about. On the downside: the soap and shampoo were one and the same and dispensed from a wall mounted fixture in the shower. Considering that traveling with liquids through airport security is such a hassle these days... it would have been better if there had been basic amenities. The hotel provided a shower cap and a shoe shine clothe. I'd rather had a decent bar of soap and a little bottle of shampoo. It didn't matter, I had the assortment I took from the Stockholm Sheraton. The towels were disappointingly thin and small. I booked this room on Expedia for \u00c2\u00a364 per night. I'm satisfied that I got value for money. The hotel has an excellent location: the tram stop is close, it's only a very short walk to Leidsplein, Vondel Park is right across the street, the major museums are within easy walking distance, and there are plenty of good cafes and resturants nearby.

At this hotel they have 1 or 2 staff members on a good day taking care of requests, and most often you have to \"push\" to get help with something. I found they were not well informed and felt it was very much like a \"self service\" experience. My advise, if you can afford it spend the money on a better hotel, possibly with a doorman that can add extra piece of mind.

The room was not big but comfortable. The path to the bathroom is quite unique as the bathroom was elevated so you have to take a few steps up (see photos). Room-wise, adding to the previous review - the bed was good, firm and very comfortable. They were generous with pillows, about 4 comfortable pillows on the double bed. The room was clean and we had a window overlooking a quiet backyard/ roof.....the room has no aircond - so it can get slightly stuffy but because it gets quite cool in the night (we were there in early Autumn, late Sept) and we were out most of the day, it didn't bother us much as we left the windows open. But I can imagine it can get quite hot in the summer months and the room gets quite direct sunlight. Otherwise, even with the window open, the room was very quiet, ensuring a good night's rest. The bathroom - very clean and modern. But just some comments - the sink was a little shallow and the tap a bit high, so when you wash up at the sink, water do tend to splash out a little. And the space around the sink area is a little cramped. And there's a soap dispenser which serves as shampoo, shower gel and soap all in one....so if you are not comfortable with that, best to bring your own toiletries, which was what we did so this didn't really bother us. The other thing which we thought was a little on the downside was the shower curtains needs some cleaning. As it's black in colour, we could see quite clearly thick soap/ shampoo stains from the previous guests. The breakfast at the hotel's very good. The spread is good and they've got really yummy eggs (hardboiled though), cereal and muesli, fresh fruit juices, bread sprinkles, cheeses, ham and salami and a good variety of tea and coffee. All served in a lovely cosy breakfast room. We loved and enjoyed the breakfast very much! The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and warm. The hotel is in a good location and we feel safe (no drunks or rowdy people or anything like that) in the area even when we were walking along the streets late at night. The hotel is about 5-10 minutes walk to/ from the tram stop which is just up the street from the Van Gogh Museum and a few minutes walk to some trendy branded shops.

Also the room next door had a balacony so the people would stand on the balancony and make phone calls very loudly. I would have complained but we were only there for three days Apart from these small problems if we went back to Amsterdam we would definatly go back to this hotel. I hope this helps anyone thinking of booking this hotel, it was a lovely hotel and the doors do have locks on them to stop housekeeping from coming in!!!", "Date": "May 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3493688", "Content": "Just spent three night at this hotel. We had booked well in advance, and as such were allocated a brilliant room overlooking the park with a terrace. I imangine not all rooms this great, so you may want to ask for it. The location was perfect for our needs, in that we were happy to be a little removed from the complete bustle of the red light district / central station area. This hotel is remarkably close to the Museum district, and has great upscale shopping and non-chain restaurants within a short walk. It is no problem to get downtown by walking or hopping on a tram. Very pleasant and helpful staff.

This hotel has a very comfortable and modern lounge/bar area in the lobby where you can get snacks and use the internet (for a fee). Most of the staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful, except for one female staff member, but the others made up for her snooty attitude. The hotel has a modern lift. Our rooms were the \"deluxe\" twin and double rooms. They were small indeed, however, they were very clean and ultra-modern. The weather during our stay was very cool and damp, and one of the rooms did not have any heat as the air conditioning was already turned on for the season. We had requested rooms on the upper floors but my room was on a floor where my window was at ground level, but at least it had a hot water heater. The duvets were very warm and comfy. We were able to purchase strip-tickets for the tram at the hotel. To reach the tram stop you had to walk about two blocks along the side of Vondel Park. The location was quite good, within walking distance of the Casino, many restaurants (including Pizza Hut), and the canal tours. I recommend this hotel if you don't mind tiny rooms.", "Date": "May 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cGood value--but a few kinks\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3418972", "Content": "My wife and I loved this hotel at first--friendly staff, great location, good value. But a few things bothered us. On our first day, the housekeeper walked in while we were in the room. She knocked first, but apparently didn't hear us yell that we were inside. Both nights of our stay, I found it tough to sleep because the trams right outside our window were really loud. Finally, the morning we were to leave, we asked for a wake-up call that never came. The room didn't have an alarm clock so we were depending on it. Fortunately I was awake from the trams, but I would have been really upset if we'd missed our train because they missed the wake-up call. Maybe we just had bad luck...apart from these isolated problems, the hotel was comfortable and pleasant.", "Date": "April 27, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Piet Hein", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d232459-Reviews-Hotel_Piet_Hein-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$128 - $229*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Vossiusstraat 52 - 53</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1071 AK</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232459", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7d/0b/7d0bf8aa122c80961e5324ec70288b255large.jpg"}}
