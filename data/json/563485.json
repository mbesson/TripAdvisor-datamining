Overall, the room was spacious and clean. It had all the things as advertised. Internet access in the room was for extra charge, whilst free Wi-Fi could be used in the lobby. Breakfast offered plenty of choice to please everybody. Location-wise, a tube station was 3 mins walk and Brandenburg Tor about 20 mins walk away. However I would warn people about the following: 1. the bathroom provides hand/body wash only (apart from towels). No shampoo/body lotion or any other of the usual bits are provided. 2. the hotel was very busy due to several school trips staying there. This caused a delay at breakfast time as the tables weren't cleaned fast enough. Also the students were very busy at night, in the hallways, running up and down the stairs etc. 3. when we arrived at about 11pm, the receptionist informed us that due to an earlier problem with their booking system they oversold their rooms and hence they will have to provide us with a different accommodation just down the road, just for one night. Note: I paid for my room in advance! However we were adamant to stay in one hotel for the whole stay and refused to go anywhere else just for one night.

We arrived late afternoon and were immediately struck by the friendliness and efficiency of the reception staff. I felt the need to practise my German which is rather poor and they were patient with me and helped me when I got stuck. They could have just changed to English because all the staff were much better in English than I was in German! The room itself was the usual basic HIE room but comfortable and spotlessly clean. As usual, the room was too warm so we kept the window open (we also enjoy fresh air) but it is a busy road so we struggled a bit to sleep the first night. After that, we had got used to the noise and slept like logs. Breakfast was superb. On two of the mornings, it was very busy but the personnel were continually refreshing the food, breads and juices. The food was fresh and tasty, the coffee hot and generally, more so as it is part of a very reasonable price, the breakfast is excellent. The bar is small and, if the reception is busy you may have to wait a bit for service but they will get to you as soon as they possibly can. Prices are what you would expect to pay in an hotel and not too much over the top. The hotel is very close to many of the tourist sites, both those in the guide books and those that do not rate a mention. The Topographie des Terrors Documentation Centre is just around the corner; Checkpoint Charlie is just a 5 to 10 minute stroll away and don't forget to go to Fassbender & Rausch chocolate factory just a couple of minutes from CC. Even if you do not eat chocolate, some of the things they do with it are fantastic. Take your camera with you. A little hint, if you want to go to the Reichstag (more commonly known as the Bundestag now) you must make a booking on-line (https://visite.bundestag.de/BAPWeb/pages/createBookingRequest.jsf?lang=en). Best to do this at least 3 days before to make sure that you can get a convenient time. They will send you a confirmation e-mail and you need to print this out and take it with you. Also make sure that you take photographi id with you - passport or drivers licence. We got there about 30 minutes before our entry time and were allowed straight in but in peak tourist periods they may not be quite as flexible. All I can say is do not let the preparation admin put you off because it is well worth it and it is free after all. There are a couple of really good restaurants very close to the hotel (it only does breakfast but has no problem with you bringing in take-aways if that it what you want). I can recommend the Cafe Stresemann (cash only - no cards) which does German food cooked freshly when you order and the Diomira Italian restaurant (if you are in the back part of this restaurant, your card will probably not work but there is usually no problem in the front - guess it must just be the signal). Back to the hotel, we checked out Saturday morning although our flight was only later in the afternoon. The hotel has a locked luggage room where they will keep your luggage for you until you are ready to go. Gave us a chance to have another walk around and even discover something which we had missed in the previous 2 days! To sum up, Berlin is a must to visit and we plan to go back again in the near future; the Holiday Inn Express Berlin City Centre is an ideal place to stay if you are on a budget, the staff are excellent, the beer is quaffable, the food edible (helps if, like me, you enjoy German food which can be quite stodgy), the public transport excellent and most things are easy to get to.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Clean\u201d", "Author": "emandernie", "ReviewID": "UR125780567", "Content": "9 minutes from Potsdamer Platz says it all.

The rooms were quite warm though and changing the temp/fan settings didn't seem to do much, but it wasn't a major issue. Breakfast was satisfactory as I knew what to expect; just a selection of meats, cheese and the usual continental stuff, but seeing as it was included with the room and still cheaper than other hotels in the area I was happy.

Only reception people deserves appreciation. They were kind, helpful and what most important - professional. The rest about this hotel is disaster. Old room with stains on carpet. TV with magic function - to change volume it is not enough to press volume up/down button - it has no effect. I discovered, that going to 'menu' function (which actually is disabled) enables volume change button (seriously) Air-con noisy with no effect on changing temperature. It heats all the time. Only potion is to turn it off. Heating/cooling - no effect. Only increasing noise on fan mode 1-3 reacts. Bizzare toilet doors which are apparently fingers crackers. (seriously be really careful). Welcome surprise - shower is set to maximum hot water - which is nearly boiling! Just malicious behave of houskeeping mates. Another malicious behaviour was that after 2 days of using free sachets of regular coffee it was replenished with decaffeinated - seems like attempt of cutting usage. There was no option - I had to buy my own from nearby Netto shop. Breakfast - only cold sandwich meat, lots of type of bread, some hard boiled eggs, jam and cereals, tea, coffee, milk - nothing impressive. 'Non smoking' hotel - so guests have to crowd in front (at December in Berlin is about 2 deg C) to smoke a cigarette. (otherwise 200 euro fine) No utensils - toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, shaving tools. There is an information, saying 'if you forgotten something - ask in reception' - I couldn't be bothered. So I bought my own in nearby 'Spate Kauf' shop from nice Asian guy. I am just wondering, as I had no iron with me - will they expect to carry that?! There was no iron in room. Basically, as I wrote before everything, except reception stuff seems to try to make your day bad and make you feel unwelcome.

Front desk folks aren't really helpful so don't expect much. I actually asked one of the food servers for travel advice and they were pretty helpful. All in all... you get what you pay for so not a bad option. One good tip, from the front of the hotel, keep going straight and make a right at the very next street and park on the street instead of paying to use hotel parking (16 Euro).

The Holiday Inn Express is a typical European HIX hotel. Basic rooms, simple free breakfast, basic service. Rooms are a bit Ikea-like but nothing wrong with it. Perfectly suitable for 3* Hotel. Beds are on the small side and could be more comfy though. Shower pressure decent, but not great (6th floor). Location: The location of the HIX Berlin City Centre is very good - although the street itself is rather dull and nothing special, but in a couple of minutes you are at Anhalter Bahnhof, where you can take various S-Bahn lines, or you can walk in about 10 minutes to Potsdammer Platz, where you can take S-Bahn, U-Bahn and RE lines. Also bus stops within a few minutes walk from the hotel. Pretty much all major attractions in Berlin (the city doesn't have a real city center - they are quite spread out over the city) can be reached in max 15-20 minutes travel in total. This makes the hotel a perfect location to explore the great city of Berlin! Priority Club: Did not get anything as Platinum member of Priority Club (not even after asking about it). I know they can't upgrade me as they only have one room type, so that's fine - but free/discounted internet, a drink voucher, anything really would have been nice. I really don't like the IHG hotels who ignore platinum status. As PC Member (any status) she said we would get a newspaper, but 4 days in a row and I've never seen one. Staff: Most staff was friendly, spoke English very well and helped us with whatever we needed. Girl at reception even complimented about the good rate we got, so I suppose we did get a good deal :) Summary: Positives: - Free breakfast (basic) - Central location - with public transport you're at all major spots in no time (24/7 public transport!). Never had to use a taxi! - Free Wi-Fi in lobby (see negatives though) - Good value for money - Rooms are in good condition - Friendly, English speaking staff Negatives: - Internet in-room too expensive (15 EUR per day or 4 EUR per hour) - Absolutely no Priority Club Platinum benefits - Old CRT tv's with limited English channels - Beds on the small side - No hot items with breakfast (I thought all HIX's had hot items now as well in Europe?)", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and good value\u201d", "Author": "sleepzz", "ReviewID": "UR92010869", "Content": "Stayed here on new years eve.

When I called the hotel to correct their error, the guy at the front desk gave me a hard time, until I pointed out that his colleague was the one who made the error, not me. During the stay, the front desk staff provided inaccurate information about public transport. After convincing me to take a bus (I wanted to use the subways), they didn\u2019t change my 20 euro note, saying that the bus driver would make change. That was not correct\u2014it seemed that correct change was needed, as is the case in North America., But the most serious problem occurred at checkout. They tried to charge me for Internet use. I was kind of taken aback; the website specifically mentions complimentary access. Furthermore, when I connected to the net in my room, no splash page appeared warning of the charge, as is typical of all hotels. The guy at the front desk said I was supposed to be told at check in. I wasn\u2019t. When he said that he had to charge me for the service, I told him he could, and the first thing I would do is put the charge into dispute. He relented. I went back and checked the web page\u2014in bold face type, it says, \u201cComplimentary Internet access\u201d and in non-bold type (almost guaranteed to be missed), it then says, \u201cin the lobby.\u201d Furthermore, the site never specifically mentions there\u2019s a charge for access in rooms. This\u2014coupled with the failure of the staff to mention this at check-in and the lack of a splash screen warning that every other hotel (including all of the other ones in the Intercontinental chain)\u2014makes me believe that this is a scam to scrounge up a few extra euros from clueless travelers.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shrewsbury", "Title": "\u201cVery good all-round\u201d", "Author": "GB40", "ReviewID": "UR57054449", "Content": "I stayed in the HI Express and the good thing about decent quality chain hotels is that you know what to expect.

Several major attractions are within 30 mins walk including Brandenburger Tor, DDR Museum, Wall Museum, Friedrichstrasse, Unter-den-Linden and more.

Tea and coffee making facilities were provided. A polite notice in the bathroom advises that if you have forgotten a personal item i.e. toothbrush, razor etc. to contact reception for one. After we unpacked, we went to reception and asked another team member for directions to one of the Christmas markets. She was extremely helpful, recommended the Gendarmenmarkt as the prettiest, gave us walking instructions (approx 20 minutes at a leisurely pace) and advised us that we could take in a little sightseeing on the way as we would pass Checkpoint Charlie. Again another member of staff who treated us as very welcomed guests. The next morning we found that the kettle in the room would only work by holding your finger on the switch. After breakfast, I reported it at reception and was told a technician would be sent to fix it. It was replaced by the time we returned. Breakfast was excellent - a choice of fruit juices, tea, coffee etc. a choice of cereals, several varieties of bread for toast, a mixture of rolls, croissants, preserves, a variety of meats and cheese and pastries.

They have a room set aside for luggage which is very secure - a receipt is given for your cases, which you have to provide on collection. When we collected our luggage, the reception staff were still very welcoming, wishing us a pleasant flight etc. For us, the mark of a good hotel is how welcome you are made to feel, services provided and how quick any issues that arise are resolved.

This violation of privacy did not result in anything notably being stolen, but it is a major breach of trust when someone enters your room without your consent. When I brought this to the attention of the Holiday Inn staff, they said the housekeeping was contracted out and they'd file a note with them to make sure it didn't happen again; I was told I could not speak with the company directly which was also frustrating. If I returned to Berlin, I'd probably look to stay elsewhere where I could get better parking rates (if I needed to park) in a better neighborhood. If the Holiday Inn was considerably cheaper, I'd consider staying again, but I'm not confident in the current leadership team based on my previous experience.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottish Borders", "Title": "\u201cvery clean\u201d", "Author": "Revier", "ReviewID": "UR28925527", "Content": "Arrived in morning and booked into room immediately by pleasant young man on reception.

I knew that would be a basic standard 3* star hotel but after reading all the great reviews I thought it would be worth booking. The location of the hotel is very good, as it is close to Postdamer Plaz and Checkpoint Charlie etc. We arrive around 2pm on Friday and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist so the 1st signs seemed positive. We were given a room on the 2nd floor although I had requested a higher floor and it was a smoking room although I had asked for a non smoking room on the booking. That was fine as we were excited to be in Berlin and wanted to start seeing the city. My Mom then looked out the window to see there was a large construction site beside the hotel. As it was Friday we thought there would be no work going on over the weekend so decided not to change rooms. This was a mistake as at 7am on Saturday morning, four workmen arrived and start making a hell of a noise. I went down to reception at 7.30 am to request a different room away from the noise and was not impressed with the attitude of the receptionist. She did agree to change the room and we received a room on the 5th floor away from the construction site later that day. The hotel should really be informing people about the construction site when making bookings and they were not interested in hearing this when we were leaving on Monday. My wife speaks german so it was not down to a language barrier. The rooms in the hotel are fine, basic but that is what I expected. The carpets and blankets in the rooms are old. The bed is comfortable but the quilt is very light and we had to request extra pillows. The breakfast is good, nothing to get excited about but does the job to start a day of sightseeing. This really is a very average hotel and I really don`t get the other reviews on this site. Of course for the price I should only except an average hotel but after reading all the reviews I really was looking forward to staying in the hotel. IBIS Hotel are in the same area closer to the U Bann and would be a better option. One thing I do agree with about the other reviews is the Italian Restaurant across the road from the hotel. The food is great and so cheap, we live in Dublin so were shocked at the prices and the quality of the food. The customer service in the restaurant is 1st class and they could teach the staff in the hotel how to behave. Berlin is a great city, and we will return and maybe even stay in the same area but not in Express Hotel Inn. Also one tip Berlin has some great places to see, but make sure to check the Film Haus in the Sony center it is a brilliant museum.

Bread products were plentiful and the cornerstone of the breakfast offering - a wide selection including croissants and mini-doughnuts as well as seeded breads. Seating in the breakfast room is inadequate for peak times (from approximately 8:00am) so expect to share a table with other guests. This hotel has a bar, which is a rarity among Expresses, but breakfast is the only food served in this hotel. Overall this was an excellent hotel, the inadequate staffing didn't seriously affect my experience merely because I only had to deal with them once, and I would certainly stay here again in future - it is one of the few Berlin hotels with both reasonable rates and a practical location.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales UK", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "cdbritten", "ReviewID": "UR15630894", "Content": "A great hotel.

The young man recommended a real German restaurant down the street and to the right, but when we visited it, we could see the clouds of smoke so we didn't go in. It will be nice when Germany joins the majority of Europe and bans smoking inside. Our room was on the top floor, at the end of the hall, and in a corner. The view from the room was nasty-a fenced in building with standing water all around. The area was being updated and will probably contain more glass and steel in the coming years. All in all, the area was very safe, and we had no problem walking around, even after it finally got dark after 10 pm. The room had two twin beds, a/c, a tv, desk, etc. (typical Holiday Inn Express but smaller than in US but good size for Europe) The bathroom layout was weird. The bathroom was divided in 3 sections: the toilet area, the shower, and the area around the sink. There was only one door so the entire bathroom was closed or just the toilet section as the door swivelled from one to the other. The strange thing was the frosted window between the shower and the toilet parts. There was no privacy if one was on the toilet and someone needed to shower or use the sink. I guess ditto if one wanted to take a shower and others wanted to use the toilet? That was about the only negative of the room. I thought the hotel was mostly empty until we went to breakfast the next morning. There were several tables in 2 (maybe 3 I forget) rooms. Cheese, meats, breads, boiled eggs, coffee/tea, and similar were available and plenty for breakfast. It appeared that restocking was done continously. I like the strong European coffee and filled my cup up with Expresso (it took 4 times since you only get an ounce or two at a time) My friend had the American strength coffee, which could be acquired with one push of the coffee machine, and said it was good. As at all Holiday Inn Expresses, breakfast was included with the room. After we had found our room and freshened up, we went walking. The guy at the front desk provided decent directions since I did not have a German or Berlin travel book. We walked to Checkpoint Charlie and then into old East Berlin. It was hard to believe that just 18 years ago, there was a wall, armed military, etc., but today, one can just walk by and see everything. There seemed to be a lot of newness on the former East Berlin side. The were some new facades on some of the older buildings. We walked back to the former wall location (there are double bricks which make a path where the wall was). There is one area near the Brandenburg Gate where some of the wall still remains. There is also an interesting memorial that appears to be hundreds of unmarked, above ground graves. The area around the gate was spectacular. We flew from Venice to Berlin on the worst and scariest flight ever-TUIfly airlines. Avoid unless you like thrill rides. We sat on the tarmac 20-30 minutes in a pounding rain/wind storm and then took off into the storm after in moved past the Venice airport. Arriving at Tegel (the primary airport for US and western European airlines) was easy. Per the hotel's recommendations, we took the bus to the main train station area and then changed for the bus that dropped us off 200 meters from the hotel. The ticket costs 2.10 euros. Take the TXL bus to Hautbahnoff and change to the M41 (direction Sonnenallee) until Anhalte Bahnoff. When getting off the bus, head forward (the same direction the bus was heading at the stop). There were many trees, and the hotel wasn't visible right away. When we left the next morning, we walked back to the same area but crossed the street and saw the bus stop about 20 meters ahead. We flew Easy Jet from Berlin Schonefeld (the old East Berlin airport) to Tallinn, Estonia. Great flight and no complaints. You can tell the difference between Tegel and Schonefeld (west versus east)..We changed at the Hautbahnoff stop for a train (S something), and the cost was the same: 2.10 euros. To sum up about the hotel, except for the bathroom layout, I thought it was great. The room was spotless, the area we were in was very quiet, the people at the front desk and those in the breakfast area all seemed nice and professional. There was free internet access in the lobby, but it wasn't available when I needed it so I never used it. I'm glad we were on the top floor in the corner because it was probably noisier in the areas where all of those on tour busses were staying. I would definitely stay there again and think the location for the price is unbeatable (even though I stayed free with Reward Points, the prices I saw were very decent).

We were able to walk to Topography of Terror, Checkpoint Charlie, and Potsdamerplatz easily even in the rain. We also walked to Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag which were about 20 minutes away. S-bahn stop was very close, which we were able to take to Potsdam with one change of trains. The hotel was very clean and modern - great value. There was a good Italian restaurant across the street (much cuter on the inside than outside) and several restaurants in Potsdamerplatz area. The block that the hotel is on is pretty quiet. We had requested a twin bed room, but received a room with one full bed. After complaining, we were informed that there were no twin bed rooms available, but were sent a rollaway bed. The rollaway bed was actually pretty comfortable. The air conditioning was not working (maybe because it was still early May), but was able to keep the room cool with the window open. Unfortunately, there was a loose plastic strip outside the window that would make flapping noises when the wind blew, making it difficult to sleep. The room itself was very clean and had cable tv with CNN. The bathroom seemed new and clean as well. We must have had a handicapped accessible room, though, because the shower had no lip, just a drain in the floor and shower curtain. This caused most of the floor (even beyond the shower curtain) to get wet. We also had a chair in the shower, which got in the way of standing close to the shower head. However, the water pressure was excellent and there was plenty of hot water. The hair dryer is located outside of the bathroom (which I thought was a plus as I could blow dry my hair while someone else was in the bathroom) and was pretty powerful for a hotel hair dryer. It was also next to a full length mirror. I know that several rooms have a pull out couch, but ours did not. The breakfast was good by European standards. There was a variety of cold meats and cheeses, breads, fresh fruit, cereals, and juices. There was a toaster and a coffee/cappuccino/espresso/latte machine, which were both pluses. I noticed at breakfast that several tour bus groups were staying at this hotel (mostly German speaking, I believe).

We stayed for a week here because we thought the location was good and we thought we would get value for money. Firstly the good points: Very very clean rooms, everything is kept spotless. All fittings are modern, this hotel is only a year old. Finally, the bad points: U-Bahn ten minutes walk, S-Bahn fives minutes but Anhalter Bahnhof is pretty useless anyway. There is no internet at this hotel. The hotel website says they have a business corner, but when you ask for it they point to a chair and a desk in the front of reception!!! This is a joke for a modern hotel not to have free internet!!! I was woken up the first night with the sound of a huge extractor fan at 01:30am from the courtyard area which went on for twenty minutes. I heard this again once in the afternoon, but I didn't appreciate being kept awake on my first night. The TV system is analogue, which is useless for a modern hotel as they only have CNN, BBC World and Eurosport in English. BBC World are switching off their analogue feed next month so not sure what they'll do then. For a business hotel I demand CNBC or Bloomberg, and they have neither. The breakfast buffet is okay, but there's no hot food at all. There's only so much I can take of cereal and bread rolls, although the coffee machines do serve good coffee. The beds were very comfortable, except the pillows are just small bits of foam which are useless and irritating. The shower curtain gets sucked into the shower cubicle when you take a shower which is very unpleasant. Additionally the extractor fan in the toilet makes such a loud noise it will keep you awake. A little tip is to stuff some toilet paper into it, but remember to take it out when you leave! I will not stay here again. Although the hotel is clean and modern you must remember it is a \"limited service hotel\" (they're own words) which means that you should be grateful to get what you've booked.

The breakfast is what you expect in Germany - rolls, cheese, cold meats, croissants, cereal etc. There is no restaurant in the hotel but we would definitely recommend the Italian directly across the road. It serves delicious food at unbelieveably low prices. The only negative comment is that we left our towels on the floor (to request clean ones) and the towels were not replaced that day.

I thought the hotel was great value and in an excellent location for this purpose. The S-Bahn 'Anhalter Bahnoff' was about 5 minutes walk and that allowed easy access to Berlin's transport system. Potsdamer Platz was about 10-15 minutes walk away with other local sights such as the Branderburg Tor about 2 minutes further along. Breakfast was lovely - a typical continental buffet with bread, rolls, cheese, ham, cereals, fruit etc. The staff were friendly and most helpful given that our German was pitiful. The bedrooms were clean, bathrooms small but shower wonderful - and the beds very comfortable (and long which is a bonus if you're tall as I am). Should i return to Berlin for further sightseeing I would definately stay at this hotel again - and most definately recommend it to anyone who is visiting Berlin for that purpose. I think if it's more of a party break it may be worth staying in a hotel closer to the nightlife though as albeit that the transport system was excellent, we were that tired from our busy days we didn't make it past 10pm.

Now the good news - the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful (with everything from local maps to telling me the location of the nearest grocery store to calling a taxi for me); the buffet breakfast is above average for most European hotels (several cereals to choose from, deli meats, various cheeses, large variety of breads, good coffee, and hard boiled eggs; however, there were no \"hot\" items such as scrambled eggs, soft boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc); the hotel is in an excellent location (10 min walk to Checkpoint Charlie, 2 min walk to S-bahn station, 10 min walk to Patsdammer Platz, 15 min walk to Brandenberg Gate); and the price is right!
