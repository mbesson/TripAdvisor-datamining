From the time Giorgio picked us up from the airport, we felt like we were part of his family. He went out of his way to answer questions, even had several discussions about Italy, family life, etc. Giorgio and Fulvio are charming and gracious hosts! My girlfriend and I shared the bedroom with the private bath which was adequate both in size and comfort. Even though the pigneto district is not at the center of Rome, it doesn't take long to get to the termini stazione where tram, bus, and metro can be accessed. The neighborhood is charming and artsy with many small shops, gelaterias, restaurants, etc. If you want to feel like a Roman and not a tourist, this is the place for you. We rarely saw other guests and came to feel like this was our own private flat in Rome.

It all changed when host Giorgio arrived (we were first met by Fulvio, who doesn't speak much English). He was full of life and seemed genuinely excited to see people come and appreciate Rome and its rich culture, he was even kind enough to answer questions unrelated to sights/eating at lenght and depth. He helped us a lot by recommending what places we should see first, how to plan our route and also local restaurants and markets. Both in Pigneto and our little B&B you can sense the native atmosphere which is hardly found in the touristy areas. The B&B is basically flat and you feel right at home. The small Pigneto quarter is filled with bars, food stores and restaurants run by locals. While the location is not the nearest to the centre, it is very convenient to go the Rome center by tram or bus, it will take up between 30 minutes and 1 hour to most tourist attractions. The breakfast doesn't change day-to-day and is quite generic (toast, ham, cheese, jam, tea or coffee, juice), but if you feel you lack something, Fulvio assists and brings more. By the way, you can choose the breakfast time yourselves, as long as it is reasonable. There are three rooms, one is with an internal bathroom (but it has no internal entrance to the lovely terrace), we have been in this one and after a while (we stayed 7 nights around New Year time) moved to another room and it was equally fine, because the external bathroom is used by guests from two only rooms + now we had a direct entrance to the terrace. It is important to mark that all this is for a wonderful value. Other hotels at this price range seemed run of the mill, none had this kind of an authentic vibe. All in all, we loved our trip to Rome and we highly recommend Abitazione Pigneto if you do not mind spending some time on public transport while you go sight-seeing!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cOutside the main city but very close by\u201d", "Author": "Jane S", "ReviewID": "UR119643062", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this B&B outside the main part of the city. As we anticipated being sleep deprived and our first time in Rome, we arranged for Giorgio to pick us up at the airport. His service was less than taking a taxi cab. He was animated and shared his love of the city. As we were driving to his residence, we mentioned that we would be meeting friends the next morning. He made a detour and showed us where we would be meeting and where the bus stop/subway station was. He didn't want us to get lost! He gave us a map as well and on the backside of the map how to get back if you are at Colosseum, Vatican, etc. The residence was on the 4th floor of a building a block off a main street. We stayed in the room with the queen bed which was very comfortable. The room was clean though small. We had no place to put our suitcase when it was opened other than our bed. On the main street we could catch the bus or tram to take into the historic part of Rome. The street behind the B&B was a pedestrian mall where farmers sold their goods during the day and cafes and bars set their tables and chairs out in the evening. On the pedestrian mall was a supermarket where we were able to buy wine, cheese, bread to have in on the terrace off our bedroom in the afternoons/evenings. The shared bathroom was not a problem and always available for our use. We were served breakfast either on the terrace or in the small common room. Breakfast was somewhat minimal - delicious juice, a few slices of cheese, meat and a slice of dry toast each. The negative that we had is the noise in the evening. We had the door open to the terrace and could hear music from the nearby bars, breaking of glass, automobile alarms going off. We went to sleep one night to a combination of Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire\" and an Elvis Presley medley. That went on till about 3 AM. If we were younger, we probably would have loved it but being in our late 50's and mid 60's, we were tired and wanted to go to sleep at midnight! We were leaving for a cruise and Flavio drove us to the Port which made it very convenient for us. Giorgio and Flavio were excellent hosts. A great place to stay, convenient to many things. It was a wonderful value for the money we spent.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGreate place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Czerwi", "ReviewID": "UR118416395", "Content": "A the begining of 2011 I was visiting Italy with my girlfriend, Rome was a 'must see' place during the trip. We stayed 4 nights in this cute B&B, really amazed by its owners hospitality and kindness. Giorgio (owner) gave us a lot of advices where to go and what too see, what is overrated and how to travel around the town in the fastest way. If you have any problem the owner is living at a flat next to B&B, but I doubt that you will have any. Place is divided into 3 rooms for guests, one of them have private bathroom, two others share one. There is also a kitchen with refrigerator for personal use, computer with free internet, maps and pocket guides. Everything is really clean and cozy. It`s a pity that his place is a little bit far from interesting places (thats why i didnt give max stars), although there is a bus and tram stop nearby. We walked a lot around Rome and usually go back to B&B by foot - even at late night. As Giorgio said neighborhood is safe and you sholud only look out for pickpockets. Nearby you can find shops, cafes and quite good places to having something to eat. At night many bars are being opened and you can taste Italian wine or beer. In short words - if only it was a little bit closer to the center it would be really perfect.

Giorgio, the owner, was extremely kind and hospitable - he was also flexible with us leaving our bags and having us drop off our room key later to work with our late departure. It was nice having our own private bathroom which was spacious (note: the water pressure wasn't the greatest and there was a slight smell at times - not sure if that was from outside or inside). That aside, the room was great, decorated with different art on the wall, shutter windows with a view, our room had a TV (which we didn't ever use - who comes to Rome to watch TV anyway :-) . There is no wireless at this B&B but there is a computer with internet that you're free to use. Breakfast each morning was great - delicious meats & cheeses, toast, juice & coffee - a real plus that we missed when we stayed at other hotels without breakfast (saves you time & $ in getting started with your day!). There is a nearby market open daily with delicious fruits, colourful clothes, and other items (on Sunday it was more of an interesting yard sale/antique display), which is fun to check out on your way to the bus stop.

The value is unbeatable and I would suggest booking directly with Giorgio and not with a third party website because your rate will be lower. The room we had was comfortable, though we shared a bathroom with another room (there is a room that has its own bathroom that is more expensive). The only marginal downside of this hotel is that it is located outside the center of Rome near Ponte Casilino and so it's a bit challenging to get to the tourist sites. It took us about a half day to learn the transportation and there are buses and a light rail that connect you quickly. But, it adds time to your day and it is something consider.

Stay at the Pigneto . . .\u201d", "Author": "vershaz", "ReviewID": "UR7414877", "Content": "The Abitazione Pigneto is located in an apartment building in a beautiful tree-lined neighbourhood in the suburbs of Rome. It about twenty minutes from the Colosseum by bus, which you can catch at a bus stop just a two minute walk away (a line on that stop also takes you directly to Termini station). The bed and breakfast is run by Giorgio and his business partner Fulvio, who are gracious hosts. We stayed here three nights and had a great experience. The B&B is actually an apartment with three bedrooms, a shared bath, a kitchen, a dining room, and an entrance hall. Giorgio and Fulvio live across the hall on the same floor, but the B&B was originally Giorgio's home and he still treats it as such. He loves the flat and the dynamic interplay of eclectic and colorful furnishings in each room, especially the artwork and artifacts littered everywhere, reflects it; it truly feels like a home and feels very \"Roman.\" Our room was large and had an extra day-bed in it. Our bed was low to the ground, but comfortable. There is a shared balcony for some of the rooms, which looks over the street and the neighbourhood. We didn't find it noisy at all, except for a few cars gunning their engines around mid-evening. It's a real neighbourhood, so your view and experience will be of a real neighbourhood, but this is not a drawback. You'll truly believe you're living in Rome instead of just visiting. One thing: The neighbourhood around the Abitazione Pigneto is fine and very safe, even at night. There are families everywhere, along with nice restaurants, cafes, businesses, etc. tucked into the well kept-up apartment buildings. However, there are large groups of men that hang out at all times of the day around the bus stop area; this may be because there is a mosque or at least a men's meeting center nearby, but it is nothing to be particularly worried about. Cars and motorbikes in this area dart through the streets, too, and aren't very forgiving, so watch out! We asked Giorgio to pick us up from Ciampino airport, as we would have had no clue how to get to the B&B on our own. While the pick-up price is a bit steep (25 euros for Ciampino, 35 for da Vinci), we've very glad we asked him. We got a very unique tour of greater Rome, including zipping around and through ancient aqueducts, and also gained a lot of insight on touring Rome from Giorgio. He helps you with figuring out bus tickets, which are your key to the city, and also recommended a fabulous, 'real' Italian restaurant just a block from the B&B. Also, Giorgio insisted we get on the bus (either the 81 or 810) the moment we arrived to go see the Colosseum at sunset; it's a treat and very easy to do, and we're happy he suggested it. Fulvio is the one who will typically take care of you -- he handles breakfast, cleans the rooms, and probably will deal with check-out or storing your bags for the day. He does not speak English, but does speak some French and Spanish; however, he's nice and the language barrier won't be a problem as long as you learn a few phrases in Italian. Breakfast is very basic -- cheese, meat, butter, jam, toast, coffee, and juice -- and could be more. You can have it at whatever time you want in the morning, though, which was great. There are also numerous trattorias, cafes, restaurants, and markets in the immediate area, too, if you're ever looking for a quick snack or a late dinner. We had a lovely time here. Giorgio and Fulvio are very kind, and have a vested interest in aiding travelers because they travel a lot themselves. This is much to their credit in making their us feel comfortable and helping us have a positive experience. Despite the somewhat long distance from the city centre, I don't think we could have had a better experience in Rome.

The room is decorated in a sort of eclectic artsy antique style with lots of original artwork, and I found the large bed to be very comfortable.
