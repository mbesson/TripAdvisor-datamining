While the place has likely not been renovated since the 1980's or before, the place has been VERY well maintained. I used to always get rooms on Priceline, minimum 4 stars, whenever we travelled. This time however, the prospect of travelling with an 8 month old and staying in a hotel for 10 days with no kitchen facilities made me think about other alternatives for this trip. I needed a place with a full kitchen, and this place provided that at a very reasonable price. The room was super clean, the carpets were definitely newer and also very clean. We even saw a carpet cleaning company cleaning some rooms while we were there. The staff was very friendly and the pool is also very nice.

Linens were fresh and beds were very comfortable. I have only stayed at 2* properties a few times before and those experiences were nothing like this place. This place is only 2* because it is a motel-style facility whose appearance could benefit from a face-lift. My only complaint would be to have the hotel invest in an air deflector for the air conditioner. It was blowing next to my head every night. For all I know, they may have had one, but I never asked. Other than that, I only have positives to say about this place. The freeway is close by. The zoo is something like 15 minutes from there. Forget doing anything in the area around the hotel, there isn't much there for tourists. However, rent a car and you're well-located to conveniently experience all that San Diego has to offer.

My family (me, husband, 5 kids aged 5-12) stayed in a 1 bedroom family suite which had 2 queen beds in the bedroom, a fold out sofa in the lounge, and full kitchen. David allowed us to have an additional trundle bed in the living area for no extra charge. The room whilst not overly large was certainly perfectly adequate for our stay of 6 nights with a large group. The beds were excellent, the room was clean and well maintained - the cleaning staff even made up the kids beds putting their teddy bears on the middle of the pillows - lovely personal touch. The kitchen had full range and stove and microwave - we brought a lot of groceries and made our own meals without any problems. We thought that the free breakfast was fantastic - waffles (kids loved being able to make these themselves - David even made them some as he wandered through the breakfast room one morning as the waffles had stuck and he helped the kids scrape it off, got the machine oiled and then made them a replacement). Other items were cereal, bagels, toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee, hot chocolate, juice, fresh fruit, muffins and pastries. We had our breakfast later in the morning around 9.30am and never had a problem with the breakfast room being full. Free wi-fi worked fine, laundry facilities were a big bonus for us - not having to hunt down a laundromat around the motel. There is a pool that the kids used, and also a bbq in the pool area which we used also. Yes, it is located away from the main tourist areas of San Diego, however we had a rental car and found it very easy to get to where we wanted to go and most places only took about 20 minutes.

One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information. We checked in daily with him for the scoop on things we were considering seeing. The only downside to the hotel is the location. Its not terrible - but its not a 'walking' friendly place. There are a lot of little local shops (drug stores, nail salons, that sort of thing) but nothing necessarily 'pretty' or tourist friendly places. That being said, it is very easy to get in a car and drive to many of main attractions of San Diego - and the staff is more than happy to give you driving information to them.

It doesn't have anything interesting (that I want) around it. It has a mortuary, a Rite-Aid, a tattoo shop, a bar called \"Effins\", and a place that had a menu in our room called \"Cheba Hut\". Needless to say we drove out of our way to look for shopping and better food. I was happy that our room had a microwave and fridge, but we only used the fridge for our bottled water. The bathrroms are hilariously small. I laughed at the toilet because the opening is too small to use. It doesn't accomodate a large butt. When we got into our room we did the thing we always do....lift the mattress and check for bed bugs. We noticed under each mattress had extra sheets or blankets under the mattress. Under the second mattress we noticed blood or a \"red stained substance\" on the sheet underneath the mattress. The leg on the table by the doof was about to break off. It was bent inwards like it was about to snap off. I moved it back in its original position so the table wouldn't collapse. Walking on the carpet turned my feet black. It looked like someone seriously cracked the front of the sink, but there was a line where it was glued together, so the motel made an attempt to fix that. When I took a hot shower in the morning I didn't get enough hot water. It ran out about 8-10 minutes into the shower. The steps going up to the second floor by room 218 were burned out at night ao it was very dark. Please fix that. i almost mis-stepped and fell. It's a small parking lot and very tight parking. The walls are very thin. I could hear arguments, conversations, tv's, toilets flushing and showering through them. Also, if get a room on the bottom floor...be prepared to have headlights shining through your window when a car parks. Headlights are at eye level with the motel windows. All in all, I think the people who own this motel try very hard to make this a nice place. There's a dog park behind the motel. They have a continental breakfast in the morning, but I didn't use it.

If you do not have a car, do not stay here. We came for the sights and hundreds of hotels/motels are better located for the price. If we are 20+minutes from anything (like here) the prices should be in the $75-$90 range. This is a fantastically remodeled motel. The rooms are super clean with no funny smells. The traffic is light (no freeway/train/plane noise). The staff is 100% customer service oriented. I really believe they would do almost anything for their patrons. The beds are the Simmons Beautyrest line (very very soft, but with adequate support). The breakfast is very well done. The one huge problem is the crowded parking area that doesn't have much room to back out of without risk of hitting cars parked behind. There would be no where to park trailers, large trucks, etc. This is the limit of the original design and there is no way to improve it. The owners really have perfected everything possible. Big tip: consider the upper rooms if you want quiet. We are in 112 (1st floor) and for 3 nights have heard every footfall above.

After brutal days of slogging through thousands of people, what a pleasure to come home to a quiet and restful place! If I have to \"downgrade\" at all, I would say that the breakfast area was incredibly small. It is uncomfortable to have more than a couple of families at any one time in that area, so I hope that eventually they will consider expanding.

The breakfast room had a good variety of bread & bagels from a local bakery, assorted muffins & pastries, a waffle-making station, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, juice & coffee. The gentleman that stocked the breakfast area was very friendly, as were all the other staff we had interactions with. The motel itself and the room were definitely older, but everything was clean and in good repair. The bed was nice and firm (a big plus for me, but not for everyone). I would recommend this motel to anyone looking for a nice stay at a very reasonable price.

Staff was very helpful - there is an excellent Italian restaurant (does not look like very much) very close and quite inexpensive - they will deliver and they make a fabulous pizza. The only problem we encountered was that a maid exchanged 1/3 of my bottle of vodka for water - no big deal - but I noticed because I drink my vodka only with water! Mentioned the incident to the night manager and had no further problems. My only suggestion to the motel would be to think about providing a small safe for medications, jewelry and passports etc - it would be comforting especially for non U.S. citizens. I definitely would stay here again - once you get to know the streets and turnoffs, it is amazingly easy to get around everywhere quickly. Breakfast was fine - to me it is a bonus.

Turns out the motorway is just down the street with easy 15 minute access to downtown San Diego. The handicapped acessible room for my Mother was wonderful with a huge bathroom. My husband and I had a two room suite on the second floor - nice cold a/c, cute little kitchen and two queen beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the main room. The pool is small but heated, no jacuzzi. Lovely flowering bouganvillae all around the complex. The breakfast room is quite small, but the choices good. However, if you are bringing someone in a wheelchair, there is not much room in the breakfast room - we had to help someone in a wheelchair who was travelling soho and it was tricky although management is super helpful to all who visit. You can get free DVD rentals at reception too! There is always coffee and free highspeed internet access in reception and the staff is very helpful at all times.

Noisy place (have been there twice before). Would never recommend staying in Mission Valley! This motel style BW (you park outside your room if you get a room on 1st floor) is situated on El Cajon Boulevard in Mesa, about 10 miles from Mission Valley and you won\u2019t hear any traffic noise in your room. You will find lots of shops and restaurants, a Starbucks and a Ralph\u2019s nearby, all walking distance. The room was spacious, we had a QQ. It is perfectly maintained and clean. Unfortunately there was no fridge/microwave in the room. But there is the usual ironing equipment. Large counter with small sink is in the back of the room. Bathroom was very tiny with tub and toilet, hardly any space to turn around. Enough towels provided, as well as shampoo and soap. There is a hair dryer as well. All clean and looking new. The only problem I had was the beds. They are too soft and old and one night I could not sleep at all, getting back aches. Most horrible beds we ever had! That\u2019s why I never would come back again. They have a cozy pool in the court which is right on the parking lot and surrounded by plants and trees so you won\u2019t have the expression, it is on the parking lot. Nice place! Seems to be heated. No jacuzzi though. In the back of the buildings (2 complexes) is a guest laundry and even a tiny dog meadow. Wifi-Internet is free but did work only for a few hours, after that we never got connected anymore. But they have a free computer to use in the lobby. So no problem at all. Breakfast room is too small, only a few tables cramped in there and not enough space on one morning. We had to take our food to the room that morning. The next we found a place in the breakfast room which was ok. Small variety of food but ok.

Let me take a quick second to address the supposed thinness of the walls. We had zero problems with noise from neighboring rooms, outside cars, pool noise or TV's.

Staff - Vanessa and the rest of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. High Speed Internet - Was ok. Slow in the early evening hours when perhaps many other guests were sharing the wireless link. Laundry - Was very convenient to have on premise laundry. We took full advantage of this. Breakfast was great - choice of multiple breads/bagels, muffins, cereals, toast, waffle maker, boiled eggs, juices, milk, coffee and tea. Yes - no yogurt. The neighborhood around the hotel was good - we felt safe but its not anything fancy. Rite Aid and CVS are one block away. Starbucks is close by as are Ralphs and Vons (grocery stores).

We stayed for 13 nights from mid to end of November 2008. I had asked via e-mail for a suite as far away from the road as possible and was pleased when we arrived to find that this had indeed been possible. Our room was extremely clean and kept that way by housekeeping throughout our stay. Generally the whole place is kept really nicely, everything in its place, clean, organised, smart and presentable. The pool and parking area with the grass and palm trees are very pleasant and given the space available I don't see how they could be made better. Our suite had 2 queen beds in one room then a door to the sitting room with armchair and sofa bed. TV,s in both rooms. Wash basin just outside bathroom, nice powerful shower with un-ending hot water. Full kitchen with everything you really need but not more. There was plenty of room for my partner and I for our extended stay which was why we booked the suite so we would not be couped up. Beds were very comfortable. The breakfast room is small but we always managed to find somewhere to sit if we wanted to, just had to wait a few minutes a couple of mornings. Breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice, the waffles are good and the coffee is ok to start you off in the morning. Parking was easy, we had no problems at all getting a space almost right outside our room everytime. As far as the people at the Lamplighter are concerned there are to kinds. 1st the staff who we found to be warm, friendly, welcoming, hospitable, professional, helpful and informative in all of our contact with them, they cannot be faulted. 2nd the other guests who in the overwhelming majority were just ordinary folk. However as will be found wherever you go there was a rogue few percent who had little consideration for others. These ones slammed doors, talked / shouted loud and late, left a mess on the breakfast room floor and their table full of rubbish for someone else to clear. As mentioned previously these were the exception and not at all the norm. If you get one of the noisy ones next door to you it does show up the walls as being rather thin. We have stayed at many places with higher star ratings than the Lamplighter and have been dissapointed at some of them. The opposite is true at the Lamplighter where the 2 star rating does not do it justice, it really deserves a third star. If you are realastic with your expectations of this 2 star hotel (ie not expecting 4 stars) you will not be dissappointed.

The pool was cleaned everyday and clean towels put on each of the loungers ready for guest to use . The breakfast area is a little small but it was nice to sit around the pool area with the well kept garden and see the humming birds while having breakfast . If you have a car this is the pefect location , everywhere that we needed to go to was within a 15 to 20 minute drive . The directions that the Manager gave us for the the different locations that we went to were perfect . This place is well worth the money . After leaving here we stayed at a Courtyard Marriott for $205.00 a night ( more than double what we paid at the Lamplighter for one night ) The pool was not clean and you had to pay $12.99 for breakfast !!!! You want value for your money stay here.

Our choice was based solely on \"Tripadvisor\" ratings, following a very last minute change in our vacation plans (flying in from Vancouver BC). I can say unequivocally that we do not regret our decision. This is a small but well managed establishment. Rooms are clean (which is the most important factor in selecting a hotel). Staff are very courteous and helpful. The reception area is not 5 star but it does have a computer with free internet access. We had no problem whatsoever with the (free) parking; maybe a bit tight if you drive an unusually large vehicle. The hotel is NOT located in the immediate vicinity of major San Diego attractions like the beaches, the zoo, Balboa Park, the \"old\" San Diego, Legoland and SeaWorld but it's right off the interstate and with a GPS, a no-brainer to get around. The first night, we had noisy neighbors and we could smell cigarette smoke in our supposedly non-smoking room. However, we were promptly moved (read \"upgraded\") to a better room the very next morning. The general manager, David Birt, was quite accommodating. No questions asked. BTW, I strongly recommend a room with fridge and microwave, especially if you're with kids. Noteworthy is the fact that there is a VON's supermarket a few blocks away where you will find everything you might need. After a long day on the road, we thoroughly enjoyed their roasted chicken brought back to our room with a glass of wine! Also, there is a delivery pizza nearby called \"Milo's\". Their pizza is top notch. The breakfast is quite basic, as described in other reviews, but OK to start the day. Waffles, cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, the usual continental breakfast suspects. The room where it is served is indeed quite small and you may have to wait for a table (we did) or else bring the food back to your room; better yet, eat it by the pool. There are two Starbucks nearby where you can have a better coffee than the one served (really quite watery). Bottom line: for the price, you're not likely to find better value in the San Diego area.

I decided to give them a call and spoke to someone at 2:00 a.m. their time. To my surprise the night clerk was very pleasant, knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic AARP rate. In less than 10 minutes I had an e-mail confirmation for my reservation. So far, so good. As I approached the Lamplighter I passed San Diego State and realized that the motel would be in a working-class/business neighborhood. Okay with me. There were a number of restaurants nearby and a couple of supermarkets. Mission Valley, for shopping, was only about 6 miles away on I-8. As I pulled in I noticed that the motel was very neat and clean. All of the employees seemed in motion doing something, and several of them were cleaning. We came over on a red-eye and arrived at about noon. I met Len, one of the managers, and he promptly checked my family in early. The room was good-sized, very clean, the furniture and fixtures looked new. Most impressive was that the bathroom was sparkling and there was a Delta massaging shower head that I had seen in a 4-star hotel in the bath/shower--a very nice touch. Better yet, the water flow was strong with lots of hot water--unlike many of the hotels that put those terrible water-saving low-flow shower heads on. A welcome relief to a weary traveler. The beds were very comfortable--better than a lot of hotels costing twice as much. Very important. When I discovered that there was no refrigerator in our room I asked Len about the possibility of getting a room with one. No problem--he had one delivered to our room the next day. The hotel is centrally located. We used it as a jumping off point to visit the Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Legoland (twice), and even Knott's Berry farm. Freeway access is very easy. Hop onto I-8 then you can get to I-15 or the 405 and get anywhere. The best part of the Lamplighter is the staff. Now I know how they got their #2 rating for San Diego area hotels/motels. Dave and Len, the managers, and all of the help were truly nice and friendly. Everyone said hi with a smile and made us feel welcome. Every hour of daylight was used cleaning, fixing, or doing something that made the place nice. Fresh towels on the pool chaises. A nice size pool that was very clean. Immaculate. Breakfast was better than the usual continental fare. It is basic with a couple of nice waffle machines, 3 choices of dry cereals, an assortment of bagels and pastry, fruits, juices, milk, and coffee and it is well-stocked. This definitely saves you time and money in the morning, and they are open until 10:00 a.m., not the usual 9:00 a.m. closing. The staff made great suggestions on places to eat such as the Casa Machado 2 doors away. We had dinner there for 4 out of 6 nights. When you tell them the Lamplighter sent you the service gets even better. The people at the Lamplighter were nicer than staff at a good number of 4-star hotels that I have stayed at. The bottom line is that you could pay a lot more and get a lot less. If Macy's had customer service half as good at the Lamplighter, Nordstroms would be out of business. Aloha from Hawaii.

I had booked the room because I wanted to have a room large enough for 2 adults and 3 teenagers. The room has a large kitchen, foldout couch, tv , full bathroom and the adjoing room has 2 queen beds and a tv. After staying several nights in a Hampton Inn , which we paid $151 a night , and then staying here for $143 a night I think that they are charging too much. The pillows are very small and flat but the beds were comfortable. The breakfast area is well staffed but the eating area is very small. Most people were getting something to eat and taking it to their room. The only hot foods were waffles and instant oatmeal. The door to the breakfast room was left open to the outside so I can see it would be easy for insects coming straight into the room. If that door is to remain open then I would suggest adding a screen door. The hotel staff is extremely polite and helpful.

For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego! It is not great value for the money; it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The \"lush landscaping\" of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed; each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad. The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive; it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient.

Parking: The parking spaces are not large, but enough spaces are provided that I was able to park right in front of my door both Saturday and Sunday nights. 9. Location: It was very convenient to the Interstate 8 ( College Exit number 10 South, then West on El Cajon Blvd. ) yet far enough not to listen to the road noise. 8. Television: A large (at least 25\") television with about fifty channels to choose from. A channel guide on a laminated card and an easy to use remote control were provided. 7: Furnishings: I stayed in a two queen bed room. The beds, desk, dresser and night stand were in lke new condition. A padded bench added extra seating or a place to open your suitcase. At the back of the room was the lavatory on a full width vanity backed by a full width mirror. At the left of this was a hair dryer and the door to the room with a toilet and bath/shower. The shower had a fabric curtain and there were plenty of towels in a rack above the toilet. Soap and shampoo were provided. The curtains were in perfect shape and consisted of a sheer and a light blocking curtain. You could open the window and let in fresh air through the screen or use the very quiet air conditioner below the window. 6. Pool: The outdoor pool has towels draped over the chairs for your use so you don't have to go to the desk for pool towels. This area is used for the overflow seating during breakfast. 5. Maintenance: One reviewer said that the place looks so good that it looks out of place in the neighborhood. I hadn't thought of it that way but but it is truly outstanding. There is great pride of ownership and the In shows it in the landscaping and condition of the rooms. The doors use cardlocks to enter (as does the breakfast room) and everything worked perfectly during my stay. 4. Price: I think that the price was very fair and the value was outstanding. I think that I saved at least $20.00 on breakfast alone. I used the AAA/Senior rate and paid $175.00 total for two nights, all taxes included. 3. Cleanliness: Because I made my reservation only a week before my stay, only a smoking room was available. I called to confirm my reservation and the desk clerk made sure that an ionizer was put in the room to make it more pleasant for my stay. The room and bath (like the whole property ) was spotless and I did not even notice a smell of smoke in the room. I saw the staff cleaning the rooms and they were removing all the bedding in the rooms for washing, even the comforters. During breakfast, a staff member is always present to keep the food stocked and the tables cleaned. 2. Breakfast: The breakfast room is open from 6 am to 10 am. There are only 12 chairs, but you can use the pool area to eat. You have a lot of choices, and I will try to list them all. Muffins, assorted Danish, apple juice, orange juice, coffee, decaf, hot water for tea or oatmeal, 2% or whole milk, two automatic waffle irons, butter, syrup, three cold cereals, bagels, cream cheese, toast and jam, fresh oranges and apples and boiled eggs. There is a television in the room to catch the local news and weather. 1. Staff: The staff was friendly, helpful and treated me as I were staying at a grand hotel. It is from them that all the other great reasons to stay here have originated. I wondered how this Best Western Inn could be so highly rated in the San Diego area. Now I have stayed here I know that it is the constant attention that the staff gives to you that makes this place so outstanding.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Leandro, California", "Title": "\u201cVery good value...no problems\u201d", "Author": "themoogal", "ReviewID": "UR14226263", "Content": "I booked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews.

Impressed by all the positive reviews on tripadvisor, I originally booked for 10 nights. However, before getting there I was a little bit skeptical because I wondered how a relatively inexpensive Best Western hotel could make it to the top five hotels in San Diego, but I was to find out soon enough. Almost everything about this hotel turned out to be awesome. When I arrived, I was upgraded to an upper-floor room with full kitchen, which was pretty spacious and comfortable. Additionally, the room included an iron/ironing board, hair dryer, coffee maker, microwave plus lots of complimentary items - amenities that you usually don't find in hotels in this price range. They also provided dishes, pans, and other kitchen utensils free of charge. Although the hotel is located at El Cajon Blvd, which isn\u2019t a busy street but not a side road either, I didn't notice any disturbing street noise. I also didn\u2019t experience any problems finding a parking space close to my room. Some people might argue that the hotel is not that close to downtown, but then again it is very close to San Diego State University and other interesting venues, so I found it to be an ideal location for me. Breakfast, which was offered between 6 and 10 a.m., was way better than you would expect it to be at a regular Best Western hotel. The breakfast bar was well-stocked with appealing choices, which included waffles, a nice variety of cereals, fresh fruit and assorted pastries. Complimentary coffee was offered in the lobby throughout the day. Although I have never been in the pool it looked very nice and fresh towels were put out every day. The most important thing for me, however, was that the hotel was absolutely clean and that everyone who worked there always strived to provide prompt and outstanding service. Housekeeping was simply amazing, they would rather replace a towel that had not been used or put an extra piece of soap than forget to replace anything. Last but not least, I have to thank all at Best Western Lamplighter Inn (which includes, but is not limited to Len, the amazing front office manager who goes out of his way to give you a pleasant stay) for their help in facilitating my transition to the US and for making my stay a time to remember. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to spend hundreds of dollars a night, but also doesn't want to compromise quality for money. Lamplighter Inn is kind of a hard-to-find gem, as it gets you more value for your dollar than possibly any other hotel in San Diego.

This was our first trip to San Diego and we weren't quite sure about the neighborhoods, and I must admit I was a bit hesitant given the great deal we received for a room with a kitchen and the extra for our dog. We were not at all disappointed!!!! The rooms were basic, but clean (the most important thing to most!) There was a queen bed and sofa bed so plenty of room for my husband, daughter and me. Our room had a full kitchen, complete with fridge, stove and microwave. Great setup! The complimentary breakfast was plenty to get us started in the morning; toast, cereal, oatmeal, boiled eggs, pastries and fruit were fine although I must admit I wasn't a big fan of the coffee. The pet area was a bit on the small side so we typically would take our dog for a walk in the morning to take care of her business. Many of the reviews reference the small breakfast area. It probably is much more crowded during the summer, but during Thanksgiving week, we had no problems with seating. For our visits to Sea World, the Zoo, Old Town and all the other touristy spots, the drive was roughly 15-20 minutes, more or less depending upon the time of day. It never seemed to take very long and was an easy drive with our GPS. Easy access on/off the freeways. We found parking at the hotel to be no problem. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit, especially if we bring our dog, as there aren't many nice, clean hotels/motels which allow dogs weighing more than 30 lbs (ours weighs 50+) Thanks, BW Lamplighter, for the wonderful stay!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cbargain break\u201d", "Author": "ashcan", "ReviewID": "UR11267076", "Content": "Chosen after looking at tripadvisor and not disappointed.

Location is extremely convenient to metro San Diego attractions (less than five miles to San Diego Zoo / Balboa Park). This along with previous reviews is why I selected it. Property is relatively close to SDSU, so area has a college feel. Banks, eateries, supermarkets, drug stores, hospital, gas stations and freeway access points are all close at hand. The L&L Hawaiian BBQ place at the corner (of El Cajon and College) served great take-out fare. I will say that the area is older, and I wouldn't recommend wandering about alone too late in the evening. At check-in, the female desk clerk was pleasant, friendly, and provided great information. Check-out was less involved and less noteworthy. Property is older, but kept well, second level is stair access only, and exterior access room was clean, though the HVAC unit did give off a strange odor at times during operation. I did not sample the breakfast, or pool area, so have no opinion regarding these amenities. Parking stalls fill quickly at night and were quite narrow; I did worry about finding door dings on my new van, but smaller vehicles should manage. If you're looking to be impressed with your room at a higher rate, I recommend the brand new Residence Inn Oceanside, CA where I also stayed during this trip (convenient to Legoland, beaches, pier).

It was impossible to keep water bottles from being room temperature and I was not there long enough to warrant buying a cooler. I also chose this motel because the manager was responding to bad reviews(and good ones) and took steps to correct problems.
