One of the cables on the fitness machine was broken and after we told the staff it was fixed by the next day. We really liked the outside patio area by the breakfast room and enjoyed some wine there in the nice weather. The hotel gave us a corkscrew to open our bottle. Our room was clean and pleasant.

The rooms adjoin by door, so you can hear everything if you have noisy neighbors.

The bed was clean and comfortable, and there was a nice big TV. The bathroom did not appear to be renovated like the rest of the room and the tub was discolored.

We scouted out accommodations in Jan 2011 right when the Ivy Hotel was being renovated. In fact, we met the new GM - Jeff Perry - at a wedding event while there. He nicely showed us what the hotel renovations would result in along with the spectacular rates (for Napa and for this location just N of City of Napa along the Wine Highway) they would have for us when we came back. Based on his great presentation/overview, we decided to use the Ivy Hotel as our primary accommodations for over 50 family and guests. Jeff and his staff were fantastic to deal with as our YES RSVPs came in and arrival/departure plans were made. Needless to say, we were a bit worried about this hotel since they had just opened a month or so earlier, so we held our breath as the guests started arriving on Thursday AM in mid-May 2011. We were thrilled when every single wedding party guest was not only satisfied with their accommodations but also with the staff at the Ivy. They liked the breakfast in the AM, they liked the modernistic rooms, they liked the rates (we paid for a lot of our families directly). I heard only a few complaints that the floors/walls are a bit thin so you can hear people walking in the halls at night/morning. So. Why only 3 stars, then? Sadly, we've had little/no luck in getting Jeff Perry back on the phone/Email since our wedding weekend ended to discuss the bill. We believe - in the checkout confusion - that our personal credit card was overcharged for some guest room nights. We're not sure, but we THINK this is accurate based on our spreadsheet calculations. No amount of phone calls or Emails to Jeff or his staff seems to warrant a call-back or acknowledgement that they will help us work this out so we don't feel overcharged. We're bummed that this experience ended so negatively as everything else went so darn well. So - I'll say this - great renovation. Great location if you want easy access to wineries. Great staff.

This was a birthday getaway that my girlfriend put together for her and I. I was utterly disappointed by your hotel. After spending our wine trip last year in Sonoma at the Best Western we were very excited to find a Premier property to stay at in Napa. It proved to be an awful decision. Neither of us were able to get more than a few hours of sleep a night due to the beds that you use in this hotel. When I spoke to the front desk personnel about I the morning after our first night stay they were extremely apologetic. They told us that they get this complaint almost constantly but that all the beds are the same, and unfortunately uncomfortable. There was no other room that we could move to in order to escape the ridiculously uncomfortable beds. At the breakfast area that first morning it was the general nature of conversation amongst several of the parties there. Being memorial day weekend there were no other options for us to move to a different hotel. The fact that you charge what I paid for that vacation for the experience you deliver is beyond reprehensible. It is not the staffs fault that a clear problem is present that the owners of this property choose to ignore. I am sure they have been put in multiple awful situations due to this. I did not take my frustration out on them, as I know it was not their decision to buy these beds. I was absolutely disgusted by our experience at your property. Both of us ended up sleeping in the chairs in the room the last night to avoid the bed. That is not how I wanted to spend a very expensive romantic birthday weekend trip.

The patio is a lovely place to have wine and cheese. Upon check-in, I asked to be switched to a room that wasn't at the top of the stairs and they couldn't or wouldn't accomodate that request. Also they were confused about how to credit my stay to the Southwest Airlines rapid rewards so I decided to drop that and pursue it later. The elevator was out of service the entire time we were there (5 nights). The top step was oddly taller than the rest and is a fall risk. Our room had been remodeled or was in the process.

We checked out the breakfast area, which was large, bright and clean, grabbed a cup of complimentary tea and headed to the car to check out the room and unpack. So far so good! We opted for a King bed suite on the second floor towards the back of the hotel, a corner room. I was so impressed by the size and decor when I entered the room. It felt roomy and bright. The colors are very modern and updated. Bright blue, dark wood and white. I really appreciate good design and this surprisingly satisfied what I was looking for. A sea of grandma furniture and flower explosion bed and breakfasts are not what I consider romantic. I like friendly and accommodating staff, updated and fresh decor and a comfortable bed and chairs. This hotel delivered! Continental breakfast was pretty standard, but decent. The indoor seating was abundant and the outdoor seating was lovely. I never felt cramped or that it was too chaotic. My only complaint is that the toilet seat was loose and the bathroom light needed to be replaced because it kept flickering. I mentioned it to the staff and they seemed to be concerned about it. We only stayed one night so I'm not sure when/if it got fixed. Also, the TV was in a strange spot. But who goes to Napa to watch TV?! All in all a great hotel for the price. It\u2019s updated, only a five minute drive to downtown Napa and Yountville and the parking is easy! Go for it!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cLow Cost Surprise In Napa Valley\u201d", "Author": "jgregb", "ReviewID": "UR101278405", "Content": "First off, I would never have even considered staying here had it not been for the TripAdvisor reviews. The reviews indicated that the property had undergone a significant remodel and had been brought up to date. One review indicated that it was a Best Western mashed up with a W. Not sure I would go that far, but it exceeded my expectations in some areas. The lobby had been updated and was a good first impression. The registration process was fast and efficient. This is where it starts to stray. The elevator was out of order (almost looked permanent, as it never worked in four days). Sure, carrying bags up one flight is certainly no big deal for me, but for some who are not in shape, it could be an issue. The hallway was dark and somewhat dreary. If the hallway had been redone, I would ask for a refund. The doors to the rooms were certainly not new. The rooms were a tale of two issues. The bathroom vanity and bathroom itself had been redone, and were basically tasteful. The remainder of the room was somewhere in between. It was packed with furnishings, and they were borderline eclectic. Not bad, but a little unusual. The bed was comfortable and the mattress was newer. Highspeed wireless is included, and to me that is a bonus. So, that said, would I recommend staying here? Sure, but be aware of a few misses and relish in the value for Napa Valley. Would I stay here again? Yes, in peak season when the rooms elsewhere go upwards of $350 per night to $1000 per night.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delray Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFavorite hotel of our entire trip!\u201d", "Author": "tdil25", "ReviewID": "UR101098621", "Content": "I was a little wearly about staying at a Best Western in Napa where there are so many beautiful hotels to choose from but the price couldn't be beaten.
