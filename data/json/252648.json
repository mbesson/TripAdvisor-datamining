While I would rather have been at the W, Intercon or JW Marriott, all of which are nearby, I really couldn't complain. My room - 316 - was large enough and recently refurbished. Everything was comfortable and clean, and there was a big new flatscreen TV with some HD channels. The staff were friendly (I speak Spanish), and the surrounding area is great. You're one block from the French embassy, a block from lovely Lincoln Park, and 2-3 blocks from the city's most glitzy shops. Gripes: no wi-fi, so you have to use the 'business center' downstairs which has a couple of desktops, breakfast is a joke (mini-muffins, sunny delight and coffee laid out on a table near reception, and fyi, the Italian restaurant next door shuts at 7pm on Sundays. The restaurant is wonderful, and there's a side entrance from inside the hotel lobby - but you can't charge meals to your room. To sum up: clean, friendly and perfectly adequate in a very fancy neighborhood. But if you're looking to treat yourself, look a bit more upmarket (and spend a bit more).", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "R", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive, for a reason\u201d", "Author": "G9508", "ReviewID": "UR121957228", "Content": "The price is low, compared with the luxury skyscrappers in the surrounding neighborhoods, and there is a good reason for that.

The hotel, as other reviewers have noted, is dated and old. I stayed in a room on the 2nd floor which proved to be quite noisy--you could hear the street noise quite easily and it woke me up once in the middle of the night. The room I stayed in clearly was extra space converted to a room. When I sat on the toilet my knees banged up against the wall; and I'm 5'11--not that tall! The bed was absolutely terrible, rock hard, if I had a sleeping bag I would have slept in it on the floor and probably would have been more comfortable. The lighting in the room isn't that great either; especially if you plan on doing some work by the meager desk. I opted to stay at this place because the other big chains in the area seemed real expensive especially for Mexico City. But avoid this place. It's basically got the charm of a Motel 6 or Super 8.

On those counts, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappointed (although in the end the price seemed a tad high, considering the fact that it is a no-frills hotel). The staff, especially in the restaurant, were quite pleasant. The gym and Internet rooms were adequate. The hotel is within easy walking distance of shops, restaurants, and even the Metro (about 15 min. away) and Anthropological and Modern Art Museums (about 1/2 an hour). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a short taxi-and-Metro ride to the historical center (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sitio nearby, too), and we made it to the airport in about half an hour (though be aware that this was on a Sunday morning). I (a 30-something woman) felt perfectly safe walking around by myself. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that the rooms were too small; they were modest, but clean and comfortable, although the mattresses were a bit too hard, there was no bathtub, and there was a rather steep step leading down from the bathroom to the main area. We were very pleased that they gave us what seemed to be the quietest possible room (facing the inside courtyard). We only visited the restaurant for breakfast, and found that to be middling, but at least there was a lot of choice on the menu. One inconvenience was that no one spoke English very well. They were very patient with my terrible Spanish, though, and so I could usually make myself understood (although there was one frustrating mishap when I, dutiful gringa that I am, came down with the inevitable stomach bug. I called room service and asked for agua caliente para t\u00c3\u00a9. They promptly sent up a plumber, who checked the water in our bathroom and found that it was indeed caliente. When I tried to explain that that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the problem, he said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to go down to the restaurant myself. I was in no position to do this. Fortunately, a Mexican friend was able to call in and straighten out the situation, and soon the maitre d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 himself appeared at my door with a tray of tea and Coke). In their defense, it appears that just about all of their clients are local businesspeople, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real need for them to speak English. And I have to say that it was nice both to be surrounded by locals and not to have to listen to screaming children. The only real annoyance was the message-retrieval system. When someone leaves a message for you, your room phone flashes and beeps incessantly until you call the front desk and ask them to retrieve the message. Bizarrely, they appear to do this by listening to the message while they play it to you over the phone (as evidenced by the background noise I could hear when our messages were played, and by Reception\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asking whether I wanted him to erase the message after he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d played it). I suppose if you have nothing to hide, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing wrong with this system, but it can be a little embarrassing. And it often happened that the damn thing would continue to beep after we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hung up. We could hear these beeps emanating from other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms as we walked down the hall and always hoped--nay, prayed--that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for us... On balance, a good choice for businesspeople and couples who are looking for some peace and quiet in a very busy city.", "Date": "August 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4823421", "Content": "'just came back from a 4 day business stay at hotel Polanco. I chose the hotel based on the previous positive reviews on this site. I was quite disapointed. We stayed in 3 other hotels during our trip(similar price range)in Mexico City and this was the worst in terms of customer service, room size, friendliness of staff and business amenities. When we arrived, the guy at the front desk was on the phone for more than 10 minutes (not kidding) simply treating us as if we weren't there. When he hang up, no word of apology - and this was pretty much the reaction of every staff in this hotel during our stay - just totally careless. The internet didn't work during our entire stay - again nobody seemed to care even after our complaint. The bathroom with shower was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel - you can hardly turn around without hitting something. And last but not least, when we wanted to pay for our stay (with a Company Credit Card) - they told me the card was rejected and we should go to a bank and get cash (with the cab waiting outside). Out of frustration, I gave them my personal Credit Card, which according to them was rejected as well and they kept insisting on cash. Only after I got really irritated with them, they finally called MasterCard, got the authorization code and processed the payment. Obviously, their credit card reader had no connection. On the positive side, the rooms are simple but clean, the restaurant is good but is not affiliated with the hotel (so no breakfast included in the hotel rate) and the area is nice and safe at night to walk.", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Statesboro, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA great value and location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2457115", "Content": "As a teacher on a budget, I was pleased that a local contact recommended the Polanco.
