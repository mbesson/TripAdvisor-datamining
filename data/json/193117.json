The good points are that the room was clean and comfortable room, a safe area of London and friendly staff at a convenient location for the tube station, a 3 minute walk away. The bad points are that the room was really outdated and whilst the bedroom part of the room was large enough for the three of us, and was clean enough with comfortable beds, the bathroom wasn't!!!

Three hot things to put on your plate!!! Not a rasher of bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, hash browns or anything else - just beans, scrammbled eggs and \"plastic\" sausages. There were plastic \"beakers\" for fruit juice, and tea/coffee. Nothing wrong with any of it - just a complete lack of choice. Ok, it was cheap.

Since we were below ground, our view was obstructed, but we spent so little time in the room, this was not an issue for us. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was large and had a tub and shower. The only complaint about the bath was that the shower head was hand held. There was a cost to having the high speed wireless Internet in our room, but I could hook my laptop into their Internet service in the lobby at no additional cost. We had breakfast added to our room. The breakfast buffet offered a very good choice of fresh fruit, cereals, toast, muffins, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. There was plenty of food to get us started in the morning.

I had to sit it on floor to heat water. However the instant coffee was very good for an instant. and my favorite cookies as a bonus. Walkers shortbread. However the security in this hotel is great, not only do you turn your key in before leaving the hotel, the front door is kept locked 24/7 and you have to be buzzed back in. There is always someone at front desk to retrieve your key from. And everyone I dealt with was extremely pleasant. Yes, the room was small but more than adequate for my needs. During the day I put my suitcase in the closet so the maids would be able to clean room without moving my stuff around. I have no idea as to size of double rooms but a single was perfect for my stay. The breakfast was more than adequate and you are brought your own pot of coffee in a press, and after the first morning when I asked for some hot water as the coffee was a little too strong for me each morning following the attendant brought me a pot made with less coffee. The stairs down to the conservatory are a little steep but I held onto rail and stepped carefully. I would not recommend this hotel for persons with severe mobility problems primarily because of stairs and no lift. I primarily chose this hotel because it was one of the few that actually stated it had a bathtub. actually they are jacuzzi tubs, regular tubs with jets. I usually spent about 1/2 hr every night soaking. ahhh. Nice fluffy towels and washcloths. I booked through their website after a couple of emails (one guarantying me a first floor rm) and got a much better rate than booking sites. about 2 blocks from Notting Hill Gate tube stop with 3 lines. When I arrived my suitcases were taken up to my rm while I checked in and as I checked out the desk clerk asked if I needed help bringing them down. I have also notified the hotel that a couple of websites are listing amenities they do not have. I know this seems like a long review but I wanted to dispel the negative reviews, every one is entitled to their opinion but mine is this was a great hotel for the rate and my needs. If and when I ever return to London this would be my first choice for a hotel (LOL unless I win the lottery)", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad place...\u201d", "Author": "Jwbhgntx", "ReviewID": "UR7245105", "Content": "I was of course apprehensive when I read some of the scathing reviews on this hotel, however, I decided not to change my plans.

I came back to check in, which was very quick and easy, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My room was indeed small, very small, but I had expected as much. But, since it was just me, I did not need anything more than a place to sleep and shower. It was very adequate for those puropses. If you are planning to spend alot of time in your room, I would suggest getting a larger room. The room was as neat as a pin, I must say. The bed was comfortable. Just a few blocks from the Lancaster Gate Tube Station, which made travel very easy. I would certainly recommend this hotel for a single person or a student traveling alone.

We want to post this to help others avoid being as disappointed as we were. The price we got was great: 99 or 129 pounds for a standard or better room in what the web site describes as a \"boutique hotel\" with a jacuzzi tub in a good location, near the Notting Hill Tube stop. The location is good and convenient to both tube and bus. We stayed in 2 different rooms. The dimly lit standard room on the first floor was relatively spacious but the carpet and lower walls were worn and filthy. The jacuzzi tub in the marble bathroom worked well and there was plenty of hot water; it converted to a less than optimal but ok shower. The superior room was on the top (4th) floor with no lift (no one offered to help us with our bags going up) looked less worn, but was smaller, had terrible water pressure, a view of a concrete roof ornament, and very thin walls so we could hear the people next door. Frankly, we couldn't figure out what was \"superior\" about it. There are also rooms in the basement that we didn't see, but be warned that you might end up there. The \"services\" were sad. The magazines and self-service pot/cups/tea equipment was a nice touch but the TV set received 3 channels and the free health club pass advertised in their guest guide didn't exist. Breakfast was ok but being in what could have been a lovely conservatory was marred by the unappetizing dead bugs in the draped fabric overhead. We found the tone of the service to be either passive-aggressive or completely disinterested. The advice we received, including directions, was wrong so often that we stopped asking. Of the many staff members we encountered during the 5 nights we stayed, 2 were helpful; we especially appreciated the friendly smile from one of the maids each day and help with our luggage when we checked out by the desk clerk on duty. Over all, the hotel has \"great bones' but needs renovation in both staffing and facilities. On the other hand, if you don't mind the depressing atmosphere and can get the rates we had, it is a very good bargain for London. The upside of it all is that because we found the hotel to be so unpleasant, we stayed away from early morning to late evening, and got to see a lot more of London than we had planned.
