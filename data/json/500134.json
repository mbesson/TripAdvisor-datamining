{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointing in Quality of the Hotel and Service My boyfriend and I drove to Ubud to sightsee for a day and planned to have our lunch at the Indochine Restaurant of The Mansion. It is in Ubud, yes, but walking distance to the main Ubud tourist area it is not. Maybe if you are very fit and loves to walk over uphill and downhill winding terrain, yes, you could walk from The Mansion to the main tourist street. We paid Rph 20,000 for a taxi ride from the Antonio Balanco Museum to The Mansion. Upon entrance to The Mansion, my heart sank because it is very disappointing. There are so many prettier places to stay in Ubud. The quality of the building is terrible. Wall paint is peeling in many places, table linen in Indochine Restaurant is dirty, garden is not very well taken care. The whole place to me is pretentious to name itself The Mansion. It does not have any charm. It is a dull place.Also, price at Indochine Restaurant is unreasonable. I ordered pomegranate crusted quail eggs for appetizer and gratinated crab for main course. My boyfriend ordered some sort of satay for appetizer and crispy duck for main course. We were served amuse bouche of some sort of spring rolls. It was good. But then my appetizer came and it was presented like the amuse bouche- take the spring roll out and drop the quail eggs- same garnish, same sauce, and WITHOUT the advertised pomegranante- that was my appetizer. My boyfriend's satay was ok, nothing special we both agreed. My gratinated crab meat with supposedly cream sauce was TERRIBLE. Crab meat stuffed inside the crab shell was cold and totally tasteless, whatever cheese was on top of the crab meat was chewey, not creamy. The duck was good but again nothing special. For the price we were expecting something to the level of the food at Sarong on Jl, Petitenget in Seminyak. No, no, no- the taste, the quality of the dining room, the food overall doesn't not deserve the price. I feel bad for people who come to stay at The Mansion thinking that they've picked a nice play to stay because they are likely to get diappointed. Try Taman Bebek, or Pita Maha. Research! Research!
