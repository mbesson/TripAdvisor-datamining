It seems to be in the middle of the city (a bit to the right of the center) and it's a wonderful location as many train stops to tourist attractions are only three or four away. There were four types of transportation (I'm lying. There were five, but I never looked for a bike): Tram, S-Bahn (train), U-Bahn (subway), and Bus. It's a perfect place for backpackers and the young. The elderly may have issues (they had lots of bunk beds. I'm not sure if they had other things. It's possible). The utilities were great. The staff were all smiles. They spoke German, English (quite well), and I'm not sure what else. Ask them about anything. There are things to do in the lobby (a seating area to chat with friends, a pool table, a bar, computer terminals that you could use for a small fee, etc). About the rooms. There were bunk beds (I didn't know this until I got there. I'm afraid of the top bunk). I don't remember seeing a speck of dust. I believe that, during my stay, I forgot what dust was. Everything was so clean that I could possibly eat off of whatever. Prices. I got a room for less than 100\u20ac (really!) for three nights. That includes the room, the keycard (for the room), breakfast (which was wonderful) and tax. What that doesn't include is the 2\u20ac laundry fee. I'm definitely recommending this hostel to others. Oh! Bring your own towel and toiletries.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cA great hostel\u201d", "Author": "Maria K", "ReviewID": "UR125441876", "Content": "A great hostel for young people. I'd say it is definitely not suited for elder gentlemen and ladies, since it can get quiet noisy at night. But for younger couples, friends out travelling and college buddies - it is the place to stay at. It is located near East Side Gallery (it took us around 60 seconds to walk down there), and right next to the U-bahn station Warschauer Str. The staff at the hostel are nice, there is a room to store big luggage, there are lockers in the rooms and also at the reception. The bartenders are lovely, the girls at the reception are helpful. Note that additional small fees are added once you arrive at the hotel, e.g. for the bedsheets and padlocks, etc. (if you stay in a 4-ppl room or 6-ppl room) However you can avoid those by bringing your own. Toilets and shower rooms are also very tidy and comfortable. All in all, it's a great hostel, and the prices don't bite.:) Best regards from the Russians from Sweden ;))", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap & Well Located\u201d", "Author": "Larry_Ketang", "ReviewID": "UR124956875", "Content": "Just stayed at Industriepalast, mid feb. Found the place to be very nice, the rooms aren't fancy but everything was very clean, and the bathroom/shower where excellent. The double bed was actually two single mattresses in a double bed frame, but it was very comfortable. The room also had a TV and a small wardrobe. I had read some Trip Advisor reviews that said the staff were very rude. I found the exact opposite. All the staff were very nice and extremely helpful. This hotel is also a hostel, with dorm rooms - i imagine the staff get a lot of requests from drunk groups and are probably rude to them(??). I found the hotel excellently located for getting around, particularly the east-side. It's situated right next to an S-Bahn and a U-Bahn, there's also a tram stop right outside. I'm planning on going back to Berlin - amazing city! - and will definitely stay at the Industriepalast again.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cNice and easy going place!\u201d", "Author": "Camilama", "ReviewID": "UR122629476", "Content": "Very nice and friendly place.

Unfortunately, upon checking out I was faced with very poor customer service. When I checked in I was asked to leave 2 Euros for my key card. Which is fine. It is a small amount of money and they give it back when you check out. I handed my card back when checking out and a different person was on the desk. I assumed he was going to give me the money but when he didn't I asked him. He said there is no record of my giving money for the card and said it wasn't his problem! He was very rude. If is standard practice that they ask for money before giving the key cards out, then it all seemed very odd. 2 Euros is not a lot of money but if this is something they do regularly I thought it would be a good thing for me to mention here. Off the back of this, I would recommend you go for the Michelberger Hostel, just a few doors down.

Also the showers are the type where you push a button and it turns it's self off after a period of time, great for saving water but rather annoying when washing your hair/self.
