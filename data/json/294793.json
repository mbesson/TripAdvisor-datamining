Close to Mandalay Bay and 1.5 miles from the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign. Fairly well connected - cabs at beck and call. But walk. Vegas is fairly walk-friendly, and cabs are very expensive.

I was told no and that I would have to take the shuttle to the airport and then catch the rental car shuttle.

The staff is great, the hotel is in reasonably good condition and the beds are reasonably comfortable. The king room I was in, was small. The suite was roomy. You can hear the planes, but to me it wasn't a big deal. You can REALLY hear people walking around on the floor above. I don't know if they have paper floors or what. If the person beside you is noisy, you can hear them too. The fellow beside me decided to have a loud conversation before 7 in the morning and then decided to whistle a tune at 7 am. I could hear this from the part of the suite that was not the bed, which was better than it could have been. Fortunately, he checked out. Maids - reasonably good, but they forget things, so you wonder what else they are forgetting. They should not \"forget\" about the ice bucket 50% of the time, the coffee machine 20% of the time, the soap 12% of the time. Breakfast - at least one of the cooks is not very good. The other ones seem to be fine, so you \"may\" get a substandard omelette. Courtyard Cafe - better priced than most. Actually a lot better priced than most. Laundry - there is only one washer and one dryer. One wonders why there is only one of each. Shuttle - fairly good, but expect to still pay for cabs quite a bit. Internet - usable, free, but fairly slow. Fine for surfing, skype didn't work very well. They reset it at 9 am, so if you're working or on an onlilne meeting, don't be surprised if you have to reset. You'd think that they would have it reset at check out time, would make more sense. TV - old style, but lots of channels. No fancy stuff. In Room Safe: Nice to have, but $3 a day. Used to having them for free, but I guess it is better than the per use charge you get at some hotels. Pool area: If there are noisy boisterous people there (and there will be), and you are overlooking the pool, you'll likely hear every word. Electrical outlets - they have lots of them. Most of them are 20 amp. Cell coverage - good in the hotel from what I can see. Air conditioning - it wasn't hot out, but they seem to be good units.

However, hotel does provide earplugs in Mariott custom packaging, presumably because planes fly over at 2 minute intervals on landing path to nearby airport. Do youself a favor... stay at a five-star hotel on the strip for the same money, and a lot more peace.

Though airport is close by, there is monimal intrusion and no loss of sleep at night. Beds were very comfortable Excellent staff who were extra helpful and friendly Nice bar, widescreen televison and comfy chairs and sofa after a hard day out at the casino etc. Good range of choices breakfast and nicely cooked dinners with adequate selection 5 mins from the strip by hotel bus to Mandalay drop off and monorail Easy to locate off I15 at junction 36 then cross West over the freeway if you are coming from Los Angeles then take 2nd left between a hotel (build in progress) and the Holiday Inn.
