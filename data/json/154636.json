They lost my reservation. English, was broken , at best at reception and belhops only speak Spanish, and a re slow and uncaring, this for a businees hotel. No wifi in rooms. Had to call to get, pen, paper, and a glasses. and articles for the bathroom. Bathroom sink had no popper to close drain. Drying yourself with the towels was like using sandpaper. Mattress was very hard, which I like, most don't but pillows werenlike slabs of cement. Mine ended up on the floor. Nothing in the area as it's an industrial area but heavy traffic & w/street vendors. Ta200 pesos to airport, 350/400 from hotel).xi's expensive at hotel , go out of hotel , turn R and go a block or two and much cheaper ( There is a business center but didn't use it, nor do I know the charges, and there are charges. Restaurant in the basement w/large windows w/people walking by can stare down at you as well as a staircase can come sdown to eat. More like a cafeteria. The food was just oh, expcept for Salmon I had once, but the foof was never hot. I will never go back here, unfortunately, it was booked for me , for work. I have traveled throughout Mexico many times and this is the worst place I have ever stayed. The best thing was the room maids who were prompt, efficient, and caring. Not too bad was room service, used it twice. Food cam quickly but not approaching hot.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Kirk_Franklin", "ReviewID": "UR119709717", "Content": "The hotel is modern, with good access to the Metro, Metro-bus and taxis.

No wash-cloths, no hand lotion, no coffee pot in the rooms. As there is no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in the room, the maid knocked on the door prior to 8 in the morning, each morning we were there - my goodness- we're on vacation! The first night I cut my finger on a sharp object in my suitcase, I went down to the desk to see if they had a first-aid kit with a band-aid. No, no first-aid kit, no band-aid. They sent me (66 y.o. female) out on the street after 10PM to buy a band-aid.

You get a safe, clean, VERY convenient Hotel close to the subway, two shopping malls(one, the Parque Delta matches most anything in the States), and good restaurants within walking distance. If you strictly want to be downtown, there are other good options but the Benidorm is a very short walk from the General Hospital subway stop and just a couple of stops to the Juarez station and many downtown sites--for two pesos--about 15 cents US. One notable feature of the Benidorm is that beds and pillows and bathrooms are top American quality--clean and comfortable. A Large in room safe helps too. For discount prices like on 1800hotels.com I do not see how you can beat the value of the Benidorm. There are great places to eat breakfast nearby--ie the Sanborn's directly across the street. The one totally confusing factor and the only reason I rated service lower is the PRE-purchase breakfast you can buy with the room. Be prepared for an adventure of what the breakfast allows and what you may be charged extra for. Not exorbitant extra charges but irritating and the front desk and restaurant do not seem to communicate-ie dont bother complaining to the mgmt about the confusion of what a pre-purchased breakfast includes. This is a small complaint. Just buy your breakfast separately each day or go to Sanborn's--and stay on the quieter NON-main street back of the hotel, You will be truly amazed what 50 or so USD's buys you!", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "medellin", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "erickMedellin", "ReviewID": "UR19696916", "Content": "Nice location one the most important thing in Mexico DF is a place close to a subway (metro) because the chaotic traffic, this one is close to a one of those stations, and it is 7 blocks from a big mall.

The room are spacious and fairly clean, however the bed sheets were terrible used (i found a hole in one). The bathroom is far froom a 5 * hotel (more like a 3*). They have a gym thats a joke, small space with most of the equipment were broken... The breakfast was another joke, a nice room with plenty of light, but no cheese or ham !!! the orange juice was in the balcony on the staff area, only one type of bread, however they had fried liver with onions for breakfast... (please!).
