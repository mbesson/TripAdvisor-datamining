Its a small hotel and the staff were friendly and helpful but there were a few negatives, the bathroom was so small we could hardly close the door when we were in as we couldnt squeeze past the sink!! The room was cold, the only source of heat was a small electric heater that they had left in the room for us, our bed was against a window and this probably didnt help! The breakfast was continental, which was grand for us to start the day, the staff leave a tray with cornflakes and a croissant outside your door in the morning.

My girlfriend and I showed up to the reception area and a young man, who could not have been older than 22, checked us in. Upon signing for the room I saw that he had placed us on the first floor at which time I asked if he could put us somewhere else. I have this thing about being on the first floor, I am always afraid that we are going to be right near the elevator, or that people coming in late at night are going to pound on our door, or wake us up from being too loud. The young man gave us a room on the fourth floor of a building down the block from the main entrance. It was nice, bathroom seemed pretty modern. There is no place to hang a towel in there, but there was plenty of closet space. There was no elevator in this other building so we had to haul about fifty pounds of luggage up four flights of stairs - no easy task. The young man told us about this before we accepted, but he also said it was a nicer room than the original one on the first floor he had selected for us. The room was made up nicely each day after we left, but what I can't stand was that the maid had turned off the air conditioner off each time after she entered. In a perfect world, housekeeping would leave it alone so that when we come back from a long afternoon of sweating in the streets, we could come back to our nice cool room and not have to wait the couple hours for it to become tolerable again. It must be a law of hotels to do this. They have a computer on the first floor which is free for guests to use. This came in very handy. Also, the concierge at the front, a pretty young lady, was very helpful with stores in the area that could help us, and where we could find things. You should know that this is a very ethnic area of London to reside in. Don't expect to see men in bowler hats and women with Union Jack flag earrings. Instead, expect burkas and full face coverings on women walking around. There is a strong Arabic population and the stores reflect that. None of them seem to serve alcohol. Walking along, you see a lot of juice bars and tea houses. There is one spot where you can get a beer late at night, it is an Austrian bar/restaurant on Bishop's Bridge Road called the Tiroler Hut. We went there after a waitress we met on the street gave us the lowdown on the area. She said to walk down the stairs, grab a beer and settle in for some fun. She was right. They serve good beers out of these huge Bavarian steins. They cost a pretty penny, about $26 U.S. for two. But the entertainment inside is the real gem. The Austrian owner has a karaoke bar complete with an electric keyboard. He sang \"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra in a thick Austrian accent and then he played a song on his saxophone. It was like a scene out of a David Lynch movie but I would not have traded it for the world. Only in Bayswater Baby!

We were so tired we said OK to this,until we got next door and saw the bedding! The pillows were all stained yellow with mould on them and the quilt which was sticking out the end of the cover was all disintegrating and mouldy looking. There was no tea,coffee milk etc at all and only a pershed old dishcloth on the sink. We went back and said we couldn't sleep in those beds. They relented and said we could have 1 night in the hotel and they would try somewhere else the next day. The hotel was better but still an old perished dishcloth on the sink the bathroom wasn't very clean. We were thankful though at this stage just for a bed. We were told we had to leave our luggage in the lobby the next morning and come back in the afternoon to see what they had found. Got back late in the afternoon to be told nothing else was available. It was either the flat next door or nothing. We said in desperation as long as they changed the bedding we would stay there. After all that we turned on the TV to find the only channels were arabic. Told reception, she didn't believe us until coming over and trying for herself. They did at least end up getting a technician in to install an aerial. I would say avoid this hotel at all costs.

Apart from that there was a generator or something like that outside. And when someone somewhere in the hotel turned on the water tap, it sounded like a plane was taking off. So I was lucky to get some sleep between 2.30 and 6.30 a.m. I was exhausted! On the last day I had to leave for the airport quite early; reception forgot my wake-up call. Two positive points: one: the location of the hotel is great, not far from Queensway where there are two underground stations. Two: I try to look on the bright side; from now on all hotel experiences can only be better!", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "cumbria", "Title": "\u201cif you want more than just a room,dont go!!!! no bar, no restaurant,no lounge.no nothing!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "elliemay19", "ReviewID": "UR72835553", "Content": "was led to believe that this was a 4*..........no way!!!!! continental breakfast consisted of stale croissant,box cheerios n pint of milk, delivered to your room because no breakfast room, no lounge no bar, just expected to sit on your bed and eat it!!!!! would NEVER go back n would NOT reccomend", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Transylvania", "Title": "\u201cNewly renovated - but they did not get it right\u201d", "Author": "misteracdc", "ReviewID": "UR69380118", "Content": "Here are my comments in a nutshell: Pros: - Good location within easy reach of public transport, shops and restaurants - For central London a surprisingly quiet location - Newly done up and quite tastefully so (if you like a more modern style) Cons: - Small rooms - I had a basement room with damp/fungus on the wall above the skirting - No sound proofing; my room had a connecting door to another room and you could hear the person breathe next door. I thought I had someone in my room actually! And for sure the other person heard me breathing as well! - I got charged for breakfast (the room price included breakfast) but could not make use of it as they don't serve before 8:30 am. Too bad if you need to leave the hotel before that time. - Also unusual and maybe of interest if you travel with a few friends and colleagues: there is no breakfast room. Each guests gets their (continental) breakfast delivered to the room. So you are forced to have breakfast by yourself.

The beds were comfortable and the shower really nice! The location is absolutely great! Bayswater road is so much fun and full of great and not expansive restaurants. The underground station 'Bayswater' is closest by (a five minute walk). During our stay this station was closed on Saturday and Sunday, but literally one minute from 'Bayswater' is the station 'Queensway' which is on the central underground line, which will take you directly to central London. It took us about 15 minutes to get from the hotel to central London, so that was absolutely great!

Bizarrely, though, my trip there did not get off to a great start... I arrived at the hotel at around 00:30 and was greeted by the only negative element of our stay - a man void of any courtesy or acknowledgement that you are what's known as a guest. He looked like he'd been dragged out of a hedge sideways too. I don't normally judge people like this but when you work in a service-based industry you should always present yourself well. t felt as though I'd intruded into his living room. I had pre-paid for my stay through an online agent. He asked for my credit card which I, at the time, thought was normal, maybe in case I broke anything in the hotel. He took my credit card and said \"\u00a3360 - is that OK?\" I was a little stumped... \"Err, but I've already paid this online!\" In a very \"don't mess with me\" tone, he said \"Nnnnno you haven't...\". I certainly didn't have the funds to pay this a second time around and sort out later and I wondered what I'd got myself into. After some convincing (namely by showing him evidence of my receipt about four times over) and his mumblings about \"some agents don't pay us\" he gave me the keycard and told me he'd contact me if any payment needed to be sorted out. I was too tired at that time to even say \"No you won't because there's nothing to discuss!\" so I just went to my room. You could immediately tell that the hotel had been recently refurbished. The best I can describe it is a high end Ikea-like standard. The life and corridors were all new and it had a quality feel to the place - for a budget hotel. The room doors were thick and meaty. Upon entering my room I was immediately impressed. It's always a relief to walk into a hotel room for the first time and get the \"thank God it's nice and clean and spacious\" feeling! There was plenty of space around the beds and plenty of room for manoeuvre. Most London hotels are small but this was at the large end of small. The TV was a large flatscreen and came with all Freeview channels. Furniture-wise there was a desk, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe - standard in most hotels. All elements seemed relatively new. Not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing but there was a kitchenette in the room. Handy having a refrigerator but I doubt many people who tour London are going to be making BeanFeast in their room and I'm not so keen on the idea of having a kitchenette right next to my bed! I think the quality of the room was spoiled by this. The bed was not naff in any sense of the word but I'd agree with other reviewers that it was hard. It wasn't uncomfortable as such but I stayed here for five nights and I'll hold my hands up and say that I was glad to get back to my own bed after that length of time. The bathroom was small and cramped but if there's only one person in there then you can't really complain. I'd rather have a small refurbished bathroom than a larger dirty old bathroom. The shower cubicle was a tight fit although the water pressure was good. The view from the room was nice enough - buildings of the same height are situated across the road but they're certainly not an eye sore. You can view a leafy sqaure just to the left. It was nice to look out of the window and relax. Maids came to change our sheets on a bi-daily basis and the rest of the staff were courteous and helpful. The location is quite good - Bayswater tube station is only 5 minutes walk away and once you have Tube access you can get to anywhere in London very easily. Bayswater itself has plenty of restaurants and cafes to choose from, although you are really limiting yourself if you just stay in the area. We only saw the original guy who 'greeted' me on the second night of our stay. He was smoking in the porch area - and did not return our \"Hello\", but instead proceeded to loiter and stare at us. I suspect he is the owner but that place would be better off without him lingering around. He made us feel nervous. If it wasn't for him I'd probably have given this place 4 stars. The hotel itself is a great find if you're looking at a budget of around \u00a370 per night. I'd certainly recommend it to friends.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Hyde Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d758236-Reviews-The_Hyde_Park_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$102 - $430*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">23-25 Leinster Square - Bayswater</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 4NE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "758236", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/18/20/1820981f6bd37750b0a2ee37d752d41340large.jpg"}}
