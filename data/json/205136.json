It is located very conveniently - close to the train station, so you don't have to walk too much with your luggage. At the same time you are in the city centre and all the sightseeing attractions are in walkable distance. The entrance to the hotel is a bit dodgy and confusing. There are few hotels in the building - like one floor - one hotel, but the room itself was clean. We didn't have any special view - the window was inside the courtyard which made the room quite, so it was ok. the strange thing is that the sink is not in the bathroom, but in the room - a bit unusual. In the bathroom there is a toilet and the shower which is quite small. the breakfast is included in the price of the hotel, but it is not served in the hotel itself - you get the ticket in the hotel and get your breakfast in a cafe across the street - the croissant and juice/tea/coffee. The pastry was very good, but the drink was nothing special (you'd better pay separately for a good espresso in some local place nearby).", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aviano, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWorst HOTEL ever\u201d", "Author": "juskicknit36", "ReviewID": "UR100816068", "Content": "This Hotel was Horriable!

The wifi is up on the 5th floor, this hotel is on the 2nd floor, even if you get signal it's 5 euros for 5 hours. It's in a pretty good spot, only a block from Termini (central station) so getting around is not a problem. Lots of cheap dodgy eats around, though if you walk to the other side of the train station the quality of restaurants improves immensely. Close to several internet cafes and laundrettes. Watch out if you go a few more blocks to the north-east, that seems like a potentially unsafe area. Stick to the regular tourist zones.

As of this moment, I cannot think of any. The help was surly, argumentative and petty. The room had furniture that you could not give away. The Internet (5 Euros for 90 minutes) could not be received by our computers. You had to be buzzed-in past security glass to get in the place. It reminded me of places that \"ladies of the night\" utilize. You are greeted by graffiti and garbage in the elevator well. (I stayed only because they had my credit card number, I had been up for 30 hours without sleep, it was 11 p.m., and it was raining.) We had to trudge up two flights of stairs to a door in an elevator well that said \"Hotel Rubino\". To get in, you had to push a button on an intercom to get in the door. When we were finally given our room, it was actually at the \"Hotel Planet\", in the same building, 3 floors up. They are apparently allowned by the same people, as the \"help\" (if you could call it that) seemed to work in several hotels simultaneously. Our \"view\" was of a garbage-filled alleyway between buildings. We got a 4-bed room. It was actually a very small double room with two other beds wedged into the room. You almost had to step over beds to get to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there was a moldy water pitcher. When we left in the morning (as soon as we could), there was another group arguing vociferously with the \"help\" about the cleanliness of their room. They had actually put large dust-balls in a plastic bag to prove how gross the room was. Yet, the \"help\" was arguing loudly! It was a black comedy! Go to the other side of the Termini for rooms, preferably about 3 blocks. We found a room at the \"Hotel Romantica\", which was cheaper, clean, and attractive. Otherwise, unless it's raining, sleep on the ground inside the Termini. It's cleaner, and people are likely nicer.

This had been booked in good faith by our friend (14 of us on a much awaited trip) who had been guided by the photo's shown on the hotel website along with the list of facilities. Half of the rooms were not ready, even though they had been booked two months earlier, I sat in one of the two chairs in reception and was left with something quite wet & disgusting clinging to my hand. The bedroom was dark, dirty and shabbily furnished. The bed sheets had what looked like moth holes, the shower curtain was covered in mould. The bathroom was so tiny that once you sat on the loo, you could wash your hands in the sink & your feet in the shower, all at the same time! The dressing table unit was chewed at one end and the drawers had telephone numbers, names etc., beautifully scrawled inside in felt pen, giving it the appearance of an old school desk.... ! Breakfast consisted of a scrap of paper to attend a \"bar\" across the road for a croissant & coffee, with standing room only to consume it.....outside....... luckily the weather was quite pleasant. All of this for the sum of 100 euros per night....what a rip off. Our first night was paid in advance, but by 8 am the next morning staff were phoning our rooms demanding payment in cash for the following 3 nights. Needless to say, our mass exodus of this disgusting hotel promptly took place before 10 am. Hotel Aphrodite, which is literally around the corner quickly made arrangements to accommodate all 14 of us at very short notice....for 85 euros per night for double room/breakfast. This hotel had lovely clean, well equipped and furnished rooms, which included mini bars, satellite tv, hairdryers etc., The staff were fantastic, attentive & extremely helpful and their continental buffet style breakfast in their roof top dining room was lovely. In conclusion, Hotel RUBINO should be reported for false representation. It is obvious that we were not the only people to be hoodwinked into parting with a substantial amount of money. We were fortunate that our friend was \"switched on\" and we didn't meet their demands and pay up front for the remaining 3 nights. Nevertheless they \"made\" 700 euros from our party on that one night. I felt so sorry for our friend, who had gone to so much trouble to arrange this trip for us as he felt responsible.
