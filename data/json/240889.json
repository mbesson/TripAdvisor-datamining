The first night I was there, just before getting ready for bed, I had a problem with the plumbing at about 11PM and there was no one on duty to fix it, so they had to move me to another room (a bother!). The room they moved me into was about the same, but was next to the elevator (a bit noisy, but not too bad) and had no desk ... actually it did have a child's table, about 2 feet square and 2 feet off the floor - not ideal, but I made do.

And I seriously can't believe they charge 16 for parking. OMG!!! I was afraid someone would break into my car!! its a nice hotel,but compared to normal hilton standards it needs to have the parking garage updated and secured in order to call it a hilton. Plus we were on the elevator with a couple who were able to ditch the 16 fee by lying that they didnt have a car. All I can say is the rooms are nice and every room has a balcony.

The staff was helpful when approached with a request, and the business center allows you to email items to be printed out for free. On the not so plus side, the refrigerator wouldn't get below 50 degrees and we had to get another trucked upstairs and installed so our food wouldn't spoil. According to a staff member, this happens all the time. Also, the leather(?) on the loveseat's arms was completely worn off on one corner in our room, exposing the dirty interior. We also didn't appreciate the giant fan-fueled air freshener in the lobby hidden behind the ATM machine. It blasted our face full of overpowering fragrance every time we approached the elevators in the lobby. One thing of particular concern was that the building fire alarm went on and off several times one night starting at 2am in the morning, blasting us out of our beds. We tried calling the front desk several times after it began and nobody answered the phone, even after 25 or 30 rings. We finally decided to risk going back to sleep despite not knowing what was going on.

Overall though thebstaff was very very friendly pool was nice even enjoyed the gym a couple times. The only truely annoying thing was the person i assumed was sneaking into the hotel to put menus under every door every day. The menus stopped around 3/4 the way through my stay so i assumed they got caught. When the maids came to clean each day the menus never got picked up off the floor(because i never picked them up from being slipped under the door). So approx. 9 menus stayed on the floor even on the day i checked out..i hope they got picked up b4 the next person checked in! But overall it was a very nice experence if i had the money to spend on a vacation to san diego i would have no problem selecting this hotel", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new zealand", "Title": "\u201ca good stay\u201d", "Author": "smithNewZealand", "ReviewID": "UR117041010", "Content": "we are from new zealand, reading the reviews had me very worriied about my choices in staying in hotels for our three week stay in the usa we had four days in doubletree club hotel san diego, well on arriving we found the hotel to be very nice the rooms very big we were staying with our two teenaged sons, the beds big and so comfortble lots of pillows big flat screen tv, cookies on arrival, good size bath room with bath nice views from our room, a couch and table with chair for our laptop. the pool and hot tub we used every day it was so good and there gym was good to we had tea at the resturant one night really good pizza over all our whole family loved staying here and would come back again, some times its good to read trip adviser but some people are really so picky for them they should pay more stay at really flash places and stop moaning over all i would give this an 8 out of 10", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sahuarita, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMore for the business traveler\u201d", "Author": "sahuaritaMom", "ReviewID": "UR116287315", "Content": "Grounds are very well kept and hotel is very clean.

My husband and I stayed here for 10 days because I had to attend a conference downtown. In a nutshell, here were our problems: 1). Broken fridge for the entire stay (was replaced eventually... with a equally broken refridgerator!! I wouldn't have been so mad if we hadn't bought a bunch of perishables for the week that we had to throw out). The second time we called, the maintenance guy told us he'd be right back... and never came back. The third time (after 4 hours), the guy told us he'd look for a new fridge... Never came back. The fourth time the desk said they'd send someone up, but they never did. 2) On our last day, we woke up to NO WATER!! We couldn't brush our teeth, shower, or use the bathroom..... When we tried to call to find out what was the problem, nobody ever answered. We'd had so many problems thus far, we decided to just forgo the shower and get the heck out. At checkout, no appologies were made, no explanations were given... and absolutely no discount offered. Really?? The hotel charges $160/night and they don't feel it necessary to provide running water? Seriously... DON'T stay here. Other issues: the staff was less than friendly the entire week. At check in, they asked for a credit card and I gave them one, asking why they needed it since the room was paid in full in advance. I specifically asked whether they intended to charge a deposit, and I was told NO. Well, the next morning I discovered $350.00 had been charged to my creditcard. The front desk admitted it was their mistake and told me.... \"Sorry about that, the girl who told you that is new. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to get you your money back, and if you check out early you'll lose the $ you pre-paid for the room. If you had brought a car with you, I'd offer you free parking.\" Well that helps now doesn't it. Half my spending money is now unavailable to me, but I get to park my imaginary car for free!!! I wouldn't have been upset to put a deposit down, that's pretty common. I was mad because the girl lied to my face. Furthermore, it was not mentioned anytime.... I went back through the fine print (priceline, etc) and I was never told that I would need to put a deposit down. Still would have been okay if the girl hadn't lied to me and then refused to do anything about it. As for the rest of the stuff: the cookies were cold (I've seen a lot of people ask about that... it was the least of my concern but they do boast \"warm\"); the hot tub was not hot and the pool seemed nice, but we didn't jump in because the weather was rainy/overcast. The resteraunt staff were equally as rude, and the breakfast buffet consisted of runny scrambled eggs, soggy potatoes and pancakes, cold coffee, and assorted breads and yogurt. Not exactly worth the $15.00 they'll charge you for it. We ordered pizza once (up to our room), It cost us $20 and arrived cold. I wish we would have called Domino's or something. I thought it was super gross and wouldn't recommend that, either. We tried to hit up the happy hour, and the waitress who greeted us had no idea what was on the happy hour specials... Nice. When we finally did figure it out, the food we had (chicken wings and flautas) was pretty good! cleanliness: Actually, it was decently Clean! For the most part, anyway. Wouldn't rave about it, but it wasn't scary to sleep in the beds and I never saw any bugs. Considering the rest of our trip, I'd say the cleanliness was the highlight of our stay. The cleaning crew came almost every day... They'd empty the trash, make the beds and wipe off the counters. They didn't replace our sheets ever, and didn't replace our drinking cups when they \"cleaned\". We had to call down to get extra toilet paper and soap when we ran out, which took forever because of the front desk's wonderful service. At least the water was still working at that point. Needless to say, please take heed and consider my mistake before you book! I had read a few bad reviews about this place before I booked it, and I wish I would have listened. Locatation: On a side note it was very difficult to access downtown from this hotel's location. Their is a bus system that can get you there if you're willing to take several hours and buy multiple transfer or all day passes, but it isn't at all convenient. I didn't feel safe taking it at night, although I've lived in big cities such as D.C. and Miami. Taxis will cost you $20.00 each way, unless they take the round about ways as did our first driver.

The lack of hygienic practices by the housekeepers is disappointing, but I am just making sure to bring in plastic cups and ask for towels at the front desk.

If you don't need a family suite, I would recommend staying elsewhere as who knows if the sheets get changed or the towels just refolded instead of replaced by what seems to be a housekeeping staff that cuts corners. I hope the manager doesn't just write one of his generic \"sorry we didn't meet your expectations\" replies but that he actually states that they are going to audit rooms periodically to evaluate my concerns.

The room was quite clean; however, see below for one note about that. The pool area was very clean and the pool was heated. The room had a door between our room and the office/livingroom space so we could put our son to bed and still watch tv in our room. It was nice that he could be to sleep at a normal time and we could stay up later. Due to the length of our stay, the hotel waived our $16 a night parking fee. (My husband requested it prior to booking the room. They did try to charge us for it at check out, but it was an oversight - as soon as we told them that there was a note on our file that our fee was to be waived, they took it off and didn't charge us and were apologetic. They seemed genuine.) The staff were friendly. We found the bed very comfy - we like beds on the firmer side. The pillows are fluffy, but we would've liked them to be longer. At least there were plenty of them and we quickly got more pillows and blankets when we called the desk. (See note in the cons re: more...) The cons: Not too impressed with the sofa bed. The cushion on the couch had a broken zipper and the stuffing was falling out the back. The mattress on it was terrible - not good for an adult at all. As previously noted, in another person's review, we also smelled cigarette smoke during our stay. Only for one night but the smell was very bad. I did observe the cleaning staff cleaning our glasses in the bathroom sink. We used paper cups after that. In our opinion, they should be put through a dishwasher and sanitization process. Not the hotel's fault necessarily, but there were several sports teams staying for the weekend. We obviously had no access to the pool area during their stay. As well, the kids were playing some form of ball in the walk way to the door - not very safe for people trying to get by. Perhaps the hotel staff could try to curb the ball games, at the very least? The cushions on the patio furniture near the fire pit area at the pool need replacing. Some are torn and very worn. They are not up to the standard of the hotel. Some of the spare blankets we received were VERY worn, even with holes. They need to check them before providing to guests. Our biggest disappointment was that we read on their website that laundry facilities were onsite so we packed light. There were not facilities onsite - major disappointment when we were there for 8 nights. We were told we could perhaps go to a sister hotel, but they didn't make arrangements for us, nor could they tell us if we could use their pool or anything while we waited for the laundry to be done. Ultimately, we had to make our own arrangements. There is no microwave and the fridge was quite small. Overall, though we found many pluses to the hotel, we most likely won't stay again due to the smoking, lack of laundry facilities and their cleaning of glasses in our bathroom.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa fe, New Mexico, USA", "Title": "\u201cSMOKE!!!

It was strange because the bed was made, dirty towels were gone, BUT towels weren't replaced, trash cans were full, there was gunk on the sheets..... What the?! My husband picked up the phone to call the front desk and is asked to hold. No big deal, I just want a new room. 10 minutes later the front desk person picks up and asks if he'll hold again, he said NO! He tells the girl what the problem is and she says that we can come down to get a new room. What's confusing me at this point is why the dirty towels were removed & the bed made, but trash wasn't taken out and towels weren't replaced. I know most hotels don't change the sheets daily, but I've never had the trash not emptied when housekeeping comes in to make the bed & tidy up. We wait at the front desk again.

The beds were the typical DT beds, nice sheets, comfy mattress. Large flat screen TV. In the cabinet under the TV is a mini fridge which was really nice for leftovers, a big plus. The desk area was fine. The couch was comfy. The sliding door lock didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, but on the 3rd floor I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too concerned since the slide in L shaped metal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was there. Our little rounded balcony looked out over the pool area. Rather The thing was that every night we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hear all of the kids & families outside in the pool until it closed. Then for some reason after the pool was closed the area around the pool became some sort of hook-up central. There were adults with clothing coming off at least two nights during our stay. Personally, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if someone was just taking off a jacket, if the pool is closed no one needs to be in that area sharing one lounge chair even cuddling. Go inside and get (into) a (your) room! The drain in our tub was so slow the tub would fill up during one shower. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not fond of sitting around in the room in the morning for my husband or I to wait for the tub to drain after the other has showered. It was very par for the course when housekeeping left the hair & soap gunk in the bottom of the tub after they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cleaned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after our first night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the housekeeping person just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care that the tub wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t draining; it has to be the guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 job to keep track of those things. So we stopped by the front desk the second morning to let them know that someone had to resolve the tub issue and that the light right inside of our door (the one that is controlled by the switch when you enter the room) had burnt out. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that I was surprised that a bellman was manning the front desk. It of course took him a while to find something to write our request on. I was actually amazed that they did fix the tub issue and eventually the light too! I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not totally within the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control, but the people across the hall from us were super loud and obnoxious. The walls in this place are way too thin. From what I saw there were 3 adults and at least 4 kids in that room. Every morning after about 7am they would flip the security latch out so that they could go in & out continuously. That bouncing sound is super when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to sleep. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also mention the ridiculous rent a cops that just sit & watch TV in the lobby. Glad I can help pay for that too. I would say based on my issues and other reviews those guys probably help get rid of unhappy guests or something. Well, in the past when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had less than stellar hotel stays I have tried not to air all of the details online, I attempt to deal with the hotel first. Since the staff that was on duty through our stay was apathetic at best, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go anywhere. Only the last day when we were checking out did we see a name for the manager on duty or any sign of the manager. But she was too busy frustrating another guest for us to bother talking to her. I did contact the hotel by submitting a complaint through Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. I was contacted by the Front Office Manager (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I can post names on here). I went as far as to send this woman photos and point out that my biggest issue with the whole situation is the lack of an apology from the hotel staff when the problems occurred. I have the past been assigned a room that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned, and the staff has kindly relocated me and apologized. To me, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a job well done. Mistakes happen, the front desk might be told by the cleaning staff that a room has been cleaned; they can only go by what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told. Unfortunately, the response from the manager was that she was going to have half of my stay refunded, and then said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again I am terribly sorry for the trouble this has caused you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. I proceeded to respond, and copy the person from Hilton that forwarded my inquiry to the Doubletree Club. Without actually telling her what to say, I went through a whole email explaining that hotels that can apologize when a problem pops up make me as a guest happy. Sure I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not ecstatic because the problem still happened, but a simple \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sorry, your room was not acceptable, we will discuss it with our staff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is very sufficient for me. Well, once again, no actual apology, just this: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I said I was sorry for the trouble, I meant that I was sorry for the inconvenience that we caused you. This situation was discussed with management as well as our team members and it was in no way ignored. Corrective feedback was given to the team members who did not do their job properly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Look, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know what was done to whom. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what was discussed with whom. I want the hotel management to acknowledge a problem and give an apology. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a refund. Why should the company I booked through have to go through the hassle of a refund. Never did I say I was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or inconvenienced, as I said the indifferent staff was my problem and it should be a problem for this hotel. After my email the manager called my home but I was at work. My husband did give her my cell phone number but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up. After two calls in a row from the hotel I had one long silence voicemail and one that said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello Ms \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmy last name\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No way will I call you back if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually leave me a message or try back later if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how Sprint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voicemail works. Ultimately, I gave up on the series of emails. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting anywhere by emailing the hotel directly. Apparently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was not in the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vocabulary. This place really has potential. The parking situation is bad. The driveway down onto Hotel Circle is steep and you can scrape your car. BUT, had this hotel lived up to the standards one would expect with the Doubletree name those things would have been minor details. The location in hotel circle is great. Easy access of course to the 8 & the 5, but not too bad to head up toward North County either, and really convenient to Old Town. Now they are just problems on a long list of things, most of which could be fixed by this joke of a hotel.

The hotel room was very nice and we had so much fun in San Diego. We also visited their pool which was lovely as well and I think there was only 2 other people in it at the time. The best thing about the Doubletree is the cookies! I went up to front desk 3 times and asked for cookies and every time they gave me one with a smile on their face. So delicious. Now on to the bad. We live in Los Angeles so, San Diego is about a 2 hour drive without traffic. I called the night before and spoke with a nice man in reservations about the possibility of an early check in. He told me that they had 4 family suites available that evening so checking in early the next day should be no issue at all. He advised that I call the next morning but I failed to do that. The next day we left for San Diego and arrived at the hotel around 12:00 PM. When we went to check in they said that the room was unavailable and told housekeeping to put a \"rush\" on the room. It basically means that housekeeping skips the other rooms and goes to ours ASAP because we're there waiting. The guy at front desk told us it would be about an hour. Which, was totally fine! We went to the beach and came back 1 hour and 20 minutes later and the same guy said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. We were a little irritated but still ok. He told us to stay in the lobby and he would let us know as soon as it's ready. Thirty minutes later my Husband goes back up to the same man and says \"how is our room looking\"? and the man looks at me and my Husband as if he has no idea who we are. Please keep in mind that there are NO other guests checking in and this guy told us to wait in the lobby so that he could tell US when the room was ready. It was the strangest thing! Then when my Husband reminds him and he says \"oh your room is ready\" as if he knew all along. I have an 18 month old little boy that was running around the lobby out of boredom for 30 minutes for no reason at all! We were in his line of sight the whole time and he somehow forgot about us. My biggest advice if you stay at this hotel is don't plan on getting an early check-in. Actually, don't even plan on checking in on time because more than likely it won't happen. After that everything was fine. We only stayed one night though. I saw a lot of people complaining about the parking - which is now $16.00. The parking lot is on a steep hilll so when you leave go very slow. The hotel did ask me if I'd be parking there and I was warned about the charge in advance. I read someone said that there was ample parking on the street but I didn't really see that and it's a busy road on hotel circle so, you really don't want to park there. Another thing that I'm just remembering. All of the Family Suites on the 5th floor are next to elevators. There is no escaping it! I actually didn't mind it but you could hear it throughout the night. Also, I kept hearing the people next door to us and they kept waking us up. The walls seem to be pretty thin - not much they can do about that I guess though. I also wanted to add that I love how the Manager of this hotel responds to every review and raves about the positives but kind of dismisses the negatives.

At 9 am, we discovered the cause of the fire alarm - the water boiler had blown a circuit ... so no hot water. When I called, the hotel apologized and siad they would remove the $14 charge for parking. We were told that the part would be replaced within 30 minutes, so we went to breakfast. On the way to breakfast, we noticed that pool was closed and yellow tape had appeared around it. The pool had been in use the night before. We were told that the pool was under repair and would be closed for a week. Oh? Nothing was said at check-in. The hotel gave us one night free. The buffet breakfast is $12.95 per person, but free for higher level Hilton HHonors members. Not a good deal at $12.95, but very good when it is free.

Unfortunatly this would be the hotel that I would not have fond memories of. First thing and if you have read other reviews is the Parking. If management takes these reviews seriously $14.00 per night for parking is a rip off. The parking facilities are difficult to negotiate and are not attached to the premises. Secondly with WiFi Internet at $9.90 per night is also a rip off when all the nearby hotels are advertising in big lights Free WiFi. Heres a tip if you stay on the left side of the hotel you can Pick up the WiFi signal from Kings Resort and use their facilities for free (in fact I am writing this review utilising their signal after they cut my service off 12 hours prior to our leaving). Now to the room....life in a shoe box. The accomodation that I had a Anaheim which was a simular configeration was about a quarter bigger and $20.00 per night cheaper. The bathrooms are tiny however they provide high quality complimentries. The Bed was excellent and very comfortable however, if you close the door between the two rooms this effects the circulation in the main bedroom. Of considerable notice was that upon our arrival in the room that it smelt like stale gym socks. The kids room was comfortable with no complaints from the sibs. Service from the staff was good especially from the shift manager in the restraunt my hats off to him.

Parking is tight, and the ramps can be difficult to navigate if you have a large vehicle. Ramp parking is limited to vehicles less than 6 feet high. Spaces are smallish. It is a shame to charge $14 bucks for this lot, especially since they allow people who utilize the hotel for meeting space free access.

We self parked and unpacked the car. Once we got in, we were told by the rude check in person, Jennifer Aparicio, that they did not have our room and that they over booked and we have to go to a different hotel! She said they will give us a refund and will not charge us at the other hotel. We asked her if we are going to get a comparable room at the other hotel and she said NO, you are JUST going to get a regular room! At this point I was started to get frustrated and upset at her level of condescension and non-sympathy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 after all, we were there with an extremely tired 2-year old. The least we expected after our PAID FOR room was given away, was an apologetic reception. We did not only get that, we got an overbearing, condescending and rude Jennifer. I said: what do you mean? where is the manager?\" and she told us there is no manager and she is the ONLY person there. We insisted we get a room similar to the one we had booked and she told us \"you are getting a free room out of this, what are you complaning about?\" We were so shocked! not once did she say \"I am so sorry for the inconviniance, I understand, I will try my best to accomodate you\" But the story doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end there. She then started helping other customers, while we are standing there to the side. I had to leave to take our 2-year old to the bathroom, and I turned around to tell my husband to make sure that we are taken care of. Jennifer loudly demanded that I \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CALM DOWN\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At this point my husband lost his temper, but not his control. He proclaimed that he believed he may be in a twilight zone episode, and that he has never met anyone so rude, in all of his years of travel. And now the story gets even better. Jennifer, called for the security guard David Veja, and told him to escort us out of the hotel. This was becoming too much. I still can not believe my husband didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resort to violence or profanity. The security guard then said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have to escort you out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to which my husband's reply was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153please try\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile, there are dozens of people at the hotel lobby watching this whole thing. And mind you, this is all happening in front of our 2 year old! The security guard then told us \"you are getting a free room, stop whinig, this is my final offer, take it or leave it!!!!\" to which my husband replied \"who are you to give us an offer? you are a security guard here!\" So we left and went to another hotel, exhausted and SHOCKED!!! I think, the worst Motel would have more qualified and professional people working there. This hotel shoud have 0 stars at best! It is now 10 days past our travel date and I just called Expedia to file a complaint just to find out they have not even called Expedia for the refund!

So I have a good pool to compare from. We booked ours through Get Away Today Vacations. (highly recommend it too) I was a bit worried reading the reviews. But to our wonderful surprise our room was brand new! Check in was seamless thanks to GATV. At the front desk they told us that there was a $7 a day parking charge...which I expected $14 from reading the reviews. However I reminded them that I booked with GATV and the lady gave us a free parking pass. Upon entering the lobby was above average for Hotel Circle. Nice, clean and modern. We were assigned a room on the third floor. (This is an 8 story building and from what I understand only levels 8 and 3 were open. The rest were still under construction.) We didnt notice the construction too much. Our room was pretty quite 99% of the time. However we didn't sleep in past 8am and we were gone most of the time between 10am till around 4pm. One guest that we talked to said her room was a very noisy during the day when she tried to put her daughter down for a nap. She too wish that they would of disclosed the construction when booking. Room was clean, we had a suite that slept 2 adults and 4 kids 13 yrs and under. The beds and pillows and linens were THE BEST! EXTREMELY Comfortable and clean. The carpet was new which is always a plus in any hotel. Missing the mini fridge they use to have. Flat screen tv, wireless keyboard for internet access if you don't have a laptop. Video game controllers. Bathroom needed better lights. Hard to really tell how your makeup looks. Better venation for moisture would be recommended too, but don't know many hotels that don't have that problem. Water pressure was a bit weak but the shower heads were great enough to compensate. All the \"bath samples\" items were Neutrogena not some no-name brand. Came with a full size blow dryer and LOTS of towels! The pool and jacuzzi was clean and comfortably heated with a plentiful supply of pool towels. Housekeeping was very good. They were very very quiet when in the halls unlike some places Ive been to. Check out was seamless again. Just turned in keys and that was it. Do becareful when entering and exiting their STEEP drive way. We saw a Corvette bottom out just creeping down.

I told her that my top priority is a quiet location within the hotel, and double-checked that my room was in a quiet spot. Our room was a \"junior suite.\" I don't recommend this type of room at all. It was the same size as a regular room, with a horizontal wall cutting the room in half. One side contained two beds, the other a hide-a-bed and second television. The \"bedroom\" side was dimly lit--and we later found out that there was no heat/air vent in the room. In the middle of the night, we found we were very warm. Only then we realized that there was a fan for circulation built into the dividing wall--but the button that operated it was broken. Additionally, the phone jack was inoperable--the phone jack was unplugged. We fixed that one quickly. Then the remote to the TV was inoperable. Maintenance was summoned, and they arrived quickly with batteries. No big deal. But the worst was yet to be discovered. When we went to bed, we kept hearing a loud noise.

In fact, we shared a wall with the elevator--and heard it grinding up and down through the night. So much for a quiet location! I only wonder how the circulation fan would have added to the din (if we had been able to run it!).
