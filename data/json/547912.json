When I called for reservations the woman I booked the room with asked me, I did not ask, if we'd like a top floor room, in the back that had a nice view. I said that would be great! We arrived on Sunday afternoon and when we went to check in, the check in woman gave me our key, and I asked if it was a room on the top floor on the back of the hotel, like I was told we'd have. She said no, they were sold out the night before, and were still cleaning rooms, and they were not booked very full for Sunday so they were not using the top floor. I objected to that, but to no avail. The room she sent us to was on the middle floor with a fabulous view of the parking lot and street, she asked us to check it out and if we did not like it we could come back down. We did not like it., The \"view\" is pretty nice out the back, a mix of houses and trees , but still nicer than the parking lot. She said she was not sure what rooms were ready, so we said we could wait, it was not a problem for us, if we could not get in right away we'd just come back later. She checked with housekeepeing, and sent us to check another room. All I looked at was the view, and said we'd take it. We found out later it was a handicap room, so the bathroom was huge, and I hoped no one showed up that needed those facilities. My complaint is that I had to be cranky just to get what we were told we booked. She finally said they do not want unhappy guests, so I do hope they think of that before upsetting another guest. This place is older, no frills, but clean with comfortable beds, and a fair price. The pool area is very nice, too. We did not see any fresh cinnamon rolls the two mornings we were there, but there were some little tins of rolls like you buy at the grocery.

An \"okay\" property, and you can tell at one time in its' prime it was a nice hotel... but it is showing its age. first thing -- should have known something might have been a little off when there was no A/C in the front lobby when we checked in -- and not much A/C in the hallways as we came in the building. Dont know if they were conserving energy, or if this is how it is. Kinda smelled musty as we came in the door to the elevator. Hot elevator, no A/C. Came into our room (has a key, no \"key card\" by the way)... and it too was musty/damp smelling, not fresh. Sheets were clean, but towels were musty. Had a fridge in the room, but it wasnt on, so we couldnt keep our food we brought cold in it until it got colder -- which was several hours later, so we just kept our food in the ice cooler we brought with us. Nice flat screen TV in the room. Decor was okay, a little dated. A/C unit kept the room cool, but no auto option, so it grinded all night. Walls and floors are thin, so we heard the elephants above us stomping around until midnight, and neighbors next door -- their shower going late, was like it was in our room, not to mention the vent in the bathroom too. I always travel with earplugs, so if you're a light sleeper, you'll need that for the noise around you. Cleanliness -- I really didnt see an issue, but the musty smell was something that turned me off. I found a couple of black hairs at the sink when I went to use it, but threw them in the trash. Toilet was clean, shower was clean. Very SMALL bathroom, but do-able for one night. Only 2 pillows per bed, so if you want additional, bring your own. We checked in at 9:30 p.m., and the front lobby closes at 11pm., so if you need something beyond that, you're out of luck. 2 blankets were in the dresser for covering up if needed. Next morning, we had wanted a great breakfast as the other reviews said there cinnamon rolls, and biscuits and gravy, and waffles............well........ yes there were these things, but the gravy was in little containers you had to heat up. The biscuits were not fresh and fluffy. The cinnamon rolls were up on a tray (plastic box, with doors) like where you'd see bagels/donuts, and were not fresh and warm. Yes there was some cereal and milk. Hard boiled eggs were in the fridge with the gravy in cups. Some fruit juice. And I did not like the coffee at all. Wow, I actually poured it out. Waffles were not freshly made, probably from a box. My kids tried to eat them, and opted not. We wrapped up, and left and went to the nearby grocery store for coffee and breakfast items to eat at the swim meet. All in all, in a pinch we'd probably stay again for maybe ONE night, because it was a reasonable rate and better than another hotel we stayed at recently at the same price point -- but Savannah House is much better in the same area on the Red Route, and has nicer decor and actual hot, freshly made breakfast options. We did not check out the pool, so we cannot review that.

The rooms are well cleaned not just supplied with new linens (I saw one of the housekeepers dusting in a room across the hall). The beds only have two pillows on them so if you are with somebody and are like me and sleep with more than one pillow bring an extra; it may be possible to ask for an extra though I didn't try. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. However, the lobby closes at 11 pm and is closed all night. The breakfast was definitely above par for your included continental breakfast; it had fresh homemade cinnamon rolls as well as biscuits and gravy that were personally some of the best I have ever had. The only one negative I have to say about this hotel is that they still use the old fashion metal keys for their rooms instead of the credit card style ones in almost all other hotels. I really didn't like this aspect of the hotel because you are forced to carry around a metal key with a giant plastic keychain on it everywhere you go. There is a 5 dollar lost key fee if you don't keep track of the keys they give you at all times. I also feel like there is an element of security that is lost with the old keys because if somebody before you keeps their key they now have a key to your room (I would be surprised if they change out the locks every time a key goes missing, $5 doesn't seem to be enough to cover that expense). Also, if you lose your keys after 11pm or lock yourself out of your room accidentally there is no way to get into your room as the lobby is closed and locked up and you will have to pay for a night at another hotel unless you can come up with a better solution. If it weren't for this one negative I would have given them 5 stars. All-in-all, I do recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cScenic Hills - Nice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "Wandering57", "ReviewID": "UR130943453", "Content": "I have stayed here the past 2 summers.

Then employees had there own children running the pool area like it was there home.

When I called to tell them we did not have towels and never used there towels because we brought our own they did not care they still charged us. They had no proof. Just watch out for this because they could do this to any guest once you are home you can not even defend yourself. They could make alot of money on your account.

You will have to walk uphill to your vehicle unless you use the handicapped spaces or stairs. We stayed there 3 nights and I will never book a room there again. There are 4 floors and we were on the 3rd floor, which is ground level. Does that tell you what the parking is like? Upon entering our room, it was VERY warm, so my husband tried to turn on the air conditioner. We had to go back to the lobby to get the desk clerk to turn on the power. I feel the room should have been ready...even cool! I am a person who brings along Lysol spray to disinfect the bathroom areas. I actually had to rinse long black hair out of the shower walls. I don't think the sheets had been changed on the first bed I checked, so we slept in the other one. Thank God there was a GFCI because when I plugged in my hairdryer the next morning, I got shocked. The first day we left while our room was being cleaned at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. That housekeeper was obviously overworked but she cleaned our room very well and even changed the sheets where we slept. The next day, however, we stayed in the room and an older lady did not even leave us all the linens to replace those she picked up. She did not clean ANYTHING. She only replaced pillowcases (after I asked her to) and bath towels, emptied the trash and left. I have never visited a hotel or motel that is CLOSED from 11 pm to 7 am. The lobby was actually LOCKED! We were ready to check out early because the Shepherd of the Hills Expressway was to be closed due to the Veterans parade. There is no other way out of this area and we had to wait until 7 am. Also, they advertise EXTENDED breakfast.......it was awful! I only saw decaf and reg coffee, juice, a bowl of fruit, cereal, bagels and sweet rolls that were obviously from a package. There was a sign that I ignored asking that food not be taken to the room. The rolls were a SNACK for that night. We ate breakfast at Golden Corral. There was also a sign that asked you to not fill your ice chest with ice from the ice machine which I ignored. The second night there was a lot of noise upstairs until very late. There is no place to complain. Remember the lobby is closed. I observed handicapped guests leaving the next morning which explained the noise and why there was a knock on our door even though the \"do not disturb\" sign was posted. Also when my husband got indigestion, I found AlkaSeltzer in their gift shop. Two AlkaSeltzer in a packet cost a dollar!
