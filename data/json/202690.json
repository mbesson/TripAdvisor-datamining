The hotel is a nice old building located in the S.Croce quarter on the Canal Grande, not far from the Rialto bridge. We had one of the rooms on the ground floor, which was large but with low ceiling and dimly lit (it was facing the opposite building across a small canal, and had two small cellar-like windows), with a nice-looking and clean bathroom. I can't complain because it wasn't expensive (90Euros), but I can only imagine how nice the view from the highest floors must be. The staff was friendly and helpful. The best things about the hotel were the location, the breakfast room's balcony (go early to secure a table, there is only two) and the bar's terrace on the Canal Grande. The worst part was probably the breakfast, cheap insta-coffee and machine-dispensed juice and yoghurt. The pastries were nice though. Also, based on other hotels I visited, I wouldn't call this one a 4 stars, 3 at best. But perhaps the better rooms deserve the extra star. Note that we had to pay an extra 10 euros per night for the cot. I don't have any other experience of hotels in Venice, but we were happy of what we got and would definitely go back if we had the chance.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIn one word: GORGEOUS\u201d", "Author": "Sagrr A", "ReviewID": "UR127624473", "Content": "Completely worth every penny and the other 6 people with me would attest to this.

What I liked best about the hotel was being right on the canal. We had a canal facing room for the 1st night - made me feel like Angelina Jolie in the Tourist! Our second room was less grand, but more affordable and had a small balcony with a partial view of the canal. I really enjoyed returning in the evening and sitting out front with a drink, watching the canal traffic go by. The hotel is expensive relative to the size of the rooms, but this is Venice and you pay for location, so enjoy the view of the canal! I think others have done a good job of describing the hotel, rooms, breakfast, etc. so I will give you my tips instead. My tips for your stay would be: 1) Visit the fish market near the Rialto bridge, we saw amazing things, huge sword fish, and all kinds of fresh seafood. Go in the morning, all will be gone in the afternoon and you won't even know there was a fish market there. 2) Near the fish market there is a traghetto (traghetti) pier and you can get rowed to the other side for only 50 cents. The tragetto is a 2 man gondola that ferries people across the canal. 3) Bring a map with you, especially if you plan to return to the hotel after the shops close. Things look very different when they pull the shutters down and you can't use the shop windows to navigate. Thank goodness one of my kids has a good sense of direction because I would have been lost forever. 4) Restaurants get more expensive the closer you get to St. Marks. If you want to eat on the canal for a reasonable price, try the 2 restaurants that are on the canal between the fish market and the Rialto bridge. The ones between the Rialto and St. Marks were much pricier and the tables are very close together (didn't enjoy smoker's smoke and ashes blown by the wind into my face). 5) The hotel offers a free water taxi (one way) to Mirano to see the glass blowing. The water taxi ride was a lot of fun and there wasn't too much pressure to buy - which I would have if prices weren't so high (most things were over 800 euros!). Be warned, you have to find your own way back by water bus (tell them when you get on that you have to buy tickets, if don't, you can be fined for trying to sneak on with out paying). 6) Taking the water bus to and from the airport to the hotel was not a problem for us, I think there were only two bridges to carry the suitcases over. I would pack lighter next time as 20 kgs is a little heavy to carry over the bridges. You get on and off the water bus at San Stae. When arriving, cross in front of the church, heading to your left and look for a very small bridge you will be on the right path to the hotel (do not take the wide road straight ahead from the bus stop). I down loaded a google map and had no problems finding the hotel, it is a 5 - 8 minute walk. The pick up times for the water bus are listed at the stop they ran every 1/2 hour.

There are lots of restaurants in the area (although the San Cassiano itself doesn't have a restaurant). The breakfast was buffet style with lots of choice and a couple of tables on the balcony overlooking the Canal and the coffee was excellent (though I drank so much I gave myself palpitations!). The staff in the breakfast room where charming and helpful. One big problem with the hotel is the lack of bar staff - there is a lovely area overlooking the canal where you can sit and erm well you could have a drink if there was anyone around to serve you! One waiter , Ernesto, is fantastic but on his days off I was told the waiter was too busy to serve me and 'you will have to wait Madam' - not what you expect from a 4 star hotel. Other times we sat for over an hour and resorted to getting a drink from our mini bar and bringing it down. If you are visiting Venice then the Italian Government has imposed a 4 euro a night 'tax' per person which you will have to pay on top of your hotel fees and the San Cassiano insists this is paid in cash so be warned.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kinvara, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA hotel with lots of character\u201d", "Author": "kinvara126", "ReviewID": "UR118000015", "Content": "In June this year I visited Venice with my son and daughter - both adults.

The hotel certainly lived up to the reviews we saw prior to booking - the staff are very friendly and welcoming. As an example, they were happy to lend us some wine glasses for some champagne we bought with us. We stumped up the extra money for a room (103) overlooking the Grand Canal - it was certainly worth it!! The room was HUGE! There is quite a lot of 'Canal traffic', even late into the night and early in the morning and we were worried that this would keep us awake, but with the window shutters closed (and even the windows ajar) you couldn't hear a thing. Comfortable beds and plenty of hanging/storage space in wardrobes and drawers. Room safe was useful too. TV in room, although we didn't watch it. The only downside (considering how big our room was!), was the tiny bathroom - there was a shower over the bath (perfectly fine and powerful) but if you like your baths, you would've struggled to sit/lie down in it! It was rather a 'one in, one out' deal with the bathroom! This is the only reason we didn't score a 5 for Rooms. However, considering the time you spend in the bathroom, I guess I would rather have the extra space in the bedroom so we can't really complain. Breakfast was included in our stay and was very good - bacon. eggs, toast, cereal, pastries, bread, ham, cheese.....plenty to choose from. In terms of location, San Cassiano is in a great spot - in the San Polo district, it is very centrally located, close to the Rialto bridge that crosses the Grand Canal. We booked a shared Water Taxi in advance of our visit as a transfer to and from the Airport (http://www.venicelink.com/) - this was well worth the money as it saves worrying about getting the rather confusing public transport and finding your own way to the hotel, especially if you haven't been to Venice before. As the hotel backs onto the canal, the water taxi can moor up at the hotel so you're dropped off right outside!

Once you find it ! Conveniently located close to a vaporetto stop St Stae, it takes a superior sense of orientation to find your way through a maze of tiny lanes and up bridges until you reach the lovely, well-hidden outside patio. The staff is incredible nice, friendly and helpful, (special mention to the young gentleman with glasses at the reception, the breakfast lady , barman and maintenance young man !)( wish I 'd asked names) so it definitely is a place I would love to come back to if in Venice again. The breakfast room is narrow but with a litlle balcony and weather permitting, having your breakfast looking on the Grand Canal must be quite an experience ! The buffet is standard but good. A minus : a Four stars Hotel charging 3 euros for one hour online looks more than a little mean. Was never charged in other 4 stars. The location near the Rialto bridge is brilliant, away from the trashy atmosphere around St Marc, close to the daily Rialto market. The restaurants are more 'local' than touristic, less expensive and good. But avoid the aptly name 'Ali Tosis' with expensive awful frozen re-heated pizzas, on the corner of a little place.

We weren't disappointed, and can see why reviewers rate Ca' Favretto highly. In truth we think the hotel merits a good 3 star rating more than 4, but on the whole we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Location is excellent; not just the Grand Canal frontage, but the hotel's proximity to Rialto market and bridge, and just 5 minutes from the Rialto Mercato vaporetto stop and the S. Sofia traghetto, mean that getting anywhere is Venice from here is easy and convenient. It's also within very short walking distance of several decent restaurants. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel's own landing stage makes taking a water taxi a very special way to arrive at the hotel (we didn't, unfortunately!) Like many hotels and B&Bs in Venice, the outside belies the interior, which is full of period detail, plans of the building and, of course (as this was a painter's house) art. Decor is traditional and slightly worn, in a comfortable way. Public rooms are compact rather than palatial, in keeping with the fact that this was once a private house. There's a small but well-stocked bar where you can take a drink or tea / coffee at any time of day and a slightly incongruous reading / games room with a wall-mounted TV. Breakfast is served on the second floor in a room which is, frankly, too small for the number of hotel guests, so that it felt busy and cramped rather than a relaxing start to the day. But this is a minor gripe, and breakfast itself is pretty good. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is plenty of information in the hotel (maps, events etc).

It is well placed right on the Grand Canal with stunning views & its own boat landing platform which meant we could get a water taxi Airport - Hotel Door. Expensive at E100 but sensible with kids as Venice is a maze of little streets & steps & i wouldnt have fancied finding it from the Vaporetto stop!! Latterly on exploring by day we discovered that the stop is not far at all and really handy for the hotel. The hotel is really ideally placed, over the Rialto Bridge near the market. This meant that the little restaurants near the hotel were considerably cheaper than the ones over the bridge nearer St Marks Sq. They were also (accurately according to The Rough Guide) much more quaint, family run with great attention to detail as opposed to the more tourist orientated grandeur of the restaurants around St Marks Sq ...that said ... price wasnt the issue, we just like to find the real Italian rustic places which were in abundnace around this hotels location. We ate around St Marks Sq a couple of times and the restaurants were great too ...iv never had a bad meal in Italy!!! The Hotel had a lovely little bar which we enjoyed drinks in every night & it also had wireless access at a reasonable rate so my eldest could facebook her friends on her iphone whilst we enjoyed drinks!!! The hotels breakfast room overlooked the canal with spectacular views and breakfast was varied and of an excellent standard. The hotel doesnt have a lift, but we later found out no hotels in Venice do! But the staff couldnt have been more helpful with the pram etc. The reception staff were incredibly helpful, and spoke great English, we decided to go to Florence for the day and the guy on reception gave me everything i needed to know ...train times, directions to station, last train back, a map of how to get to the Vaporetto stop the most pram friendly way ...just fantastic!!! We had a quadruple room which was enormous, clean, and faultless. The communal areas of the hotel were very old world, elegant and charming.

It was easy to spot from the vaparetto as it's red and stands out form the rest. The nearest stop is the Rialto mercato which is about 5 mins from the hotel. Have a good suitcase with with wheels as there are some steps you have to cross to get to the hotel. The hotel itself is tucked away down some alley ways. The staff were all really lovely. The room was pretty small. I have looked at the photos here and we must have stayed in one of the standard rooms. Have a good look at the photos on tripadvisor as the rooms vary enormously! The weather was cold this week so I was quite glad the room was hot all week but I wonder what it is like when it gets warmer! The room itself, once I got over the shock of how small it was (it reminded me of when I was a student staying in halls at uni) was actually very comfortable and cosy. It had everything we needed and to be perfectly honest, we both loved it in the ned. It grew on us I suppose. The stairs from the 2nd to the 3rd floor are very steep. If you have any mobiltiy problems or a cardiac problem check which floor you are staying on as there is no lift. We are both young and fit but had to pause every time before attempting this set of stairs. I am sure I have toned up this week so it's not all bad. The breakfast room is lovely and very Venetian with a view of the grand canal. There is toast, croissants, yoghurt, a selection of cereals and fruit to eat. Coffee, tea, and orange and grapefruit juice are the drinks on offer. On Sunday there was a slight change to the selection available. Toiletries are available in the rooms. I am a woman who needs to have nice toiletries when I am on holiday. They have shower gel which is OK (so don't waste valuable space taking your own. Save it for shoes/clothes). There is plenty of soap. I think you should take your own shampoo and conditioner. I think the showergel doubles up as shampoo for those who don't mind what they put in their hair. There are plenty of towels and the room is so hot you don't really need a dressing gown. In terms of clothing I would advise taking plenty of warm clothes at his time of year. It's hard to walk around in high heels in venice so unless you really have to, don't bother. You need a good pair of walking shoes for daytime trips. Get a 3 day travel card (33 euros) as this is the best value by far and can be used on the vaparettos in venice and the bus which goes from the airport into venice. There are plenty of things to do and see which I am happy to give advice on if contacted. We stayed for a week and get bored easily so did loads of things to keep ourselves busy and out of trouble. One more thing I have to warn you about is eating out in Venice. It is really expensive. It doesn't look like it is that expensive until the bill lands in front of you with cover charge (per person of course) and service charge (12.5%) added on. At the beginning of the holiday we saw a pair of back-packers sitting in one of the quiet empty squares eating pizza out of its box on a really cold night. We thought it was awful but soon realised that we might end up doing the same by the end of the holiday! There is a fantastic japanese restaurant around the corner from the hotel (if you want a break from lasagne, and breaded veal cutlets). I have so many tips I could go on giving you but I don't want to bore you so I'll stop now. Venice is truly magical.

Thus we were told that we would be put in one room for the first night and then upgraded to a superior room for the remaining 5 nights of our 6 night stay. I decided not to object on the spot, but to see the room that we were going to have for the first night. So, with all our luggage in tow, lugged by a doorman, we trooped up to the top (3rd? or 4th?) floor. The door opened (barely) to a garret that ordinarily was furnished with a single bed. A temporary second single bed had been added and with the small bar refrigeration there was not enough room for us and our luggage. This was our second trip to Venice and we have travelled in the intervening years to other places in Italy, but had dreamed of returning to Venice. I descended to the lobby and patiently explained to the manager on the desk that the room was not acceptable. I mentioned that I regularly review hotels on TripAdvisor and that in my prior visit I had stayed at another hotel that was nearer St. Marks and had been well pleased with it but had selected the Ca Favretto due to the praises sung over it on TripAdvisor. When I inquired if there surely were not another room available for the first night, the manager offered us a room on the first floor that, although it had a low ceiling and is at the level or below the level of the canals, was much superior to the attic closet that we had been shown. This room was almost spacious and the bath included a tub/shower combination. It included a king-size bed plus a day-bed. It was the only guest room on that floor and, I suspect, may often be reserved by folks who may have disabilities and not like stairs. As it was acceptable, we took it and then we were transferred for the remainder of our stay to a truly lovely room. While this room (214) does not overlook the Grand Canal, it may be the only room in the hotel with 3 large windows, two overlooking a walled garden (the entry to the hotel if one arrives on foot), and the third the canal beside a very grand Palazzo with handsome architectural features even on its sides. This room was very nice. The furniture was handsome, in good overall shape, with a terrazzo floor, ceilings of greater than ten feet high, windows dressed in damask curtains and lit by a Venetian glass chandelier. (There was a broken Venetian glass sconce that still worked but wobbled and one gilded flourish of the headboard was missing. But these flaws are in the character of Venice, which is all the more romantic for its decaying elegance.) The bath included a tub/shower, vanity, bidet, etc. and was relatively recent re-done, with newer tile. We made 214 our \"home\" by buying an immense bouquet of fragrant lilies that lasted our whole stay. The hotel provided the vase. We breakfasted every morning to the surprise of the wait staff on the balcony that overlooks the Grand Canal. (The staff assumed it was too cool. Thus, neither of the two bistro tables were ever set in advance. But we moved out there and every morning were then joined by others who agreed that the view and the experience were worth the cooler temperature which we found bracing but not discouraging.) If we had not had the \"bump\" that created a poor first impression, I would sing nothing but praises of this establishment. As we had that experience, but were able to meet it with a positive attitude that resulted in changes being made, we nevertheless had a wonderful time. We LOVE Venice. If you do as well, then I would recommend this hotel but caution you to secure guarantees in advance as to what room you will be assigned and if unavoidable circumstances require last minute changes suggest that you be prepared to meet them with \"serenity,\" the signature, after all, of Venice.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cQuaint, well cleaned though decor calls to mind a treasury of European Swap Meet finds\u201d", "Author": "froufroupaperie", "ReviewID": "UR83386890", "Content": "If you're into a bit of history (who isn't when travelling to Europe?) and can tolerate the European flair of all things antique, then this quaint hotel is a good match.

There is a boat stop just around the corner, as well as an interesting museum of modern art. Sitting on the small terrace outside with a drink watching the canal traffic pass by is just wonderful and we found the staff to be friendly and polite at all times. My only negative comment would be that the breakfast is a little dull. Ok if you are just there for a couple of days perhaps but we were there for a week. That's a minor point though.

It is two blocks from the Rialto Bridge-one of the central points of Venice. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to St. Mark's Square. We arrived at the hotel from the airport by water taxi which are docked directly in front of the airport. The water taxi drive was a fifteen to twenty minute ride in a high speed 35 foot power boat. The trip was reminiscent of the James Bond movie from Russia with Love boat chasing scene. During the first few seconds of the boats unexpected rapid acceleration, my wife lost her new hat which she had purchased in Rome. However, our driver, chatting nonchalantly on his cell phone, while the boat jumped from wave to wave, was oblivious to this casualty. The \"cab driver\" pulled the boat up to the dock in front of the hotel, placed our luggage on the dock, and quickly whisked away on his yacht after retrieving his 100 EURO Fee. Yeah, a 100 Euros but worth every cent. Because the hotel is not large, check in was quick and efficient. The bell captain quickly retrieved our bags from the hotel's dock and we were ready to explore Venice in short order. It is five minutes from the Venice Water Bus number one which is was quite convenient. You learn how to use these water busses (vaparettos) which (which run all day and all night and are an incredible experience) quite quickly. The hotel is not luxurious but is very old world and quite comfortable. The staff was extremely kind and professional. They made us feel very much at home here. Breakfast was served every morning. Here there were eggs (cold if you didn't get up early) bacon, croissants, toast, cereal, fruit, meats, sausage, juice-in short-every kind of breakfast item an American could dream of or desire. The kitchen staff was low key and efficient. Our room was right on the grand canal and the view was spectacular. The room was quiet and comfortably air conditioned. There are a number of restaurants nearby. The night life of the Rialto Bridge area was also only a couple of blocks away.

I'll put it this way: if I go back to Venice, I'll probably try to stay somewhere else for a different experience, but I don't regret having stayed here.

The room is dark, but that's part of its charm, and you'll appreciate it if you're there in the heat of the summer! The room was air-conditioned, too, which was much appreciated. We had a room overlooking the Grand Canal and loved waking up in the morning and opening up the shutters to the windows to the view of the bustling morning traffic on the canal. We would watch people going to work on the vaporetto, people transporting crates of food to the market, police boats, water taxis, you name it! All the bustle could be a bit noisy, but as soon as we shut the windows it was perfectly quiet again, so we could choose what kind of atmosphere we preferred. Then we would head to the breakfast room for a breakfast that exceeded our expectations. We were able to snag the balcony each morning (there are two tables out there but we were always able to get one of them, probably because we are early risers), and enjoyed delicious coffee with steamed milk, toast with nutella, eggs, sausages, etc. I've heard breakfasts in Venice can be expensive so we really appreciated having such a great breakfast available and included in our room price. The service at the hotel was great. Each morning we would ask the concierge to make us a dinner reservation for the evening at a place we'd picked out in our guide book and he would call over to make the reservation for us. That was a huge service, as we didn't speak more than a few words of Italian but wanted to get in to these wonderful restaurants we'd read about.

Having crossed over the Rialto Bridge we followed the water and then uncovered the back alley leading to the entrance. It is not well signposted until you are on top of it. We left our luggage as we were early and the room was not ready and set out to explore straight away. Upon our return we were shown to our room on the second floor (215). I had said it was my birthday when booking so asked for a nice room. Unfortunately, although the room was a good size it was very dark and had absolutely no view due to the fact that it was down the alley. The building next door to us was being renovated which meant it was very noisy. Luckily we had ear plugs with us for the flight which I slept with both nights. It was also extremely hot (26 degrees at night). When we mentioned to the concierge that the air conditioning didn't work he said it was the law in Venice that you cannot use it until the 1st June. There was no mention of this in the room!! (Not sure if that is the case as another review said how efficient it was). Breakfast was your standard continental fare which is fine. It is served on the second floor. We were very fortunate to find a free table on the balcony over the Grand Canal as I got up for my birthday which was a bonus. We had taken some champagne with us for the occasion, but when we spoke to the desk staff were told we could only drink it in our room (dark and dreary) so took it out with us and enjoyed a far more impressive view. I cannot fault the location of the hotel once you have been out and about. We had a lovely time despite the fact that it did not live up to our expectations.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and courteous. The breakfast in the mornings was very good, going beyond the typical continental breakfast to include scrambled eggs, bacon (I think it was actually pancetta), and little sausage-type things. The cafe (espresso) with hot milk was excellent, although they will also make American-style coffee if you request it. I HIGHLY recommend making use of the breakfast room balcony, even off-season. I sat out there alone every morning, since everyone else seemed to think it was too cold. The views in the morning are simply amazing! You can watch the boats coming and going, delivering fruits and veggies to the Rialto Market, and some of the best pictures I took in Venice were taken on that balcony. I was traveling alone, so got the single room. I knew it would be tiny, so was not disappointed. Even though it was small, it was completely adequate and comfortable. There was a fairly large wardrobe, a writing desk and chair, a large enough bathroom with toilet, bidet, sink and shower, a mini-bar, and an opening window that looked down on a little side canal ~ beautiful! The staff was wonderful at giving directions, although I would recommend spending a few Euros to buy a good detailed map at a tobacco shop. That said, I was able to navigate my way through Venice using only the map given to me by the front desk of the hotel, although I got \"lost\" at least once every day. Actually, detoured would be a better word than lost, and it's something that you really should not try and avoid! My two favorite pictures in Venice were taken on my little detours. The hotel internet was free in 30 minute increments, and the hotel does have a bar, although it's not manned at all times. If you want a drink, all you have to do is ask the front desk clerk and they'll send someone in. Another huge perk of this hotel is the deck they have on the Grand Canal. I would sit out there after a long, hard day of touristing, maybe sipping a glass of wine, writing in my journal, or simply staring out on the canal at night. It was an incredible way to end each day. I agree with others who said that arrival at this hotel is easier with a water taxi. If you choose to take the vaparetto, get off at the San Stae stop, and call the hotel before hand to ask for directions from there. It's not far, but the streets are confusing. Also there are at least 3 small bridges that you would have to cross, so I wouldn't try it with a lot of luggage. This building is something like 500 years old, and I think it is simply beautiful. The only caveat I would give is that there is no elevator. My room was on the \"3rd\" floor (which would be the 4th floor in the US), and the stairs are pretty steep. Also, small rooms are standard ~ if you want or need a big spacious room in a hotel with an elevator, you probably shouldn't stay here.

Wall paper looked a little worn, as did the tiny end table next to the bed. Teeny TV. Window opened which had a canal view. Also window in the bathroom. Typical golden venetican decorations, such as gold wallpaper & bedspread. Flat pillow. Bathroom got wallpaper all over the place & was small. No lift. Believe me, I am not one to complain.

This hotel was fine, but I just don't get the over the top reviews. Maybe like most hotels in Venice, I was annoyed to have to turn in the giant key to the front desk every time I left. The front desk clerk seemed cold & not very willing, or not willing to go out of his way to help with restaurant, live music advice, etc. (Although he did pull out a map & draw on it for me.) The bell hop, Earnesto, was nice, but then seemed \"too nice.\" I ran into him twice, once walking around the alleys, & another time on the vaporetto, & he invited me out to coffee. I hate to say it, but it seemed like he was hitting on me, so I tried to avoid him after that. I stayed out past 2:00 AM at a wine bar one night, & had to bang & bang on the front door to get the night desk clerk to open it. Again they had my key, but they locked the door. The breakfast was good & the view over the canal was nice. It was Dec. &, I guess, a little chilly, maybe for most people. There were only 2 outdoor tables, so I enjoyed my breakfast outside.

The location is near the fish market & I loved walking along the alleys, almost feeling like I was going to get lost, to find the place. However, I think most anything in Venice is a good location. At least for me, the most fun was walking around the bridges & alleys. Such an eery, spooky, surreal, magical place. The next year I went to the Hotel La Forcola, which was something like $70 & I liked so much better. Very friendly French front desk person there.

We had a marvellous few days in the city and the hotel really contributed to that. We treated ourselves to a private water taxi from the airport (90euros) and I would recommend that anyone planning to stay here do the same because it is ever so exciting - my stomach flipped as we left the lagoon and entered the canals. Arriving in style, I felt like a film star! We were greeted from the taxi and the staff were very welcoming. A charming man worked 'front of house' during our stay and he always had a friendly word to say whenever we saw him. We were offered a complimentary drink on arrival but were too excited to hang about so we 'hit' Venice armed with the map provided by the hotel. The hotel was conveniently situated, about 10 minutes walk from the Rialto and a bit longer to St Mark's Square. We liked being tucked away and enjoyed the strolls to and from the main tourist sights, passing retaurants and bars catering for Venetians and not mainly tourists. We felt very safe, even walking through the streets in the early hours of the morning. Our room was comfortable and clean. The shutters blocked out all light so we sept well, especially being so tired after hours of walking. We had plenty of wardrobe space and the mini bar was well priced. The small bar is a nice place to have a pre-dinner drink in the evenings. The breakfast room is really sweet, with the food items kept well-stocked, and we liked standing on the balcony and watching the canal traffic. Had it been summer, we would have made every effort to get one of the two tables on the balcony - what a location for breakfast. Venice itself was marvellous. So good, in fact, that we got engaged whilst there. It was the perfect setting. I would recommend the secret tour of the Doges Palace, taking the lift up to the top of the Campanile, visiting St Mark's Basilica, splashing out in Cafe Florian and/or Cafe Quadri (the latter was my favourite with less tourists packed in and gorgeous petit fours) and walking around the sestieres rather than catching the water buses. Only when you set off on foot so you really get the feel for the city. For a nice meal with fresh produce and good wine, I recommend Trattoria Da Bruno (52 Calle del Paradiso , Castello). We celebrated our engagement with an amazing meal at Cip's at the Cipriani. We took the complimentary water taxi (all polished wood and velvet) to the hotel's island in the lagoon and had a romantic candleit meal with views to St Mark's Square. It was expensive (25euros for a soup starter!) but worth every euro. A wonderful way to end a wonderful break in a lovely unassuming hotel.

Everything that could be wanted or needed in a base from which to enjoy Venice is present in this little gem. The reception staff are extremely efficient, and very knowledgeable of their great city, and are happy and willing to help with advice and recommendations. Breakfast is a simple but satisfying affair with fresh fruits and cereals, and eggs, bacon and sausage in plentiful supply. My wife and I stayed in a grand canal view room for 5 nights. The room was beautifully decorated, with a very comfortable bed and plenty of storage space. It had a nice little bathroom, with a great high pressure shower. The view however is why you pay the extra to stay in this room. It isn't quite directly opposite the Ca'Doro, as advertised, but it isn't far away, and the elevated view up and down the Grand Canal is very special indeed. There is a little noise from the boats in the canal, but hey, this is Venice, so it is to be expected. There is no noise whatsoever from inside the hotel, so the room is perfect, offering the best of views, and the best of peace and quiet in which to escape and unwind after the busy days in the city. Rialto is a short 5 minute walk away, but the hotel is sufficiently well hidden to be isolated from the thronging masses. There is no restaurant in the hotel so they only serve breakfast, but this doesn't matter as Venice is abundant in its eateries. Be careful where you go as it is very easy to find bad food here - most restaurants are no better than average at best (in our 5 night experience that is). We did however find one or two wonderful little places. For excellent pizza and buzzy atmosphere, try Nono Risorto - the choice of the locals, and very close to the hotel. For an evening meal, try Vecie Fritolin - delicious food with great service and atmosphere, and again very close to the hotel. The best of all the restaurants we ate in however has to be La Buona Forchetta on Calle de la Madonna. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very well hidden and secret little place, but it was by far and a long long way the best food we had in Venice. A delighful little lady owns it and cooks everything fresh from scratch before your very eyes. What a pleasure. Also, find the Bacaro Jazz Bar, across Rialto and to the left, for an excellent choice in wine and very friendly and lively atmosphere for an after dinner drink - great fun! The hotel could pay a little more attention to its general facilities, for instance, they don't have an internet connection for their guests to use, which is unusual in this day and age, but at least there is one very near by. Similarly, the hotel bar which is so beautifully done sadly has a very 'dead' feel to it, and isn't really condusive to relaxing with a drink at the end of your day. It may be better served if it played some music and / or was attended by a full time bar man. My wife and I are much more accustomed to the 5-star hotel, and perhaps some of the reviews here may be forgetting that Cassiano has only 3. I however would not hestiate to rate this hotel as better than its 3 stars might otherwise suggest. The little things I mention above should not deter anyone from enjoying what would I'm sure be a very comfortable and pleasurable stay.

It's really close to the rialto bridge and off the beaten track so you aren't constantly walking with throngs of people. The hotel room was large and clean, and the shower was excellent. The breakfast was great, we managed to fill up so much we only needed to buy dinner each day, and on our second day we managed to secure one of the two elusive Grand canal side tables - very romantic. The hotel has lots of character, gold headboards, Murano blown glass chandelirs and lovely furniture. I was hoping to get a canal view room, but we ended up with a room on the second floor overlooking a smaller canal and someone's kitchen - which was actually kinda funky. In terms of previous posts about finding the hotel, I'd say if you're on a budget and you want to travel venetian style (i.e. don't want to spend big bucks on a water taxi) I'd go on public transport. We bought 3 day venice cards online for 30 euro each. This gives you unlimited travel on teh water buses (which cost 5 euro), regular buses (which cost 2 euro), and entry to all the public toilets (which cost 1 euro). We picked our cards up from the airport, got the number 5 bus to La roma, and the no 1 water bus (vaperetto) from their to San Stae. It's only a few minutes walk from there, and the map on the hotel website is easy to follow. Having the Venice cards meant we travelled just about everywhere and I think we saw a lot more than if we had had to pay for each trip separately. Definitely go to Murano and Burano (although it's worth noting that in august nearly all the glass blowing factories are shut for the holidays), and if you have time and the weather's nice the beach at Lido is a good place to chillout, and there are surprisingly few tourists (I guess they are all milling about feeding the pigeons in st mark's sq).", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago (Southwest Suburbs), IL", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "gms11", "ReviewID": "UR5617232", "Content": "The hotel is comfortable with a good view of the canal and in a fairly quiet area.

Our guide didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use high pressure sales tactics, but since he paid for our water taxi, we felt an obligation. On the other hand, we were able to arrange a gondola ride that picked us up at the hotel for about the same price we would have paid in the square. One important note: It was recommended that we take a water bus instead of a water taxi to get from the train station to our hotel. Unfortunately, we had never traveled to Venice before and we were not familiar with maneuvering its walkways which can be very confusing at first.

Breakfast was good for a 3* hotel, with usual cold buffet of cheeses, meat, croissant etc as well as scrambled eggs, bacon and strange sausage. They serve breakfast until 10am which is good for late risers. The waitress in the dining room was smiley and very efficient. Though the hotel has a bar, no-one seems to use it. We did....just the once. The guy on reception had to leave his post to pour us a drink, then promptly disappeared. The hotel is about 10 mins walk from the Rialto and all the shops and restaurants. However, we ate one of our best meals in a osteria directly behind the hotel, Antico Giardinetto. Fabulous food and great wine.

We tried to open the windows for ventilation, but I was bitten about 12 times by mosquitoes as there are no screens. Again I complained and the manager insisted that there were not any mosquitoes in Venice that time of year.

We had to keep the windows shut and our room temperature at night hovered in the mid 80s F. I wrote to the manager about our issues. He has replied elsewhere in these reviews but he is defensive.

I could hear absolutely nothing from the rooms beside me - no talking, running water, etc. There was an occasional noise from the hallway, but that happens in any hotel. Here it was not much problem at all because there were only 5 rooms in the hallway. I never heard a thing at night. The bathroom was quite adequate in every respect. The shower always had warm water and the water pressure was good. The towels were huge and soap & shampoo were provided daily. The staff at San Cassiano were always courteous and helpful, as well as very professional. I had to check out at 4:00 a.m., and that was no problem for them. There was an attendant at the front desk all night. The breakfast (included in the price) was better than I had expected. Every morning there were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cold slices of ham and cheese, about 4 different kinds of rolls, and fruits such as pineapple and peaches. I would always have an orange flavored drink that wasn't quite \"orange juice\" but it was good nevertheless. I thought the location was wonderful. Even though the hotel was on the Grand Canal, the walking route to the entrance was a secluded maze of narrow residential streets. There are no other hotels in the immediate area, and you can witness the daily life of Venetians just right outside San Cassiano. Once you get your bearings, you'll find that you can reach the fish market and the Rialto Bridge area in just a few minutes. Although I enjoyed the secluded location, it could possibly be a turn-off for some. It takes a bit of trial and error to learn the route back to the hotel, so you need a little patience.

One thing i would say. Dont bother buying a orange venice pass. The blue one will get u into the museums and buses. Not needed to get into the loos. They are only 1E. planty about and they are clean. Best buy.

Despite being on the Grand Canal, we closed the windows at night and the room was very quiet. The staff was nice and spoke English well but were not overly helpful.

We were careful to print out the map to this hotel, based on others' reviews. It came in very handy, but it did not show that all of the bridges (3) you must cross to arrive at this hotel from S. Stae water taxi stop involve large flights of stairs. We had a fair amount of luggage, and this proved to be difficult. I would highly recommend taking a private water taxi, which will drop you off right in front of the hotel, and is well worth the extra spend. However, don't let this deter you from a stay. The hotel was absolutely charming. The gentleman at the front desk was extremely gracious and accomodating in all respects. Our room was a bit small, but it was beautiful, with matching tapestry bedspreads and curtains and a venetian chandelier. The bathroom was small, but very modern. The air conditioning was a state-of the-art individually controlled ceiling unit. Breakfast was very nice, served in an elegant room. The hotel was very convenient to the Rialto bridge and all other locations. We walked all of Venice from here, and loved it!

The staff was friendly and helpful and English speaking. We arrived from the airport via private water taxi which dropped us right at the hotel door. While it's expensive (80 Euro), it's fast (25 min) and no hassles dragging heavy luggage through narrow streets or trying to locate the hotel. The dock has small tables and is just off the bar and lobby area. It is very relaxing to sit there and watch the canal traffic. There is also a very nice quiet courtyard with tables off the lobby. Breakfast was included and is served in a very elegantly decorated room with a view of the canal. An assortment of rolls and croissants, cereal, fruit, juices, coffee or tea as well as eggs and various meats and cheese were offered from 7:30-10:00. Our room was small and faced the narrow side street. However, it was comfortable and clean and nicely decorated. The canal view rooms are larger and more expensive. However who spends much time in the room? Our only complaint was a faulty shower knob that made turning on the shower difficult. We had an easy time finding our way to the Rialto bridge (5 min) and to San Marco (15 min).
