Until the last several trips I had been very happy with the hotel, but the last two trips I had bad experiences. In April I was forced to move to another room for one night at great inconvience to me. I had unpacked everything and was settled in for 3 weeks, I thought. Apparently management wanted my room for a group or large family and they gave me NO CHOICE. This last trip was even worse.. I had made reservations three weeks in advance and requested that I would like one of the three rooms that I prefer. I recieved an e-mail saying reservation confirmed.. When I arrived I was told that the room(s)were not available and I was given a room with a double bed (the room I requested had a king size bed) and was an inside room with very poor ventilation. I am sorry that the management apparently does not value good repeat customers..", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201chello\u201d", "Author": "melltoronto", "ReviewID": "UR102585344", "Content": "best quality,lower price in tips and guideliner,clean beach,clean rooms", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocosingo, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cAs cheap as good hotels get in DF\u201d", "Author": "nasaguy26", "ReviewID": "UR85910194", "Content": "I stayed in Hotel Cuba after a few VERY noisy nights in Hotel Republica just down the street. For only 250 pesos/night, I got a clean room, hardwood floors, a TV and a pretty nice bathroom. I don't know if they've changed their prices since but I later stayed with American friends in \"nicer\" hotels for $100/night and found them to be on par with Hotel Cuba. The only problem I had was the noise. The hallways seem to amplify noise and they make random announcements to employees throughout the day. Very annoying, but still well worth the price.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery noisy!!!\u201d", "Author": "milorr", "ReviewID": "UR85649070", "Content": "It is not our first visit in Mexico DF. We spent many night at different hotels and this one disappoint us a lot. It looks fine when you visit but we had some surprised. If you choose a room on the street, you don't sleep because of the noise from this street. If you choose a room insight you stay awake until the last guest shutdown his TV (which was, for us, around midnight) and you are awake at 5 o'clock by the screemings coming from theese guests (most of them were Mexicain and didn't mind about noise) or the interior garage of the hotel. We wanted to stay there 2 weeks... we ran out after one night! We could not have hot water event if we asked for it many times. They did not supply hangers and the safe deposit in the room was out of service.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Cuba", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1584307-Reviews-Hotel_Cuba-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Republica de Cuba No. 69</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
