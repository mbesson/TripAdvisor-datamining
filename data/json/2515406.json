But once you start paying attention to anything beyond the gloss, this hotel loses stars quickly. First, the bathrooms are tiny. Like, so small that the door can't stay open because it runs into the show curtain. Considering that most of the furniture (the desk, the dresser) in the room was clearly too big for the space (pushed side-by side, with no space between them), I would have been willing to sacrifice a couple of feet in the bedroom and smaller furniture for a slightly bigger bathroom. The upstairs restaurant was closed for rooftop repairs, so breakfast was served in a large, windowless conference room that was eerily quiet. Okay, these things happen: repairs must me made, and they had to serve breakfast somewhere. But the food was awful and expensive. My Garden Scramble was overcooked and dry. My husband's french toast was better, but fairly gummy. And the two together cost $37. That was the amazing part -- they stick you in some large conference room with awful lighting and no ambiance, and don't think to reduce their prices at all. The next night we got a chocolate lava cake to take to our room. It was advertised as having a warm chocolate interior. And when we bit into it, it was cold, cold, cold. Okay, still delicious (it was chocolate, after all), but another example of how they just don't pay attention. The internet is expensive at $10.95/day. My husband and I have separate computers, so before paying for the internet we called downstairs to ask if the daily charge would cover both of our devices, and we were told yes. Then were charged twice, and were told it's because we used two devices. They did remove the extra charge for that one day, but said in the future it would be $10.95/device/day.

As others have noted, the entry is odd, but perfectly workable thanks to fast elevators, the rooms are a bit small, and the bathroom is cramped but fixable by removing a wall. Otherwise, the room was very nice, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet. It is a 10 minute walk from the train that serves the airport ($2.50 each way), and a short walk to almost anything you want in downtown Seattle. The positives: as a Gold member, I received free internet and free breakfast coupons for each day. I learned on my last day that the coupons can be applied to any meal, at a value of about $13 - something to keep in mind as I visit other Hiltons. So, my Gold level status saved me about $25 each day! In addition, they serve a fairly extensive and free evening snack buffet at the top level restaurant, which occasionally served as dinner. This helped offset a glass of wine or two with my \"dinner\". Service was superb, by everyone at the hotel. All staff were excellent, from the housekeeper who serviced my room in 15 minutes when I needed to get back early, to the restaurant servers, and the front desk. This is a very customer-oriented property. A little known trick for bad weather is that there is an indoor path to the convention center. The staff can provide instructions if you don't want to venture outside. The one negative surprise had to do with phone charges. I had planned to take a 4-hour telecon via the internet, but I had a problem with my computer. Since I wanted to use the hotel speakerphone, I looked for a rate card, but there was no rate information in the room. I called the front desk, but they also had no information. At their suggestion, I called their provider, Sprint, but got the usual automated menu system with little outlook for a live person. So, I direct dialed - BIG MISTAKE! After 45 minutes, I had accumulated a $172 bill - almost $4/minute -- you just can't find rates like that anymore for domestic long-distance. Usually, rates are under a $1/min. I was motivated to get my computer working and finished the call that way. Later, I got a call from the front desk apologizing for their lack of information, and they cut my charge in half. A nice offering, but still, these charges seem out of line. I am drafting a letter to the hotel manager - they need to post their rates and not put their employees in this awkward position.

If you rent a car, try to rent one from National or Alamo so you can return it here and avoid the horrendous parking fee. Our room on the 25th floor looked updated. We did have a partial water view. We decided on two double beds instead of one king bed because our daughter was staying with us for a few hours until her red-eye later that night. We're used to sleeping in queen beds at home so a double was tiny and uncomfortable. The bed was also very firm and the pillows were very mushy. The A/C by the window was loud but turning it off made the room stuffy. We did not get a good night's sleep in this room. Bathroom was clean but tiny, particularly the toilet/shower area. There were more than enough towels and everything felt fresh and clean.

It's also in the 'ride free' zone which means if you're just staying in the downtown area between 6am-7pm, your bus rides are free. I'm sure there are many airport shuttles that can take you here too but if you're on a budget and just have a carry on, you can take regular public transportation buses as well. Room and bathroom were a bit small but not unbearably so. Decor wasn't bad but not super modern either, could use a facelift in the near future.

The lighting in the bathroom is to dim.( I know conservation). The walls are a bit thin. The TV seemed to be programmed not to go too loud. For a Hilton Rooms are bland and dull!

On a bright side, the room was clean with large flat screen TV, it is clear the rooms have been graded a bit, bed comfortable the staff friendly and helpful. This is Business Hotel with little character. Car Rental Desk located in the hotel great for renting car for a day and return.

Cost $25.00 per person but must pick up at the Space Needle.( take the Monorail cost $2.00 per person with Senior and Children discounts) Pikes Market is fun and interesting.( there is Pikes Market Tour) We did not take , but wondered around on our own. Boeing Tour is great for learning about how planes are put together. Everert(Boeing Factory) is located about 30 miles outside of Seattle. Tours are between $48- $56 depending on Tour Company.

Supposedly the taxi fare is $32 from the airport (as adverstised on the cab window), but none of my colleagues or I got that rate. Something about extra taxes due to the airport. Our fares all ranged from $38-45. The bellman at the Hilton were all very welcoming and friendly and the front desk was nice enough. I checked in at noon, well ahead of the 3pm check in time. The room was clean and fairly up-to-date. The downside was that the bathroom was very tiny. It was quite awkward getting in and out of the bathroom to close the door. Also, the hangers for the closet had the tiny hooks so they couldn't be used on a normal clothes rod in order to help combat theft. As a result of this, you couldn't hang your clothes just anywhere. The only place besides the closet was a tiny hook on the back of the bathroom door. This became quite annoying very quickly when getting ready. On my last night there, it was after 10 pm at night and I heard the sink make a funny gurgling noise. When I looked in there, it was full of brownish black water. I called the front desk and someone came up and had it fixed within half an hour. I don't know if this was an ongoing problem as my neighbor had the same problem that night, but the response was quick and was taken care of quickly. The location of this hotel can't be beat. We were two blocks away from the convention center, and about 5-6 blocks from Pike's Street Market. I walked down there 3 times during my stay. The walk down is all downhill, and the walk back can be quite a challenge depending on which way you come back. If you walk down University street (which the Hilton sits on), it will take you straight to Pier 57 where you'll find many restaurants. We ate at the Crab Pot one night where they have a crab boil and dump all the goods on the table for you to break open with a mallet. Coming back up the stairs and hill after a full dinner was a real challenge! But fun nonetheless! Overall, this was a decent stay at a decent hotel. Not the best...but not the worst.

I can now honestly say I do not intend to stay here again. In a nutshell, the level of service here stinks...badly. Here's a rundown of failings of this place (as experienced by us on the last trip) - Lineup of no less than 5 parties at checkin - with one person manning the counter - despite this being at a busy time ~3pm, and with no apology for the wait. - Very snarly front desk staff. Upon informing him that we had 2 reservations (for consecutive nights...one with points, the other at a pre-paid rate) he reacted with serious attitude, as if I was inconveniencing him and that it was MY fault the reservations weren't \"joined together\" in the system. He then informed me that our room key \"probably\" wouldn't work on the second day of our stay - which, as it turned out, it didn't. (My opinion - this is a 'technical' issue that front desk should be able to deal with very easily, without me having to be inconvenienced by returning to the front desk to obtain a new key) - In previous stays using Hilton points I was offered comp. upgrade to 'executive' floor - not this time (despite the hotel clearly not being full). - Cleanliness of room was NOT up to standard - hair in bathtub and bathroom floor, for example. - Unusual (and cramped) layout of bathroom. - Lobby bar staff were unattentive, despite there being only 3 other people in it at the time. Furthermore, we had to listen to her complaining loudly to another patron about how long she had been on duty. Food was dropped on our table with nary a word. - Finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the fire alarm going off at 7:15 Subday morning, and continuing for ~30min (staff did instruct people via the PA system to remain in their rooms). Upon checkout later that morning I inquired as to the problem, with no real answer, other than \"something went wrong\" (duh!) - nor any apology whatsoever, nor any inquiry about whether our stay was satisfactory, etc. My (and I assume MOST people's) typical guage on the level of service at a hotel is the willingness of staff to take care of the small things that might otherwise cause you irritation or inconvenience, staff's expression of appreciation for your patronage and their general level of courtesy and pleasantness. From my experience, the Hilton Seattle is seriously lacking in those respects.

There was nowhere for the taxi to pull into and no awning to keep rain off. There was no doorman. Just a door at the corner of the building. You have to get on the elevators to get to the lobby and that really wasn't marked well. There's a ramp that leads to parking and a cardio center, but I don't know if I would have even noticed the elevators right away if somebody hadn't gotten off of one of them. The lobby is about 14 stories up over the parking area (I'm guessing at the amount of floors). Reception was efficient if not overly friendly.

I would rate the other Hiltons as \"Excellent\" First of all they charge you $9.95 a night to use the internet in your room. The free wireless internet is only available in the Executive Lounge (small converted guest room) or in the lobby. We went up to the Executive Lounge and it was comical.

After a series of failures by Hilton staff I was put in touch with Seattle Hilton's Director of Security. I asked him why I wasn't notified that my car had been broken into.

This property is in a great location in downtown Seattle, in easy walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Pacific Place shopping, the Convention Center, and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is an older property, but the only way to guess that is due to the slightly smaller bedroom and bathroom sizes, along with the narrow corridors on the floor levels, along with the small number of rooms on each floor. All walls, tiles, linens and furnishings were clean and modern, presenting a nice decor. Bathrooms were equipped with Crabtree & Evelyn Le Source toiletries (my favorite!). Rooms start on floor 14 (which I was on) and run through floor 28, with the restaurant on the 29th floor. Three elevators provided smooth and speedy service. Another plus - to access any guest floor, and room key was required, helping make a single traveler feel safe. The meeting rooms were spacious and the hotel staff kept refreshments aplenty. Breakfast and lunch each day in the restaurant was an unexpected gourmet treat - much more elegant than normally required for informal meals. The restaurant had a spectacular view of Puget Sound and when the sky was clear, the Olympic Mountains. The view was easily seen from any seating area. The bar area also had a menu but I didn't eat there - but the bar was large with a cozy decor. The concierge was friendly and helpful. One night she made a reservation for me at Cutter's Restaurant, making sure the restaurant would provide me complimentary transportation for my return to the hotel. At the restaurant, I was given an appetizer, courtesy of the concierge. Also, I needed a 4:15am town car pick up for the airport my last day and the concierge booked me with a company, saving me $15 off the most affordable transportation I found on my own on the internet.

Not sure why people complain about check-in not being ground level as there are many examples of international hotels with a similar configuration. IMO, not something to really gripe about. I actually welcome it as it means the floors start at a higher level thus further removing you from street noise. Upon walking to the ground floor entrance, the bellman was extremely pleasant and asked if it was my first time. While waiting for the elevator, he carefully explained the hotel amenities and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I was a little early for check-in and my room wasn't ready. No problem. I left my bags with the concierge and went looking for lunch. Upon returning, my room was ready and was given a room on the 25th floor. I noticed they called this floor the HH floor. The room itself was a decent size. The furniture is newish and there is a flat screen tv, although I consider this \"de rigeur\" for the HIlton chain. I did think the comforter was a little on the thin side, but did the job. There is an in-room safe and an electric thermostat. Some of the hangers looked a little derelict but did the job. The washroom sink is separated from the toilet and bath. Both areas are quite small. One thing I did note is that the shower had excellent water pressure. As a HH Gold, I was allowed access to the 28th floor executive lounge and received a coupon for a free buffet breakfast on the top floor restaurant. There were some passes to places such as Gold's gym but I can't remember the other ones. The lounge had h'ors d'oeurves from 5-7 pm. I walked in and noted there was a single hot steamer (didn't look inside) with a decent selection of veggies. I think there was an alcohol selection. Didn't stay as I had other dinner plans. Next morning, went to the top floor restaurant for breakfast. The buffet was not the most plentiful I've seen but decently stocked. There were the standard bacon, sausage, eggs, french toast, pastries, fruit, etc. A feature I like about all Hiltons is that you can ask for made-to-order eggs as part of the buffet. I ordered an omelette and what came back was a HUGE omelette that was very good. I've had omelettes in plenty of hotels before and can vouch that this thing was big. Check-out was smooth. The whole time during my stay, there were reminders that \"I would be getting a survey and if I couldn't rate the hotel a 10, they encouraged me to call someone about it\". Considering the Hilton is NOT a 5 star hotel (I think 4 star), it met expectations. The staff certainly did try and tried hard. I would stay here again, provided the price is right. I'm giving it 4.5 stars (but TripAdvisor won't allow that) because the HVAC was a little loud and the smallish bathroom size.

The drinks are expensive though, so you might want to drink elsewhere. The staff was nice enough, but they didn't even offer or ask if we wanted a mini-bar key. I had to go back down to get one and that was after a lady came by the room to check our mini bar.
