It isn't just a shuttle to and from the airport like so many others--this FREE shuttle goes to area attractions and runs constantly throughout the day. There are scheduled times and you do need to sign up the day before, but the hotel is remarkably flexible and will work with you if you need service at random times (a definite benefit when relying on the often unpredictable Amtrak arrival schedule). The location IS a little ways away from some of the more notable attractions (Space Needle, etc), but the shuttle eliminates that problem. And frankly, with Seattle traffic being absolutely horrific and the only drawback to an otherwise beautiful city, I strongly recommend that you take advantage of the shuttle and leave your car in the hotel parking lot. The amenities are very nice. The hotel rooms are comfortable, clean, and modern. The fitness center is convenient, and the guest laundry? Don't let the term \"coin laundry\" on the hotel's website fool you--both the washers and driers are 100% free. Beyond that, this hotel does try harder than places in similar or more expensive price ranges. I came into Seattle with a severely pinched nerve in my neck--it was so painful that I could barely lift my luggage getting off the train. By chance, I happened to mention it to the front desk clerk just to see if he had any local advice--within 30 seconds he was on the phone to a local chiropractor and masseuse setting up my appointment and saving my vacation in the process.

Hotel Nexus was a perfect spot for us. It is not super high end, however, it was very clean and staff was very friendly and they have done a good job restoring what looks like an older motel. The price was fair, for what it was. The location is just north of downtown, by about 15 minutes or so. However, they have a free shuttle to go pretty much to any of the tourist areas. I do suggest scheduling your shuttle pick up in the hotel BEFORE you depart. They took my husband and I downtown the evening before we left on our cruise, and to the pier 91 for the cruise and picked us up after the cruise also!! We did tip the driver a small amount, but didn't see too many other passengers do so. But, we figured a small tip is still cheaper than a taxi. I would suggest if you want to go to Pikes, not to go to their recommended drop off of (I believe it was 6th), but to go to the Pier 66 stop (I think that was the stop), and walk up to Pikes, vs. the 6-8 blocks that they recommended. The pier 66 stop seemed closer!! But both were fine. The breakfast was decent, beds were comfortable, staff friendly, good shuttle. I would stay here again without a second thought!! I didn't notice any traffic noise, but our room was located on the back side. Starbucks was right across the street (fairly busy street), and it shares a parking lot with a restaurant, which we didn't get to try to our dismay! It's also just across the freeway from a mall and movie theater, which we did catch a movie too. Very nice stay!!!

Kind of interesting that the same swirly pattern was in the elevator. Still looked like an old elevator, but it was a nice touch. The rooms are accessed via walkways that on a windy day would leave you pretty wet, they must work their butt off if it gets icy out. The room was exactly what I was looking for since I was there to take a 5 hr test at a testing center. It was clean, the bed was comfortable, and I enjoyed using the big desk-like table that was part of the room. It had nice access for plugging my laptop in, etc. It smelled like old BO, when I first went in, but that rapidly cleared up when I fired up the AC. I masked it myself with some popcorn. I like it when they have a microwave in the room. Tub had a big gouge in it, and the tub faucet dripped, but I didn't notice until the AM. Still, a very clean bathroom. I was overall pleased with the room/hotel. It was old, but they have tried hard. The other options in the immediate area didn't look that great on tripadvisor.

I was a little annoyed to find that there were no grassy areas for our dog to potty in, only mulch/dirt and rocks, but they claim to be a pet-friendly hotel, etc. The other thing I found very annoying was that they placed a $25/day pre-charge on our credit card. When I called and asked about it, I was told that they do this mostly on holiday weekends, etc. This should have been made very clear before booking, or at time of check in.

I could find nothing in the downtown or Seattle Center areas under $450 per night (apparently there was a very large convention in town and they had all the rooms booked). I was therefore left to look outside the downtown/Lake Union/Seattle Center core. Our usual places to stay when coming into Seattle overnight are Silver Cloud Stadium (pricey, but fun rooftop pool), Marqueen (love, love, love it here), Holiday Inn Express near Space Needle (cookie cutter hotel, but convenient), Silver Cloud Lake Union (great breakfast area - like a huge living room overlooking marina), Paramount (great to stay if taking in a show at Paramount Theatre and we love the Dragonfish Restaurant), Watertown by the university etc. I only mention these so you know what kind of places we customarily stay. Now for the Nexus.... hmmm... we upgraded to a \"suite\" for an additioinal $50, since there were 4 of us (2 adults, a teen and a tween). One room contained the living area and sparse kitchen, the other room contained 2 queen beds. Everything in the room seemed clean, but I was still leary of the couch and carpet. The beds were comfortable and the bath area was clean. There was 2 robes provided (didn't use them) and enough towels which were fluffy and clean. The place still has the \"motel\" feel to it even though they've tried to spiff it up a bit. Maybe the Nexus should do away with their shuttle and they would get better ratings...this is where things were both good, then a bit bad for us. You can reserve the shuttle up to 24 hours prior to your arrival and I was very impressed when a desk clerk called me on Thursday morning at my home to verify our Friday afternoon check in and shuttle reservations to go to Safeco Field for Friday's game. Great! Off to a good start. We checked in and verified our shuttle to the game. We were in lobby ahead of time and loaded up in the 11 passenger van (plus one seat for the driver) The driver was dismayed that there were reservations for 12 passengers and we, of course, couldn't all fit. ... so after a bit of time, we changed vans and headed onto I-5 stopped traffic (I completely understand that traffic is not the hotel's fault) but when we eventually got to the ballpark area, the driver seemed lost and made a series of rights and lefts - we could see the stadium , we just couldn't get there. He eventually dropped us in a parking lot about 3 or 4 blocks from the stadium - no problem, we walked... only now it is getting really close to game time, and we had hoped to be there an hour or so early. The biggest glitch with the shuttle is that we were (unknown to us) SUPPOSED TO SCHEDULE THE RIDE BACK TO THE HOTEL AS WELL. Well, the shuttle reservations for the ride back were full, so we ended up paying $30+ tip for cab from Safeco to Nexus. I suppose it is my fault for neglecting to confirm, but I assumed the shuttle service was ROUND TRIP.- so my tip is to reserve both legs of your shuttle at the time of reservation. Breakfast was drearily bad the next morning. We got to the breakfast room about 1/2 hour before it was due to close and they were out of many items. No eggs, bacon crumbs only in floating grease etc. But the worst part was how dirty the whole breakfast room was. We were told the hotel was completely full the night before - so maybe they just were unprepared for a full hotel eating breakfast... \"Free \" breakfasts can always be a bit \"hit and miss\" so we just took this with a grain of salt. Of note, the closest open place to get a drink once we got back to the hotel after the Mariner's game was The Ram - on the other side of the freeway (5-10 minute? walk), but the walk felt a little unsafe.... the bar and grill on the hotel property closes at 10pm.

This time we booked 3 rooms and brought both sets of grandparents and planned on staying 5 days and have some fun.

We had tickets to the Mariners game on Friday night and booked the shuttle 24 hours before the game as the hotel suggested. The shuttle left the hotel 20 minutes late and then the driver went straight on the freeway into rush hour traffic rather than go around through back streets. Thus we arrived right before the game started instead of an hour and a half early. We were booked on the return shuttle and were told to meet outside the amtrack station directly after the game (around 1030 pm) We arrived at the spot at 1015. At around 1045 2 vans from the hotel arrived. One of the vans had a rear facing car seat in it for our 4 month old. The driver didnt check the roster and allowed a large group of people that were not scheduled to board the van. The driver refused to ask the people to get of the van and allow us to board. Even though our party was on the list. The driver said another van was coming and left us! 1100pm with a 4 month old baby! We called the front desk and were told by someone who said it was his last night that another shuttle was not coming. That the driver had to drop everyone and come back to get us. Long story short, we didnt arrive back to the hotel until 1245. We were in a seedy part of town, where we had to deal with bums and prostitutes for over 2 hours with our parents in their 60's and our new baby. The kicker is the trip takes about 15 minutes with normal traffic. No excuse for them making us wait! Very disapointed! We will not return! Sidenote-we had no maid serivce our entire 5 days.

Also, the Nexus has a policy that only your bed gets made and towels changed if you stays less than seven days. No counters or toilet cleaned, nothing else.

The potential is here for a retro \"boutique\" style property; but at the moment it is far from retro, unless the definition of retro is tired and worn with slaps of 60's style colors. It resembles a motor inn and not a hotel style at all. The rooms are very basic: with a crowded sink/microwave/mini-fridge area, old style TV's, very spotty WiFi connections and the old fashioned heater/ac units under the window.The bathroom is small and when we checked into our room, towels and hand soaps were missing. I do have to give kudos to the staff for getting our missing amenities to the room very quickly. While we were there, a group of teens were there for a conference and over two nights, it was ridiculously noisy with running on the outdoor hallways late into the night and van alarms going off at 7am. My sister was a few doors down and was up til 3am listening to a ruckus on the floor above them; she finally went down to the front desk after repeated calls to the desk didn't address the problem. We did use the shuttle to get to Safeco Field and it was great getting there. Coming home, there seemed to be some confusion as to how many were going back, with not enough vans or seats available to porter us back. We stood around while the hotel staff tried to figure it out and finally after about 20 minutes all were accommodated. This shuttle confusion continued the next day when we tried to use the shuttle to get to Pike Place Market. I had put our name in at the front desk about an hour prior to the scheduled departure and when the time came, again the staff seemed confused as to where they would put the people in the couple vans that were going to various places. Had they kept us all updated of what they were trying to do instead of running in and out of the hotel lobby and looking confused, it would have been a lot less aggravating standing in the driveway awaiting some kind of direction. When they asked where we were going and what our room number was, the driver couldn't find it on his clipboard and this seemed to confuse them even more. We finally gave up after waiting 30 minutes and took a cab into Pike Place Market. They really need a more organized method for their shuttles so they could run more efficiently. We decided to cut our stay short by a day and checked out the third morning; the front desk staff did seem slightly apologetic but basically said that the noise they had with the teen group had cost them some business and remarked to me \"I guess we won't be seeing you at this hotel again.\" No, I don't think you will.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cLarge rooms,free shuttle service\u201d", "Author": "3bear", "ReviewID": "UR115828163", "Content": "We stayed here before and after a cruise.

This is an overpriced motel. I stayed here because I was in town for the Seattle to Portland bicycle ride, and the Nexus had advertised on the ride's website. They advertised a special rate, shuttle your bags to the start line, etc., etc. Fabulous! After making the initial reservation, any time we called to ask a question about the shuttle or whatever, nobody knew anything about it and told us to call back later. Finally we arrived. The lobby was nice and the staff was ok, but often was so difficult to get an answer to anything. Three of them standing there doing nothing, pretty annoying. The rooms are small and while some things seemed clean, the bedspreads looked old and shabby. The halls and elevators were small and hard to maneuver large luggage through. We got up the morning of the ride. Now, the hotel was full of cyclists and they couldn't bother to put the hot breakfast out a little earlier. They knew all the riders would be gone by the time they usually put it out. We were left with cereal, dry overboiled eggs and bagels. Half my bagel was dry, the other half was soggy. So gross. My friend wanted a photo of us so she asked someone who we think was another guest to take a photo. The man at the desk was apparently offended that she didn't ask him and made some comment. Fine, she handed him her camera. Then he didn't get off his lazy butt to take the photo. Seriously, he just turned his chair and took a crappy shot. WTH? Finally it came time for them to shuttle our bags to the start line. We dropped our bags in the lobby, and when we came back down with our bikes... the bags and shuttle were gone (they weren't supposed to drive us, just our bags). But now we had no idea where to meet the shuttle. We rode on to the start line and hoped for the best. We couldn't find the shuttle. My friend called the hotel. The man who answered was extremely rude (the same one who \"wanted\" to take our photo) and just kept telling her the driver was at the start line. \"He's at the start line.\" \"He's at the Start. Line.\" \"He. is. at. the. start. line.\" It was his only answer. Snottier each time. We tried to explain that there were 10,000 people there and we could not find him. Could he patch us through to the driver? No. Could he call the driver? No. Could he give us the number? No. What is your name? Click. He hung up on us. Several minutes later I called and asked for the manager. I was told she wasn't there. Again I politely tried to get him to help us. He spoke to me like I was the biggest moron in the world for wanting to find my bags. Again, I asked for his name and again he hung up. If you won't give someone your name, and your solution is to hang up on them, you know what you're doing is wrong. Finally, we located the driver. The driver, Dan?, (the only person with a clue at this whole hotel) informed us that he had just spoken to the man at the front desk and that they could have called him.

There's no breakfast room service; the complementary breakfast is served in a very small room that is reminiscent of a school lunchroom and was far skimpier than Laurie S. describes. Worst of all, the battery in my smoke detector failed at 3:00am.

The comforter had a stain on it in plain sight that looked like seman or some other bodily fluid. Now I always take off the bedspread immediately anyway because I know a lot of hotels do not wash these in between each guest but come on...if there's a stain in plain sight i think you should wash it. Also, I don't even think they wash the blue blanket on the bed because when I saw them cleaning other rooms they did not take away the old blankets and they did not have any clean blue blankets on their carts. The good news is they were changing the sheets at least. The bathroom had strands of hair on the shower walls and on the bathroom floor (wasn't my hair), and all around the ledge of the tile was built up dust. The toilet was also not thoroughly cleaned...the part where the toilet seat and cover is attached to the toilet had some kind of white crud caked on it. Also, the hair dryer had dirt or makeup smeared on the handle, so they obviously do not clean this in between guests either. So, overall I guess it just depends on what your definition of clean is, but this hotel was unacceptable to me. We had room 303 and our other family members had the room next door (to the right from the outside). We paid $100 per room for one night.

I am a big Seahawks fan and had a friend coming in from the UK that is a \u201cmassive\u201d NFL fan from afar. She had never been to an NFL game so my wife and I wanted to take my brother-in-law and her to Seattle for an experience. My wife and her brother are no football for sure but this experience had both of them wanting more. I had been sourcing tickets through e-bay and Craig\u2019s List but was looking at about $100 for any ticket no matter its location in the stadium. Adding hotel on top of that and we were getting to be very pricey. It was only in the eleventh hour that I Googled \u201cSeattle Seahawks game and hotel\u201d and came across a couple of options including this package offered by Nexus Hotel. The others were over priced and just out of my range. I called the Nexus and spoke with Sarah who was more than helpful and accommodating with my questions and requests. It was when she said that it would be \u201c$213 per couple\u201d that I asked how much was the hotel on top of that assuming that the $213 was for the Seahawks tickets. I was pleasantly shocked when Sarah stated \u201cthat includes a night in the hotel and transport to and from the game\u201d. Getting to Seattle and finding the Nexus was easy as pie using Google Maps. The Nexus is right off of the I-5 and can\u2019t be missed. With the Seahawks package we all received a collector\u2019s glass (nice touch) and a coupon for a free beverage at the Saphron restaurant next door. Now this is a motel set up with each room having a door to the outside world but it met expectations and passed them in terms of cleanliness and the \u201ccontinental breakfast\u201d. My wife checks for bed bugs wherever we go and this place was clean and had a recent remodel it looked like. We had two rooms for the four of and each of them had queen sized beds, a fridge and a microwave (those two were bonus items to us). Parking was ample and again\u2026 location, location, location! The next day was the Seahawks game and it was a bit confusing to find out when and where the bus left from as some of the staff had no idea but in hind sight the bus leaves at 10:30am and it goes from right out front of the hotel. On the bus is where we met our self-proclaimed \u201cparty hostess\u201d and she had the most-est! Randi-Sue was a big Seahawks fan and it showed, she was enthusiastic and excited and she got the bus going and ready for the game. The fact they also brought along some beers for all of us to enjoy on route the game was just another bonus that we hadn\u2019t expected. It was a short 20 minute ride to Qwest field but longer would have been ok too as the beer was cold and FREE! Randi-Sue took an interest in everyone\u2019s experience and when she learned that I had three NFL virgins with me she offered us her discount card at the merchandise shops that offered us 15% off of souvenirs. Thanks again Randi-Sue! My English friend and I made good use of it and spent a couple hundred dollars on jerseys, towels, scarves, a jersey for her dog and countless other souvenirs. The fan experience at Qwest Field is second to none and my voice was horse for days after yelling and having a wonderful time for four hours during the game. The Seahawks were horrible this game but the experience of an NFL game at Qwest Field made for some awesome memories and my wife and my brother-in-law are asking when we\u2019re going again already! We got back to the hotel after the game (thanks for waiting for us Randi-Sue while we shopped) and went to the Saphron for our free beers. We were expecting to have a full meal there as it was dinner time but when we walked in the owner and the staff were meeting and the owner looked at us like \u201chow could you come in the restaurant right now\u201d. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks and spoke with the bartender who was less than impressed with the owner. Most of the other staff were moping around like their dog had been shot so needless to say we had our drinks and left. We asked the staff at the Nexus where we should go next and they pointed us in the direction of the Ram Pub. Awesome place to have some great bar food, some cold drinks and the service and atmosphere was what we were looking for. Upon check out the Nexus could have some more staff (more than one) at the counter for 11:00am on a Monday but I finally got my receipts only to have a phone call hours later that I was under charged. As it turned out they had over charged my credit card but when I called Sarah to sort it out she again was more than helpful and had the charges reversed in an instant.

The rooms are sorta art-deco in an old fashioned sorta way. It's noisy and not very clean.

There are some good things and some not so good things about this hotel. I chose the hotel primarily for the location and for the fact that they provide a shuttle to the Childrens Hospital (as well as other area hospitals and attractions) where I was visiting. The good things about the location are the proximity to the freeway, and the Northgate mall. Also there is a very good restaurant next door. The bad things about the location are the proximity to the freeway (noisy) and the fact that the hotel is located on a busy road that connects to the freeway. The best thing about the hotel itself was the housekeeping staff. The room was very clean, the housekeepers were friendly and I never woke up to the sound of housekeeping calling to each other or vacuuming next door like I have had in some hotels. In fact, the housekeeping staff were the friendliest people at the hotel. The front desk staff, one in particular, were cold and not so efficient (almost as if they just didnt care) and unfriendly to the point of being rude. I noticed this with all the guests, not just myself. The other not so good things about the hotel was the look from the outside - very like a budget motel, with the rooms on several levels with their entry doors along a corridor on the outside facing the street (which is not always secure) and the outside just had a shabby tired look. One of the most frustrating incidents involved the internet access. The hotel boasts high speed internet in all the rooms. I was able to get online on Thursday but not at all on Friday or Saturday - it seems the hotel was full and the internet was busy and the signal was very weak. It was very frustrating as I was not able to be online again until Sunday morning. The hotel was very noisy, you could hear the guests in all the surrounding rooms, and while this is not the fault of the hotel, I had an upstairs neighbor who paced his floor (my ceiling) ALL NIGHT LONG for both Thursday and Friday night.

The bedspreads looked very shabby and when you actually see the covers underneath they has several holes!!- The pillows were a joke- the 1st morning we went out and came back at 2pm- the room hadn't been cleaned- okay- so when they did come in she changed the sheets, not pillowcases, no did she even wipe down the bathroom or sink- Oh yes, when you used the sink it filled up- maybe drano would work- no closet just an area near the bathroom- and yes a plus with microwave and fridge but the area was so tiny, the fride also leaked all over the floor (a nice puddle to step into.) We didn't get a chance to go for the breakfast, so can't comment on that. It is a a very busy street. You can't open the drapes to see light as everyone can see in- The rooms were quite dark-poorly lit. Would not stay there again-", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chilliwack, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGood value, good location\u201d", "Author": "exiled-scot", "ReviewID": "UR5780995", "Content": "We last stayed there at the end of August for a couple of nights, as we had stayed there previously.

The first morning of our stay water started pouring through the light fixture in the bathroom. We called the front desk who suggested that we take a key for a dirty room and use the shower there. I was told that they did not want to give us a key to a room with a clean shower because they would have to re-clean the room. When they finally agreed to allow us to use a clean shower they told us that they did not know when they would be able to fix our room. We were considering checking out when the manager told us that if we stayed the next night that we had reserved she would make sure that we would be taken care of. Although the room was cleaned when we returned, taking care of us was a $10 discount on the room which frankly was less than we tipped the maid. The front desk staff was disinterested and somewhat rude, parking was difficult to find and although they said that the hotell was newly remodeled it still looked like a run of the mill Ramada Inn. It's near a hospital and you will hear sirens all night long. Good luck if you stay here.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cNew Name-Nexus, Old Hotel Look\u201d", "Author": "kennygH0n0lulu", "ReviewID": "UR5405848", "Content": "We're out of State visitors to the Seattle region visiting our daughter and stayed at the Ramada Inn @ Northgate for 3 nights which were 3 nights too much. There were a few some pro points about the hotel-near the Northgate Mall and highway on-ramp entrances, free parking and continental breakfasts but the cons over-ruled the pro points. Cons- Check in was messed up with a confirmed reservation for a two double bed room, but front desk told us that they had us for a room with single queen size bed. No bell man to take our baggage to our room. The lobby's single elevator is too small to transport 4 adults with baggages. Room number configuration is confusing-odd number & even number rooms on either side of the building. Strange hotel design-coming out of the elevator where all room doors are exposed to the outside part of the building. Hate to check in this hotel when the temperture is in the 20's-30's. Tiny cramp rooms and out-date furniture- lamp with blue poka dots shade & green plastic swivel chair. Room's only window is fronting tthe corridor preventing privacy. Air conditioning is NOT central air. It's a stand alone a/c unit that is built in the exterior wall under the window. Our a/c unit's control was broken and could only work when the gauge is at the coldest settings. Instead of freezing, we turn the a/c off and slept in a musty but warmer room. The blankets were thin and the bed sheets were stiff, regardless of their claim of upgrading their beds with new Serta beds, our sleep were not restful. The bathroom faucet couldn't give us any warm water when we turned the handle to the middle, it was hot, hot water. The shower head was loose so on our first shower, water sprayed all over the bathroom floor. The name has changed from the Ramada Inn at Northgate to the Nexus, but it's still an out-dated and a budget class hotel that we definitely won't come back to. For a few bucks more, I'd rather stay at a Marriott and enjoy their superior rooms ,service and ameneties.
