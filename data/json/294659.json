We really enjoyed staying there. The location is perfect -- just steps away from the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. It's about a 15 minute walk to the Grand Bazaar and about 20 minutes to the Spice Market. It's also about 5 minutes from a stop on the tram, which is useful for seeing other parts of the city. Our room was very nice, with a drop-dead view of the Hagia Sophia. (We were on the 4th floor, which should have the best views.) The bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom was nicely outfitted. One complaint, though: the jacuzzi tub/shower had tall sides that made it difficult (or even dangerous) getting in and out of the shower. I would not recommend room 402 to the aged or infirm for this reason. It's too bad, since the room is otherwise very nice. The restaurant and the roof-top deck have spectacular views -- supposedly the best in Sultanahmet. There is a buffet breakfast each morning in the restaurant. In good weather, you can sit outside. The views inside and out are great. The breakfast is nice (but not world class) -- fruit, dried fruit, yoghurt, cheese, cold cuts, cereal, American coffee, tea, etc. They will also offer you eggs each morning. What makes the hotel special, though, is the staff. Every one of them, in both the hotel and restaurant, goes out of his or her way to make you feel welcome and to take care of your needs. At every turn, the staff tried to make our stay in and out of the hotel as enjoyable as possible. They were happy to make all the arrangements we needed (tours, restaurant reservations, etc.) and to recommend places to see and eat. This was our first visit to Turkey and we loved it. We will definitely return some day and when we do we will return to Seven Hills Hotel.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ramon", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "CJPSanRamon", "ReviewID": "UR128175105", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Seven Hills hotel in Istanbul just this past February, a mere 2 months ago.

Sechkin, Ozan and the entire staff are great folks with sound recommendations of where to go, what to do, everything, Istanbul is their town you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do well to ask them questions and to listen to them.

We spent a great 5 nights there with only one night where we had above average noise from restaurant traffic and a partier. The Seven Hills restaurant is second to none and we tried plenty, we should have eaten there more. And now the view... from both the restaurant and the upstairs roof. Incredible!

Location is only one aspect of why I'd recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff are simply amazing!! Reception, bell-boys, restaurant staff at breakfast and dinner go well beyond the call of duty to make you feel welcome and to make your stay as wonderful as humanly possible. Ozan at reception deserves special recognition - as would everyone else if I wrote down their names. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable, and despite other reviews, we found the evenings and nights quiet and peaceful. Breakfast was terrific with the best view in the entire city up on the roof. And the restaurant makes any trip to Istanbul complete with stunning views over the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and the Bosphorus at dusk. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite on our final night, a room complete with a dual-aspect balcony.

The location is really the main reason to stay here. The Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque are literally in the backyard, and lots of great bars/restaurants are nearby. The hotel features a great rooftop for views of the city, but the restaurant is so-so. The breakfast was horrible....they kept bringing the same food (literally, the exact food) from each day before (it was majorly off-season, to be fair), and you could tell from the cheese discoloration and the gradual decay of the strawberries. Highly gross and insulting, as the price of the room is definitely higher than what it should be. The rooms were ok, and the heating was good. However, because the hotel is famous for its views, tons of tour groups come to the hotel for dinner upstairs late into the night. And with the elevator being tiny, most tour members stomp down the stairs noisily after dinner. With floors being marble and wood, don't count on getting sleep till well after 12:30.

For the first choice, try to find an hotel in Taksim district, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but don't expect to sleep before 3:00 AM\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.so\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.we choose the second option and select Sultanahmet district, very closed to numerous historical sites (Hagia Sophia Museum, Basilica Cistern, the blue mosque, Topkapi Palace\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc). We end up in the Seven Hills Hotel with the help of TripAdvisor and it turned out to be an excellent choice. It is located just nearby Hagia Sophia Museum and the blue mosque. We stayed for 3 nights and all people we met in the hotel were extremely nice to us. We booked for a Superior double room for 185 Euros per night. At arrival, I noticed that room prices at hotel desk were higher (230 euros if I remember correctly) but on top of it, when we arrived at the hotel, we were offered a suite for the two first nights (\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we were \"a romantic couple\"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6was the reason we were given\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6?!?). In the end we were also offered the third night and all that without asking anything. I don't think this can happens to everyone but at least, it tells they really did their best for us. Receptionists were all very nice and took the time to teach us the minimal Turkish language we wanted (completely useless as everyone speaks good English, but we had a lot of fun trying our best speaking Turkish).Our airlines lost one of our suitcases, receptionists organised phone calls and delivery to the hotel on their own. The room (actually the suite\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) was very nice (a surprising \"ottoman style\" may be, but charming), clean and quiet at night (although above the street, it is a quiet street). We had a small Jacuzzi as a bathtub \u00e2\u02dc\u00ba\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and that was nice too. We had a short look in the Superior double room: it was of course smaller but would have been really OK as well ('didn't look how the bathroom was). Well, all that to say that I can only recommend that hotel. The hotel also has a roof terrace with one of the very best view on the see, Hagia Sophia and the blue mosque (slightly higher than surrounding roof terraces from other hotels). We didn't have lunch or diner at the restaurant of the hotel, but breakfast were very nice (large fruit choice, cheeses, sausages, honey\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc).

We discovered it when a friend who worked at the British Consulate in Istanbul, recommended it. The location in the Sultanahmet (Old Istanbul) area is ideal for many main tourist sites (inc. Topkapi, The Bazaar), and it is surrounded by many excellent restaurants - including the Seven Hills own rooftop restaurant (where you also have breakfast), with spectacular views of the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Camii) on one side and Ayasofya (Hagia Sophia) on the other, against the backdrop of the Sea of Marmara. Both rooms I've been in were well furnished, and were larger than I'd expected, with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. The free wi-fi was a bonus, when so many hotels charge exorbitant rates for this. Breakfast is a large self-service buffet, with a variety of foods available. The staff in the hotel are very welcoming, and go out of their way to make your stay memorable - nothing is too much trouble for them. The only downsides worth noting are the small lift (max 4 persons?), and, as with most hotels in Turkey, the proximity to the mosque does ensure you get an early morning call from the muezzin whether you want one or not!

The location could not be better- across the street from the Four Seasons, steps away from the major tourist attractions. Restaurants, shops and cafes all around within easy walking distance. The staff is incredibly helpful, and the rooms are very nice. The doorman took us shopping last night and showed us the best places to eat, told us what a fair price was for various items and helped us to negotiate with vendors. The restaurant in this hotel is amazing (reviewed under restaurants). We simply could not be more satisfied with a hotel at any price, but it sure helps to feel that we're getting a good deal, which I know that we are! We are traveling with two small children, and were upgraded to an available Presidential Suite at no extra charge! Of course, I wouldn't expect that they could do that for everyone, and it certainly helps that we're in low season and there are plenty of vacant rooms in town, but we didn't even ask for the upgrade, it was their idea! In short, if you like the personal service of a smaller, boutique hotel a one to two minute walk to the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia, want true international four star quality and fantastic service, you can't go wrong with the Seven Hills Hotel.

I'll start with the positives. The hotel is in a fantastic location, and the staff members are friendly. Unfortunately, this wouldn't be enough for us to return to this hotel. We reserved the Blue Mosque double for two nights. At 11:30 PM that night, they called our room to inform us that there would be construction in it in the early morning, so we would have to relocate rooms immediately. They moved us to the suite (which sounds like it would be good); however, this room had no view of either the Blue Mosque or Hagia Sophia (the main reason we chose this hotel). When we were relocated to our original room the next night, we couldn't sleep at all. We were on the 4th floor, and the restaurant is on the 5th floor. Literally, all night long, we could hear what was going on above us--even long after the restaurant closed, we could still hear workers cleaning up. We heard every chair that was dragged along the floor. We could also smell everything from the kitchen. Our room had a fishy odor for several hours, followed by an intense smoky/charred odor in the middle of the night. This odor was so intense that it woke me up, and I had to open the window to air it out. I also noticed that the photos on their website do not match up with what is seen in person. Even the photo of the outside is inaccurate (it shows the 3rd floor and the restaurant, but not the 4th floor!). The photo of our room was inaccurate as well. The furniture is different and has been rearranged so that the bed does not face the Blue Mosque. There was not even a nightstand next to the bed.

My room was clean and cozy, with a comfortable king-size bed, good linens, a spacious bathroom and a water view. The windows open in the rooms so you can enjoy fresh air throughout the night. Also, the room had a mini fridge, so you can have cool beverages and a snack in your suite. I saw a couple of other rooms at the hotel, and both were quite large, with lovely water or city views. The Seven Hills Hotel is located in the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul, steps away from the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia; the location cannot be beat, and the hotel has an absolutely stunning view of these two sites from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roof-top restaurant. The view is better than that at the Four Seasons across the street. For a first time visit to Istanbul, all the main tourist sites are within short walking distance, including the Topkapi Palace, the Cistern, the Hippodrome, the mosaic museum, and so much more. An easy walk along Divan Youlu (approximately 20 minutes, longer if you shop along the way) will lead you to the Grand Bazaar. Just exploring the Sultanahmet neighbourhood is a treat too. As for the common complaint about carpet salesmen (or impromptu tour guides, or both) bothering tourists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, particularly in Sultanahmet Park, which is between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. A firm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should suffice, and just keep moving. I did consider advice to stay in the Taksim Square area to avoid this problem, but am glad I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. In addition to the fantastic stay I had at the Seven Hills Hotel itself, I liked the convenience of being right where the major attractions are found, and frankly, if you have to travel to the area, then you are going to encounter these salesmen regardless of your hotel location. In fact, after a couple of days exploring the area, most of the salesmen recognize you and either leave you alone, or better yet, they strike-up casual conversation that no longer feels pressured! The staff at the Seven Hills Hotel is great. Seckin, Bulent, and their team offer warm and relaxed hospitality; they make you feel like you are staying with friends. I have not experienced such genuine hospitality in all my years of international travel. Do check with them for tips on the best places to pick-up certain Turkish specialties \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my friends still rave about the Turkish delight that I brought home from my trip\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I would not have found the particular shop without assistance from Seckin! Also, the hotel can arrange car service to/from the airport, and bill the charge to your room tab.

It's central location, friendly staff and more than adequately kept rooms make it an ideal choice when travelling to Istanbul.

It was a spacious suite, with a comfortable king size bed, a jacuzzi just near the sleeping area, a beautiful glass shower and a desk area. The room had pretty big windows, and a balcony covered with a grapevine, overlooking the small street - just charming. Overall, this room was a 5 stars quality. The breakfast was served at the rooftop seven hills restaurant, which has fantastic views like everyone here mentioned. The buffet has good selection and service is efficiant and friendly. The location, as mentioned in all reviews, is perfect. Just a minute walk to the main attractions of Istanbul and many cute restaurants around. Even a taxi to Taxim, if you want to change the atmosphere a bit, is just 10 minutes. The only problem we had is that being in the annex, you dont have reception services like in the main seven hills hotel. Also when we arrived, the receptionist of the seven hills hotel didnt have our reservation, but after we showed him our email correspondance with his boss, everything was resolved, To sum it up - I actually recommend the annex part even more, since it has beautifuly designed delux rooms.

For instance, the main goal of our trip to Istanbul was to see the cello concert of Julian Lloyd Webber, which took place on 28.02.2009. We had very little experience with Turkey and Istanbul and so the concierge arranged our transport to the concert hall and back, he gave us all the warnings of what to do and what to avoid with Istanbul taxis and his concern about our well-being was genuine and very touching. Our room was gorgeous with splendid view of the huge Saint Sofia church. The room was perfectly clean, decorated with taste and quite spacious. The wireless Net worked fine. The location of the hotel is fantastic, it is right in the most interesting part of Istanbul between Saint Sophia and the Blue Mosque (see the photos attached). The hotel's restaurant is on the top of the building and that happens to be the highest spot in the vicinity, so if you go to the terrace on top of the restaurant you have a 360-degree view! This is not to be missed! -- just by turning your head around, you can rest your eyes on the Marmara see or the Prince Islands or the Asian bank of the Bosphorus or Sain Sophia or the Blue Mosque. Of course, in February it is a bit cold to have a dinner outside but I can't wait to go there in the summer! What my wife and myself liked most is first of all, the great service of this hotel - very gentle, very helpful, with genuine concern for the guests' well-being. Then we liked the hotel itself, it is tasteful, cozy and perfectly clean and quiet. Then we liked the food - the restaurant on the top I mentioned prepares the best food in Istanbul, as far as we can tell from a four-day visit. We tried several other restaurants just for the diversity but they were not as good. The friendliness of the personnel is noticeable in the restaurant, too: my wife made several requests for food items and beverages that were not in the menu but could easily be prepared (like lemonade made according to her taste) and they were fulfilled perfectly.

Although it was not considered by the travel companies to be a 5-star hotel, we were treated with 5-star service. Bulent Sayan, the Manager, made sure that everything was taken care of in advance. When we entered the hotel, it was bright and sunny, with dark wood and Turkish art, it was absolutely charming. The young man, Jabriel, who was manning the reception desk was busy with another client, but he took the time to look up at us and smile. (What a huge difference from other experiences we have had in past travels around Europe.) As soon as we mentioned our name to him he told us that Bulent had mentioned us, and the next thing we knew there was a man standing by the elevator with our luggage waiting to help us. We were shown to our room which was beautifully decorated in traditional Turkish style, it was very clean and comfortable, with a deep European style bathtub, and lots of hot water. I loved that there was more than adequate storage for our things, and the fact that we were also able to open our windows to see the locals, smell the local cuisine (divine), and hear all the wonderful sounds of Istanbul, made the beginning of our trip exciting. But there is more to come...on the roof top is an amazing restaurant. They serve the freshest fish I believe I have ever eaten, and there is a large variety of dishes on the menu to choose from, so it makes it difficult. We had reservations about six in the evening just as the sun was going down, and it didn't dawn on me until we were up there how fortunate we were to be in this specific hotel. The location of the Seven Hills is directly in-between the Blue Mosque, and the Haija Sophia, two of the most amazing archetectural structures in the world!!. What ambience!! Can you imagine....on the roof with your sweetie, sun going down, stars twinkling, traditional Turkish music playing, the freshest food, the best service...wow, it doesn't get any better. Between the service, the food and the view I have never had better memories. The few days that we were there Bulent and his staff treated us like family. They took care of us in a way that I have never experienced in any of my travels, and it is the only place I have ever been where I was sorry that I had to leave. I am certain that it was because of the wonderful treatment that we received by Bulent, Jabriel, and the rest of the staff at the Seven Hills hotel.

This was a trip we had originally started to plan over two years ago so we could be on the Turkish Mediterranean coast for the March 2006 total solar eciplse. Unfortunately my elderly mother got sick and ultimately died just 2 weeks before our scheduled departure, so we had to cancel everything. I was determined to reschedule this year--all but the eclipse. So our tour really got off to a wonderful start when we finally arrived at our hotel in Istanbul. I had been communicating with the manager, Bulent, for almost two years, about this trip, and he had really gone way beyond the expected in promptly responding to emails, graciously accepting the last-minute cancellation, and then helping me find an excellent Istanbul travel agent. I felt terrible when I cancelled the first trip, so was delighted to finally be there and meet Bulent. The hotel itself could not be in a better location in the old part of Istanbul, Sultanahmet. The hotel is a beautiful wooden structure of the old Istanbul style, several stories high, with a restaurant on the roof that has an incredible 360-degree view of the Bosphorus, the Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia, and Topkapi Palace, and all of Istanbul. This is where the breakfast is served, and it was breathtaking to see the early morning sun illuminating everything. The hotel is simple but elegant and uses a lot of nice antiques. Nothing overly ornate, but the entire ambience was one of gracious Turkish hospitality. My husband and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone seeking to stay in this section of istanbul and doesn't want to spend a fortune.

It offered a variety of bread, fruit, cheese, eggs, yogurt, cereal, olives, vegetables, etc and all kinds of juices, milk, water, tea, coffee etc. The gentleman serving breakfast even made an omelet if you requested. The view from the restaurant terrace was fabulous, probably the best in Istanbul. The location was just perfect, within 10 minute walking distance to major tourist attractions such as Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Topaki Palace, etc. And a taxi stand was just around the corner if you needed to catch a taxi.

Bullent went out of his way to recommend and arrange a belly dance dinner show that was fun, and recommended other nice restaurants that I really enjoyed.

We were supposed to go to Bodrum for 3 of those days but canceled when we realized how much there was to see in Istanbul. Bulent, the manager, was very cooperative in finding us space for the three extra days, but there was some mis-communication and our last day, which was a separate reservation, was given away. With the language barrier it is always important to verify things and I neglected to do that. The hotel is in the perfect location as everyone else has mentioned. We only used a taxi twice in 6 days and walked the rest of the time. Bulent and his team were very good at arranging restaurants that provided free transportation. Although I am not into hokey tourist productions, the Orient Cafe that Bulent hooked us up with was great. We stayed in one of the suites-the Presidential and it was very spacious and relatively inexpensive (220E per night). My friend stayed in the Marmara Suite (402) and said it was very noisy. The rooftop restaurant was great for cocktails and winding down at the end of the day. The staff was some of the most friendly I have encountered on my travels. Breakfast is on the terrace, and from a US or European standpoint is not what we are used to. But, they are willing to make some eggs, and it makes for an OK start to the day.

The Seven Hills Hotel (SHH) delivers BIG on both accounts. It has the highest rooftop terrace restaurant on the Bosphorous side of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia and a truly unobstructed, proximal view to both behemoths. The view from SSH's rooftop terrace of these two architectural wonders is truly breathtaking and its possible to sit for hours wiling away the time, being mesmerized by the sights of this man-made beauty as well as the natural beauty of the Bosphorous - of which SHH also has the best view in the vicinity. The Gelata Tower, across the Golden Horn and approximately two miles from the SHH, is also visible from the terrace. Service on the terrace and in the restaurant just below the terrace (which offers seasonal outdoor seating with views to the Bosphorous) is excellent - the waiters are friendly, helpful and seem sincerely intent on ensuring a positive experience for their guests. The restaurant excells in its offerings of traditional Turkish appetizers, fresh fish and Turkish wines. While not cheap, the restaurnt (like the hotel in general) offers good value. For warm-blooded guests, the waiters graciously offer shawls to ward off the evening's chills while enjoying the sights and the restaurant's offerings. PROXIMITY: Per above, SHH is ideally situated in Istanbul's old city and numerous major sights are within an easy walk. The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi palace are no more than 250 meters from the hotel. The Grand Bazaar is no more than a kilometer away; the Roman Cistern (the famous and architecturally exquisite underground water reservoir) and the Hippodrome are approximately 300 meters away and the famous Cegalogu Turkish/Roman bath approximately 600 meters distant. For jaunts to the Spice Market or across the Golden Horn, the hyper-modern streetcar stops 250 meters from the hotel. INTERNET: One of the greatest pluses is the superb wireless internet network in the hotel; to compensate for the thick concrete and stone walls, each floor has a separate high-speed router/network. Additionally, the hotel generously makes a computer available in the rooftop terrace area (with a Turkish-language keyboard, ensuring message recipients have to carefully read your cryptic transmissions from Istanbul!) to hotel guests traveling without laptops. The hotel is not a luxury or boutique accommodation, but delivers all advertised services and many other amenities. Built in an old Ottoman residence, it has many interesting interior architectural touches including elaborate ceiling and crown mouldings. The furniture and rugs are all Ottoman style antiques. The front desk staff impressed and surprised me with the detail, friendliness and sincerity of their email correspondence prior to my arrival. The breakfast buffet was more than ample - offering a variety of meats, cheeses, fruits, breads, vegetables and cereals. Rooms are equipped with reasonably-priced minibars. A common expression in Turkey, \"No problem\" really could be the official slogan of SHH. HAWKERS: The hotel sits in the middle of what must be the world's largest concentration of highly talented hawkers. Your best defense is to completely ignore these predators - who will pose as tourist information assistants in the major sights. After offering a few tidbits of information, incredibly, they will invite you to their carpet, ceramics or trinket stores where the hard sell begins. The hawkers are linguistically gifted and will impress even the most hardened foreigner with their ability to play on a tourist's guilt when ignored. I would caution travelers only to carefully watch extras charged to your hotel account - on checkout we were surprised to find the actual charge for city tours to have doubled over the quoted price, a laundry charge to have come out being three times the estimate and a restaurant dinner charge from a previous room occupant on our bill. We chose not to contest the tours and laundry as they could well have been a misunderstanding, but did refuse to pay the previous guest's dinner bill. We will definitely be staying at the Seven Hills for our next trip to Istanbul; from our perspective, there's no reason to look further.

Highlights: The location could not be better--about a 2 minute walk to the Blue Mosque in Sultanahmet. The rooms were gorgeous--easily equivalent to a 4-5 star hotel (they're small enough that they can't be rated with stars). In my opinion, the rooftop restaurant has the best view in Sultanahmet--you can clearly see the Blue Mosque, the Haghia Sofia, and a gorgeous view of the waterways of Istanbul. It was sunny and warm during our visit, which always helps :) But mostly, it was the staff that made our time there special. Our uncle insisted that we go there because he felt so much like he was treated like one of the family. We were treated very cordially every time we saw a staff member. Bl\u00c3\u00bcent, the manager, and Sema, the day shift leader, were very friendly and helpful--we cannot say enough good things about them. At one point, a staff member helped us carry our bags across town, and when we needed a ride to the hotel, we were transported in a luxurious van--much better than the treatment you get in the USA! This hotel also owned another property a few blocks away that had just opened. They said we were the new hotel's 6th customer! We stayed there for an evening in a huge room with a king sized bed, a jacuzzi tub, marble countertop in the bath, and the most amazing elevator I'd seen in years. Since we were newer customers and did some business with their travel agency partner (read below), we got a good deal--about half the hotel's \"rack rate\" for that stay. The hotel also partnered with a travel agency nearby, Kommegene Travel, who booked tour packages for 9 out of our 16 days in Turkey. Overall, they did a great job, choosing great options that matched the experiences we sought and were very responsive to our needs. Actually, they knew we were on honeymoon, so they had wine waiting for us on two different occasions. It was very sweet. Concerns Of course, no trip goes perfectly. All over Turkey, we had trouble figuring out the remote controls for the A/C units, which seem more advanced than those in the USA. In the room in the new hotel, there was a slow leak in the A/C unit that dripped into the room. They explained that it was so new that it was the first time the A/C had been used after install, so we were happy to accept their promise to have it looked at the following day. Our other caution didn't involve the hotels at all, but the tours we booked and went on. Part of it was that Turkey was completely new to us and we weren't sure what to expect, but we found ourselves wishing that we were better informed about some parts of our tours. For example, when they say \"free meal\", that means free food, but you pay for drinks, even water. In a warm/hot climate like Turkey, you have to drink all of the time, so we were constantly buying 5L jugs of water from local markets for 1.5 YTL rather than paying 2-3 YTL per 1/2 liter bottle during a meal. Also, they say the night buses stop for periodic bathroom breaks, but sometimes those breaks didn't happen, or happened once in the course of a 9 hour trip! Don't be afraid to ask the travel agent specifics about your tour(s), and to get their phone numbers when you have questions or problems. Overall, this hotel far exceeded our expectations, even after we left. When they heard that I had left an important item in a remote part of Turkey, they arranged have the item transported to the hotel and sent it to me in the USA. Now that's service!

They can be a bit noisy due to their proximity to the popular, stunnning roof deck. A last note- my sister stayed across the street at the Four Seasons.

We liked it very much, would recommend it to others. As others state, the location is superb and the rooftop restaurant view (wow !) is probably the best of any hotel in the city. We found Bulent to be an excellent manger and the other staff members to be very helpful. The manager of the breakfast buffet got up early to make us omelets to go with the buffet as we had an early morning flight and had to leave prior to the normal opening for breakfast. We were upgraded to the Blue Mosque room on the 4th floor. While you could hear chairs move above you in the restaurant, it did not wake us up in the morning nor prevent us from sleeping (as stated in another review). The view from the room has got to be the best in Istanbul with the Blue Mosque so close. We had breakfast and early evening drinks on the rooftop restaurant. Drinks are not cheap, but you can have one drink and admire the views for as long as you want. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but ate at a great place 20 yards from the hotel on the same side of the street-( walk out of hotel and make a right; only restaurant there). Recommended by the hotel, it was superb and reasonably priced. No need to take hotel's car service from airport--take taxi both ways as it is half the price. Hotel gives 10% off if payment is in cash---that includes anything you bill to your room (e.g. drinks, tours,) during the stay---nice discount-- We took the two half-day tours in one day. While Bulent told us the various bus tour options, he never pushed the tours on us. It was our decision based on having only two days in the city. The afternoon tour to Topaki Palace, et. al. was definitely not worth the money (do it on your own)---Morning tour to Mosques and Bazaar was better, but still expensive (30 euros) ---last hour was \"talk\" from carpet experts and bazaar and you could do that on your own--they do give a free lunch (very good) if you take both 1/2 day yours same day----I read in travel guide (Frommer) that hotel is associated with next door carpet store, and that they will solicit you as you enter and leave hotel---We never encountered that , we were never even approached to come in to the carpet store-- For the location, view, service, price, Seven Hills is a great place to stay for a few days in Istanbul.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northwood, Middlesex, UK", "Title": "\u201cThe best ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5327960", "Content": "I stayed at 2 hotels at Istanbul in May 2006.
