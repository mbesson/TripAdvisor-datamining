For a motel that offers an airport shuttle (or do they?), they should have a public access computer to print boarding passes in my opinion. (A question I forgot to ask when booking.)

I didn't know if I would be warm enough under the sheet and blanket and I didn't want to use the bedspread unless absolutely necessary. I wasn't confident it was totally clean. The pillows were too big for the pillowcases they were stuffed into. One was too thick for me to rest my head onto comfortably, and both were very lumpy. The mattress was uncomfortably hard. I wasn't sure I would be able to sleep on it, never mind the planes frequently flying not far overhead and the trollies honking by.
