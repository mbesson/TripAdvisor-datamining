As per title! - received surprise when we went to check in..! - in the one building and next door was where we stayed! VERY Basic Hotel - not good value for money. One good point is that is is very close to the Van Gough Museum which is definitely worth a visit as is the Anne Frank Museum (not near hotel - but that is ok!) Even though it is very near the Van Gough Museum so are many other Hotels so you do not need to choose it for this reason. They have marketed this hotel (pictures on Internet) extremely well - its looks fine from the pictures but there is definitely a very different and far more budget feel when you get into the place! We only booked a week before we went so our choice of accomodation was limited but I still did not think from the Internet that this looked as budget as it was and it was not a budget price that we paid. It was not the worse place in the world but certainly Extremely Basic and if you enjoy or like to mooch around a 'Hotel' space - then this is Definitely not the place for you and if you do not like climing tenament stairs either consider this! We had toured around Belgium before getting here and there was not a croissant in site for Breakfast not even a roll for that matter - plain bread and a toaster was where it was at - some cheese, ham, basic cereals and concentrated juice - so just bare in mind! Still enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam :) - after all the accomodation should not make the holiday but a nice base is always an added bonus!", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR212457137", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SusannePegg"}, {"Content": "absolute disaster booked this hotel over internet read several reviews and decided that overall it was not to bad. that was a laugh,we booked a standard double cost 448 euros for four nights.got there at 1800 hrs and rang reception door.the hotel is situated on the most expensive street in amsterdam with many designer shops on it, thought it was going to be ok. wrong, wrong, wrong.the reception staff were nice enough gave us the key and showed us the rooom in the next building, the rooms were in one building the reception and breakfast room another. we walked into the room and looked around. we were to stunned to speak to each other, the bathroom, rather shower room was filthy with mould all over the walls shower curtain and door frames. the carpet in the room looked as if it had not been cleaned in serveral decades and the furniture was from the 1960's. there was a mini bar fridge with nothing in it execpt mould.my partner was furious and we were hardly speaking to each other. i went to reception and stated it was not possible for us to stay in such a filthy place and asked for another room stating this was not the one seen on the photos. they said that they had a double delux room which they used for the photos would we like that our reply was yes until we were informed that it would be an extra 60 euros per night, after some negotiation we got it for an extra 7.50 euro a night. the delux double was slightly better, the shower room slightly cleaner, but on closer inspection you could still see traces of mould again the mini fridge had mould inside and when we lifted the sheet to look at the mattress we were almost sick, it was full of stains and looked like it had come from a skip. also we noted there to be blood stains down the bed side cabinet and wall. we simply could not stay there we left the room and walked and could not look at each other or we would both have cryed. my partner decided that we would go back and get the next flight home.on our way back we spotted another hoel over the road a delux boutique hotel and were fourtunate enough that they had a room for three nights. we immediatley went bacvk to the bellington demanded our money back, which they gave without any problems minus the cost of one night,they were obviously used to giving poeple there money back, and promtly departed.all we can say is nerver never stay in the bellington it was not fit to put animals in let alone humans. we complained to the dutch tourist board and said they really needed to review how the star rating is given, to give the bellington a 2 star rating you would need to be high on something or given a very big bribe. please do not stay here, if you do on your own head be it.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR892719763", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "simo171960"}, {"Content": "NIce hotel with friendly staff The rooms are basic but this hotel has a very friendly staff(!)

I stayed at this hotel due to the good reviews that were deposited on this website but when we arrived our worst nightmares struck!The shower absolutely stunk of urine! there was mold in the shower! mold on the shower curtain! the toilet was old and unclean, the shower area needed ripping out and a new one installing.The bedroom was awful, tv was just about working, curtains were over 100years old, carpet was really old and dirty, I was bitten in teh night several times. The en-suite washbasin which is bascially in room is really old and looks bad.The whole room is basically the worst thing I have ever seen! I can live with budget rooms! but this was not budget! I wouldnt let an animal live in these conditions!We did complain to recpetion but we got the usual recpetion of 'sorry all rooms are full but you can have a standard single room' No thanks! if this is bad imagine what the budget room is like!We did try to get an other room in town but because it was good friday weekend everywhere was full!I would also like to say if you are english and you like you fry-ups! dont there breakfast is crap! just ham and eggs!I would think twice mayble 10 times before going here!

Good value for money. Excellent tram service for getting to the centre. Good quiet location. We didn't have breakfast as are not early morning people, instead we ate at the Van Gough cafe at the end of the road which was very pleasant.The room was a good size and if you wanted to watch TV there were a good few English channels to choose from. A couple of previous reviews mention mold. There was a some mildew in the shower but not enough to smell at all. You get what you pay for at the end of the day. The room was old fashioned but clean and there were clean towels and bedsheets.The only problem we had was that the heating didn't work which we complained about.

The location of the hotel is excellent the sightseeings are al nearby we didn't have to take a taxi or public transport to go to there. Even the leidseplein was 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel with the nightlife and restaurants so we didn't had to worry if we got hungry.

I have stayed at this hotel three times on my numeorus visits to Amsterdam and have always left wanting to come back.
