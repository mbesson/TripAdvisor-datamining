First impressions were not good - the entrance to this small hotel was terrible- plaster and dust everywhere with a dirty abandoned chair. in the corner. the wrought iron gate was open displaying a junk yard filled with rubble and black rubbish bags. The stairs leading up to the first floor hotel revelaed dangerous looking open wall sockets with electrical cables sprawling out. If the hotel was under going building work then I feel there should have been a notice explaining this and apologising to the guests . IHowever, once upstairs our room was clean and very tastlefully decorated (if a little small and dark). The room had an overpowering smell of drains/stale water which was a shame bewacuse the bathroom was very nicely furnished (beware of the step !). Breakfast was adequate and the staff were pleasant. Best thing about this b&b was the location - right in the centre of a very busy street and within a few steps of the Trevi Fountain.

It took us a bit to find it, but once we got there we were not dissapointed. We stayed in Rome for only 3 nights and this hotel was the perfect choice. Walking distance from everywhere, you could hear the Trevi fountain from our window. The room was clean and spacious, decorated with great taste. The staff were really helpful and nice; the breakfast was great (italian cold meats, cheese, bread, croissants, cakes, coffees and juice..) This hotel was perfect for the romantic getaway where my now husband proposed!", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residenza Trevi Roma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d646457-Reviews-Residenza_Trevi_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$158 - $264*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via del Lavatore 83</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "646457", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/2/7/2/9/249272/249272.jpg"}}
