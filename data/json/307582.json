{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Highly recommended My girlfriend and I have been staying at this hotel for the past 8 years and depart again to stay there in 2 weeks time. We have our favourite room 243 which we organise to have via email with one of the staff. Staff are always helpful and pleasant and nothing is ever any both. Rooms are average but you get what you pay for and if there is any odour from the bathroom a trip to Mata Hari for deodorants and moth balls fixes the problem. A smile and good manners always helps. I find it pays to go through a travel agent to book holidays rather than do it through the interenet. I have found at the hotel that people who are having accommodation troubles because their reservations are lost seem to be doing it via the internet.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a low cost holiday and who want to be surrounded by happy faces and beautiful gardens.", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR194486317", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PJTPerth"}, {"Content": "A very good place to stay My wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years and find it to be a very good hotel. Yes at times in the past there have been some stupid drunks in the pool area but soon taken care of by the security staff. We have never had a problem with staff or admin. The breakfast could be a little better but will get you by ok.Location is great and the beach is close. In all hotels you will find some things anyone will complain about and need be at times. We always have stayed in the bungalows and find them quite good. This is a good choise hotel for any age group really.

Unfortunately thought I would stay at another Hotel not far from Kuta Beach Club and was that one hell of a big mistake. 5 star hotel, huge, impersonal, didn't cater for westerners and really had no time for us.

We stayed only one night just prior to our departure from Bali. We have travelled to Bali many times over some 16 years and are about to return there in a few weeks. Kuta Beach Club has to rate as one of the worst places we have ever stayed. The room stunk of cigarettes to start with. There were no towels in our bathroom - we rang just before we went for a swim to arrange for some to be brought to our room. Spent an hour or so in the pool and asked the staff to change the music - some of the foulest stuff you could imagine being played over and over again. Went back to the room, no towels. Rang again...no worries will bring some some. An hour later...where are the towels...they then brought two pool towels...no, we wanted bath towels. I borrowed some from someone in another room - the towels arrived around 4 hours after our first request. God knows why it took so long - no explanation for the delay. The rooms are ordinary, along with the food served at the restaurant and the reception area at night seems to fill with some of the dodgiest characters I've ever seen in Bali. For all of you who stay there regularly, give yourself a treat and try somewhere else - Bali has some of the most beautiful, inexpensive hotels in the world with great staff and superb restaurants........Kuta Beach Club is not one of them!", "Date": "Dec 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR558862618", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SOOz-Trip"}, {"Content": "So - So We had been advised through the travel brochure that this resort is not a club, nor is it on the beach, so no illusions there. However the resort is in an extremely convenient position to everything one would want in Kuta and literally within minutes walk of the beach, supermarkets and dozens if restaurants.But. The pervading memory is of noise.We arrived fairly late to a welcome drink and a short walk to our room accompanied by a very friendly porter. The room was certainly adequate for the price we paid. Very traditional with a small verandah and stone carvings which in the Balinese way, give the impression they are a thousand years old. Ah! Peace and tranquility and sound sleep.What on earth is that noise? Bleareily I study the time. 0600. There is clattering, screeching, scraping, banging and shouting coming from somewhere close. Later, we find that we right next to the restaurant and the noise is from tables and chairs being re-arranged.Following this rude awaykning and breakfast we return to the room. Now we have hammering, banging, scraping and thudding from the other side, where a unit is under renovation.OK. So now I go to the front desk. Not so much to complain, but to ask for a change of rooms - whatever the cost. Yes, there is room available, right alongside the pool. Talk about between a rock and a hard place. I didn't expect the pool to be full of drunken shouters either.This was a while back, but I would say don't go there for a restful stay. Go there to stay awake about 4 out of the 24.Et ceteras: Service 8/10. Surroundings 6/10. Ambience ruined.

The staff are allways friendly and helpfull. Because we have stayed so many times, the staff even rember our names, which makes our stay even more personal and friendly. The rooms have allways been clean and well serviced. The daily complimentary breakfast is fantastic. If you like to spend time in the pool, the pool bar is the place to be, a sunken bar, which you can sit around all day, and have a sip from a delightfull range of beers and cocktails. They even have stubbie holders for your dingin bintang, ( cold beer ). We will be staying there again this christmas. So don't be put off by people bagging Bali, it's a fun place to go, and so is the Kuta Beach Club.

If guests go to the front desk with a complaint, they should be firm and friendly but not rude and abrupt.That will get you nowhere. I have had small problems at times and they have been sorted out ASAP to my satisfaction. The hotel is central to everything and the staff will arrange for drivers to take you anywhere and will arrange day trips and anything else you can ask for. People must remember they are visiting a developing country and the people there have a very relaxed lifestyle but are willing to go out of their way to help visitors to Bali.I rate the KBC very highly and my wife and I are looking forward to our next visit in September. I just love the swim up bar and sitting in the spa at night having a drink and watching the big screen movies.

When I showed them reservation numbers and dates they spent a lot of times asking me irrelevant questions (what kind of work do you do?) and seemed to be acting like they were trying to figure out what the problem was. Eventually, I told them to give me the one room and I would try to sort the problem out when my other group members showed up. During the check-out process, they Front informed me that one of my rooms was US$70, not the $40 noted on my reservation form. They told me that I had stayed in a deluxe room and would have to pay the deluxe rate. I had asked their staff for a room with a double bed (as my reservation indicated) but they seemed to have given me an upgrade (with an upgraded price.) Also, when I told the Front that my Deluxe room had no hot water and that my wife needed to take showers in my father's room they bluntly replied that red is for hot water while blue is for cold water. Obviously, I tried both red and blue with no luck. For me the water problem wasn't a huge deal, but their unwillingness to even investigate this problem and show even a minimal amount of understanding was frustrating. While trying to settle this matter with the Front Desk, another guest asked if I was having room problems. This guest told me his friends were having the same type of missing reservation resulting in upgrade problem at the same hotel. As I left the hotel, I overheard some guests (who had just arrived and were checking in) having a problem with their hotel reservations.I got the very unpleasant feeling that this sort of lost reservation resulting in an upgrade happens quite often at the Kuta Beach Club Hotel.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR376380611", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u701b\u612a\u7df5\u9287\ue0a0\u5010\u6d5c\u70d8\u76b8\u951b\u4f8a\u7d12   showReview(22855369, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR381757452", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u6434\ue15e\u6e4c\u9287\u5c7b\u4eb6\u9288\u5c7b\u4e9c\u9287\u72ae\u4eef\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(21362684, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR647304296", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jagat"}, {"Content": "\u9359\ue218\u5010\u9287\ue042\u4eb8\u6d93\u5d85\u5f72\u9288\u5098\u4efe\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19168366, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR842232631", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u934a\u3086\ue18c\u9429\u7a3f\u7e59\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19166148, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR480894551", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9429\u7a3f\ue62e\u9288\u5fcb\u501d\u9287\u6c25\u5046\u9289\u70bd\u5120\u9288\u253f\u512d\u9289\u7b3a\u5061\u9289\u0441\u5142\u9287\ue21b\u527e\u93af\u866b\u5051\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19164502, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR916689262", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9480\u59d0\u4eed\u942b\u20ac\u9287\u6219\u4ee7\u9287\u5c7b\u5153\u9289\u6c47\u5153\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19161406, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR386694693", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d307582-r20104538-Kuta_Beach_Club_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "307582", "Price": "$65"}}
