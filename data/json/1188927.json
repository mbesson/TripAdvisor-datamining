The staff however are helpful and friendly but please don't make the decision to stay just on this. There are motels 2x better than this for the same price.

Being a single woman traveling alone I was hoping the location wasn't as bad as some previous reviews stated. I was pleasantly surprised that the neighborhood wasn't as bad as I thought is was going to be. There was a lot of new homes being built in the area and yes there were a few boarded up but not as many as I thought there would be. I never once felt unsafe. Kendall the manager was GREAT !! When I asked him about how to drive to the French quarter, he said it would be easier if I left my car there (behind the locked gates). He offered to give me a ride and told me if I wanted to take a cab back, it would be around 10.00 or he said I could call him on his cell and he would come and get me. I took the cab back and it was 10.00 like he said, plus a tip. The room was very clean, the carpet was either new or just cleaned. The flat screen TV worked great and the free wifi worked great as well. It was nice to have a fridge as my dogs food needs to be refrigerated. Another good thing about this hotel is not only are they pet friendly, Kendall didn't charge anything for having 2 small dogs. My only complaint and its a small one, is that they have no coffee makers in the rooms. I drink a lot of coffee and had to take a 2 minute drive to a gas station to get some. During my cross country trip my windshield cracked and the glass people are going to come to the hotel in the morning to fix it. I let Kendall know and he had no problem with it. He even said I can stay past checkout if they are not finished by then. I 100% recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area. The hotel staff is friendly and go above and beyond to make their guests happy. The rate is unbelievely low but the quality is high.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest deal in New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "Jeffrey H", "ReviewID": "UR129787462", "Content": "Crescent palms motel was the best deal in new Orleans when I stayed there during jazz fest.

I couldn't abide by spending $200+ a night in the French Quarter and looked for a better value. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crescent Palms Motel. It is about 3 miles from the heart of the French Quarter. It is located at the end of MLK and I felt very safe in the surrounding area. I did not notice any foot-traffic or loitering on or around site. Off-street parking is available inside the courtyard of the motel. The on-site manager was genuinely nice and courteous, and when there were no cabs available just before a big parade, he took us to our destination along the parade route. Also, the motel is located along RTA bus route 28 which runs right to the corner of Canal St and S. Rampart, and at $1.25 per rider, that can't be beat. Cab fare was about $10-$12 fron the Quarter to the motel. The rooms were very large and the full size beds were comfortable. The mini-fridge was a nice addition, large enough to keep our sandwiches and beverages cold. The bathroom was cute, renovated in a retro style and reminded me of the Art Deco district of Miami Beach.

The price was less than half of other places located at similar distances from the CBD. The room (two queens) was a good size, had a nice flat screen television, free WIRELESS internet, decent sized bathroom, a barfridge, functioning although very noisy air conditioning, and great water pressure. The room was clean, and kept clean throughout our stay by daily cleanings. We always had plenty of towels etc. and the beds were always made up. The room had been redone recently - the ceilings and walls were new, but the carpet, although clean, was old and fully of cigarette burn marks. Our hosts were very friendly. We arrived at midnight and the night manager showed up only a couple minutes later to let us in as promised. On our first morning the owners gave us a lift to St. Charles street to a restaurant they recommended for breakfast . A few days later the night manager gave us a lift to a restaurant we wanted to try out for dinner. Other than that we took taxis to and from St. Charles, then walked into the CBD. The taxi's averaged about $8.50 each time, which included an extra $1 for having 2 people in the cab. Once we took a taxi all the way downtown to the Sheraton on Canal, which cost less than $15. The downside to this hotel is that it's in an area where it's not safe to walk around at night. In fact some of the taxi drivers said they wouldn't even walk around in the day time, although the two of us (two women) did walk all the way into the CBD from the hotel one day, with no troubles. It's in the middle of the projects, most of which were destroyed by the floods. They've rebuilt a few, which look quite nice, and more are being built right now. There's also a lot of very run down houses, many boarded up, and a bunch of small churches. The hotel is gated, but when the gates are open during the daytime, there are always a bunch of men hanging around the entrance, often with alcohol (e.g., bottle of whiskey in a paper bag). They never bothered us but it did make us uncomfortable having to walk by them to get to our room. We would have felt more comfortable if the front office was manned at all times, but 9 times out of 10 it was empty.

We arrived late at night and, at first, I was a bit concerned about the surrounding neighborhood. Not necessarily because of personal safety, but because I was moving across country and my car was packed to the brim with all my important belongings,as well as two cruiser bikes attached to the back and a thule on top! (We were concerned about safely parking the car the entire trip) Upon arrival these worries were soothed as the motel offers gated parking that are locked every night at 10pm. We were greeted by the night manager Kendal, he was super cheery, checked us in quickly and showed us to our room. He explained the t.v. had died earlier that day and he had just brought in a brand new flat screen. This quick response to a minor problem is a sign of a well run establishment! The rooms were spacious and impeccable. The pink retro tile in the huge bathrooms was adorable. The furnishings were simple yet comfortable and clean. The decor in the office and bar were fabulously mid-century modern that matched the exterior of the hotel. So cute! The bar was tiny and smoky, but filled with interesting characters. It made for a relaxed and entertaining evening. The next day the vivacious female day manager, (I forget her name) explained the best routes to get around the city on our bikes. She gave great advice. We explored the french quarter, garden district and everywhere in between. The neighborhood around the motel looked much nicer in the daytime (old folks sitting on the porch waving to us as we pedaled by). We arrived back to the motel in time to sit on the car-port roof sip some beers and watching the sun go down over NOLA. I loved my stay at the Crescent Palms Motel, and felt great about supporting a local business revitalized after Katrina. You can read more about the history of the Motel on their website, or just ask! The location was a terrific taste of life in residential New Orleans away from the drunken tourist trap that is the french quarter.
