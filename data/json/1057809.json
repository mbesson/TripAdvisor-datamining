I arrived in the evening, checked in and went to my room. Next day I was having a meeting and I left my bathing items, cosmetics, etc. on the table, together with my book. After the whole day I came back to the hotel and my stuff was missing. I've contacted the reception desk, but the lady was only surprised, no action at all. I suggested to call housekeeping to ask them about this, I suspected they found my stuff and brought it to the reception desk, but they did not. So, the only thing I could do is to write them a letter asking if they find the items to sent them to my address, but that was a few weeks ago and no response so far. It is good I didn't leave my laptop there. I am aware, that it might be an isolated case, but it happened to me and please be aware with this hotel. I hope they are checking now if the inhabitant stays in the room for another night or not, in my case probably they didn't and clean the room to be ready for a new guest, however, it shouldn't happen that my stuff is missing. Other hotels gathering left items and contact recent guests to ask what to do with the items, either trash them or send them somewhere. I do travel a lot and stay in various hotels, but this was the first time something like that happened to me.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cI really liked it...\u201d", "Author": "jboano", "ReviewID": "UR114772183", "Content": "Good price. Good hotel. Taxis costs around EUR 15 from airport. Train station is 3min walking and takes around 20min to Berlin center. 10 min to airport.

AM campus is a nice hotel offering comfortable rooms at a great price. High ceilings make the rooms bigger than they really are simply decorated but very nice. The breakfast is nice enough fruits and yogurts and a hot meal as well. The location is a bit far from the center but the train station is a short walk away. The sch\u00f6nefeld airport is nearby too. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

I found the hotel very convenient for visiting the city. Near to the U-Bahn station at Adlershof. It was also very easy to get into the city on the public transport system. Easy to get to the airport ot Schonefeld too (only 3 stops away). It is a brand new hotel that opened on 22.07.06. All the room facilities worked, and it was very clean, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. Great for people who want healthier options but you can also have a fry up, if you wish!

This made us a bit suspious but we went anyway. The hotel is located in the outskirts of the former east berlin on S-bahn line S9 Adlershof stop and it is about 30 minutes by S-bahn to Friedrichstrasse. The room was very much business traveller style, the food and service was exemplary. It cost us \u00a3185 for two of us to stay five nights so I would throughly recommend the hotel. If you do stay here make sure you go to the following. Cocktail bar on Dorpfeldstrasse - fantastic mojitos, caprinhino's and long island iced teas - we both got legless for 30 euros total. Communist freedon fighter memorial on Dorpfeldstrasse Suzes cafe on adlergestell - good German food very well priced.

(the pictures included in this review are from room 505). the hotel is a perfect stay for someone travelling from Schonefeld airport as it is only a 15/20 minute bus ride away from the airport (on bus numbers 162/163) or a 10 minute S bahn ride (line number S9 to Spandau). however, if your airport destination is Tegal or Templehof you might be best to find a more centrally located hotel as Adlershof is quite a way away from the city centre. the closest S bahn station was a 5 minute walk away and a 30/40 minute train ride got you to all the attractions in the centre of Berlin. we had a fantastic city break holiday and the hotel was superb value for money!!!", "Date": "July 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Airporthotel Berlin-Adlershof", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1057809-Reviews-Airporthotel_Berlin_Adlershof-Berlin.html", "Price": "$64 - $113*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rudower Chaussee 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12489</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1057809", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/45/c8/e3/business-doppelzimmer.jpg"}}
