This place was the worst hotel experience I have had in my life. The sheets were dirty, the carpet was in worse shape I didn't want to walk barefoot in the room for fear of getting fungus, but worst of all is the fact that I left some very important items in the room that were stolen.

It is extremely cheap (at times being as low as $29 per night) and the location is awesome. It is by no means a fancy place, as it is older and far outdated, but it does the trick if you just need somewhere to sleep for a low price. My room had two queen sized beds, a kitchenette and a bathroom. The room was clean, but once again, it is older, so the furniture and appliances were old. The people who work the desk are friendly and accommodating. The location is the best part because it is located in a little hidden terrace off of the main street, and the beach there is fairly unoccupied.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cnot bad for one night stay\u201d", "Author": "takeme2Coz", "ReviewID": "UR51059073", "Content": "My boyfriend had to make a business trip to Miami. We arrived late and just needed a place for one night before heading over to the gulf coast for our vacation. The hotel is old, but we found it clean. Very bare bones,hard beds and small rooms but ok for one night since we were checking out the next morning. No coffee pot or restaraunt. There is a Days Inn next door with a nice bar and good food.

The sign out front says \"Open 24 Hrs\" - wonder what that means... the smell of the mold and mildew competed with the smell of disinfectant to see which was strongest - had to turn off the A/C because of the dust and mold on the filter. The floors and fixtures were dusty - must not have been cleaned since the last review... we were booked by hotelscorp and they refused to move us but did cancel the deal - they wanted me to buy a timeshare and they put me in this dump ?... the night shift said they were all booked and could not change rooms .
