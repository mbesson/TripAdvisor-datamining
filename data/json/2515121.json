The speed is good and we were able to video-call (FaceTime) our daughter via the connection. If there is one criticism I have is there is no coffee/tea making facilities in the room - but this is not a huge deal as there are ample places (including the hotel) where you can buy a coffee or a bite to eat.

The location is no more than a 2 minute walk from the Place Monge Metro (you can see the hotel across the road as you come out of the metro) and therefore is very accessible from whatever airport/location you are arriving from. The Rue Monge street that the hotel is located on has some good bakeries (passtieres even...) as well as fairy decent supermarket that is open most nights till 10pm I felt the street was very safe and never had one concern about the area. As others have said the Rue Mouffard eating district is just behind Rue Monge and their are plenty of pleasant restaurants charging no more than 22 euros for a 3 course meal. Notre Dame is a short 10-15 min walk away and is recommended as we passed some amazing bakeries on the way that sold delicious \"Pan au Nutellas\" for just over a euro! The hotel is charming, red walls, dim lit and felt very Parisian. The staff who I dealt with were all very pleasant and helpful and spoke fluent English. The lift as others have said is tiny, fits no more than 2 slim people, but I thought it was a hoot squeezing into it with the skinny husband and a carrier bag from the shops! Our double room was on the 4th floor, spotlessly clean, slightly dated furniture but had everything we needed. Double bed, desk, flat screen tv (no english speaking channels) and mini bar. It also had a charming balcony style window that looked onto Rue Mouffard however even though we stayed during a weekend we heard nothing from the street when the window was closed. The bathroom was tiny, as was the shower, definately wouldn't fit two, I didn't bother trying! But again had everything one would need including toliteries and was cleaned to perfection every day. The only negative I have is that when the neighbours in the next room went to have a shower or use the bathroom, it sounded like they were in our room, the walls are obviously very thin although I found it quite funny towards the end. This was my first trip back to Paris as an adult and I fell in love with it, I plan on going back at every opportunity I can and would stay at this hotel again if I could get it for a similar cost as I did for this trip (\u00a3150 for 2 nights).", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, excellent value for money,\u201d", "Author": "amandypandy", "ReviewID": "UR125555588", "Content": "For the price, I couldn't find much fault with with this hotel.

The hotel had been recently renovated and we got upgraded to a great room at the back of the hotel overlooking the Arenes des Luteces. The staff is really pleasant and helpful. There is a great breakfast in the morning. The lift is really small but you really only need it twice to get in and out with your suitcases. The stairs are right there. The neighbourhood is great too. On an earlier trip, we had stayed up in the 9th which felt a bit touristy. This felt like a safe, interesting, local neighbourhood with lots of history. The hotel is right between two metro stops so getting around is no problem. If you are taking the RER in from CDG, it's probably best to get off at the St. Michel stop and walk a bit further (about ten minutes) to avoid extra stairs and transfers. The only \"drawbacks\" are that the room we were in had no safe (the one at the front desk is only accessible during the day), the bathroom is a sit-down shower (which is pretty normal for France) and it's a hotel that asks you to give your key when you leave the room. You're supposed to pay for wireless and printing, but we didn't have to. The room has a mini-bar which we used as a fridge for our groceries and there were extra comforters in the closet. I found a really good deal on Expedia and the room was less than half the listed price. If you're travelling during low season, I suggest checking on those types of booking websites.

The bed was very firm, linens were ok. The front desk service was very nice and cordial and friendly, offering input about directions and suggestions. Some being better than others. The elevator fits two tightly. For the price ~$165/night it was a good deal for the area. Anything nicer will run into almost double.

Also, probably because we were on the sixth (top) floor and on the back side of the hotel, it was pretty quiet. We couldn't hear any street noises. The only noise we heard really was the occasional rumble of the metro (which either runs under the hotel or very nearby) and some dripping water noises that seemed to come from the hotel's radiator/heating system. Both of these noises were subtle, and not enough to interrupt our sleep. (The metro stops running at midnight anyway.) The location was very good. The window in our room looked out onto the Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce. It's an easy walk to Notre Dame, St Chappelle, the Pantheon, and restaurants in the Latin quarter. Metro stations for lines 7 and 10 less than a block away will get you anywhere in the city. Close to bakeries, wine stores, book stores, butchers. Only thing I didn't see on our street that I would have liked was a cheese shop, but I'm sure there must have been one nearby. I would prefer this location to almost any other in the city. The hotel staff is very friendly, polite, and happy to speak English. We had pleasant interactions with everyone we spoke with at the hotel. A few details worth noting. The wifi internet access is 2.50 euros for a full 24-hours of access. Unlike hotels in the states, that doesn't mean a 24-hour period and then it expires--instead, it means that if you use it two hours a night, you can use it for 12 nights before needing to spend another 2.50. So, it is practically free and I'd be surprised if spending 2.50 one time doesn't give you all you need for your stay there. However, only one device can be connected at a time with the username/password they'll give you, so if you want to use both your laptop and your smart phone on wifi at the same time, you'll want to buy TWO username/passwords. That's what I did and it worked great for the whole week we were there. The room comes with a TV, mini bar, hair dryer, shampoo, soap, shower cap, shoe shine wipe, toilet paper, tissues, etc. There is no iron, or ironing board, no coffee maker, no hangers in the closet.

Perfectly positioned a few steps from the Place Monge m\u00e9tro exit (make sure you take the Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce exit), the hotel was warm and welcoming from start to finish. Decor is slightly less impressive in the rooms than it is in the lobby and I'd agree with other reviewers that this is definitely the smallest lift I've ever experienced (all part of the fun, squeezing in with large case, small case, camera backpack, handbag and husband!). However, everything was ideal - room was well sized (we were in no. 45) with a suitcase stand, desk, chair, wardrobe and bedside tables; nice view of Rue Monge (very quiet at night); shower was small but well powered and hot; bed was one of the comfiest hotel beds I've slept in with two spare duvets in the wardrobe; and we didn't notice much noise from our neighbouring rooms. We were pretty annoyed that the cigarette smell came straight into our room from the nasty smokers in the room next door, but that was only for a couple of nights. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful with enquiries and internet was just 2E50 for 24 hours of usage (not per day) so that kept us going for the full weekend. All the places we needed to get to were simple to reach - rue Mouffetard with its (over-touristy) bars and restaurants was 5 minutes' stroll (we'd recommend Caf\u00e9 Felix for its happy hour 5-euro cocktails), place Maubert for Saturday morning market was 10 minutes walk via the Panth\u00e9on, Notre Dame was another 10-minute walk, Louvre was an energetic half-hour march. And of course the two metro stations were just a few steps away. We'd definitely recommend the Petit Cardinal brasserie (on the square near Cardinal Lemoine metro entrance) for eating and drinking in the evening (salade aux g\u00e9siers to die for) and the little boulangerie opposite for breakfast pastries and lunchtime baguettes.

The bathroom was small but functional, sink, toilet and bath. We had booked a room with a shower (bath was 10 Euros more) but we got a room with bath.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable. I really liked the decor, with the patterened curtains and simple white comforter. The bed itself was comfortable (it is a firm mattress, which I didn't think I liked, but I slept so well I'm reconsidering!), as was the pillow, which felt soft and wasn't the hard foam that some hotels use. The bathroom was nice, lots of towels to use and a good size sink with plenty of places to put toiletries. The towels were fluffy and absorbent, not thin. The shower was small, and the only place to put shampoo was on the small ledge in the corner. I think this is typical for Paris, but it's something to be aware of, because it is closer than US showers, and took getting used to, even for me, and I'm a smaller person. A plus-size person, or one who wants a lot of space, might want to consider the rooms with the bath. On the plus side, the water pressure was great, and you could adjust the height and angle of it to suit yourself. There is a lift, but it is tiny! I thought it was great just because of that, but it is not a multiple person and their luggage kind of lift. One person and some luggage, or two people and no luggage! We stayed on the 3rd floor, so didn't use it much, but if we were higher, I think it would have been very useful! Breakfast was plentiful: breads (brioche and baguette), small pastries (which are mini-sized but seemed to come from a bakery, not the kind that come in plastic wrap), yogurt, cereal, juice, cheese and meat and always fresh fruit (bowls, and also whole fruits. I had white donut peaches that were yummy). And of course coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc... The breakfast is 11 euros, but I think it is worth it, because there is a great deal of variety. I liked to have yogurt, bread with cheese and met, juice and coffee, so it worked out well for me, but if all you want is a pastry and quick cafe, perhaps somewhere else would be better. I liked the convenience and the quality. And I love the red decor! The staff were very helpful. From the cleaning ladies to the concierges, they were great and went above and beyond. They hold the keys when you go out, and as there is always someone on the desk 24 hours, you just pick it up when you return. I like not having to keep track of the key, and I'm sure it's a security measure for them, too. It also means you get to know the concierges a bit, and this adds to the warm feeling of the hotel. The location is convenient: literally around the corner is the place monge metro, and if you feel like walking, it's just a short distance to the Seine and Notre Dame (half a mile; perhaps 10 minutes, tops). We walked just about everywhere, only taking the metro from the hotel to get to places farther afield. Rue mouffetard has lots of restaurants, a fun market, and great people watching.

Other things that were annoying was no place in shower to put shampoo (no ledges, etc) and with it being so coffin small it made for some interesting shower olympics to function. Ladies: shaving your legs is nearly impossible.

I went down to the front desk to ask her and she was rude about it and told me i have to dial 0, but that isn't what I was asking her. Then the phone rang and I told her to go ahead and answer and I will wait.... thinking it was a customer wanting to book a room. I ended up standing there for 10 minutes while she chit-chatted with what sounded like a friend. Luckily, my friend whom I was meeting walked in the door at that time and he told me to dial 00 first. Thank god he walked in or I woudl have still been waiting. She didn't even get off the phone long enough to great him either. Honestly, it wasn't that big of deal but I just thought it was rude.

Julie is a truly friendly, fluent in English, proprietor of the Hotel Monge and is why you should choose to stay here during your Paris stay. She is so much more than that, as she also was extremely helpful when we needed directions to somewhere. She had a file of maps printed out and would simply reach for the appropriate map, take her yellow highlighter, and show us exactly how to get from point A to point B. She also was wonderful at recommending the most incredible places to eat- family friendly and reasonable, with A+ food (And as a former food services instructor, I am highly critical and picky when it comes to food!).

Positives: windows are double paned and the rooms are clean. But we think there are better hotels out there. We found the Familia Hotel MUCH better last time we were in Paris (they were booked this time around ) 1. Staff did not seem to make an effort to be friendly at all. When we checked in we were simply given our keys and pointed to the elevator/stairs. We were suprised since others raved about the service. We barely got a smile out of them- I wondered for a minute if THEY were the ones paying us to stay there. 2. Elevator fits only 1 person with luggage or 2 small people. The dark winding staircase was not much better to lug your baggage up. 3. There is not clock or coffee/teamaker in the room. Considering they managed to have a minibar in each room, hmmmm. 4. Don't expect to sleep in at all as the housekeeper starts banging and vacuuming at around 8 am. Ok? it's supposed to be a holiday 5. Finally, we found the beds pretty rough to sleep on. I woke up with backaches (normally I never have back issues). The last couple nights I found it helpful to sleep on my stomach. Anyways, hope this helps!

Julie, Juliet and the rest of the staff at the hotel are unfailingly polite and helpful all the time. They provided us with hot water (for tea) every night we were there. Answered our queries and recommended us where to get late night supper, paris style. Breakfast is superb - croissant are nice! Most importantly - we accidentally left behind an item of sentimental value and emailed Julie about it. She promised she would search around for it and she did! She found our belonging and kept it safe while we picked it up on our way back from Milan. Were really grateful to them for it. Overall a great hotel. The service was simply all-rounded.

Our room was #401, a corner room with twim beds pushed together. The room had a small seating area in addition to the bed area, and looked over the small amphitheater behind the hotel. The room was comfortable and quiet. The bathroom was small but not tiny, and contained a tub with no shower curtain and a hend held shower (not atypical in Paris hotels). We dealt with this easily: I was very careful to always keep the spray pointed toward the backwall, and my wife chose to shower sitting down in the tub. We had a few chuckles about this, but it was fine. We enjoyed the fact that the Hotel Monge's rooms are airconditioned, as Paris was warm during our stay. We did not use any of the products in the in-room mini fridge, but we used it to chill the wines we bought to the room. The linens and towels were clean of good quality. The room was cleaned well every day. The elevator is small - 3 passengers max and only one person with luggage at a time. So, we normally took it going up, and took the stairs going down. The location of the hotel is great. It is in a middle class working neighborhood, with many small shops, bucheries, charcuteries, boulangeries, and tabacs. The Rue Monge Metro station is within 200 feet of the hotel's front door, and there is another station 2 blocks from Hotel Monge. We walked Rue Monge and other main avenues in the neighborhood as late as 10PM and felt safe. There are many good resturants within 15 minutes walk, and Ille de Cite - Notre Dame - is less than a 20 minute walk. One of the main assets of this hotel is Julie, the owner and operator of the hotel. Julie was a joy to work, with from working out the reservations to the day we checked out. Julie is at the front desk perhaps 10 hours per day, and was there every day but one of our stay. She made two sets of dinner reservations for us, ordered taxis for us twice, made two restaurant recommendations (1 on Ille St Louis and 1 in the Rue Moufetard area) that were excellent, and generally acted as our chief source of advice. She has a delightful personality. Her husband handles the morning in-house breakfast and other chores, and he along with the other staff, most of whom have been with Julie for many years, were absolutley great.

She was happy to oblige (and correct!) my French, and was equally warm with my mother in English. The breakfast downstairs seemed a wee bit expensive, and so we sought our breakfasts elsewhere. Early rising was a bit of a nuisance, since the night concierge sleeps behind the desk on a cot (and you don't want to disturb him), and the front doors are shuttered.

The bathroom ~ likewise, bigger than I expected, based on previous descriptions posted on this website. A bonus was the airconditioning, which came in handy with the unexpected heat at the end of last week! We found the small elevator exactly as described, small, but efficient.

Our favorite area was Rue Mouffetard, which is a three to five minute walk from the hotel. We spent our last morning walking thru the markets and eating breakfast in one of the outdoor cafes. We spent two wonderful evenings at the Restaurant Le Jardin D'Ivy. Ivy and her husband own this restaurant, and she is the artist responsible for all of the art decorating the walls. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but most tables were full every morning. We preferred to eat breakfast at different spots every day.

Trip Advisor came through again! The hotel was exactly what we were looking for, and Julie was very helpful and accomodating to our every need. The rooms were immaculately clean, and though a little on the small side, we expected this and it had no bearing on our hotel stay experience. We did have an unfortunate experience upon our arrival in Paris: on our way to the hotel on the Paris Metro, my sister's passport was stolen. We hadn't even been in the city for a half hour when this nightmare occurred. When we got to the hotel, Julie provided us with the telephone number of the US Embassy and told us where we could find the closest police station to file a report. As we arrived on a holiday (Nov 11) the embassy was closed so we had to wait until Monday to get a new one issued. Fortunately, my sister had brought a xerox copy of her passport with her, so I'm sure this helped getting a new passport issued more quickly than normal. Lesson learned...do not travel in a big city without a neck pouch and keep all of your credit cards, drivers license, cash and passport in that pouch! And always, bring a copy of your passport. Regarding the hotel, we couldn't have asked for a cleaner place to stay. We also enjoyed the ambiance of the breakfast room off of the lobby, so we ate there every morning before starting off our day of touring Paris. There is a small room off the lobby that has free internet access, but beware that it does not support AOL, only MSN as far as we could tell. That was the only inconvenience we ran into at the hotel. Also... because we had to stay an extra day in Paris to secure a new passport, 3 of us (out of our party of 6) had to get another room for the night, and Julie was able to get us a triple room (with balcony) for about 50 Euros per person. The room was a little cramped with the extra bed, but we didn't mind, and the bathroom was a little bigger than the double we stayed in the previous 3 nights there. Bottom line...you can't beat the location and the price. It was truly a \"boutique\" hotel and exactly what we wanted. We will definitely stay there again, and despite the bad luck with the stolen passport, it will not affect our decision to come back to Paris again someday.

First impression was that the hotel is small, simple and clean. It was air conditioned, which was very nice for us spoiled Americans after a hot day of walking the city. Our room was on the 4th floor (really 5th), and going up and down all the stairs did get old after a few days. The elevator is nice when you have luggage, but tiny and slow and not really for use otherwise. Our room (44) was one of the smaller rooms that overlooks the street. About on par with most European rooms I have seen. Everything in the room was very clean and tidy and it had both a small tv (which we didn't use) and a mini-bar hidden under the desk. The only real complaint about the room was the shower. The curtain in the shower was very thin and therefore subjected us to \"windy curtain\" - when the curtain blows into the shower and ends up sticking to your body. Also, the hand-held shower head would not stay put and we always ended up getting water on the floor despite our best attempts to control it. Other than that, the room was quiet and comfortable. The location of Hotel Monge is great. The Latin Quarter was a fun place to walk around and feels a lot more like a real \"neighborhood\" than many areas of Paris. The only downfall to the authenticity is that often in shops and stores, no one spoke English and our limited French was stretched to the max. Though this is to be expected in France, in most other parts of the city we did not have this problem. Our experience with the service was mixed. Julie and the other 2 gentlemen working the front desk were nice enough, if not overly helpful. The only time we really utilized their advice was to ask Julie to recommend a cabaret, and unfortunately the one she said was \"the best\" - LIDO - was TERRIBLE. We were literally laughing in the middle of the \"Cat's\" montage because it was so cheesy and horrible. We wasted 100 euro on a show straight from 1970. Maybe that's what most tourists want to see, but we were extremely disappointed. A bit of advice: If upon arrival in Paris you choose to take the metro to the hotel, opt for the Cardinal Lemoine stop rather than Place Monge, as there are MULTIPLE stairs to drag your luggage up at Place Monge. For future metro trips, Place Monge is the closer stop (if you head toward the \"Arenes de Lutece\" exit) - literally a few doors down from the hotel. We made the mistake when we arrived and kicked ourselves later. Some other Metro advice is that if you plan to be in Paris for more than 3-4 days and arrive on a Sunday (or early in the week) you should opt for the \"carte l'orange\" which has unlimited metro trips for a week. It says you need a picture when you get it (which we paid 4 euro for) but not once was this picture ever verified so I would say skip the photo and plead ignorance if there's ever a problem.

The staff are pleasant and efficient - we didn't see much of them as everything was fine! Our room was spotlessly clean, warm, and comfortable, and tastefully decorated. It overlooked a busy street, but the double glazing eliminated most of the street noise. You pay 6.50 euros extra for the breakfast, and although you might get your cafe and croissant slightly cheaper in the local cafes, if breakfast is a must, we would recommend that you have breakfast at the hotel. The hotel is in a nice part of Paris, within walking distance of the Quartier Latin and the Ile de la Cite, but not overrun with tourists - on the Sunday morning you got the feeling that it was somewhere people lived. There are lots of good restaurants on the rue Mouffetard, just a few minutes walk from the hotel, so you do not need to go on a long trek to find your evening meal when you are already tired from a day's sightseeing. Next time we go to Paris, we will probably stay here again.", "Date": "December 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cLovely Room and Good Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2861954", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Hotel Monge for 3 days and nights in late November 2004. We had 2 street facing rooms which were priced at an excellent rate. The rooms were lovely, spacious and very clean. In our double room, we had an large bathroom with a giant soaking tub, fabulous for a hot bath at the end of a long day on your feet. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but instead frequented the many bakeries and cafes up and down the street. The lift was small but fine for moving luggage. One plus was the small fridge in each room which was great for storing drinks and snacks. The street traffic was noisy but tolerable when windows were kept sealed, I would request a rear facing room in warmer weather if you want to keep the windows open. Our only problem was with guests smoking in the halls, on 2 nights we had to stuff towels around the door to keep the smell of smoke out of the room. I would recommend this hotel for the value and extremely clean rooms.", "Date": "December 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, MA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Gem!\u201d", "Author": "SamsaraCambridge", "ReviewID": "UR2858214", "Content": "I stayed at the Residence Monge for 4 nights at the end of November, just returned home last night. I booked about 2 weeks before my trip via email based on an article in the New York Times, reviews from this site, and a recommendation from another hotel, and it was a superb experience. Our double room was spotlessly clean, and the bathroom had an attached bath with a hand shower. The sheets were changed daily, and the bed was firm and comfortable. The staff the front desk spoke English (if that is a consideration for you), were polite, helpful, and kind. And best of all, the location is unbeatable, right in the heart of the Left Bank on rue Monge, which is a wonderful street. I made friends with the woman who runs Arene's cafe (two minutes away) on the way to the Cardinal Lemoine Metro. There are boulangeries, a grocery store, and restaurants (try the Vietnamese place up the street on 80 rue Monge for a delicious, cheap meal frequented by locals and students). And the Metro is a heart beat away. You can also walk to the Pantheon, the Institute du monde Arabe, the Paris Mosque (which has an incredible Moroccan/Tunisian restaurant, our best meal in Paris), Notre Dame, Odean, the list is endless. Stay at this place. I will definitely return there.

It was every bit as good as the previous reviewers have said. We have two more details regarding location that we think are important. First, the Monge backs on to the Arenes de Lutece, an ancient Roman arena that was uncovered in the middle of the 19th century and was almost paved over for a bus station. Instead, thanks to neighborhood protesters, it was excavated and turned into a local gathering place. If you pay a few euros extra and have a room in the back, you can watch people playing boules or soccer, or a bunch of decorous young people enjoying an early-evening get-together with wine and snacks. Or you can go downstairs and wander around the beautiful gardens on the upper level, or simply sit on one of the arena steps or a garden bench and read the newspaper. Of course, you can watch the boules and soccer players without paying extra, and I wouldn't be surprised if you could join them. Second, if you walk not toward Mouffetard but in the other direction, you soon come to the Jardin des Plantes. This is not only an entrancing botanical garden but the site of the excellent Museum of Natural History (and other scientific establishments). Just before you arrive at the Jardin des Plantes, you come to the mosque, which has a restaurant and tea-house with marvelous food and North African pastries.", "Date": "July 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "mannyr8", "ReviewID": "UR1835497", "Content": "We stayed for a few days in April and had a wonderful stay.
