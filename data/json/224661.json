I am pleased to say we were pleasantly surprised & relieved. we had a twin room on the top floor. The room was spacious & clean. Bedding was clean & the beds very comfortable, The en-suite was small but totally adequate for our needs and clean. I agree the decor could do with brightening up & the carpets had seen better days but it was clean & tidy. The staff were friendly & helpful. Breakfast was basic & uninspiring to be honest but for someone who doesn't eat much breakfast any way it was adequate. Location to Paddington underground was excellent as literally no more than 5 mins walk. We checked out after breakfast on our last day & as our train was not booked til 7pm that evening we asked if we could leave our luggage at the hotel for the day which was no problem, for this we were really grateful. I cannot believe all the bad reviews this hotel gets.

Had we not booked we would have chosen another hotel. We found a friendly and helpful reception, room 202 was clean and newly decorated with private bathroom with new plumbing and tiles on walls and floor soap and shampoo. Towels were changed daily (quite unnecessarily) and house cleaning OK. NIce bed and linen. Continental breakfast consisted of juice, milk, corn flakes, fruits, cheese and jams, sausages and baked beans, boiled eggs and bread to toast, as well as tea and coffee. Other rooms may not have street view and in basement. The lift was under repair. Water boiler and dried coffee, creamer and sugar in the room. The coffee was not to our taste.

We paid half the normal room rate through booking online. After reading reviews on this site we didn't have great expectations but were only really looking for somewhere to sleep with breakfast included. First, the positives. The location of the hotel is great, very close to Paddington station/tube. The lady on reception greeted us with a smile and was very friendly and helpful. The room was very warm (almost too warm!) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c important considering it had been snowing in London around the few days we were there. The room was nice and quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c located between 1st and 2nd floors, never heard a soul. Breakfast was reasonably good. Bed was surprisingly comfortable. Second, the negatives. The hotel was quite grotty. D\u00c3\u00a9cor not updated in years and very drab. Room was quite dirty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bathroom was particularly bad and lots of damp and mould in sight. Wallpaper peeling off, some light bulbs not working. We weren't expecting the room to be small, but it would probably be better to describe it as tiny. The less said about staff at breakfast time the better! There was building work going on at the hotel, however the upside of this is that it is apparently only 9am - 5pm (we never heard any noise outside of these times). Staff were not native English-speaking (nor most of the guests!) but we got by. You have to pay in full on arrival. We were able to store our luggage on check-out and return later in day to collect before returning home. Considering we only spent about 3 waking hours in the hotel, overall none of these things detracted too much from our stay. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you have to expect in London on a budget \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been wanting to stay any longer, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have chosen to stay here. Tip: There are lots of places to drink and eat in and around Paddington station, which is another bonus on the location of the hotel.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cNice bed-breakfast hotel\u201d", "Author": "smuckers007", "ReviewID": "UR20294572", "Content": "I went on a holiday last July in London.

The room was basic but clean (twin room), not too big, but then not a cubby hole and what do you need a big room for when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in London! Was warned about breakfast by previous reviews, but as a person who eats just about anything it was fine, would say though if you were there longer than 3 nights probably would just stick to the cereals, coffee and juice.

There was also a tv (not many channels), hairdryer and trouser press. We were at the back of the hotel and our room was quite quiet. Their website advertised a bar which we thought would be nice for a glass of wine at the end of the day but the bar does not exist any more. The breakfast was the big problem. One morning it was fried egg and baked beans and the next it was sausage and beans except they were'nt sausages but WIENERS. There were cereals but only three, two of which I didn't like ,but there was also apple or orange juice and toast and tea or coffee.
