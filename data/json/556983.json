The hotel staff was very nice and helped us. The first night we state in a small room, but after they moved us in a larger one. The rooms are clean, have new furniture, refrigerator, hair dryer and free WiFi access. Every day they clean the room. The breakfast is continental type: just croissants, coffee, milk, tea and some cakes. The location is very good: it is 10 minutes walk to Pizza Republica metro station and 15-20 minutes to Termini. You will find touristic maps at the hotel reception. In conclusion I recommend it to those who aren't concerned about luxury hotels and just want to visit the city and to stay at a decent hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "las vegas", "Title": "\u201cWorst, Terrible -- Not Secured !\u201d", "Author": "carlabebilasvegas", "ReviewID": "UR59027334", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel at noon and our fisrt night while we were sleeping from a long travel from Las Vegas, USA , someone violated our privacy--someone went inside our room and stole our money and a lot of our stuff.

The air conditioning did not work it our first room. We were moved, after we had been there for 3 nights to another room on another floor without our permission. This room was not adequate. None of the amenities that were list on hotel.com were there such as TV, fridge, or air conditioning. The continental breakfast was a joke, as well--dry bread and a yogurt. Our possessions were all unpacked and moved so when we got back to our room everything was gone! We were moved again the next day to another hotel down the road. Our bags had been opened. Not sure what someone was looking for. At the end of the day you would like some peace of mind thinking your luggage would be where you left it and the hotel you were staying at is the same one.

It was by no means the greatest hotel we've stayed in but for \u00a3190 each including flights for 4 nights, we wouldnt have expected more and we had a great stay. The room was clean - but quite dated. Great shower and clean bathroom. The only problem really was the air con which in our room didn't seem to function properly at all. We were advised on arrival by reception not to alter the settings on the remote control in our room but we did anyway and it improved things a bit - but in July it's pretty hot so was a little uncomfortable at night! It may have been better in other rooms though and i guess it would be fine if it wasn't the height of Summer!

We were looking for something nice, but not extravagent. We booked through another web site that showed pictures of a clean, modern looking room. The first thing that you should know is that this is not a hotel in the traditional sense. It is an old office building and the \"hotel\" occupies a few floors. There is an elevator that brings you up to the floor with the lobby that worked maybe once for us in 4 days. Be prepared to use the stairs and heft your luggage. When we first walked in to our room, what we actually found was an old, dirty room, that was not well maintained. There was a dirty beadspread, marks on the walls, stain on the carpet, light fixtures hanging from the wall, wires hanging from the ceiling, and air conditioning that did not work. The only thing that was true to the pictures we saw were the newer bathroom faucet and toilet. After complaining to the management, they offered us a different, bigger room, but in similiar condition. I complained again to the manager and was told that this is the level that we should expect in Rome. I told him that the level of the ammenities have nothing to do with the cleanliness and upkeep of the room. His only defense was that they were given thier rating by the web site and were fully inspected by thier representative. We would have immediately left and gone to another hotel, except we would have been out hundereds of dollars because of the cancellation policy, so we decided to tough it out. The next wonderful (sarcasm) part of this beautiful (more sarcasm) hotel was the bathroom. As I mentioned, there were some newer fixtures, such as the sink faucet and toilet. That's about it for the positives. There was mold in the shower. The water was cold 90% of the time and scalding hot the other 10%. Water leaked onto the floor from the shower. The towels though were the worst part for me personally. The smelled like they had been soaked in Curry. I immediately requested fresh, clean towels and got towels that smelled just as strong as the first. I don't know why, posibbly laundry was done in the same place as cooking? My final complaint is that the window shades/blinds in our room were broken and would not lock. This left us with a very insecure feeling about security in the room. Although we were on a high floor, the small balconies were connected and it would have been possible, although unlikely for someone to break into our room. The only possible positive thing that I can say is that the staff seemed overall pleasant, although I definately didn't feel my complaints were addressed properly. Bottom line: Would I stay here again? Heck no! Would I recommend this place to anyone?

The hotel bears no resemblance to the that depicted on the website. The room was clean but very basic. On arrival my DIY skills were tested when I had to afix the toilet seat to the pan. The air conditioning is none existant and considering the temperature reading in the centre rose to 43 in mid afternoon air con is essential. The breakfast was described as continental. You had the choice of an inedible prepacked croissant in celophane , bread (not fresh) for toast and a yogurt. Hardly continental. I have eaten better and in cleaner conditions at work !! The reception to this hotel is on the third floor with accomodation on the floors above (we were 5th) all you need is a temperamental lift that rarely worked.

I spent a lot of time trawling through the Lastminute.com hotel options, comparing their reviews here and finally made my informed selection. I received a confirmation and pre-paid voucher from Lastminute.com clearly indicating the Hotel Pichierri and its address in Rome. We arrived in Rome on 3 May at about lunchtime and walked from Termini to the hotel Pichierri, but once at Reception, the guy working there looked at our voucher and informed us that we had been \"assigned\" to another hotel. I pointed out to him that we had in fact booked into THIS hotel, had a paid voucher for it and that it was the only hotel listed on our cofirmation. He said there was nothing he could do and that we had to go to their sister hotel. The more we argued, the less interested he was. All he kept telling us was that the hotel was of the same standard - never mind it meant we had to haul our suitcase all the way over there and the fact that we had carefully selected THIS hotel!! The hotel we were sent to was the Hotel Alius and I have to say that I have never had a less friendly reception in my life, nor seen a more depressing room (I have posted a full review - have a look if you are interested). So I wanted to warn anybody who books the Pichierri through Lastminute.com that you may be randomly \"assigned\" to another hotel not of your choosing and nothing you say to the staff will make any difference!!", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland", "Title": "\u201cWe liked it\u201d", "Author": "ClevelandChil", "ReviewID": "UR6932748", "Content": "We have just returned from a four night stay at the Hotel Pichierri.

Before going I read some bad reviews of this hotel under the name Hemmingway Suites - it seems to opertate under more than one name! However, the hotel was wonderful! I'm not sure if changes have been made since those reviews were written but my experience was nothing like the ones described!! Our room was gorgeous...nice and spacious....a large bed and a nice clean bathroom with a powerful shower. There was maid service every day with fresh towels. Breakfast was extremely basic...coffee, tea, croissants, toast and yoghurts. But as this is a budget hotel...we paid 180 euros for three nights, i think it is extremely good value for money. It is also ideally situated, just 12 minutes walk to termini station which is where you get the airport transfer bus to and from, and also about 20 minutes walk to the spanish steps and trevvi fountain. We didnt need to catch any buses as everything was easy to walk to. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful - they gave us a map and pointed out the best sights to visit. One thing to remember is that the reception is on the third floor of the building so this is where you need to go to when you first arrive. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel, great location, great atmosphere and great value for money. PS. I would recommend requesting a room as they may vary a lot. We were in room 505, but a previous review recommends 603. I think the 6th floor is home to the most popular rooms.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Pichierri", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d556983-Reviews-Hotel_Pichierri-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$76 - $1,320*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Flavia 84</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "556983", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bb/91/bb91d7a60eb0bef54480000c32f07a0c1large.jpg"}}
