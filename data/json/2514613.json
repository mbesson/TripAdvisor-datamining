When we arrived around noon, they quickly grabbed our luggage and said they would secure it for us while we toured around the Financial District. We came back around 6, and even though our room wasn't quite ready, the staff were fantastic. They apologized multiple times and quickly got it ready for us. We went upstairs and the maid service was wonderful as they were finishing up our room. And once in we were shocked at how nice it really was. It had alot more room than what we expected and the bed was comfortable. There was even a mini-fridge and microwave to our surprise! The location of this hotel is ideal, as it's almost right in China Town and Little Italy. Lots of good shops as well on Broadway and Wholesome Foods almost right beside it.

The AC was broken - although we were told it was new and installed just the day before we came - and the carpet was moist and wet. This led to an incredible smell and gave us a headache after not even 5 minutes. After complaining we were offered a room in the basement, which was smelling similar bad and is complpetely unacceptable. The room looked more like a prison cell than a hotel room. In the end we were given another room which was acceptable, but it was free only for one night. And given that fact that two rooms offered were not tolerable, we decided to move to antoher hotel after the first night. We did not want to take any risk. The location is nice and the staff was indeed trying to help. But I did get the feeling that they knew all too well that the room (602) had the problems before offering us the \"upgrade\".

By using seven as a euphemism for negative one, the Sham Hotel demonstrates just how \"boutique\" it is: in the most literal sense of the word, they \"appeal to a sophisticated and specialized clientele\" that can afford a dark cell at $300/night and happens to be a subterranean creature. This group is so specialized that only two of them exist: Sonic the Hedgehog and Bilbo Baggins. When we opened the door, we expected it to lead directly into a subway station.

First off, let me say that I travel to New York frequently so I know what to expect when it comes to prices/rooms/etc. I normally stay at the W up near Times Square, but my daughter really wanted to stay in the SoHo area and not a \"chain\" hotel. Since this was my daughter's first time experiencing New York, I thought I'd let her have her way for a night... NEVER again! Let me say, this area is not as hip/fun as this hotel prices it out to be. I paid almost $300 to stay here on a Friday night. Typical NY price so that was not a big deal to me until I saw the room. We were placed in the basement, which we were not told until we got there. The room had one itty bitty window. A window that nobody, not even my very skinny daughter, would be able to get through if a fire broke out in the building. The room itself was also a closet (but most NY rooms are). I immediately went to the desk to complain about the fire hazard, closet room, and price. We waited almost 20 minutes while the desk clerk was on the phone with another VERY unhappy customer. After he was done taking the call, the desk worker said there rooms are first come first serve. I reserved the room WAY in advance so I had a hard time believing that story. What also bothered me is that he offered no solutions whatsoever. The next day we asked for the desk to call us a cab to take us to the Park Central Hotel (way better hotel for the money- we got a room on Sat. night for $200 with a view of Times Square). The desk said he'd call the hotel's driver. This guy was in a car that was unmarked, had no cab meter, and had a huge coke nail. On top of that he drove like a maniac. And I'm not an anti-texter while driving, but when you're going as fast as this guy was driving and texting... it does not make a customer feel safe, but then again neither does the huge coke nail. I know that some people rated this hotel good- they must not have been in the basement (but isn't that a scary risk to take)? Listen to my review when I say it's not worth it. Every time I entered or left this hotel I saw other people complaining at the desk. I would NEVER recommend this hotel/robbery/scam to anyone. Take your money elsewhere.

The \"closet\" space was just a few hangers behind a panel. The worst problem was that both my husband and I ended up with multiple bruises and scrapes on our legs and feet from tripping over the bedframe--because of the smallness of the room and the hard wooden frame all around the bed. We expect the rooms to be small, but not to be consistently writhing in pain over bumping into the bed. The city was noisy at night--which kept my husband up a bit, but I slept really well.

My room was on an upper floor and had a nice view of Houston/Chrystie, and theres always a light humm of traffic (its NY afterall) but it wasnt much of an issue. Plenty of soft towels in the bathroom, which is always nice, especially when you're getting ready in a rush and dont want to miss dinner reservations :) There is a huge Whole Foods Market at Chrystie, perfect for grabbing a bottle of wine (or two :) before heading out to dinner. Gem is close to Soho shopping during the day and E Village bars at night - the location really is perfect for the area and so is the price!~", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGood experience\u201d", "Author": "GojuRyupt", "ReviewID": "UR84782443", "Content": "The first night spent in the room that is in the basement, I asked to move to other room, and so was, the rooms are clean, there is a little street noise but we are in NYC I liked the room taking into account my needs , wi-fi acceptable, near the subway, and food shops, across the street there is a Whole Foods Market is excellent and we can bring food to the room unfortunately my room had no refrigerator.

Issues I ran into that they totally helped with: 1. connecting my iPad to the free wifi (they had an iPad at the front desk so they knew how to use one!) 2. ceiling light went out (they changed it right away) 3. adding on an extra night (allowed me to stay in the room even before payment for the extra night was secured) 4. crazy-loud jackhammering on the street directly outside (apologized sincerely and allowed late check-out so I could sleep in). Loved, loved, loved the location! Be sure to get sweets or the full breakfasts from Sugar Cafe, a couple blocks down on Houston. The room: Liked the design and feel of the room- comfy and clean. Bathroom was spacious, but I may have been in the wheelchair-accesible room. A/C unit worked well. Nice desk space and chair, which I used for hours doing work on my laptop. Great lighting- good range from well-lit to subtle. The bad: I stayed in the worst room in the hotel, room 701-- other reviewers also wrote about the basement (rooms labeled in the 700s). Room 701 is a queen-bed with a window that is at low-street-level (you can see feet walking by) placed directly next to the front door facing Houston St. It feels/sounds like the window is not sealed, or maybe it's the a/c unit, because the street noise is unbelievable loud. The curtains were old and inadequate-- you can see into the room from the street! I had to jerry-rig some towels for privacy. Wifi reception in my room was extremely low to none, but was high-speed with the network cable. Cordless phone didn't work- but who uses that anyway? No fridge.

The drawback on the convenient location is of course the noise from the traffic below...particularly the never-ending ambulance sirens.

Small dislikes: windows are fixed and therefore the only way to get air into the room is to turn the AC on...which i dont favour as it gives me a dry throat every time! The second drawback with this is that the AC is very noisy and rattly. My cousin staying in a separate room to ours had a more modern unit, but same noise issue. Rooms are very small, but i knew this when booking and know that space in Manhattan comes at a premium so got used to it and wasn't too bothered!

Returning at 3pm to check in I was very pleased with my room on the 5th floor (which was quite a good size) close to the junction of Forsyth & East Houston overlooking Sara D Roosevelt Park. I had a few issues in that the bed was bigger than the mattress, so I caught my leg on the corner of the wooden base a couple of times - but quickly learnt my lesson. The bed however, was extremely comfortable and I found that the pillow mist that appeared three days in greatly aided me to get to sleep as the white blinds did little to block out the sunlight when you come in at 4am and are getting to sleep as the sun comes up - the curtains are just for show. The TV didn't pick up a lot of the channels, but you don't come to New York to stay in watching the television - it was just background noise whilst I was getting ready to go out. Other than that, I was very happy - I was only really in the room from 4am to 10am, popping in to get changed in the early evening before going out again - it was comfortable, in a great location and I felt safe, plus I felt my belongings were safe. The staff were extremely helpful - I had some issues with my room card, but was told it was likely because I'd kept them in the same pocket as my mobile phone - moving them solved the issue. I wasn't told what the pebble was for, but I'd read about it on Trip Advisor - so put it on my bed halfway through my 10 night stay and returned to find that my sheets had been changed as requested. I also wasn't made aware of the charges for the safe, they appeared on my credit card statement afterwards, having to contact the hotel to query what they were for - but the rate was very reasonable and I was happy to pay for the service given the peace of mind it gave me. Maybe 'A guide to your stay' card should be added to each room explaining about these. Overall The Gem is a great hotel, the free WiFi was a big plus - it always worked and the speed was excellent, the staff were friendly & helpful and the location made it easy to get to wherever I wanted to go - the subway station is a block down for F & V trains. Perhaps it's a little expensive for what it is, but all hotels in the LES seem to be which I find surprising in comparison to some of the more touristy locations. I'd definitely stay here again though as the nightlife is great - I'd recommend that anyone staying at the Gem also visits the National Underground, it's a great place to be at night and is within easy walking distance to & from the hotel - handy if you've indulged in a few drinks!", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Adequate\u201d", "Author": "Horseymama", "ReviewID": "UR60917381", "Content": "I stayed here over Spring break with my 9 yr. old son.

This is no excuse, get more staff! The next day we asked again and eventually someone came to clean the room, and lets just say, i still wouldnt call it clean! They never vacuumed the room or even mopped the bathroom floor, yet they would leave all the clean towels on the floor. The tv didnt work properly and there was constantly a line going across the top of the screen and a buzzing noise from it. There were no curtains, just a blind, which meant that there was always a draught coming in, the room was freezing at night as the heater they had in the room was very noisy and the heat would blow you away! On our last night, we had very noisy neighbours, walls were like paper! The only good thing i have to say about the hotel was Courtney. He was very helpful and polite and he always tried to do whatever he could, not like the other staff at the hotel.

Hotel is located right on the edge of Soho in a lively part of town, directly above the NY institution, Yonah Schimmel's Knishes, and convenient walking distance to the East Village, Little Italy, and Chinatown. The rooms, hallways and lobby are all quite COMPACT but nicely appointed, and as accommodating as they can be given the tight quarters. Staff were very friendly & helpful, including holding our bags for several hours in the small office. We reserved one room with 2 beds but were reassigned to 2 rooms on the same floor (not adjacent) which worked out fine and ended up being a big bargain (we were charged the single room rate, as is appropriate). Room appointments were lovely & I wish I could have enjoyed the room more - we were out at our event for the bulk of the time. Nice shower, toiletries, coffee, fridge/microwave, and very comfy beds, linens, and bathrobes. Poor sleepers should note that Houston Street is ALWAYS noisy. Bring earplugs. Also, for those traveling by car - and good luck traveling by car in lower Manhattan - there is no parking, but many commercial parking garages around. The staff recommended one east of the hotel, but we found parking on Elizabeth St. just north of Houston and it worked out great. I would happily give 5 stars except for a few modest issues: one room's door did NOT want to latch shut, so we had to use the deadbolt simply to close the door; the same room had a sketchy bathroom light switch; and - worst - we were at first assigned to a room that was already occupied. Big no-no, mitigated by the fact it was occupied by other people attending the same event (but not known to us). No one likes to be getting changed & have a stranger walk into their hotel room!!
