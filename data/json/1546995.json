I must say as the days have progressed, it's become from bad to worse. Where should I start from? Let's start from the very beginning, the rooms are small but are not that bad for a single person. However, one must really be careful while walking in the rooms, more often than not you will bang your feet against the furniture for sure, happened to me countless number of times, specially when you wake up in the morning and moving towards the bathroom! Funny but true. So be careful The breakfast! Oh god, this is truly bizarre, more than 600-700 people in an area with maximum of 100-150 seating, felt like fox river (refer to prison break). So many times it has happened to me when I (after a struggle, eventually find a place to sit) and after eating I go for a refill, by the time I come back someone else has taken my table and usually ends up in an unnecessary argument. My point is why is the breakfast done in an area which can hold a max of 100-200 people, when at full occupancy the hotel can be occupied by more than 1000+ people. Absurd is the right word to use. Then we move to the receptionists, poor guests who have to face receptionists having such huge egos, who don't even know the meaning of S in service, one name that I remember is of a lady called daisy. I am sure everyone has certain issues in life, but at work they should never surface and specially not towards the customers. Well, I was unlucky as I am sure this was the reason for an argument with her, totally uncalled for, when she actually called me ( cant recall the name, which was her husbands!!) by her husbands name, which I later asked her about. And I had gone to her asking for a change of 200 dirhams, ideally 2 fiftys and a 100 note. Well the response I got was an egoistic and arrogant one. \"Sir, we are sorry but we can't give out change at all (followed by her husbands name) in the most arrogant and haughty manner, first she said its not allowed (even palm jumeirah staff doesn't have the guts to say that to the customer) pathetic, then she said, I don't have and eventually I had to speak to the manager in charge to get some change. This is just one of the many instances I had trouble with the receptionists. The fundamental problem with hotels like citymax hotel bur Dubai is the fact that they think that the people living in the hotel are cheap, uneducated and just living on the edge as far as they are concerned. They show the least respect to customers, their service is as poor as any cheap 1 star hotel back in India. The only way to improve things is to give proper training to their staff and make them respect the customers, greet them warmly and genuinely help their guests. Now, coming to the biggest disappointment of my stay (which is still in progress btw) is \"huddles sports bar\". What is so funny about the name is that they actually call it a sports bar without evening understanding what a sports bar means. Sports bars are meant to have multiple screens showing variety of sports or maybe the major sporting events WITH COMMENTARY of course. But here, oh god, there is juke machine and a live band playing while an intense match between United and Chelsea is going on, India and Pakistan is going on etc...just pointless. I mean how can someone overlook such important factors. When I asked the manager whose from Kashmir, India (can't recall the name as I don't care) he responds in the most inappropriate manner and says to me if I have any concerns I should not talk to him, but the marketing team of citymax. What an idiotic response, i shall never forget it, this is the level of their so called managers, instead of noting it as a suggestion they ask us to go to the marketing team of the sports bar and urge them to put some commentary. This portrays his attitude towards his work and his respect and understanding of the company values ( if any). I just want to end this long review by saying that if this is how they treat their guests, it's disgusting to say the least, I feel angry and I don't understand why customer service isn't in their agenda at all. I can understand its a budget hotel but come on there has to be a line drawn beyond which they cannot afford to fall. They must properly train their staff, bloody manners are the bare minimum. But amongst the ill mannered staff there are genuinely nice and cheerful people, like Mr. Balouch and Mr. Khan, they are the duty managers if I am not mistaken, however, their subordinates are just their opposites. Certain room service staff is also nice and friendly, as well as the cleaners. But the overall experience has been a forgetful one... I strongly disrecommend this hotel if you are looking for average service also. Still stuck here in what I presume is the 100 star hotel (as per their outlook) which in all fairness is less than a 2 star hotel.

Did not have time to write earlier. The manager (not the one responding here) will recognize me. He, among others, was unfailingly responsive. Overall, the room is clean and comfortable - slightly smaller rooms but this is not a resort, so fine. Yes, the engineering guys are clueless and in a hurry to get the job done. But in the end, the accommodations matched up with good 3 or 4 star places. It is a new property and is being kept well. Breakfast is fine. Earlier complaints I had read did not hold true. Always a bit of variation and catered to Western and Asian tastes. The gym is airy, adequate and clean. The pool seemed fine - did not use it. (I did inform (not complain) the manager that the staff at breakfast were surprisingly sullen, and not welcoming at the entry podium - not a cool thing early in the morning. That was the one aspect that never quite improved.) Very convenient - can reach all parts of Dubai efficiently. Great grocery options - Spinneys for example - within a 10 minute walk.

Brakfast was ok, but often fruit and youghurt was finished (beacuse of some who took a whole plate full of one item). The biggest problem was the huge (approx 90%) amount of russians, they pollute the poolwater when they do not get a shower before swimming at any time. We even saw some who was actually washing themself in the pool (after a sweaty day on town?), disgusting. So please Citymax, make BIG signs for the russians and make the poolboy check they are followed. Otherwise the poolboy was very helpful and the poolarea ok, though it could be bigger with more chairs.

I stayed here for 7 nights, first two nights were not that comfortable as their was some noise from the Restaurant & bar located on the ground floor. We requested to change the room on the first night itself but were told that hotel is fully booked and they cannot fulfill our request. But after some more talk with the manager we got the room on the 7th floor facing the Standard Chartered Bank, which in-turn was quite comfortable than the 2nd floor. The rooms are quite clean but are quite small in size, the beds were quite comfortable but again the bathroom size was small. One thing different on 7th floor rooms was the bath tub availability in the bathroom which was not their on 2nd. The room is equipped with a 32\" LCD which shows just a few English and Hindi channels, a small refrigerator, tea and coffee refreshments. The top floor of the hotel (8th floor) has small pool which can be used from 6 AM till the evening. Coming to the breakfast buffet (inclusive in room rent), the menu consist of regular continental food while including a single Indian dish. We did find the food of a good quality and the service of restaurant staff to be quick. But since the hotel was mostly occupied we did had to search and even wait for table to be free, but can't entirely blame the hotel for this as fully booked hotel during DSF time will have its consequences. For people looking for Indian food, the hotel is ideally located at a walkable distance near Kamat (Veg) / Gazebo (Non veg) restaurants, to locate these restaurants after exiting Citymax hotel turn right and cross the traffic signal, head straight and u will find them on your right. Also, if you take right from the above mentioned traffic signal you will find Mc Donalds, Pizza Hut in few meters. For outdoor, the hotel is located near the area Bur Dubai creek area and the Meena Bazaar, the walk to these will take approx 20 mins, creek area is good for stroll in the evening while featuring the DSF celebrations. Also one can take Abra (boat) from the creek for a visit to Diera which has the famous Gold Souk. For visit to other parts of Dubai one can take taxi (which can be expensive) from outside hotel or can walk to Al Karma metro station which is at 15-20 mins walk able distance.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel With poor food!!\u201d", "Author": "Tatanasov", "ReviewID": "UR123724807", "Content": "The worst breakfast I ever eat,every day is the same,no variety of food.No wifi internet,if you like to use they charge 20 dhm per hour,if you want to make a phone call in dubai city charge you 5 dhms with no to give you any receipts!!!

Overall this hotel offers gr8 price, comfort & staff and anybody staying or lookin for a budget or good situated accomodation should consider this property first..We will return and lastly thank Leizel for her time to listen to us and may her career with Citymax move forward as she showed us as guests that we are important for the hotel to make changes & move forward.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Karachi", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ShahbaazMithani", "ReviewID": "UR122221223", "Content": "I went to Dubai with family for vacation.

A little more variety in the breakfast would be an advantage and serving real coffee, not Nescafe would go down well.

Although requires a cab every time you need to step out (nearest metro station is Sheikh Rashid Bin Khalid and Deira - Costs Dh10), it's centrally located. Most of the destinations are short hops if the traffic allows. Check-in is slower than most but you can't complain. Depends upon the number of people in front of you in the queue (yes, I have seen queues of tourists waiting to check-in). The hotel is huge with at least 600 rooms (as per my estimate.. Didn't count though). Rooms are small as per the industry standards but I stayed in a single room. However, the bed size was as good as a double bed that you may find in most of the hotels. Comfort levels are pretty high. No noise, no disturbances. The bed was amazingly comfortable and provided excellent sleep quality. Breakfast, although has a big menu, is usually the same everyday and same goes with the dinner buffet with one or two dishes changed here and there. But you can't complain. Food quality is good. The hotel also has a Sports bar & grill and a Chinese restaurant with again an excellent menu and food quality. The prices are set to be at a reasonable level and won't hurt your pocket too much. Didn't check out their Indian restaurant. Has a reasonable gym with a few treadmills and some other equipment and a small pool on the roof. Most amazing thing? They have a fast and reliable Internet connection in the rooms available for free for the hotel guests. The only thing that bugged me about it was it was an Ethernet connection and I have a Macbook Air. There was no free Wi-Fi. Had to trudge down to a Virgin store to buy myself an adapter. All in all, a pretty reasonable hotel worth staying in. Try and ignore the downsides which are really very few.

But I've got out my notes now and thought it worth writing something about the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at approx 14h00 after checking out of the Golden Sands Apartments and taking a taxi to Citymax Bur Dubai. Patrick at security assisted us with our luggage - smiling and helpful. On checking in, the person handling the check-in, despite me giving my details of the reservation, called up the reservation and advised me of the costs. They didn't check to see that this was already pre-paid accommodation that was done through a Tour operator, until I advised them of this. We then asked if someone could assist us in taking the luggage to the room but we were told that they cannot do this and we should make use of the trolleys (much like the ones at shopping malls!). This is the first time that I had see shopping trolleys at a hotel to take luggage to ones room! Patrick was the one that assisted us in taking the luggage to the room. Since the hotel is a fairly new hotel having opened not long before our arrive, the rooms were still new and linen etc in perfect condition and for the price that we paid - well worth it. There were no towels in the room, but after having phoned reception for some, they immediately had some sent up. We then set out for the day. On returning from our shopping expedition, we walked around in circles trying to find the hotel. Since its a new hotel, not too many people are aware of its location. Positive features - still a new hotel so decor etc is all still intact. Comfortable rooms but no more than 2 adults can be accommodated in the rooms. Rooms have satellite channels - quite a good variety. Breakfast was good and overall layout of the hotel is quite comfortable. Negative aspects - reception did not check that the reservation was already paid and I could have well ended up paying twice. They also did not give us messages that we received from my brother-in-law. Would hate to think that if it was something urgent what would have happenned. It was only when we called home, that we were told that he had left at least 3 messages with reception for us.
