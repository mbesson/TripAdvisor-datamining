{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Unsatisfied services It was a terrible experience during my stay with my wife in this hotel recently.The first thing which turn us off is-- we found the drank half-full bottles and other left over still remained in the mini-fridge once we checked into the room. The next horrible thing is-- there isn't any towels provided in the rooms! Eventually, the receptionist just gave us a shabby towel (instead of 2! ) and explained that there was no more towels right at the moment. The next moment we stepped into the shower area, to our surprise-- the soup dish holder was covered with dirt ! We stayed in this hotel for 3 days and no room cleaning provided even once and yet blackout happened in the middle of the nite while the surrounding buildings are still lit. We had decided not to return to bali again thanks to this terrible experience.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR708415413", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "x-dimensions"}, {"Content": "Maintenance required Booked and stayed here four nights as result of reading reviews below. Airport pickup (we arrived midnight and got out of customs around 1am) was waiting for us but not obvious as there were heaps of other drivers waiting with signs. Room and bed were large though the mattress was not innerspring which bothered my partner a bit. Rooms kind of dark and no bright lights for reading. Airconditioning worked. Private little balcony nice. Bathroom near new and clean but shower tap kept falling off and you have to wait a lonnnnnnnng time for hot water to come through. Smelt like recycled water in loo? Many cracked and brocken tiles on reception floor and around pool. Dangerous and sharp, beware of bare feet. Pool lounges kinda old and weathered but generally servicable. Really sad management dont keep up with maintenance on this important area. Pool itself beautiful for swimming. Breakfast supplied was ok but toast is more like dried bits of white bread with crusts removed. Tea barely drinkable, bring your own if you want good tea, but it could be the water? Location of hotel right in Kuta with all the sounds and smells. Good pool hall across lane and heaps of bars and restaurants really close. Heaps shops close if you like that sort of thing but you do have to walk past the insistent please to purchase everytime you walk down lane to beach. Hotel staff friendly and polite. You have to ask for toilet paper and towels. Sometimes clean towels not available till late in day, some scungy looking grey things. Ok for the price but broken tiles around pool real disappointment and dangerous.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR101875850", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "FlipperTasmania"}, {"Content": "rooms were nice, but don't book via indo.com!! I read all these statements here below and decided to stay in the fat yogi as well. To get picked up from the airport in the middle of the night was a good point, but unfortunately nobody came despite it was mentioned on my booking confirmation. so I had to take a cap and the reception told be I should contact indo.com (I booked the room via this webside). Nevertheless, the room was great, pretty new, the breakfast good and the pool area really relaxing. Would come back, but not book via indo.com next time.", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR814818831", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Cathy07"}, {"Content": "Brilliant Stay       Hotel Room", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR176052982", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Wrinkles30"}, {"Content": "Fantastic!! Fat yogi's is a fantastic place to stay in Kuta, particularly if you are looking for value for money. The location is very good, just off poppies 1 (one of the main roads in Kuta) and approx 5 mins walk to the beach. If the beach is not for you then you can spend the day lazing by the pool.We stayed for 3 nights in August 2007 and we were amazed that the price per night for our stay was just \u62e210, including breakfast!!!! (delivered to your room if you ring up!)The rooms are very clean and of an excellent standard considering the price, the bed was a very comfortable king size and the bathroom was very large and always had hot water!! The only way this accommodation could be made better is if they put a TV and fridge in the room, but then that might push the price up to \u62e212 a night!! I would strongly recommend anyone staying in Kuta on a budget to stay here.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR871044384", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Wolfman08"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay Great Place...I've stayed there many times....very affordable...with a pool...nice staff....this is one of the best values in Kuta...Inexpensive rooms for backpackers too...", "Date": "Sep 16, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR713983120", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d308782-r17909286-Fat_Yogi_Cottages-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "308782", "Price": "$28"}}
