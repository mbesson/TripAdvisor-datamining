The reason I gave the hotel only an average rating was because of the parking situation and the front desk staff response to it. Charge for parking is $20/day. As we were taking our car out of the garage to do some siteseeing we noticed that most of the parking spots were filled. We asked an employee what would happen if there were no available spaces when we returned. He said they would take our keys and double park our car. When we returned, the gates to the garage were closed. I went into the front desk and asked what we should do. He told me I could park in a lot 9 blocks away or since it was Friday, wait an hour until 6:00 pm and meter parking on the street would be free until Monday morning. I told him I was told they would take my keys and double park and he said there was no room. His attitude was it was my problem and he could care less. When I said I paid $20 to park he punched some keys on the computer and said he removed the fee. No apology, no sympathy, only kept saying I could park 9 blocks away or on the street.

Share it! I recently booked a flight and stay through Expedia wit a Airline ticket for Delta & Hotel in New Orleans from Portland Oregon for April 12th and would leave @ 5 for my flight back home to Oregon. This was a once in a life time event for me to see my daughters Jazz Band from Independence Oregon perform at the Jazz festival in the French Quarter. When I arrived I asked to have a wake up call at 5am Sunday morning to catch a 7am flight home. Friday night I stepped on a staple and cut my big toe see picture of staple and blood. From 1 till 3:30 in the morning (the 14th) it sounded like someone was dragging a large metal garbage receptacle through the parking lot under my room. I them realized the PLUS in BESTWESTERN French Quarter didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean anything at all! I thought when I booked it and saw the hotel it would be a quite in, NOT! Fist thing Friday night I step on a staple in the carpet @ Hotel. From 2 till 4 in the morning it sounded like a giant metal garbage bin was being dragged across the down stairs parking lot. At 5:10 in the morning of the 14th three big burly and scary looking men came right into my room. I started screaming at them hoping I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being robbed or something! They told me to shut up and be still! They finally turned on the light and realized they were in the wrong room! The next morning I made my complaint about the noise, my foot and the men in my room. The lady MGR had no empathy at all, I was disgusted with her reply. Saturday I was totally beat all day after the ordeal of the three men. I still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep thinking about it. I was able to see daughter perform, but when see asked me to dinner I could only stay for a short time and was feeling sick to my stomach and did not enjoy our dinner together. I slept like a log Saturday night. @ 5 am I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive any wake up call! I woke up @ 5 minutes till 7 and missed my flight had to run out and catch a cab to air port! No shower no food! So I had to go on 2 hours stand by from New Orleans to Atlanta, then 5 hours stand by to Oregon. Very bad vacation, worst I have ever had! I finally arrived in Oregon around 7:30 8ish. When I arrived I had no Baggage another problem! Did not get bag until the next night. After many days working with Expedia, I have decided to never use them again. I had to call them and be on the phone while they called the MGR and made me stay on the phone, in order to get my room refund of $529 for 2 nights there. I found out later the going rate was $150 a nite, so I was also WAY OVER charged for the room. Still waiting to get my whole trip refunded.

I like fresh air, especially when sleeping, and their appeared to be no way to just run the fan on the A/C unit--you had to have heat or cold. In October, you need neither in New Orleans.

If you stay at this hotel, be prepared to walk and walk to everything. Bourbon Street is three blocks and down by the river is over six blocks. Because of the heat and humidity, we ended up taking a cab to many locations. The mule carriage ride by Jackson Square is lovely (they don't use horses because of the high heat and humidity); you must try Cafe du Monde, but forget trying to get in at breakfast, the line is two blocks long. We went in the afternoon. For jazz, try Snug Harbor, the Spotted Cat or Apple Barrel. Before booking a hotel, I would definitely suggest mapping out what places you are wanting to see and then select your hotel accordingly...do you want a pool, a restaurant with your hotel, etc. The Natchez jazz lunch cruise is nice, as well as Cajun Tours Honey Island swamp tour. The area of this hotel is safe, we walked late at night and felt perfectly safe. This whole area of the French Quarter is active into the early morning hours, some bars are open 24/7. The street musicians are totally delightful and are very courteous about having their picture taken, but please remember to tip them. The French Market is like a giant outdoor flea market, but worthwhile to see. If you don't like heat and humidity, go earlier in the year and check the weather there prior.

There is a small store around the back right of the hotel that has soda, beer, snacks, etc. so that was convenient. So why did we stay there? It was free for us.

The room we got (a double double #331) is the worst room I've ever stayed in in an American hotel! The paint was peeling, the door had to be lifted to fit into the door frame, the bathroom was tiny and dingy. My sister checked in a day later and got a room FOR THE SAME RATE in the new section. The quality of the room was a world apart from our room. If you stay at this BW, make sure to insist on the new section and try to get a room away from the street which is really noisy. Also, the hotel didn't have a bar - they were awaiting their post-Katrina license.
