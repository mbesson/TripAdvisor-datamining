I must admit we had high expectations of this leg of our trip, being Hollywood after all! Unfortunately, we soon realised that Hollywood Blvd is not all we hoped. We found it to be quite dirty, seedy and definitely did not feel safe walking around late at night. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the heart of Hollywood so it is easy to see the famous sites. We arrived the day before the Oscars so the street was mostly blocked off but it was good to see everything set up and we walked along the red carpet at Kodak theatre (no celebrity spotting, sadly!) We hired a car which was great because we could venture out of the city along the coast and we spent a day at Malibu, Universal studios, Warner Bros studios (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!) and Six Flags theme park. There is also a great shopping centre close by called The Grove which has lots of nice restaurants. Back to the hotel, we found it a bit challenging to drive out of the carpark as North Highland avenue is extremely busy all the time. There is a small supermarket/liquor store and pizza restaurant across the road which came in handy. The breakfast at the hotel is very nice and the staff are helpful. Our room was average, overlooking the dreary streets of LA. I think we were just disappointed overall because we hoped Hollywood would be nicer, but in terms of the hotel itself and the location, we would recommend to anybody keen to visit LA. I think given the little time we actually spent in Hollywood, if we returned we would stay elsewhere further out. I highly recommend hiring a car to get around. The Blvd is bustling with action, characters and tourists but not nearly as \"glitzy\" and \"glamourous\" as I expected!", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cLocation is good!\u201d", "Author": "-saiyan-", "ReviewID": "UR127506395", "Content": "Stayed for a short 2 nights, Location was great, within walking distance to the heart of LA.

The location was good for car access to Beverly Hills, Wilshire Blvd, Pasadena, Griffith Park, Santa Monica Mts and to Burbank airport. Breakfast bar was excellent - included yogurt, variety of breads and pastry, scrambled eggs, gravy and either bacon or sausage. Our last day, they unveiled a new pancake machine which was pretty cool and actually made ok pancakes. Disappointed they didn't have more fresh fruit, since so much is grown in the region, but... Our room was comfortable and relatively quiet, but the toilet leaked and we had to shut it off at night, as maintenance was never dispatched to fix it during the day (despite our notification) - also had annoying little problems with bathroom lights not always turning on and with a noisy but useless bathroom fan. Parking was by valet and was efficient. Desk staff were friendly. The hotel is inconvenient to access by car if heading north on Highland. We had to drive into the residential area north of the hotel, do a U-turn and return southbound on Highland in order to enter.

I felt safe walking with my family to and from the hotel, even at night. One day I went for an early morning run along Hollywood Blvd alone and while there weren't many people out and the street sure looks different without the tourists, I felt safe. The bad news is that you do have to pay for location. We stay at this chain fairly often and we paid almost 3 times what we paid for similar quality hotels in Ca and other places to stay here. Plus, parking was $20/day + tips for the valet. So we found the hotel expensive for what you got but not when compared to this area, just when compared to other places.

I had been on tours of the area before but never stayed over night. The area is renown for homelessness and prostitution. I was travelling with my husband, 3 children and their grandmother. I wanted somewhere central so we didn't have to spend a fortune on tours/travelling to 'where the action is'. Also travelling with small children, it's very hard to predetermine if they will be able to adventure out of the hotel on any given day. Thankfully, this was the perfect location for us! Being a group of 6, we had to book two rooms at previous stops (which was very expensive) but we were all able to stay in the one room at this hotel. It was spacious and really nice. During our trip we stayed at 4 different hotels and this was everyone's favorite. Internet access was great, breakfast was fine (USA food is not my favorite), there is a pool and gym facility (and they give you additional towels which is something little but helpful). Security into the hotel was good, staff very helpful, the hotel smelt really nice which is good because there are some not so nice smelling areas in the neighbourhood. Originally, I was a little concerned that I wouldn't feel safe with the kids being in the centre of the action. But I felt 100% comfortable and 100% happy with this hotel, the location and the service they provided. The hotel is close enough to be 'in the action' but away enough to stay out of the 'dodgy areas'. I found the hotel very family friendly but if I was traveling alone or with a partner, it would also be great. Because the hotel is so close to everything including Kodak Theatre, Walk of Fame, Wax Museum, Universal Studios etc, I was able to save money on shuttle's/ tours to these places. Because of the convenient location, I was also able to buy a bulk discounted theme park ticket and get cheaper admission to the other theme parks including Universal Studios. Often when you purchase theme park tickets they include the shuttle which is generally a couple of hundred dollars more. Because we could catch the train to Universal and buy the discounted entry, I saved around $600. I think people need to remember when staying in an area such as this, there will be homelessness, prostitution and dodgyness but that's the adventure! I highly recommend this hotel. They do a great job with what they have to work with.

My friends were in the room next to us and heard none of that,,so DO NOT stay in room 307 ! BTW,,earplugs solved the noise polution. Nice looking pool,,but we weren't there to swim.

The lady (an I so wish I could remember her name) is an asbolute sweetheart and works her butt off every day to keep the food stocked, the place clean and orderly and everyone who comes through there as happy as can be. She deserves major kudos :-) Overall the hotel is very nice, the rooms are excellent, clean and spacious. It's a great value for the money and I highly recommend it if you are looking to stay in the Hollywood and Hollywood Walk of Fame area.

The location is great with walking distance to Hollywood Highland Ave metro station which is a direct metro ride (red line) from Union station. The hotel is very clean and the staff is excellent in maintaining the hotel. There is a microwave in the lobby of you want to reheat your pizza or other food. Room has coffee maker which I personally don't like - I'm a fan of the good old electric kettle. I enjoyed the breakfast as they served various types of healthy oatmeal (incl. plain) along with standard stuff like brown/white bread, cinnamon buns, scrambled eggs, juices, tea, coffee, yoghurts, milk, pancakes, some meat stuff etc. The breakfast area is not very large - so it could get full pretty quickly. It was not a problem for us as we would get very up very early at 6 and crave for food (time difference) :-). The staff is very helpful with directions. Hollywood walk of fame (kodak theatre, chinese grauman etc.) is to your right when you come out of the hotel and hollywood bowl is to your left (easily walkable). Lots of eating points inside Hollywood and Highland mall - it is a very touristy area. So be prepared to get bombarded with people looked to sell you stuff. We just ignored them. You will also find a grocery next to HollyWood and Highland mall and other eating points nearby. The hotel is a bit pricey but I guess it was worth it as the other hotels next to this hotel did not look very attractive from the outside. If you are coming from the airport, just book a super shuttle in advance (32 dollars for two people) to take you to the hotel. Alternatively, you can take the flyaway bus to Union station and then it is a red line metro to Hollywood and Highland AVe station followed by a short walk to the hotel. Los Angeles is a huge spread out city - a bit tasteless for some people. So staying at this hotel provides easy access to Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Amoeba Music, Highland center, Kodak theatre and Sunset Strip. Rest is far far away. If you are looking to go to Santa Monica or Venice beach - you need to take the 60-90 min bus (733) from Union Station. Be sure not to take this bus in peak time (5-6:30 PM) as it is crammed with people and they don't speak English very well (esp. in Venice). The bus stop is \"Main and Grand\" for Venice beach. I would not advise staying at Venice beach after dark but it is a great beach (better than Santa Monica). Do take a jumper with you as it can get cold at the beach. The hotel can arrange LA tours - a bit boring but that's the best way to see LA in a short space of time. For me - the best attraction in LA was probably the farmer's market - I found the others bland and tasteless.

The Jimmy Kimmel Theater is right across Hollywood Blvd. as well and since they tape around 5 pm you can watch them tape outside if they are doing any of the crazy stuff they sometimes do.

The hotel was standard HIE fare, which I consider to be a good thing. Clean, nice, well appointed rooms. With the curtains drawn you wouldn't know if you were in a HIE in Hollywood or Texas....but as their old add said the best surprise is no surprise. Outside though was what was different. Around the pools, the parking garage and different places were painted with huge murals. The whole place had a very nice feel and was very nicely appointed.

Juice and coffee tea were available as were (curiously) hard boiled eggs, which I enjoyed. More fruit would have been nice - just banana was offered, although you could have as many as you like. The breakfast area was often packed, and sometimes spilled out into the pool area. The hotel was quite full when we were there (we saw staff having to turn people away), which explains a packed breakfast room. Pool was available - nothing flash, but nice to take a dip at the end of a hot day (music was a bit loud though). The hotel is in Highland Avenue which is a bit scruffy, but very close (5-10 minute walk) to the Hollywood attractions and all the bus tours. also you could jump on a metro bus there to Santa Monica (actually two buses at $1.50 each - 25c for seniors - so $6 for a round trip - about 45 minutes each way).

Breakfast is included and is the standard buffet, but does include a pancake maker that shoots out a cooked pancake in 45 seconds or thereabouts.

The air conditioning was a unit built into the front of the building and although a bit noisy it was efficient. Our room faced the main road and on a Saturday night /Sunday morning the noise from traffic was minimal despite thousands of people leaving the Bowl. Our main reason for choosing the hotel was its proximity to the Hollywood Bowl. Reviews had told us it was at most a 15 min walk and they were correct.

The hotel smelled great throughout the property. The housekeeping staff should be recognized for their efforts. - Breakfast - comes with the room reservation.

Tables limited around 9am. - Outdoor Pool - A bit small, but nice to have it around to take a quick dip in. Our kids had a great time enjoying it. - Amazingly fast Check-in / Check Out process Cons: - Most amenities (laundry, pool, etc) not available for use after 8pm. The hours should extend to 10 or 11pm. - The Guest Laundry Room is not sufficient - there is only 1 set of machines for the entire hotel. I wasted up to 3 hours of my vacation time waiting for the machines to be available. Also, I had to purchase our laundry supplies - at other hotels, the laundry supplies are complimentary. The dryer took forever to dry clothes which exacerbated the wait time. - The complimentary WiFi / Internet was way too slow. Another hotel guest echoed my frustration with the performance in the business center, also my husband didn't bother using his laptop since the WiFi was so slow. - The front desk staff didn't not mention any further benefits that we could be eligible for since we are Priority Rewards members. We could have used the extended checkout. Also, the front desk didn't seem interested that we were staying and didn't suggest any dining or touring/attractions to visit. I usually get recommendations from the front desk when they ask if we were there for a leisure trip. Also, it would help if the parking was free for hotel guests. - It was also very difficult by car to enter and exit the hotel on highland avenue. There should be a way for guests to be able to enter the hotel directly instead of turning up side roads to get in. This was very stressful and unnerving during our stay.

During our stay we travelled to Disneyland, Universal, Warner Brothers, the beaches, Griffith Park, Dodgers baseball etc. and The Holiday Inn is ideally located for all these places, with good access to the freeway. We felt safe at this hotel and one night when we came home late, felt reassured to see a guy in reception who just guarded the hotel. Breakfast was adequate. There was a good choice of cereal, pastries, cooked food and pancakes to cater for all tastes. However, the room breakfast is served in doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cater for the sheer volume of guests. Unless you get to breakfast ridiculously early, or late, you are often left waiting for a table to be free. The room was constantly crowded and made for breakfast to be quite stressful. It was nice to have a pool at this hotel, although as it was in the middle of the hotel building, there was a lot of shade and it was difficult to lie in the sun. Every time we went out there, usually late afternoon, people were lying on the loungers in the sun, so we were stuck in the shade. Still, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really come to Hollywood to sunbathe. Towards the middle of our stay we had a problem with ants in the room. We suddenly saw lots of ants walking from near the window down towards the table. We mentioned this at reception and the person behind the desk was very apologetic and said there would be someone up that day to solve the problem. The volume of ants had decreased but there were still ants by the end of our stay. Some had even made their way to the bathroom and bedside cabinets. Not nice! However, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this put you off as I am sure this is a one off as other people haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mentioned it in reviews. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and if we ever returned to Hollywood, we would happily stay here again.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cSecond Time as good as the first!\u201d", "Author": "sford87", "ReviewID": "UR117462829", "Content": "This was the second time I had stayed at this hotel.

It was a very nice hotel, in a great location for walking to the Hollywood Bowl and other nearby attractions, ie Walk of Fame, Hollywood and Highland etc... The room wasn't ready upon checkin, but was a few hours later, it was a very nice two queen bed room, room 504. The rate wasn't bad, as I had the AAA rate. The room was very clean with standard amenities, it also had a nice flat screen TV, comfortable chair for sitting, and a nice work area desk. The one room downfall was the wireless internet, though free, the connection was extremely slow and horrible. The desk clerk said it was because of everyone getting on it, I don't think everyone in all the rooms was getting on at exactly the same time. The hotel has a very friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast was very good, with a great variety of food, pancakes, sausage, bacon, cereal, danishes, coffee, juice, milk, better than most free breakfasts at similar hotels. I can't comment on the fitness center, or pool, as I didn't use either. I did walk out by the pool and it looked like a calm area, and was clean. The business center is free to use, and the internet is wired and way better than what's in the rooms. There's also a small store next to the front desk, that sells drinks, candy bars, chips etc... and also has a microwave for guest use. Like I said, the area is good for walking to many nearby attractions. I highly recommend seeing a show at the Hollywood Bowl, as it's an amazing venue---but bring your own food and drink in, and don't park there! It's a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There's some restaurants close by, and others within walking distance up and around Hollywood Blvd. I did notice one thing about the hotel, if you're on floors 6-8, you have to take two elevators to get to your room. You go to the 5th floor from the lobby, then from there take a second elevator. It seems a little inconvenient if you're staying on one of those floors.

The driver- i don't remember his name (I think it was Daniel) was really great!! He was on time to pick us up from both the hotel and disneyland and didn't complain at all, even when he had to come at 1am to pick us up from Disneyland. Similarly, because we had 5 people in our group, the people at reception recommended a private driver to get to the airport, which was a faster way to get to the airport and cheaper too, because the shuttle's charged per head.

The bed was great and had a duvet vs a bedspread which thankfully most hotels are getting rid of. The AC, Internet and TV all worked well. The bathroom was spotless and there were lots of really good towels. Because I was at the back of the hotel it was extremely quiet. The hotel was full but I hardly saw anyone.

Unsurprisingly therefore the room was very dark. The television was old and when you turned it on was automatically on volume 99 out of 100 everytime, the signal was also pretty poor. The fridge was so loud I had to take the plug out of it, not that it was problem as there was nothing in it anyway! Luckily though the room was fairly clean, it all seemed a bit old and outdated though. The keys to the room had not been activated after we had checked in so we had to go back down to reception from the sixth floor, which takes a while in itself as you have to take one lift then walk through the corridors round to the other side of the hotel and get another lift down. In the morning we asked reception to book us a taxi, they asked if we wanted a yellow taxi or a limo service, we replied a yellow taxi presuming that was the normal LA taxi. Then a Black 4x4 pulled up and the Valet said this was our taxi, we questioned them saying we had asked for a yellow taxi and they replied yes this is it, so having only been in LA a few hours we took what they said and got in. As we thought it turned out to be a Limo service and cost us $25 where the same journey on the way back cost us $13. The driver also explained to us that he was in partnership with the hotel. What a coincidence... All in all a pretty awful stay at a hotel I was thinking would have been one of the safest options of knowing what you were going to get in Hollywood.

The front staff was just amazing every single one of them and the manager was so helpful....The only down side was the pool was very cold and did not feel heated we only realy used it on one day that was 98\" outside. We took a cab or a flat rate driver which seemed to be not so bad on several occations to Target yaah Beverly Centre Mall and the Staple Centre and we also went to Santa Monica Peer this was about $50 US we went for the day. I was a single mother with two teens and this was a safe and perfect place to stay. The breakfast buffet is a must we went every morning. I can not say enough how amazing the staff were from the housekeeping to the guy who aranged our cabs and rides.

We had stayed downtown five years earlier and had unfortunately come away not enjoying our stay at all. This time we spent three days in town after a Mexican Riviera cruise. We chose this hotel after a fair bit of research, due mainly to it's location closer to all the tourist hotspots, local eateries and it's included breakfast. We were not disappointed this time!! The position was almost perfect and we were able to walk to many of the sightseeing spots or the departure points for the tour buses. Even later at night, we didn't feel unsafe walking back to the Hotel or over to the nearby convenience store or food outlets. The included breakfast was a pleasant surprise.. hot food, toasts, bagels, fruit, juices and pastries -plenty to get you started on your busy day ahead! The lady who staffed this breakfast area was always very friendly and kept the food well stocked no matter what time you come down. The free use of the internet area was also much appreciated to enable you to do last minute sightseeing research or catching up with news from home. The room we had booked included a little kitchenette, a spacious bathroom and a king size bed...all modern & tastefully decorated and quite comfortable. Even though the hotel is on a busy road, there is very little street noise and sleeping was never a problem for either of us. The staff were friendly on check-in, helpful with directions and willingly allowed us to store ( quite a lot of) luggage on the day of check-out due to our late flight home. This Hotel proved to me that position is very important. Our previous stay had been tainted by the poor position of our accomodation - not accessible to sightseeing, restaurants & overall a less safe neighbourhood. Of course, it is also nice to have some of the comforts of home and helpful staff around you.... all of these were found in this Hotel!", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livermore, Ca", "Title": "\u201cGood location-comfortable rooms\u201d", "Author": "mamadino", "ReviewID": "UR103396707", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel one night on our way to Disneyland.

Well I can only say that it was a fantastic find and unfortunately for possible future visits is sure to become very popular and therefore busy. Oh well.... it deserves a great review anyway. The location is only the shortest of strolls from the main tourist street of Hollywood and the train station. The staff were friendly and the place was wonderfully clean and seemed well maintained. Street noise was no issue nor activity in the adjoining carparks. Taxis had no trouble arriving quickly or coping with the busy road. A good range of food and eatery choices close by if you explore a little. Until we actually experienced it ourselves, I now know why so many compliment the happy friendliest woman who runs the breakfast room. Goodness me, one morning the place was chaos, full house and everyone wanting to eat at the same time, she didn't miss a beat; coped, smiled, helped...happy...what an advertisement for the friendly face of Holiday Inn!! Hollywood is a bit overated and you can do it in a couple of half days, but this location I now consider is the ideal base to use for a full tourist stay in LA.

At first we experienced a problem with our A/C unit. The guy came up and checked it, filled it with water and it started working again. 10 minutes later, it quit working again. I called the front desk to see if we could move but the hotel was sold out so we had to stay where we were. The temperature in the room wasn't a problem because it wasn't hot outside...all we really needed was a way to move the air around in the room so it worked out fine. Someone came up the next day to fix it and after that we didn't have any issues. The hotel is on a very busy street. I was afraid the traffic noises outside would keep me awake as I am a very light sleeper (hence the need to have the A/C unit operating correctly...to drown out the traffic noise) but I slept fine You can hear the ambulances, trucks and horns but other than that, you can't hear much traffic noise. In fact, the second night I slept like a baby. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location. You aren't smack dab on Hollywood Blvd...which would be VERY loud. Its one block North...just a hair away from all the commotion of downtown Hollywood...but just a short walk away from it all. If you have a car, the man that works in the garage will park it for you when you arrive and bring it around for you each morning. It costs $20 a day to park there but its worth it. The best thing about the hotel is the breakfast and the wonderful woman named Marietta that runs the breakfast buffet. She was there each morning with a smile on her face. She had that place running like a well oiled machine. The eggs, bisuits, bacon or cereal never got below half full and the tables were never dirty for more than 30 seconds. She was amazing! The food was very good too to be hotel buffet style food. Good biscuits...good eggs...good bacon...good white sausage gravy and one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had!

The breakfast from 6:30-9:30 daily was standard but had everything you need for a good wakeup. My only complaint is that my room on the third floor was beneath the breakfast area on the 4th floor.

The pool was nice although I didn't use it, and the gym was 2 treadmill and 2 ellipticals, which I used but the room was definitely lacking.

If you are taking the Metro in Los Angeles, then the hotel is approximately 5-10minutes walk away. Across the street is a small supermarket which sells pretty much anything you might need. If you fancy a cheap meal, there is an adjoining pizza restaurant, there is also a sushi restauarant but I did not go there. Our room was located on the 6th floor, to access that floor, you have to take lift A to the 5th floor and lift B to the 6th floor, so be mindful of this if you have lots of luggage that you have to carry around. This is not a 5 star property by any means, so don't expect too much, however for somewhere to rest your head then it's ok. We checked in late at night and it would seem that in the small lobby area, a man is perched on a stool who is security and will always ask you to show your key when you were going back to your room, usually late at night. The following day was my birthday but prior to my arrival, I had emailed the hotel to ask about car hire and trying to get to Six Flags Magic Mountain but I did not receive a reply. I mentioned this again at reception when I checked in and this information I had given them was ignored completely so I felt a bit let down. The room was furnished in a modest style but clean and tidy - I did wonder what the room would be like but it was very comfortable and catered to my needs. Complimentary breakfast is available in the breakfast room which is located on the 4th floor, there you can have eggs, sausage patties, toast, cereal, tea & coffee, which was more than adequate. There was an attendant there, I think her name was Maria, she was very helpful. We tried watching a pay movie in the room but the movie kept cutting out after 10 minutes so we followed the instructions on the screen to call the cable company who put us through to a corporate account department who were subsequently closed. At this point, we were concerned that we were being billed for a movie we never got to see, we then contacted reception about this who then told us that they were unaware that they had pay movies! Upon check-out, much to our delight, we were not charged for the movie in the end, we watched it on the flight home anyway!

The Hollywood Bowl is I'd say about a 20 min walk away a lot of people were parking near the hotel and walking there. If you are planning on doing tours with Starline Tours these also leave from Grauman's Chinese Theatre, you can arrange a pick up from your hotel but as they visit quite a few hotels it might add another hour or two onto your day, it was easy to be able to walk there. You can also jump on the subway from Hollywood Blvd to Unviersal Studios which is about two stops away, then you walk across the road and get a shuttle up the hill to Universal Studios. We thought about walking and Im so glad we didn't as it was quite steep and was a lot further than I thought it would be.We got a taxi back that evening as we were so tired and it was about $20 I think to the hotel. We enjoyed this hotel, the rooms were clean, a little darkish but great for sleeping. we had a Queen Executive suite 2x Queen beds and a double sofa, as we were traveling with 2 Adults and 3 teenagers this suited us perfectly and allowed us to have just the one room which although cosy saved us a lot of $$. We booked direct on the Holiday inn site and got a great advance rate of $195.00 , I asked to be on a high floor due to trip advisor reviews I had read about the street noise. The air conditioner was quite noisy but we got used to it and were so tired from our daily adventures we went straight to sleep each night. The boys had a dip in the pool one day and used the gym a few times. Beds were very comfy, even the sofa bed.The room had a mini fridge, coffee machine, free Wi Fi but that didn't work very well at times but was free. Breakfast was also included which was great as we usually didn't want lunch so saved the cost of two meals. The breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon, bagels, muffins, yoghurt, fruit, cereals, juice tea and coffee. Staff were always pleasant and helpful, you also get a free USA today newspaper which you pick up in the foyer. There is a laundry on the 3rd floor but only has one machine and dryer but was really handy. Across the road from the hotel is Pizza Shop, Subway and a mini mart which was well stocked and not too outrageously priced . The last day of our stay we discovered a pharmacy/supermarket on Hollywood Blvd about one block past the Chinese Theatre it wasn't huge but was cheaper than the mini mart for snacks. The area was a little dirty and some strange characters around but we had no problem the whole time we were there. The only issue we had and it wasn't with the hotel, they seem to use a private taxi service (un metered) I guess they get some kick back. So if you want a metered cab make sure you stipulate that. The private cab we had took us to our next hotel in Venice Beach ($80) which was fine. We mentioned that we were going to the airport in two days and he asked us if he could take us, we had to be picked up at 5.20am. He gave us his number and we confirmed the night before by phone with him. Well he didn't show up and at that time of morning it was hard to get a 5 seater cab, fortunately we were lucky and still made our flight. I can't find the card with his name on it but when I do I will add his name to this review. Like I said nothing really to do with the hotel other than they use his service.

Will look after bags if check out early & pick up later. Seemed to have a nice clientele - lots of friendly people from Europe, Canada and Australia staying there, many families. Negative points: Room was very stuffy because windows do not open much. Many rooms only look into a wall (not good if claustraphobic!) Busy street - traffic very noisy - we had to turn on the air conditioner all night so it would drown out the road noise. Police sirens, helicopters & fire engines much of the night. Hollywood is generally quite a seedy area - lots of homeless people, beggars & weirdos wandering about, but most of LA seems to be like that these days! I noticed that the Magic Castle Hotel, very nearby, is on a quieter street and gets very good reviews, but it charges a lot more. Recommend eating at The California Pizza restaurant, upstairs on the corner of Hollywood & Highland. Greek Pizza scrumptious. Recommend not booking any LA tours until you arrive as they offer lots of discount vouchers in the main street, as well as deals for seeing multiple attractions, such as a tour plus wax museum. This hotel was also selling two day passes to Universal studios for the price of 1 day (but note that it is much cheaper to take local bus than to buy a pass that includes transport). We did La City Tour A1 - Venice Beach (very, very seedy & dangerous at night), Santa Monica Beach, Dowtown including oldest house in LA, Hollywood, then Movie Stars houses in Beverly Hills etc. A good way to see a great deal of LA in one day. But be aware that if you initially get a crappy seat on their mini bus they make you stay in the same one all day even though you paid as much as the people in the front row (good reason not to give a tip to tour guide who insists on noboby moving seats!)

So I am going to get those two things out of the way first so I can get onto the good stuff. We were on our honeymoon and when we booked, we included this information with the online booking. We arrived after a long flight and waiting for a shuttle bus for ages, and it turned out that checking into this hotel was the most stress free and fast thing, which we were very pleased with. We were given room 305, and we rushed to our room and pulled open our curtains to see what kind of fantastic view we had \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only to be confronted with a concrete wall and hardly any natural light. When we looked up, we could see the side of the pool. Still, we tried not to be disappointed, not even in the morning when we were trying to catch up on sleep after an 11hour flight, only to be awoken be the constant sound of scraping cheers on the floor above \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what we later discovered to be the breakfast room. These sounds started around 6.30am every morning and we were as a result, woken up by these noises every single morning of our stay. Luckily, we had lots of things planned so we tried to roll with it and just get on with things. If you make it to the breakfast room for 6.30-7am you will be able to have a calm, quiet breakfast. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s later, say 8.30am, be prepared for a very busy room, sometimes with no seats available. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry! You can always have a take out breakfast. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read other reviews about the breakfast by the way and how anyone can complain about this FREE complimentary service is completely beyond me. Every morning, there was; coffee, a selection of juices, milk, 4 different cereals, yoghurts, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, toasts, bagels, cinnamon rolls, I could go on and on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.there is so much there and lovely staff members who are constantly replenishing and cleaning and smiling. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to complain about? Our room itself was very comfortable, fantastic bed, lots of room, cleaned every single day, fresh towels, etc. We also had a fridge which was handy and we were close to the vending machines and elevator so there were pluses to room 305 too! We felt very safe indeed in this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I have to make a comment about the staff. We experienced at least 4 different front desk staff during our 7 night stay and each and every one of them was helpful, polite, and obliging. Whenever we saw any other staff they were as polite and cordial. I wanted to mention this as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear they all work very hard behind the scenes to make your stay a memorable one (and despite the view and being below the breakfast room!) our stay was very memorable. I would stay here again in a heartbeat with a moment of hesitation. Hollywood & Highland shopping centre is a 5 minute walk away, Hollywood Boulevard the same, the Metro station is right there too and is clean, safe and fast. $1.25 one way to go to Universal Studios \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it takes 10 minutes tops to get there.

It is located about 10mins walk from the walk of fame and graumanns chinese theatre and is on most of the tour companie's pick up routes. Our room was nice and big and was very clean. Breakfast was included and it was really nice, the usual toast, cereal, pastries and cooked things. You also get free use of their internet in the business centre, as well as the gym and pool. The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well. For anyone who likes pizzas I would recommend visiting the California Pizza Kitchen at the mall - pizzas are lush there and are rasonably priced. We got a shared bus to the hotel through Super Shuttle. It cost approx $32 return and pick ups occur every 10-15 mins from airport. Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after 11 hours on a plane! We didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx 3/4 day and was really worth the money. We then did an escorted trip to Universal with Starline which was well organised and Universal is worth visiting!! We also went to Madame Tussauds on the walk of fame which had some good and bad statues!!

Hollywood itself seems to be quite overrated but the hotel was a great place to call home for six days. Check-in was easy and all of the front desk staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant. Had a nice chat with the girls while they were watching the Super Bowl during the quieter moments of the day. They even helped us plan our trip to the San Diego Zoo (and remembered us well enough to ask how it was when we returned). The room was quite spacious though perhaps a little dark with no proper lights, only floor and table lamps. Bathroom was nice and the bed super comfy...not much street noise either and you'd never know that busy Hollywood Blvd was close by. Free buffet breakfast every morning was a Godsend - nice supply of toast, bagels, cinnamon rolls, various cereals, milk, yoghurt, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, coffee, fruit, and more...fabulous! As a tip, it's probably a good idea to swipe a couple of paper plates, bowls and some cutlery from the breakfast room in the morning as although there is a kitchenette in the room, there is nothing to eat your food on or with. Only had two problems during our stay, both of which were handled by staff very, very quickly. Once our room key stopped working and it was immediately replaced by the girls on the desk, and towards the end of the trip our toilet backed up but the maintenance man was quick to fix that also. The free Wi-Fi was horribly slow at times in our 4th floor room...that's probably the only real complaint I would have. The small business centre was more than adequate for those times where we had to email home. We didn't have a car for the whole duration of our holiday but as tourists we made good use of the hop-on hop-off buses that most major touristy cities have. The company we used in Hollywood started from outside the Chinese Theatre so that was very convenient and the information they provided, as well as the variety of loops to take you to Downtown LA, Santa Monica, the hills, etc were great. Ordered in a couple of nights from some of the restaurants listed in the hotel's booklet...good experiences all round. There's a convenience store and Subway across the road (if you can ignore all of the scary people hanging around at night), and the sushi restaurant, Shinto is to die for!

While checking in at this hotel, the two clerks on duty decided to have an arguement over room assignments while also trying to activate my room keys. Unfortunately for me, the keys were not properly activated and after arriving at my 7th floor room, via two seperate elevators, I had to go all the way back down again for them to activate the keys properly. Our room temp was set at 76 degress so we immediately turned on the A/C and set it to 70. When we retruned 3 hours later the room was still 74 degrees. The room never di cool off properly using the A/C. We tried to open a window but thye had been locked shut. We also then discovered our remote control was missing eyd when we had a new one brought up the person informed us that housekepign had been looking for a remote for this room but apparently never placed one in the room. After getting the TV situation squared away I went to the business center to check in for my flight. No printer was present in the business center so down to the front desk I went yet again. It's never a good sign at a hotel when you need to interact with the front desk on multiple occasions. I was able to use the front desk computer and was told that management was \"working\" on getting a new printer. Apparently $150 and a quick visit to Officemax is beyond their capability here. I asked for a manager on duty but there was none and the owner of the hotel doesn't come in until 9am when I'll be long gone. I've stayed at hotels like this in the past and most of the time the poor service can be directly traced back to poor management/ownership. You can't pick who owns and manages a hotel, Holiday Inn is supposed to do that for us and they have obviously failed with this location.

The TV channels could only be changed from the cable box, but there were no instructions on how to do that. The in-room safe failed to work the last morning of my 3-day stay.

The hotel looks a bit rough on the outside but don't worry, it's very nice on the inside. The best part about our stay was, by far, the daily complimentary continental breakfast. From memory, it had bananas, 2 kinds of cereal, hot biscuits, cinnamon rolls, gravy, bacon, toast, english muffins, mini blueberry muffins...we never went hungry! In fact, it was enough to tide us over until dinner most days! Don't need to worry about breakfast running out, a friendly lady was there at all times to keep items restocked and I can't get enough of those biscuits! Apart from the great breakfast, the hotel is an easy 5 minute walk from all of your Hollywood tourist attractions like the Walk of Fame, Mann's Chinese Theatre, Disney El Capitan Theatre, etc. There's also a CVS drug store on the Walk of Fame which was great for buying snacks. And the subway station is also right on the corner of Hollywood Blvd and N Highland Ave and is so easy to use if you want to go anywhere else (we went to Universal, only a 5 minute ride). The hotel rooms also have a mini fridge to keep your drinks cool. It's hidden under the TV in a cabinet, we didn't figure that out until our last day! There's also free highspeed internet access which we used in our room on our laptop to plan what we would do for the next day. The staff are very helpful and friendly and minded our VERY heavy luggage for us on our last day while we shopped at Hollywood and Highland mall as we had a late flight back to Australia. If you need any airport transfers, we used a private van from Zippy Shuttle and I can't recommend them highly enough!

The lobby, while small, was warmly accommodating with a space carved out for sofa and large flat-screen TV. The contemporary soundtrack in the background was carried up into the hallways which, along with the modern carpet made for an unexpectedly trendy vibe. The room itself was very comfortable and modern. We appreciated the cozy bed, the selection on the flat screen TV and excellent shower.

We spent 3 nights here which was about two too many since the area has few decent bars or restaurants and is full of people on the scrounge - panhandlers, nut jobs and 'servers' who spend more time telling you about their 'gratuities policy' than getting your order right.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK - YORKSHIRE", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel , good service, good location for seeing hollywood\u201d", "Author": "BUNSTERBOO", "ReviewID": "UR33128259", "Content": "We came to this hotel from Las Vegas - we took the Luxbus from Vegas which took 4 1/2 hours.

We stayed at this hotel from the 2 June 2009 to the 6 June 2009.

The rooms were very clean and we had new towels anmd sheets every day. Breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice. the breakfast attendant was also very helpful and chatty. The pool was quite small, but it was warm and very clean and very well received after a hot day out and about. The hotel was about 5 mins walk from Hollywood Boulevard where you could get transport to most locations. One day we took the metro to universal studios which was only one stop away. The tube was clean and not busy. We then took the free shuttle bus from the metro station to Universal Studios. The second day we took the metro bus from hollywood boulevard to Santa monica and had a fab day...if you go try Bubba Gumps the shrimp if awesome! We walked from Sanat Monica to Venice beach it was a nice walk but it took a good hour. Venice Beach is nothing special and once you have seen it you are ready to go back to Santa Monica! The bus service was great and cost only $5 each to hop and ond off all day. We also took the Bus to Beverly Hills, Farmers Market and The Grove all for $5 all day travel what a bargain.

We were glad that other Trip Advisor reviewers had warned about this though as it helped us be on the lookout for it. You can walk to the Grauman Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame easily (10 minutes) and Paramount is close by.

This was our first time in LA (we'd just spent 12 nights in Vegas and were on our way up the coast) and having only 2 days we thought it best to stay in the middle of it all and the hotel was very well placed for this. On arrival we were allocated a room on the 3rd floor, then the gentleman on reception mentioned the breakfast room was on the floor above this - I queried if we were directly below it (as we had just been in a really noisy hotel and I needed to get some sleep!) and he said 'no but tell you what i'll upgrade you anyway' - how nice. We had just booked a standard king room but he gave us an exec room instead which had a bit more space. This was very kind of him and he was very helpful the whole time. The room did face the street, which was very busy and noisy, but as we needed the aircon on both nights (it got up to 102 at one point) it drowned out any noise anyway, so it wasn't an issue. The room was very nice and spacious, with a sink and fridge in the sitting area. The bathroom was very small but clean and everything worked well. The 2 main reasons we booked this hotel were (apart from the good reviews) the fact that you got internet access and breakfast as part of the price. The internet access was available in the room/ wi-fi and in the business centre (2 computers in a room beside the pool which never seemed to be busy) we didn't ever have any issues getting connected in the room. The breakfast room overlooked the pool and the cereal/ toast/ eggs/ sausage were a good start to each day. The hotel offers valet and self parking but they both cost $22/ day so we opted for valet, not that it made much difference as it's a tiny car park just off reception. But the car park attendants were always quick and friendly. The hotel is a 5 min walk (only that long due to traffic) to the Hollywood & Highland shopping complex which we ate at both nights (uWink & California pizza kitchen) and the walk of fame is on the other side of this.

However they did not bother us for handouts or harass us in any way, it's just a little disconcerting that they are around.

You can find lots of places to eat there too - we went to the Disney Soda Fountain for an ice cream treat right at the corner of Highland and Hollywood, yum! Our room was an executive queen suite, which was a very large room for a family of four and probably fit 6 comfortably. It was offered to us at the same price as the standard two queen room so it was a good deal at the time. There is no separate living room, just an arched wall separating the beds from the sofabed. The sofabed, being new, was in good shape and not lumpy or uneven. When opened there was still plenty enough space to maneuver around. The queen beds were wonderful and I liked that they provided lots of pillows on the beds. I added photos of the room so you can see how it looks. We were on the 4th floor which was THE BEST, get a room there if you can because all the amenities are there - business center, pool and FREE breakfast buffet.

The free continental breakfast is good and sorts you out for a few hours, so you cannot complain about that. The staff on reception were competent enough and friendly but they do only recommend one of the tour companies on the boulevard so it is worth shopping around because there are better deals available with other tour companies.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "Carolg903", "ReviewID": "UR26198160", "Content": "This hotel is perfect for an LA trip.

A serviceable breakfast was included in the price. The business center included two computers and printer. There's a convenience store and daytime Starbucks across the street. Negatives: Some of the staff appeared immature or inexperienced. When I tried checking in, the two staff members looked overwhelmed although there were only a few people checking out. I was asked to have a seat, which I didn't mind, but was promptly forgotten. When checking out, the desk staff person had a personal laptop and cell phone out. Our car was vandalized as was one other car. We learned there are no security cameras in the garage. I know the hotel is not responsible but it's something to be warned about. Driving into and out of the hotel is hectic with traffic The wi-fi is slow and frequently stops working. Housekeeping skipped our room even though we took the Do Not Disturb sign away and were out by 9:30 AM and were back in the late afternoon. Also at check-in, we were given a half-used bottle of lotion. Not the biggest deal, but it just added to the holes in service. Neutral: Parking is $22 with tax.

The hotel was well-located and clean, the price was reasonable, and the staff were friendly - particularly the night desk clerk, whom we saw a lot of due to jet lag. Breakfast, which was included in the price of our room, was pretty good, with a selection of pre-made omlettes, sausage, toasted bagels, cinnamon buns and 2-3 juices. It runs from 6:30 to 9:30 only, and I recommend getting there early, as swarms of pensioners seem to show up at 6:30 on the dot and grab all the sausages. There is no room service, although there are soft drinks and snacks on sale in the lobby. If I had any complaints with this hotel, it would be that the friendly young people working at the desk seem to be under a lot of pressure to sell pre-packaged city tours. Perhaps this is part of their compensation. At any rate, any request for directions around town had them pulling out their color pamphlets and recommending the most expensive, five-hour tour, and encouraging us to book now, now, NOW! Parents of young children: we found the hotel pretty well childproofed, with a plexiglass fence around the pool. The only negative for my (tall) daughter is that bathroom faucets were placed so far back that she had to be lifted up whenever it was time to wash her hands.

The best thing about the place is the location as it is a short walk to a metro stop and the Hollywood and Highland center. We stayed two nights and because the hotel was full we were given one of the smaller rooms (I guess you have to request a large room). So I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the rooms were spacious. They were just average. The wireless internet in the room rarely worked. They gave me a password to access the wireless, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Somehow I stumbled on another wireless site that worked sometimes. Our TV worked only some of the time and then when it was time to watch the football bowl games on New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work at all! They sent a guy to the room to try to fix it, but even though he tried for more than 30 minutes, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Not at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no picture and no sound - no TV. They offered to move us the next day to another room but we were checking out. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say much good about management either. I had a problem with part of my iPod Touch case being thrown away but the manager wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even give me the courtesy of talking with me about it. The people at the desk tried to help but because of the times we were actually in the hotel the housekeeping manager wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there so I had to call the hotel twice to have them check to see what happened to the case cover. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine why the housekeeper would have thrown it away. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the trash can although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit that it was left on the floor next to one of our suitcases. But so was the cup that was left from the last guest who had been in the room and that I found under the drapes when I was looking for the case cover. I suppose if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the trash it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count.

Great little supermarket AND a Starbucks across the street from the hotel - always felt very safe. Van Morrison was doing a two nighter at the Hollywood Bowl which is practically next door to this hotel as well. They made arrangements for us to do a Paramount Studios Tour and due to an error on the part of the clerk, we didn't get to go but they accommodated my son and I by booking us the Warner Bros Tour instead and it was FABULOUS!! Also, arranged the cab, which cost us about $15 each way.
