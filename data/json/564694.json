{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice little hotel close to main attractions It was about a 20-25min walk from train station and when we arrived there was no answer at the door but fortunately a postal woker arrived at the same time and we got in when she buzzed the buildings other residents.The man at the reception desk was very friendly and helpful and asked if the room was ok - a first! It was up 3 flights of stairs but we were backpacking so used to walking lots anyway.We were very close to the Duomo, museums and river with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby as well. I recommend the 'Ristorante da Mimmo' just up the road if you stay here.The room was not serviced each day which isn't a problem for me - I know how to make a bed and feel it is a waste of time for staff that we only end up paying for and I don't use fresh towels every day at home either so no problems that they didn't get changed. Maybe after a week or so fresh towels would be desired but we only stayed for 3 nights.The air-conditioner didn't work very well, we had it set to 30C but it only seemed to get to 20C. Fortunately the weather was pleasant and therefore it wasn't really required.I liked this hotel and its location, the only small issue I had is the office is only open from 10am to 1pm and even then the door was shut a lot of the time.Otherwise, a nice, clean, comfortable and cheap hotel in a good location. I would recommend it.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR429909397", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "alkegs"}, {"Content": "I don't recommend this B 1. Far from station for bringing heavy baggages persons on foot.2. Heating system does NOT work in the middle of the night even in Jan. We awaked up to cold.3. They didn't make a bed next day and didn't change towels. We have to use our own towels.4. The room is the 3rd floor, no lift, you have to bring your baggages by yourself.5. Owner is not at the place.However, staff told us where to visit kindly.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR474305773", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nomore2"}, {"Content": "Good but Quirky Locanda Gallo has pristene rooms at a great value. It is important to note however, that this is a guest house and not a hotel or hostel. The reception is only open between 11 am and 1pm, so if you have to check in/out or have problems at any other time, you have to call the owner's cell phone. He is very prompt and helpful. Also, the building is old, so you have to be careful not to blow a fuse.", "Date": "Jan 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR627186055", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "aelleg"}, {"Content": "A bad choice for us First, do not arrive without a cellulaire phone. If your arrival is not in the morning, you are out of luck and will need to call a number for the person responsible to come open the door and give you the key to the room. There was then a mix-up with our reservation as we were supposed to have a room with a kitchen corner. However, we were able to change room the next day. The room named CIMABUE on the second floor is very small (for 3 persons) but ok with a small kitchen corner and small bathroom. However, as soon as you use the shower, a smell of the sewers comes up through the shower drain and stayed in the room during our stay of 3 days. This room is also at the back of the building with the music and shouting of the neighbors.The room on third floor is very big for 3 persons with a very small bathroom but new. However it faces the street with noise from the bikes passing during the night.Not expensive.
