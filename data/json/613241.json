{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location The location was excellent, right near the underground station and in a very quiet strasse, with a few corner store type shops near by.If you're driving to the hotel there isn't much parking outside, and there are strict parking regulations. There is a small carpark at the back of the hotel and you can park there for 5 Euros a day if there's a space.The hotel itself is pretty basic just BB, suited to short stay travellers without children. We had to re-arrange our double room to try and squeeze in a travel cot for our 1 yr old. But the room was pleasant, clean and actually had opening windows for fresh air!! Rather than the air con you get in some hotels these days.The included breakfast was continental and very nice, but the breakfast room was a bit on the small side and people were having to wait for a table if you arrived at peak time (possibly about 8-9am).The staff were helpful and friendly and if you only have a limited knowledge of the German language (like me), their English was pretty good.", "Date": "Dec 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR553512039", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "charliejane"}, {"Content": "the hotel is OK Very basic hotel but excellent position. It is placed in a nice and quiet neighborhood in a tree-lined street just a few steps away the underground station and at a walking distance from the city center. On the whole the place is very much unassuming and modest but the staff is kind and the breakfast is not bad. Ideal place for a cheap but confortable stay.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR367426667", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ItalianBari"}, {"Content": "Great value This was a great little hotel and we were pleasantly surprised for the price. The location was ideal for us, being only steps from a subway station and not in the heart of the city centre. we were just accross the river from the city centre, in a lovely little neighborhood. We ate at a local restaurant/pub right next door on the corner and our meal was delicious. We also walked accross the park (beautiful little park right next to hotel) to a fancier hotel (Steigenberger), for a wonderful dinner another night. The front desk staff were friendly, spoke english fine and were willing to answer any questions we had. The room was very clean (spotless actually), the beds very comfortable and the pillows huge and fluffy. The windows open all the way so you can really get some nice ventilation going. The bathroom was clean with a tub and handheld shower, but there was no shower curtain which really wasn't a problem. The water pressure was good.The hotel stay included a buffet breakfast which consisted of cold meats, breads, fruit, cereals, milk, and coffee. I did not eat (just coffee) but the room was clean, pleasant and ample.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR357066057", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Keefucious"}, {"Content": "Buona posizione   showReview(10937271, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR615602394", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "alorism"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d613241-r11460033-Hotel_Diplomat-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "613241", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
