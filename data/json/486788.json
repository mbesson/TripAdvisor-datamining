The rooms are cheaper than some of the other hotels in the area, and it's right by the airport. The pictures depict an older building, so my expectations were not all that high. Previous reviewers describe the property and rooms accurately - small, and in desparate need of an update. Breakfast, taken in the outside section, was very good and the restaurant, like a lot of San Juan that I saw, had a cool art-deco vibe. The front desk person that made my reservation the night before I arrived and the one that checked me in had cheery and helpful attitudes, but the other front desk agents were un-cooperative and somewhat surly, despite my attempts to be a good customer. One of them was at once surly to me, and then all nice, when she thought that it was time for a tip. She didn't get one, but the very nice man who checked me in earlier, did. In the morning, they refused to call the taxi driver that I had used the night before, but what really aggravated me was that the taxi that they did call (obviously a friend) overcharged me for the ride to the airport. Taxi rates to and from the airport and the hotel are published. When I asked why my fare was more, I got a lot of bs and outright lies, like, \"It's an extra dollar for the call.\" What call? I stood my ground at the airport, and after placing two quarters on top of my bag (rather than handing them to me), she made a quick exit. My intention was to straighten things out at the airport taxi stand, but she didn't like that idea at all. It was fairly obvious criminal behavior. This may sound more like a review of a taxi driver, rather than that of the hotel, but the hotel staff called this taxi specifically. My message to the owners/managers of this property, if you ever bother to read this website: The Coral Sea is what it is, but shabby treatment of your customers doesn't help, at all. Allowing your employees to take advantage of your customers and engage in criminal behavior will drive your customers away.

But the stay was going to be free, paid for through my Delta Skymiles so I decided to chance it. I can see how someone might be disappointed if their entire traveling experience consisted of major American hotel chains. If the Holiday Inn is your sole basis of comparison then you will be disappointed. No little bottle of shampoo, the TV didn't work properly, and you have to let the shower run for a few minutes before you get any hot water. This kind of thing is why the hotel is as inexpensive as it is. However, the place was very clean. Having seen some reviews from people here about poor maid service at this hotel, I decided to do an experiment. On the first day, I left no tip. The result was a poorly-made bed and some crumbs I had deliberately left on the floor were not swept up, etc. Then on every day thereafter I left a $2 tip. It should come as no surprise that the service improved 100%. Please remember that these women have a fairly unpleasant job that many people would consider demeaning and they get paid next to nothing in what is practically a third world country. Put yourself in their shoes and just give them the tip they deserve. You will see a difference. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful to me in response to my treatment of them as equals. Yet I observed some of these same people giving the cold shoulder to tourists checking in at the desk who failed to use words like 'please' and 'thank you.' Bad manners led to receiving bad service. I think that perhaps there is just a cultural difference here that guests need to get used to. At a major chain hotel run by an American corporation, all employees are expected to give excellent treatment even to crappy, rude, non-tipping guests. Here in Puerto Rico, at a locally-owned hotel, normal human nature seems to be permitted to dominate. As someone who tries to make a point of having good manners, I'm pretty ok with that. My room was totally fine and I would have been happy paying up to around $70 a night for what I got. Clean linens, comfortable bed, clean bathroom, reliable wi-fi, no bugs and there was air conditioning. There is a public beach only a few blocks away and the neighborhood was completely safe and well-policed at all hours. The point of the trip was not to sit in a room for 4 nights and 5 days - it was to see San Juan. I only really came back to the room to sleep and check my email.

So, I decided to stay at Coral by the Sea which was about $76/night all in for a single bed room. My stay for four nights was quite pleasant because I was using the hotel only as a base and did not stay there unless I was sleeping. That said, unless you are accustomed to sleeping through fairly loud air conditioners and a plane going by once in a while, this place will be quiet enough for you. Even the Ritz which is right next door endures the plane sounds. You will have to let the water run in the shower for about 7 minutes before any warm/hot water comes out. The sink did not seem to have hot water flowing even though there was a hot water faucet and pipe. They provide two bath towels and one towel for the floor- these towels smell like bleach (which is good) but they are very thin and sometimes slightly stained. The bed was somewhat comfortable as were the pillows. The sheets smelled clean, but there were stains here and there and sometimes even a random hair. The rooms contain a small LCD TV, a [dirty] chair, plastic cups, ice bin (not sure if an ice machine is available however) and an armoir. I noticed some insect bait in the room but never saw one insect. The elevator is slow but works and a nice perk about the hotel is the free parking. I imagine during busy times will be hard to find parking as the lot fits about 15-20 cars. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Internet access really is only available in the lobby which is a pain, and while I was there the hotel's internet access was down, so I was leaching from one of the connected restaurants (Platos). The hotel is in a great location, with two connected restaurants (Platos is expensive however) where you will receive a 10% discount for showing your room key. Walgreens is nestled in between this hotel and the Ritz, and both the Ritz and Walgreens are 5 minutes away. I spent a day at the Ritz's spa which was great because it's so close. There is also Burger King, Chilis, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Taco Bell and others located on the strip of hotels all within 10 minutes of walking distance to this hotel.

Via driving, Old San Juan is 20 minutes away, Luquillo Beach 35 minutes, El Yunque rainforest 35 minutes, Seven Seas Beach (near the Bioluminescent Bay) 45 minutes and the ferry to Culebra 50 minutes.

Shower, Shave and Sit. The 2 queen size beds in our room was very comfortable and the room was very clean. It does need a little up grading with the furniture and it would have been nice to have a microwave and a refrigerator in the room. But what more can one want for a price like that. Check out was at 12 noon and my meeting lasted after 2 pm and the supervisor on duty was so generous in not charging us an extra day due to the fact that our belongings was still in the room. I will definitely stay there again and again.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cCoral by the sea\u201d", "Author": "misawa393", "ReviewID": "UR24454420", "Content": "After reading some of these reviews, I was way skeptical about staying at this hotel.

We splurged on a nice hotel pre-cruise so just wanted a cheap place to lay our heads for one last nite. Everything you read in the reviews is VERY true. The lobby is alright but once you get inside the elevator and make the slow(so slow in fact It makes no noise and you feel as though you may be stuck) ascension to your floor you feel an eerie chill like your in Hostel 4 or somethin. Once the elevator jolts to your destinating floor you get off in a dark hallway with metal doors.As for the room-very basic. I didn't think it was that bad but my GF was appalled. She was so upset she wanted nothing more than to get out for dinner come back and sleep and get out ASAP.At first i noticed the AC wasnt working and when I went down to ask(the room phone couldn't reach the front desk-at least I couldn't figure it out.) I got lucky since the front desk person apparently abandoned the front desk to show a prospective sucker what the rooms looked like. He assured me the AC did in fact work -all you had to do was flick a switch on the wall-a first for me.I then mentioned that our room had no wash clothes could I get a couple. He advised me that the hotel did not provide wash clothes. After a sweaty day we were forced to use one of our towels for a wash cloth then share the other towel to dry off.Once again not a really big deal to me but obviously a lady would have a much different perspective on it. The bed seemed clean and the sheets had a smell of bleach, the room overall was very simple and dingy but wasnt overly dirty that I found-the tile floor a little gritty like sand. We found the people at the front desk very helpful actually and never had a problem with the parking. They have surveillence of the lot at the front desk and there was a guy helping us out each time we parked. So that wasn't a problem for us but it is a rather small parkin lot so I could imagine the issues pointed out in other reviews. It IS about a 3 block walk to the beach-but not a very pleasant one-garbage ridden alleys,fenced in condos, etc. Overall the area was very dark at nite and gave you a general feeling of unsafeness. It WAS very close to some of the nicest hotels in Isle Verde area but Isle Verde even though in the tourist area seemed rather unsavory to me.The type of place where call girls and drug lords come to life after midnight. I felt MUCH safer staying in Condado and I even felt safer walkin the streets of Ole San Juan in the wee hours of the morning than walking around this area. Overall it was the cheapest I could find at 100$ a nite and it served the purpose for me. I wouldn't suggest it for couples or family who have never went camping or stayed in hostels in their past-this hotel would be a shock to their system. Oh one more good thing is it is a mile to Charlies car rental on the same street which is very convenient to drop off and get to the airport in less than 15 minutes time.There was also a string of very good Italian restaurants down the street and a very good place for authentic PR food called Maria somethin or another.

I was equally excited because we had such a good rate on our lodging, flight and hotel via Priceline.com. From the moment we established contact with this establishment, we encountered sub-standard service. Upon our arrival to town, I called the hotel to get directions. I talked to two people who gave me very \"vague\" directions. My reservation documentation confirmed a check in time of 1pm, yet upon confirming our arrival via phone, we were told that check in time wasn't until 3pm. From this point, throughout the duration of our stay, each day we encountered a sub-standard service, event or occurrence. Upon checking into our room, we found bath towels the size of hand towels, no hand towels or face cloths. The baths towels were the consistency of a dish towel, (very thin and not very absorbent). The room , (and specifically the bathroom) had a musty odor that wouldn't seem to dissipate even after opening windows. Even thought this was a non-smoking room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. The bedspreads and bed linen were visibly soiled Later that evening we encountered ROACHES crawling over our toiletries. When we expressed our horror to the front desk, they provided a nonchalant \"sorry about that\" and sent the maintenance porter to our room to give us a can of roach spray to console us. The front desk offered to move us to another room for one night, then move us to another room again, (because they were at full capacity, nonetheless, this was an inconvenience solution). Because it was late in the evening, we kept the can of roach spray and stayed in the room. We didn't get much sleep thinking about the roach infestation. As Priceline's policy states no refunds, we were very unhappy with the way this hotel turned out. The next day, we were told by the manager/owner, that we would be moved to another room . He even asked our permission to move our luggage as he would take care of the room transfer while we were out enjoying our vacation. When we arrived back to the room late in the evening, we were told by the desk clerk that the manager told her to tell us that he had our original room thoroughly cleaned and inspected and the he wasn't going to move us and we can stay in the original room. At this point it became obvious that because we were pre-paid, they didn't care about out discontent. We insisted on being moved to another room and the desk clerk finally decided to help and get us moved. The next day, in our better room, my friend awoke to find a roach crawling across the nightstand. Since we were tired of moving, we stayed in this room and continued to arm ourselves with the can of roach spray. We didn't even bother to unpack our bags for fear that roaches would be running through our clothing and belongings. This is very inconvenient when lodging for an entire week. For the rest or our stay, it was one thing after another: a slow drain in the bathroom sink, wound up being a clogged drained, we saw ants in the room, the ice bucket was filthy, and surprisingly, we never saw an ice machine anywhere, (hmmm), I dropped a pair of shorts on the floor by mistake and the dust and dirt that was on my pants was INCREDIBLE, we dare not put our bare feet on the dirty ceramic floor for that reason, we constantly had to ask for extra towels, as they never left face cloths or an adequate amount of the thin bath towels in the room, parking was an issue as they were always surprisingly booked and had more cars than parking spaces, we often had to leave our car keys at the front desk so that the security guard could move our car, because we had to park and block someone in to get a half a space on the parking lot, the garbage receptacles were in plain view in the parking lot and every time you went to and from your vehicle, you smelled the stench of garbage and had to view it overflowing daily, most of the time when we returned to the hotel we had to walk threw a crowd of guests and hotel staff smoking and hanging out directly in front of the main entrance. Lastly, this place is so close to the airport that you constantly hear planes taking off. The planes fly so close that it sounds like they were often taking off on the roof of the hotel. It seemed like the staff at this hotel was used to these types of complaints and were not at all motivated to provide corrective action. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the frustration of trying to be budget conscious and don't stay at this hotel. I witnessed a number of people complaining and demanding a refund. I am a budget traveler by choice, and I have never experienced a 2 star hotel on this level.

I booked a room at the Coral by the Sea Hotel and Restaurant because it was inexpensive. The day before my departure to Puerto Rico, I decided to read the reviews for the hotel(something that i normally do not do because I prefer to find things out myself). I began to freak out because of the negative reviews about this place and tried to look for rooms at other hotels within my \"vacation budget\". I finally came to the decision that we would not be in the room for long periods of time so we sucked it up and away we went. Coral by the Sea is not much to look at. The \"free parking\" is a total of 12 parking spots for all of the guests and staff. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The rooms are not much to look at either. A bed, a desk, 2 chairs, and a nightstand and the bathroom is extremely small. The A/C is very good however. The room was cleaned everyday of our stay (5 days) and we never had a problem. The hotel is located 2 blocks from the Isla Verde beach, 3 blocks from the El San Juan Hotel and Casino (which houses numerous nightclubs, restaurants and the aforementioned casino), within minutes of Old San Juan, and about 45 minutes from Luquillo Beach and El Yunque. With all of this going on around you, who actually wants to spend time in their hotel room? I truly believe that all the negative reviews are from people expecting a 5 star hotel at economy prices. For $80-$95 a night and with all the North and East side of Puerto Rico has to offer within an hour drive , the Coral by the Sea is an ideal spot to rest up from a long day of sightseeing and exploring. Does it has its flaws, sure it does, but the price, locale, and staff more than make up for it. Keep in mind that Coral by the Sea is a small, economy hotel and you will enjoy your stay. There is just so much to do in Puerto Rico than to worry about the quality of your hotel.
