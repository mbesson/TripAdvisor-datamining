I debated having a view and more convenience to the Convention center where most sessions would be, vs the calm and boutique nature of the St. Regis. I am very happy I chose the St. Regis! I stayed in a Queen room which was just the right size on the 4th floor. The **free** wifi, water, chocolate on the bed everyday, breakfast, AND printing of a presentation were icing on the cake. I like to compare this hotel to a Kimpton although with more perks! The hotel staff were all very, very helpful--they made excellent suggestions for dinner, directions, transportation, etc. I only had beer at the adjacent pub and breakfast each morning. It is the same breakfast daily (which someone complained about in a post I read a few months ago) - but there's a Tom Horton's across the street for those who want more choices. Location-wise, the St. Regis is perfect if you like to walk in this walking-friendly town--I walked to Gastown, waterfront, & Stanley Park.

I chose the St. Regis because we arrived late at night via Amtrak, and I wanted a hotel close to a Skytrain station in case we arrived in bad weather. We were fortunate and had mild weather for our quick trip, but I still appreciated being right on top of Granville Station. We walked up Seymour Street to Harbour Centre and the Vancouver Lookout to enjoy the view, then stopped by the steam clock before heading to luch at Kita No Donburi (separate review). The hotel itself was wonderful, both in terms of comfort and service. I had noted on our reservation that we would be arriving late -- and when we walked in the door shortly before midnight, the desk staff had everything ready for us. The bed was very comfortable, not overly soft.

The bathroom made up for the lack of tub (who uses a hotel tub?) with a wonderfully adjustable shower head (a luxury for my 10 year old daughter). The floor was heated (bliss at 5:00 a.m.). There was an illuminated make-up mirror (when did I get so many wrinkles?) as well as comfy robes. Breakfast in the very attractive, club-atmosphere basement dining room is made-to-order and offers choices including eggs, fruit, and pastry. We were very grateful to the staff for packing breakfast boxes for us (which were ready at the front desk) to take along for our early train departure (just make sure to ask for this the night before). Every staff person we encountered was gracious and cheerful.

We looked at others reviews and decided this was the hotel we wanted to stay in. After checking prices on the hotels website with other websites we found a lower price contacted the hotel and they agreed to match it immediately (which is the hotels policy but I thought it might be more of a hassle as has happened to us at other places.) First I would like to list the cons because there really weren't that many but if you are taking a car you have to stop in the 3 minute spot beside the hotel, put your flashers in, and get a parking pass. Parking is $25 a day with unlimited in/out access, but we ended up walking and using the bus instead of taking the car out. We had read about the parking cost per day but didn't read about having to get the pass from the front desk and ended up having to drive around the block a few times in the dark so hopefully this will make it easier for the next guests. Also if you are looking for a hotel with a pool this is not the place for you as they do not have one, it wasn't an issue for us because we were there for the sights! On to the pros -- everything else! The hotel staff is amazing and go out of their way to make your stay fantastic! The carried our bags in and got us settled into our room. The rooms were an adequate size but not small as mentioned in other reviews (we had a room with two double beds, two nightstands, a tv stand, and a desk) but the decor is great and the bathroom was very spacious. Employees were great about giving us directions and recommendations for local sights and restaurants, offered to book events for our family and are able to switch our US money for Canadian money (but only $100). They offer umbrellas for daily use which you might need, free WiFi (worked wonderfully), and iPads that you can rent (but we didn't). Any request we had was meet with a smile and prompt results! Finally the food at the hotel. Breakfast was included in the cost of our room and was one of the best we have had. It included juice, coffee/tea, breads (pastries, toast, or bagel), eggs cooked to your preference OR waffles OR an omelet, potatoes, meat (bacon, sausage, ham), and fruit. The first day we let the kids order what they wanted but the breakfast portion was huge so the second day we scaled it down a bit. Also as a person with lots of food allergies I was still satisfied with the amount of food I could eat. I had ham, potatoes, and fruit with tea and OJ. We also ordered room service from the hotel by calling the front desk. Again even with food allergies and making requests for changes from the menu our food was delivered within 20 minutes and was great! Finally I wanted to address noise issues that I had read about in another review. We were on the second floor and found that we didn't hear our neighbors except for a couple of doors closing or road traffic except for an ambulance. We never heard the people above us or beside us, we were in at a decent time at night and then out during the day. This hotel is very family friendly but is also able to cater to any other type of traveler!

If you have a car, there is 24-hour, unlimited in-and-out parking in a secure garage in the building next door for $25/day plus 35% (!) tax. There are several less expensive public parking lots within short walking distance, some open 24 hours and others that close between about 10pm and 5am, but you need to pay for each stay which can be inconvenient if you come and go multiple times. It\u2019s a minor complaint, but compared to other hotels in the area, $25/day did strike me as $5 or more too much. Our fourth-floor queen room was very clean, well decorated, nicely appointed, and very smartly designed. It was not large, but had ample room for the two of us with plenty of closet and dresser space for storing clothes and suitcases. It was well insulated from the outside, hallway, and adjacent rooms so noise was not noticeable. The excellent marble bathroom with large stand-up shower includes heated floors, which is a great touch during the cold months. Bedding, towels, and toiletries were top-notch. The flat-screen TV was larger than average for a hotel room and all of the power, audio, and video connections a business or personal traveler could need were positioned in one convenient panel over the desk. Wi-fi was free, as were all local and long distance telephone calls, another nice touch which I hadn\u2019t seen before in any hotel. The in-closet combination safe was big enough to hold a laptop in addition to other valuables. The climate controlled worked well, as expected. The alarm clock included a radio and a docking/charging station which fit multiple sizes of iPhones/iPods. The real value of the stay though may have been the hot breakfasts (easily a $15/person value at a local restaurant) which were served in large dining room on the lower level. Over the holidays, serving hours were extended from 7am to 11am. There were three very good options, two hearty and one light with fruit, and all included coffee or tea, various juices, and choice of bread. All the staff throughout the hotel, especially in the restaurant, were very friendly and helpful.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cFantastic choice in downtown Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "RPaderna", "ReviewID": "UR121964399", "Content": "I recently completed a 4 day stay at the St. Regis Hotel in downtown Vancouver.

On checking in, after being rushed through the information about the hotel whilst the gentleman behind the desk talked to other employees around me, I was given a room on the 1st floor. As I was only staying one night at the end of a long trip, I didn't bother questioning it and figured it might not be so bad. I was wrong - room overlooked noisy street and if it were not for the earplugs I had on me, I wouldn't have slept a wink. Very noisy. I understand the location is smack in the centre of everything and therefore noise is to be expected, also understand being an older boutique building the insulation isn't the greatest - so just keep in mind if you want a restful sleep here, bring earplugs and we prepared to hear everything going on outside as if it were happening in your room. The room itself is lovely. Very tastefully decorated in pale hues and dark wood. Very small and simple - queen bed (note queen bed sizes are definitely smaller in north american than we are used to in the southern hemisphere - I was traveling alone but if I were traveling with my partner this would be a double size to us and probably uncomfortably small, but totally fine on my own). The bed was comfortable so no problems there. Desk for work and chest of drawers. That was it for what was in the room, very basic. The bathroom was huge. Not sure if this is the standard type of bathroom or if I was in a disabled room, as space was very generous, huge tub, railings etc. The bathroom was beautiful and so clean. The whole room was incredibly clean. A few things to point out - no shower cap, but all other expected amenities in the bathroom were provided. No minibar fridge - don't care about the minibar, but do like to have a fridge in the room for my own drinks, etc. Am sure if I asked they may have been able to provide it. Room service was average - server not impressive just dumped tray and left without saying a word. Chocolates on pillow on arrival, free bottles of Fiji water to drink during stay that are replenished daily, free calls - all, local, international, cellphones, etc. Free wifi within room worked most of the time okay, business centre open 24hrs, Didn't try to breakfast so can't comment on that.

But I've never had an experience like this before and was determined to also put my two cents in. Also, all of these problems occurred during Grey Cup weekend (which we had never heard of before beginning our stay in Vancouver). Pros: Nice enough rooms (if on the small side). Pretty good room service. Very friendly staff. Cons: Terrible drop-off situation. Experienced actual road rage while attempting to drop off our bags. Highest noise levels I have ever experienced in a hotel/hostel ever, anywhere. Partiers/drunks congregate at the intersection and nearby businesses, which contributes to the noise levels. Does not seem to have any ability to quiet down neighboring businesses. Did not handle the Grey Cup situation very well. Not particularly cheaper than other downtown hotels that don't have the previous cons. First off, my girlfriend booked this thinking it was the St. Regis chain. Would not have been a problem if the stay had been better, but they need some serious disclaimers on the website explaining the situation. As far as the actual stay goes, the drop off area is borderline traumatic. Basically they have you double park in one lane of a VERY busy, very angry, two lane street. All the other drivers don't see the hotel signs and think you are being a jerk. This was a friday evening and drivers were PISSED OFF. We were dropping off luggage from our rental car before driving the car back to the agency and were probably in that spot for 5-7 minutes. I was honked at, shouted at (\"in Canada, that no stopping sign means no stopping\") and generally abused by the other cars... As my girlfriend was pulling away and turning off her blinkers, an SUV with BC plates honked, swerved around us, cut us off and then, after we honked, hit the brakes, trying to get us to rear-end him. He flipped us off before driving away. During busy times, the hotel absolutely should have someone outside protecting drivers and generally absorbing this abuse. Onto the room situation. As we were checking in, my girlfriend asked for a higher room, but were told second floor was the only one available (due to the grey cup). We got to the room and found that it was very noisy, with many drunks shouting on the street and a bus stop directly across from us where the busses made BEEP BEEP BEEP noises every five minutes. The windows did absolutely nothing to absorb this noise. I decided to suck and up and sleep with ear plugs and a pillow over my head. Then at about 10:30pm, a bar started blasting music, making sleep impossible. I called down and was again told no other rooms were available. The guy at the desk said things might calm down by midnight.. Midnight came and went with just as many drunks still lining the streets and the bars making ZERO effort to do any noise control or keep patrons from hanging out outside. In fact, the bar near us turned the music UP at around 1am. At this point I called down and told the front desk we would be moving to another hotel immediately. We ended up booking a significantly larger, completely quiet room at the Four Seasons for not a lot more money. Overall, we had a terrible, stressful experience. The only reason the St Regis did not get a 1 rating was that the next day the manager was very very nice and understanding and canceled charges for both the night we tried and failed to use and the next night we canceled. Besides these issues, the hotel has friendly staff and the rooms are nice enough (although a bit on the small side if you're staying as a couple). Based on my experience and other reviews, it seems like they have a few problem rooms where the noise levels are not adequately contained. Additionally, it seems to be a highly intoxicated location which contributes to the noise levels. They either need to put a lot of effort into sound proofing these rooms or give guests a serious disclaimer about the noise level when reserving them (don't just assign guests to the problem rooms and hope for the best). It is a downtown location, but other downtown hotels do not seems to have these problems (we are currently blissfully, quietly, happy at the Four Seasons). I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and hostels and this was the first time I've ever walked from a hotel I'd checked into. One other suggestion: Given the number of times the \"Grey Cup\" was mentioned in relation to these problems, it would have been nice if they had called and given a bit of warning. CFL is not covered at all in America and we had no idea the Grey Cup existed or would cause so many problems.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDried milk and dissapointing reception staff.\u201d", "Author": "aliqmul", "ReviewID": "UR121062213", "Content": "We stayed in the St Regis hotel for a week in November. On arrival, the initial impression was that the hotel was smart, and with an excellent city centre location. On checking in, we quickly discovered that the staff on the front desk were not particularly friendly, and that they were often distracted by other things that were going on behind the desk (answering phones to other guests, talking to their colleagues about some issue, trying to change the volume of the music playing)........this, unfortunately led us to feel like we were not particularly valued guests and that we were a bother. The room (201) was of a good size with a walk in wardrobe and plenty of room to fit our luggage. The decor was tasteful and the cleanliness generally good. We were dissapointed that the view was out onto a flat roof of the adjacent restaurants and their air conditioning units, and as a result were unable to open the window due to the noise. With the window shut the units were also audible and so for the purposes of quietness, I would not recommend this room. The bathroom had all of the extras that you would expect and also was of a decent size. Unfortunately the please tests of the bathroom was marred by the shelf under the sink which had a missing support so repeatedly fell off. The cleaner seemed to ignore this by putting it back up after every time it had fallen, and balancing fresh towels on it......very frustrating! Tea and coffee were provided, but the milk was powdered.......dissapointing and surprising for a hotel that sells itself as being upmarket. One of the much better aspects of the stay was breakfast. Our host was polite, attentive, and the breakfast was delicious, freshly cooked and timely. St Regis has got this just right.

Next the room.. nice corner room with plenty of light on the 4th floor. Very clean and beautifully decorated and fitted out, the bathroom was the best we have had on this trip. Breakfast was included (as was overseas and local phone calls surely the first of any hotel to offer this?) .... back to the breakfast... served in the lower ground level. There was one waitress for all of us during the week, I wish I could remember her name as she was great. Very efficient and friendly... I noted on weekends they had 2 younger girls who struggled to keep up with what she did alone! Plenty of options to choose from and all very nice (we went through the whole menu by the time we left!) The business centre, near reception, was great. Free computers to use and a little lounge with large television. Free wifi also included. Location of this hotel was great for us, very near to the Skyrail to the airport, shopping a plenty but can't rave about the restaurants/cafes nearby. We did eat in the hotel restaurant on the first night and that was good, little noisy with all the tv's going but no complaints re the food.

On my first visit: location (near Canada Line), rooms really comfortable & quiet, bed really comfortable & friendly welcome. All looked good. On my arrival I asked about getting a light breakfast before 7 am as I had an early flight to catch. I was told breakfast started at 7 am but if I came down early I would be able to get something. The following morning I came down to find that I couldn't access the breakfast lounge & the concierge. though very pleasant, said he couldn't do anything to help me now. I left disappointed & said so at the time. A few days later the hotel sent me an email asking for feedback. Needless to say I provided it! What surprised me was the prompt personal response from the manager (Jeremy Roncoroni), he apologised & explained I had highlighted an issue with staff training which he would address. He also offered me a room upgrade from my return stay. On my return stay, I was delighted with the room. What delighted me was I received a personal note & a complementary bottle of wine (which amazingly included 3 glasses which recognised that I was now travelling with my sister & her husband). This amazed me and showed a great attention to detail. I checked out in the morning & Jeremy approached me at the desk to check if everything was ok. The bottom line was that I was blown away at how this hotel took its feedback seriously. I think you can tell so much more about a place by how they deal with their mistakes. Well done St Regis & I would have no hesitation in staying here again. One small point was that the lobby/lounge bar was very noisy when I stayed. I understand that this was due to a major sporting event & reopening of the Stadium at Vancouver.

I had back to back meetings with 2 potential investor groups. As it was so last minute, my favorite hotel that I usually stay at was booked. One of my staff instead booked me a room at a hotel I had not heard of before called \"the St. Regis.\" I got a late start from Seattle and then had a delay at the border. I was unable to reach my contact from the first group to let them know I was running late. I didn't know what to expect of the hotel. I arrived at the hotel 5 minutes late for my first meeting. I rushed into the very nice lobby and approached the desk where the person behind the desk was busy checking in someone else. He looked at me and said \"you must be Dr. Failla\" He welcomed me to the St Regis and someone else then came and welcomed me from a business area behind the desk. He told me that some people had arrived to meet with me and he had them waiting in the a very nice room off to the left of the front desk. He asked if I would like to use a conference room. The room my group was already sitting in looked as perfect as one could ask for and so I asked if we could just meet in there. He said fine. He took my credit card, checked me in, parked my car and brought my bags to the suite while I greeted and met with my guests. My guests were comfortable and happy. They had been offered and served refreshments before by the front desk staff even before I met them. I applaud you St. Regis for 5 star customer service! We simply closed the door and had a good meeting. After the meeting was over they gave me the key to the room. My bags were there. They had given me a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was wonderfully comfortable and appointed with a see through fireplace seperating the sleeping room and the living room and desk area. Even though the hotel is in the heart of downtown there was not any street noise. It was quiet and peaceful.....a true oasis in the heart of the city. For my next meeting they put me in the stunning conference room. Once again the staff made sure everyone was comfortable. They didn't even know ahead of time that I was having meetings there and they made it so perfect! As it turns out the St Regis is in the heart of everything. You couldn't ask for a more perfect location with the best shopping, restaurants and nightlife a short walk away. The Concierge suggested and made a reservation for us at a place called Coast. Coast is now my favorite restaurant in Vancouver! They also sent us to another amazing place.....called Sanafir. Sanafir reminds me of the \"Buddah Bar\" in Dubai. Anyway, the final surprise was when the bill arrived. There were no charges for the internet or phone calls. There were no charges for the use of the the conference room. The bill was so reasonable and the final tally so much less than I am used to paying in Vancouver that I had to read it twice to make sure it was right. Thank-you St Regis for everything.

The second room was at the front of the hotel with a street view but was even smaller than the first room. Fortunately I was on my own as two people in the room would have been quite tricky!... 2. The business office consists of 2 computers off the lobby and no printer that I could find.... 3. The bar is a seedy sports bar.... 4. There is no restaurant and the room in which breakfast is served has the ambience of a railway station cafeteria.... 5. There is only one elevator used by both staff and guests and is very European in size, ie. holds about 4 max. We found it quicker to walk up and down. ... 6. There are no business meeting rooms in the hotel, you have to rent a room at a university building down the street. Positives... 1. The staff were very friendly... 2.

Pros: Very friendly, pleasant and efficient staff, they work hard to give you city information, directions, restaurant suggestions. The room I had (#301) did not have street noise from below, although some of my associates staying on the 1st floor did hear some night sounds from the street. Great location, being just a few blocks from the Robson Street shopping district, a few blocks from the waterfront, next door to a T station (Granville stop) and bus routes. The room is a bit small, but very clean and well appointed with muted color theme and blackout windows (plus a small window that actually opens)- a large walk in closet with light and safe and iron/board, dresser, desk and chair with lamp and computer hookups, flat screen TV with a good choice of channels plus on demand movies ($), upholstered chair and a very comfortable bed with pillow top. The desk includes a note pad and pen. The bathroom is a good size with nice glass & tile shower (hand held with holder), plenty of hot water, and nice marble and decorative tile with dark cabinets and wood decoration. You get 2 big towels, 2 vanity towels and 2 face cloths. The toiletries include shampoo, conditioner, lotion and a vanity kit of nail files, cotton pads and qtips. You get a large rectangular bar of soap - my only comment would be having 2 bars would be nice so you are not always moving it from the shower to the sink. The coffee maker is located in the bathroom - reg and decaf coffee and some tea, coffeemate (real cream like Land O Lakes mini-moos that don't need refrig would be nicer), and a hair dryer There is a lighted makeup mirror and two nice robes. There's an IPod docking station/clock as well, but I could not figure out how to set the alarm, so I had the front desk set up wake up calls for me that worked well. The surprises I mentioned above include: (1) you can get a free day pass from the front desk to the Steve Nash gym next door to the hotel (nice facility with all expected machines and free weights, dressing rooms with locks you can set yourself, towel service - no pool.) (2) the breakfast is included in the room cost and is substantial and in a very pretty wood panelled room in the basement that has flat screen TV's; there are 3 breakfast choices consisting of a bacon/egg type combo (apple chicken sausage or ham available) with toast and potatoes or you can swap potatoes out for a nice fresh fruit cup, and fresh juices (orange, pink grapefruit, cranberry, apple); a second choice of a continental breakfast that can be a belgium waffle, danishes, yogurt and fruit or their own granola (good); or a third choice of omlett with all the fixin's and toast. There's a variety of good bread choices for toast, and for the gluten free folks a tasty rice bread toast. (3) worldwide phone calls are free; (4) the St. Regis bar next door is a large open space pub-like woody area with good beer choices and tasty food (I ditto the previous steak sandwich thumbs up from another reviewer.) (5) Gotham steak house is next door on the other side and is a very pretty bar with good steaks if a bit expensive. There are also free apples and newspapers in the small lobby area for guests, and a business center off the lobby with free internet access and a number of terminals available. Although no transport is offered, cabs regularly drive by and the front desk will call for you. Also, the hotel has parking for $25 per day, which is one of the more inexpensive hotel parking options other than farther distance public parking. Con The elevator (only one) is tiny and you can wait a while for it, especially in the morning in the breakfast room. I took to taking the stairs, which was probably good exercise - but note the stairs are not accessible that I could see from the breakfast room. There are stairs from there into the St. Regis bar that has an entrance into the lobby, but it is closed in the morning hours due to liquor license rules.

When we arrived back in the afternoon, they greeted us by name and sent us to our room where our bags were already waiting for us. We typically only get that type of service in high-priced resorts! The room - a smart queen guestroom - was decorated with a cool blue palette that was a nice combination of contemporary with classic finishes. It wasn't a huge room but it was comfortable and the closet and the bathroom were sizeable. The shower stall and bathroom were gorgeous. The electronics panel in the room was top-notch and so much better than the typical hotel for charging anything and/or displaying your laptop on the room's flat-screen.

The location is great and the breakfast is quite simply one of the best I\u2019ve ever had in a hotel. Guests are spoilt for choice of breakfast items, which included custom omelettes, eggs, bacon, sausages, ham, toast, fruit salad, potatoes, cereal, pastries, lots of juice options, coffee and more \u2013 all presented with full table service in a nice dining room. It was a huge meal that kept us going well into mid-afternoon each day \u2013 and it\u2019s included in the price of the room, something you just can\u2019t beat. The staff at the St Regis were very friendly and knowledgeable, and we were delighted that Juan thought to tell us about the annual fireworks show happening the first evening we arrived. We were not aware it was happening and it was definitely something that was not to be missed. Our room was a queen-size and our travel companions stayed in a king-size room. The rooms themselves didn\u2019t appear to differ much in size or amenities, other than the bed in the king room being bigger. It\u2019s worth taking this into consideration if you decide to splurge and pay the higher rate for the king room. The bed was very comfortable and had European-style duvets in place of top sheets and blankets like American hotels tend to have. The bathroom was also nicely presented, had a great shower and featured under-floor heating, which is such a luxury (as were the soft, plush bathrobes that were provided)! We did think that the room seemed a little small, especially for the price we paid, but overall we were pleased with it. It would have been nice to have a fridge/mini-bar in the room and we felt this was a significant oversight for a hotel of this star rating. On more than one occasion during our stay we agreed that a fridge would have been a helpful thing to have. Noise from the street was also a minor issue for us on the Friday night of our stay. Although the room had double-glazed windows, we were on the first floor facing the street and the Friday night revellers got a little bit raucous in the wee hours of the morning! Maybe consider asking for a room higher up in the building to avoid this. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that St Regis has a lovely \u2018business\u2019 center with computers and free high-speed internet located just off the lobby. It also has a great bar right next door and attached to the hotel (breakfast is served in the basement here) \u2013 perfect for a nightcap at the end of the night.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cTruly amazing hotel in every way\u201d", "Author": "DarrenNCSU", "ReviewID": "UR116879771", "Content": "Free WiFi.

You are able to pick what you would like from their printed menu, and it is brought to your table and well as your choice of morning beverages. It was delicious! The people at the front desk were very helpful and we had the good luck of bumping into the gentleman that was working on their security system (he didn't even work directly for the hotel!)

A pleasant high-end boutique hotel which is not affiliated with chain hotels. It was completely renovated with high quality finishes throughout and not just in the lobby. Standard rooms are on the small side, but we elected to upgrade to a studio suite which had a living area, bedroom and very nice bath. The shower was a good size with high quality non-slip marble floors and very nice counter-tops. A great choice if you prefer boutique hotels that don\u2019t allow smoking or pets and want to minimize any allergies that you may have. In my mind, the hotel is not too big and not too small\u2026..just the right size! St. Regis is very well managed with excellent staff at the front desk, exceptionally clean, and offers a full breakfast in their downstairs breakfast room (perfect size with wood flooring and paneling) which is included in the price. Breakfast is not a buffet but you sit at a table and order from a fixed menu. The hot food and sides are very good and the servers are efficient with a great attitude to make breakfast a very pleasant experience and handle special requests very well. Breakfast stops at 10 AM or 11 AM on weekends. They also include free Internet and phone calls. The extras made our stay an excellent value given the disadvantage of the current USD exchange rate. Staff knows the best Vancouver restaurant scene (especially Breanne at front desk\u2026a foodie) as well as where to go and what to do no matter what the weather is. The moment you arrive it is very obvious that the staff takes a lot of pride in their services and care about their guests. They also have a good size on-site restaurant (done in very nice wood finishes) which offers an alternative if you don\u2019t want to venture out at night. The only con is their small elevator. But the hotel is just 5 stories which minimizes the wait time from floor to lobby. The City of Vancouver strictly enforces parking. There are expensive meters everywhere.

We were very impressed with this cozy, charming boutique hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It is ideally located in downtown Vancouver, within easy walking distance of many attractions or transit options (Sky Train, taxi, car rental, etc). The St. Regis has a retro, upsacle charm. It does not contain too many rooms, nor is it a high rise hotel, which also gives it a cozy, intimate feeling. There is only one elevator in the hotel, so be prepared to wait on occasion if it gets busy. Since we stayed on the first floor, we found it faster to take the stairs if the elevator was backed up. And it is the smallest elevator we have ever seen. We stayed in a Queen Suite on the first floor. The room faced onto Dunsmair and looked directly into the Tim Horton's and 24-hour A&W across the street. I would recommend trying to book a room on a higher floor, with a better view and perhaps not so noisy with traffic and pedestrians below. The Queen Suite itself was on the smallish side, with a separate sitting area (sofa, desk, chair, console table with TV), and bedroom area (queen bed + TV). The decor was classy, with a designer's touch. It was kept immaculately clean during our stay. The bathroom was luxurious and well-appointed. We found the St. Regis staff to be very accomodating and helpful. We experienced several minor issues with the room fixtures, and they were promptly fixed by the staff. The front desk staff was polite and cheerful, and they took the time to answer questions about Vancouver-area sites & attractions. Breakfast was included in our booking, a great way to start the day. The free long-distance calls, wi-fi, Fiji water, Acca Kappa spa toiletries, plush robes...all little touches that went a long way to make our stay so enjoyable. Overall, the charm, quality, location and value of the St. Regis were fantastic and we recommend it to anyone looking for hotel in Vancouver.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the St. Regis\u201d", "Author": "Jonahs", "ReviewID": "UR115996531", "Content": "We loved this hotel, with great desk service helping with what to see in the area and locations for dinner.

The negatives: (1) Get ready to hop in and out of cabs really quickly since there is not much of a place for the cabs to stop and (2) if a little street noise bothers you do not get a room with a street view.

The list of amenities included in your room rate is exhaustive: a huge hot, made to order breakfast. WiFi (which worked well for me) & use of the hotel\u2019s business center. Worldwide long distance calls. In-room bottled water (which I chugged like it was going out of style). Heck, the rooms even had a window you could open to let in the fresh mountain air & radiant heat in the bathroom floor. The location of the hotel, a block from two light rail stations & an easy walk to the hockey arena, convention center & cruise terminal, make it a great home base for both business & leisure travelers. In addition, the Starbucks in the building & the Tim Hortons across the street provide ample opportunities for caffeine. Check-in was easy, even at the dreadful hour of 1:00 am. The front desk staff was even patient in repeating most of their schpeel to me the next morning, since I had forgotten most of the key information in my jet-lagged haze. They also helped me out by converting a small sum of U.S. cash to Canadian dollars at a fairly reasonable exchange rate when my ATM card wouldn\u2019t work. My \u201cSmart Queen\u201d room on the 4th floor was indeed smart - smartly decorated & wired with smart \u201cgreen\u201d technology. The hotel\u2019s attention to detail in decorating is superb. The walls of my room were covered in one-shade-lighter-than-Tiffany-blue leather rectangles stitched together. The baseboards & crown modeling were painted a bright white & the curtains covering the room\u2019s four windows achieved something few hotel curtains do: they were both stylish & actually kept out the light. The bathroom was small, but the lay out worked well, with lots of fluffy towels, a non-wussy hair dryers, & a surprisingly large stall shower. The small closet in the room contained just enough room to store a suitcase & a few hanging items & also contained a safe large enough to fit a laptop, a great security feature. I felt like a valued guest throughout my stay, always greeted warmly by the person working the front desk when coming & going. Even Friday night, when the streets, the hotel restaurant, & the hotel rooms themselves were lined with deliriously happy hockey fans (I was there during Game 5 of the Stanley Cup - lucky the game the Canucks won, and was not there for the riots that happened a week later), service was still top notch.

When I find myself in Vancouver again, I won\u2019t hesitate to stay at the St. Regis. The three-egg omelet the size of my head alone would be worth it. Some things to consider when planning your trip to the St. Regis: - Request a corner room on a high floor. The views of downtown are great, as is the light that pours in from the numerous windows. - The elevator is small. It can really only fit four adults, with minimal luggage. A great security feature to see, though, is that the elevator is only accessible with a room key. - If you\u2019re in a hurry, let them know at breakfast when you first sit down. The speed of service can be tailored to your schedule, something I found out after having to shovel my eggs down to make an appointment I was running late for. - If you\u2019re hungry, make sure & order room service or stop by the restaurant early. The kitchen closes at 10pm & there aren\u2019t really any other places in the immediate vicinity to grab a decent late night bite to eat.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sao [paulo", "Title": "\u201cperfect !\u201d", "Author": "masffonseca", "ReviewID": "UR115092421", "Content": "Iam brazilian and spent only few time at st regis hotel , but everything was excellent !

If you are a light sleeper, and will be there on a wkend, I would recommend using earplugs in addition to a white-noise machine (we used a white noise application on our Android phone that we plugged into their clock-radio) The bathroom was very nice (shower only; large with excellent styling), as was the room itself (which had a large dresser). The bed was comfortable and firm. Clock radio had audio plug for smartphones/ipods. WiFi: they called a technician in to resolve issues plaguing guests. Once resolved, it was a little inconvenient in that it forced us to relog onto the system with both a username and password every time we re-entered the hotel. ***Mgmt: please have hotel's router cache our hardware address for 3 day periods so that we don't have to relog on every single day, often multiple times a day*** Breakfast: Filling and tasted fine, but of limited choice: every day they gave us the same three choices of a) eggs over easy b) an omelete or c) waffles (they all came with coffee/tea, a large glass of juice, toast/bagel, and hashbrowns/fruit). For a weekend trip it would have been perfect, but for a week long trip I prefer buffets with a greater selection. TV: Picture surprisingly unclear for such a modern hotel.

Upon arriving at the hotel shortly after 9 pm, the front desk clerk greeted us by name as soon as we walked in. Since I've never stayed there before, I had a feeling that this may not be all good. Indeed, she informed us , very nicely, that the hotel was overbooked due to having a very large convention in town, and unfortunately we had been the ones affected. She explained , and at the same time gave us a letter written by Front Office Operations Manager Casey Kitamura, that St Regis would arrange for us to stay at Metropolitan hotel 2 blocks away, pay for room and taxes, internet, all telephone calls and breakfast for two. In the letter, Casey emphasized that this over booking was not typical for St. Regis Hotel and hoped to welcome us again in the near future. I have frequently heard of guests being bumped to another hotel in such situations, but to have EVERYTHING ( telephone calls, breakfast) all paid for was news to me. Brittany , front desk clerk, immediately called a taxi, and out of nowhere came Ryan who loaded our luggage into the taxi while Brittany paid the taxi driver. Metropolitan was rated #8 on tripadvisor, so it was not a shabby substitute. Check in process was smooth. Another amazing part was a phone call from Brittany within 5 minutes of our arrival in our room to make sure we're happy with it. I was very impressed with this level of service and called Casey the next morning to praise his staff. I informed Casey that I would be back from my Alaskan cruise in a week and would be their guest again, and requested early check in. He immediately said he guaranteed it. Sure enough, shortly after 9 am a week later, we walked the 10 minutes from cruise terminal and arrived at St Regis, and was promptly checked into our room. We knew the elevator was small from reading reviews here at tripadvisor. It was actually bigger than the one in our hotels in Rome and Sienna. It had room for 6 passengers. During our stay, we took stairs half the time despite being on 5th floor. This small elevator and nice staircase reminded us of boutique hotels in Europe. Entrance to stairs is 10 ft from elevator, 15 ft from front desk, and required room key card to enter, so it's very secure ( as did elevator) Room was very nicely done. I paid particular attention to the quality of finishing , as some recently built establishments had poor workmanship. My room although did not have expensive furniture and wood work, the finishing was of very high quality. Even minor details like alarm clock was thought of and a couple levels above other hotels of similar classification. One feature we did not make use of was the free world wide telephone calls ( except Nigeria, I was told) but it certainly would be handy for many travelers who come from far away. When we're at breakfast the next few days, we were satisfied with the selection ( see my photo) but what was surprising was the level of service. In many places where breakfast was included, we found that the wait staff were rushed, but here they ( 3 different staff over the few days) smiled, took the time to take the order, and seem happy with their job. Back to the front desk. I asked Ryan how I could hook up my iPad 2 to the control centre to view my pictures.Minutes later, he searched the web and printed out a page on an Apple gadget that is required to make that connection, and explained that the hotel was built before there was iPad so the control centre did not have allowance for it. He further advised how I could go to Apple store two blocks away. Wow! That is service. St Regis, through the management style of General manager ( sorry I do not remember his name but it was mentioned here on tripadvisor) and Front Office Operations Manager Casey Kitamura, has indeed set the standard for service. They are proud of being ranked number 1 in service in Vancouver, and has posted this accomplishment in their elevator.

He later told me he has never heard of a hotel denying a rate posted on their web site. Keep in mind this is not a cheap hotel. When I asked to extend my stay at the front desk, I was told a room was available and it was not a problem. I then told my agent to re-book my flight to the next day.

This forced me to change my flight again as all the hotels were booked and this ended up costing me in excess of $400. When I told the desk this they said they needed proof of the costs. So not only did they make a mistake on the room being there, they then questioned if I was telling the truth.

The little touches make so much difference, like free bottled water and little bedtime choccies, but really it's the big things that count, and the St Regis has at least two really big things going for it: all telephone calls are free, global or local, courtesy of an internet phone system; and breakfast is included in the very reasonable price, and is substantial, varied and delicious. The wait staff at breakfast were wonderful - friendly, efficient, really helpful. The hotel also has a sports bar for those who like ice-hockey, and we spent a few fun hours there meeting locals and learning about the game, coinciding with Vancouver's success in the play-offs. The meals at this bar are also very good, great steak and a good wine list. Sure it's noisy, but it's fun for those who enjoy this sort of atmosphere. The first room had both a fridge and a microwave, so we were able to buy supplies and occasionally save a bit by eating in. Inexplicably, the second room, two floors up, had neither fridge nor microwave ... but this is a mere quibble.

Good downtown location., Afternoon check in staff, very friendly. We received a very welcoming greeting from the young lady at the desk. She was very pleasant and explained all about the hotel and parking situation (except for the fee and unlike the morning \"manager\"-see parking below). Cons: Breakfast is ordered from a menu and there were only 2 hard working waitresses trying to serve all the guests AND clean dirty tables. I would estimate the breakfast room has at least 20 tables for 2 and each was packed at around 9am. They seemed understaffed. So the wait for drinks and food was very lengthy. We saw people standing besides dirty tables waiting for them to be cleaned so they could get a seat. If the hotel is going to serve breakfast \"waitress style\", they must improve service and perhaps have a better system for seating people. Besides the wait, I dont enjoy eating with people standing around me waiting to sit down. Coffee cup was dirty and had to be replaced. Tea pot was cracked, leaked on table and had to be replaced. Hidden fees - Parking was never referenced on my reservation confirmation. I was charged $25 at checkout. When I questioned the morning manager he said it was mentioned somewhere on the web site. I said it should be referenced on the reservation. He said it was not on my reservation due to space considerations. Are you kidding? I showed him the print out of my reservation which was 2 pages with plenty of empty space. After arguing back and forth about unexpected parking charge he started telling me about all his years of experience in the hotel business and that parking charges are not on resevations. The fact is whether he is right or wrong I really dont appreciate checking out with a manager ( I think he was) who is defensive and argumentative. One small elevator to serve 6 floors. If you are in a rush the wait for the elevator can be frustrating. I saw people on the lower floors take the stairs. that's ok provided you are not physically unable or dont have much luggage. Hotel only has 6 floors. We had a 3rd floor room in front of hotel. We had a poor nights sleep due to cars, motorcycles, people yelling at all hours of the night (which I dont understand), and the garbage trucks in the morning. They share a parking lot with the building next door. We found it logistically inconvenient. If you are driving to the hotel, there is no room to park in front while checking in. We parked on the side of the hotel in a narrow drive way. My wife had to move the car several times to allow access for other cars until I checked in and was given the gate card for underground parking lot. We found this stressful and inconvenient.

We booked it because of the glowing TripAdvisor reviews, which have given the St. Regis a high ranking. I have to say, the manager is a genius to do this, because it works. Everything in the reviews is true, from the gorgeous remodelling of rooms, to the (slight) noise from the street below. In fact, I booked the hotel partly because it's right across the street from Vancouver's best pub by far, the Railway Club. Excellent craft beers from all over the region. You must check it out if you stay at the St. Regis. Also, all of Vancouver's greatest bands have played the Railway at one time or another. Excellent beer, pub food, and live music. Right across the street. We had only one problem. When we got to our room it had no bathtub. Make sure when you book (if you require a tub) that you specify you need a room with a tub. We were upgraded to a small suite, which was absolutely exquisite. I can't say enough how gorgeous the suite was. However, they charged us an extra $50, which was unexpected. But here's the best part. When we received the follow-up email after our visit asking us to give a glowing TripAdvisor review, I mentioned this extra room charge, and the brilliant genius manager behind this hotel refunded our $50!! The only other warning I'd give about this hotel is the $25 parking charge, which if you include the ridiculous state parking tax actually comes to $32/night!! In fact, you can find overnight parking in the area for $9 flat fee. Just ask the helpful valet at the nearby Gotham steak house for advice on where to park. The bed was great. Sheets were fine. I don't know what that other reviewer was on about, or else they bought new sheets. No wine glasses in room. That would have been nice. Breakfast was pretty good as others have said, but you can get a better breakfast in downtown Vancouver at countless restaurants. My current favourite is Joe's Cafe in the West End. I'll just make one more comment and this is a general point for all Vancouver hotels. The shower in this hotel was like most others: flow restricted, weak and insipid. If I was running a hotel in Vancouver, I'd take out those damn flow restrictors. I know of only one hotel that has great showers: the Four Seasons. Look, when patrons are paying (with tax) nearly $200 to stay a single night in a hotel, how about giving us a decent shower, eh? So how much more does it cost for the extra water and heating? 25 cents? Come on. And this is Vancouver, where it rains all the time, and water is plentiful. Get rid of the flow restrictors.

Breakfast was a good spread of bacon and eggs and juices. Location was superb, right next to the Granville Subway line or about 150 metres to the canada line which will take you to the airport. overall the stay was brilliant, beds were extremely comfy, couldnt hear noise from the streets even though we were facing Tim Hortons. Would definitely come back here again and without a doubt, its affordable, location's great and the perks that comes with it and the staff makes it very worth while. Thank you St Regis for capping our fantastic holiday to Canada.

The massage therapist, Mishal Rijal, was incredible. He is worth the trip to Vancouver! The free internet service was appreciated. The hotel has an excellent location close to the sky train, shops, the ocean as well as many superb eating establishments. The room I was in was a jr. suite. It was roomy, warm and clean. Having the covers pulled down with a St. Regis chocolate on the pillow and a beautifully hand written personalized note upon arrival made me smile.

Its location near two skytrain lines means great access all over the city. I am a relatively light sleeper, so I travel with earplugs and my iPod and accept that there will usually be some sort of noise to drown out. Unfortunately, the St Regis is one of the loudest properties I have ever stayed in. The main part of the hotel is along busy Dunsmuir Street and the Granville skytrain station - meaning that from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. I was woken up constantly by the traffic noise and the yelling bar crowd. As I was in town to write an exam at 8 a.m. the next two mornings, the terrible sleep was a problem. In the middle of the night I also found the room stiflingly hot - when I called the front desk to ask why the thermostat wasn't responding to my adjustments, they told me that the settings didn't allow it to go lower than 70 degrees. (Am I the only person who finds that too hot to sleep in, particularly with synthetic bed linens?) Opening the windows was not an option since the street noise was already intolerable. While I understand that there is a trade-off between a central location and a certain amount of city buzz, there are construction techniques that can be used to mitigate these problems: upgraded windows and insulation, heavier window coverings, adjustable ventilation systems which can contribute white noise. Sadly it doesn't appear the St Regis took any of these steps. The next morning when I informed the staff I would be checking out early due to the noise and uncomfortable temperature, they were quite rude and said I would have to pay a cancellation fee nearly equal to the value of one night's stay. While I understand hotels protecting themselves through such fees, my feeling was that these were circumstances beyond my control. However, in the end they did not charge the cancellation fee, for which I am grateful. I should also point out that they did offer to re-accommodate me elsewhere in the hotel, but due to its layout and location I wasn't convinced it would make any difference - and with my exam I couldn't take the chance of having another terrible night. Ultimately, if you are not bothered by noise, I would recommend this hotel for its price, rooms, breakfast and location. But if it's important that you get a good night's sleep - I would look elsewhere.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Castlegar, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, family orientated\u201d", "Author": "BMS3", "ReviewID": "UR97041771", "Content": "Would stay in a heartbeat, family orientated people, good and down to earth.

The location was excellent, with 10 minute walks in different directions to the harbor, Gastown, Chinatown and downtown shopping and restaurants. Important to us was the ease of walking with our luggage one block to the Sky Train station that got us inexpensively to the airport in about 30 minutes. We took that one-block walk at 5:30 in the morning, and yet felt quite safe on the well-lighted street. Ask the staff at the desk to get the correct station and train line, if you're not sure. (I believe it's the Vancouver Center Station -- not the slightly closer Granville Station). The hotel was renovated in 2008 and offers just about every modern convenience you could ask for. We stayed in a standard double guestroom, and were quite pleased with all the in-room amenities. The free breakfast not only had a good assortment of buffet items, but you could also order additional hot breakfast items that were served to your table (eggs to order, bacon, ham, etc.). We used the free pc's in the business center to check our email, and we were impressed by the ability to make free international calls. The room price was a great value considering all the above. We got a AAA rate, but be sure to bring your card -- this was the first time in our years of traveling when the check-in attendant actually asked to see our AAA card. We had no car, so parking was not an issue for us. The hotel charges $25 per day for garage parking with in-out privileges; pull up in front of the hotel on arrival to go in and get a parking pass and directions. The staff was quite helpful, especially when we asked for a Chinatown restaurant recommendation. We ended up at a great dim-sum spot that was filled with locals. A Starbucks is attached to the hotel, and several fast-food and convenience stores are very close. The St. Regis has its own steakhouse and a bar & grill, but we did not use them in our short stay.

It's now difficult to say whether St R came up to prior expectations but there was certainly no disappointment. A small hotel in centre of town, St R gave everything we needed over our 3-nights stay. In fact, so much so that we ate each night at the Bistro bar which is something else. Book a table if you go as younger business folk use the Bistro as their after-work collapse joint and business meeting venue from 4pm leaving few tables for others and it can be full by 6pm. We wondered about our decision to eat there on the first night, had become accustomed by the second and enjoyed it on the third despite everyone trying to talk above the general hub-bub. One of those perhaps rare eateries where staff know many of the diners and by our third evening we were welcomed as though we had been there for ever. Great. If a Bistro is not your style, the hotel has a quality restaurant next door with prices to match. A burger bar is immediately opposite so food would not be short. Our room was more than adequate. One thing we did find was that staff have a mental block if asked for fresh milk for room use. If what you need doesn't come in thimble sized long-life, forget it. There's a 7-Eleven, plus the burger bar, across the road for immediate needs - including milk. Breakfast was excellent and included in the room rate for us - with fresh milk for the cornies. Reception staff were ever-helpful and fell over themselves to assist. In your travels has it been noticed that when there is an error in the final bill it is rarely in the guests favour. Same here. Interestingly, our two errors involved tips in the Bistro which suggests, to me, that it is the system, not the night-auditor, which is at fault. Those ever-helpful receptionists resolved the problem promptly and efficiantly. Spouse and self would go back to St R without hesitation. Mainly, because it is more \"personal\": where a guest can be comfortable, eat and drink well without excessive cost and be served by staff who care, receive help where sought, be in the CBD and feel safe.

I immediately went downstairs and they were able to re-accommodate us to a different room without the smell. The new room was quite small but for sleeping it was fine. It was on a lower floor so the street noise was there - and although I live in the city and have lived in similar spots for many years, I live on a quieter street now so had to readjust to the \"white noise\". The bathroom was very nicely redone as was the room itself. They also had cooked to order breakfast included which was very nice indeed!

The hotel is superbly located in downtown Vancouver. It really is perfectly situated. The room was very clean and well equipped. The staff were friendly. The worst thing about this hotel is the parking arrangements. The problem for me was on arrival. It said on their website that you can stop outside the front to get a car park pass. However, all the signs on the street said you were not allowed to stop, so we stopped down a side alley instead. I ran round into the lobby to ask what we were supposed to do and apparently there is a by-law which says you can stop on any street for up to 3 minutes regardless of the signs. I suppose if you know these rules, then that is fine, but as tourists we did not. And even if we did, what if there was a queue? Could I get in and out in 3 minutes? It turns out the alley I stopped in I was even more likely to get a ticket for stopping in. All of this made our arrival very confusing and stressful. The owners of the hotel need to make the rules and directions clearer to the guests. Once we were in and sorted, our stay was lovely. Apart from the elephant that was walking about in the room upstairs (not literally, just someone was making a lot of noise), I can't complain about this place. The breakfast was average to good, but at least it was free. The free wireless was excellent and I liked the free bottles of water - a nice touch. The St. Regis turned out to be a great base for our Vancouver stay. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is the parking issue, and the fact it cost me nearly $300 per night (including parking fee of $25 per day). I just felt that I could probably have found somewhere as good for less money, but I wanted a guaranteed good place for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon.

Location is very good - centrally located in downtown near the shops and restaurants, as well as a short cab ride from the port, . Although I think that it is geared more toward business travellers than toward leisure, we still had a pleasant stay. Arrived early in the morning, and our rooms weren't ready, so Brian suggested we take a short walk over to Vancouver Island. First of all, it was probably twice the amount of time; and I wish he had mentionned the boat that takes you to the island - it would have been a much more pleasant trip in the heat than walking over the bridge. The note, from Jeremy Roncoroni, general manager, was an unexpected (and welcome touch) The rooms, minimalist but attractive, are very comfortable - our son said that it was the most comfortable bed he has ever slept on, and my complaints are few and minor. I found the tub to have an extremely high side, making it difficult to get into, and I wished that there was an outside ventilation system. As we were downtown, there was a noise factor that did not lend to a restfull night's sleep. Although breakfast is included (a welcome respite, considering Canadian prices), the atmosphere was rather austere (rather bar like in nature), and the food instutional (juices in machines, toast your own bread, egg selections limited to scrambled or fried, no omelets, coffee machines). However, given the prices, it probably works out to $15/per per person, so it is certainly an added value. Coffee wasn't good, (by my standards,: I like it strong) but there is a Starbucks in the building and a Tim Horton's across the street. Britta, who was on in the evenings, was a great resource for dinners - Cactus Club Cafe was certainly a winner. Be sure to take some time to go to the aquarium!

The linens and decor were first class, and the service was excellent. Located in downtown Vancouver, the St. Regis is within walking distance of great restaurants, shopping and the Vancouver Art Museum. A hop-on-hop-off trolley ticket for two days allowed us to get around easily, including a day in lovely Stanley Park. It is on a par with Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. This is a lovely city with friendly people, the the St. Regis fit right in. The staff were friendly, and always willing to go the extra mile, giving directions and making recommendations. Breakfast is included in the nightly rate. It includes eggs cooked to order, bacon and/or sausage, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, and a variety of breads--bagels, pastries, toast, muffins. Fresh juices, coffee, tea, and milk are included, of course. Last but not least, the place is spotlessly clean from top to bottom.

All of the staff I spoke to in the hotel were top class, even the cleaning staff were friendly and smiling. They are a real asset to this hotel. I don't know where these guys are trained but there are many top class hotels around the place that could get some lessons from the St Regis!

The rooms are a good size, very tastefully decorated with quality fitting and have a very crisp clean feel. In room wireless, air con which is very responsive, 32\"LCD, a nice desk, nice lighting and and very nice spacious bathroom. I have stayed at 5 star hotels all around the world and this room would not be out of place in any of these hotels. I had a drink at the bar adjoining the hotel and the staff there were also very friendly and the service was great. The only slight negative I could point out is the lift. It is from the original hotel so it is very small and quite slow but there are only 5 floors so it doesn't have to go far. The longest I waited was about 3-4 minutes. Ben was efficient on check in he actually informed me the lift was a little slow so I was prepared for it anyway.

The hotel has a real quality boutique feel and the room was beautifully decorated and very clean.. the bathroom was spotless. One slight gripe was that I had requested a room on a high floor (to minimise street noise). We were put on the first floor and it WAS noisy. I brought this to their attention and to be fair, they were really nice about it and said we should be able to move. Noone approached us about it on the second day so we stayed in the same room and then couldn't be bothered moving for the last night. Also, when we actually looked at the hotel, it's not that tall, so maybe a higher floor wouldn't have made any difference... we'll never know. I also had one sleepless hight because someone in the room nextdoor was watching TV loudly until 3:30 in the morning. Again, to be fair, I went down to reception and they phoned the room and asked for it to be turned down. The room (103) was small. I looked in some of the neighboring rooms on the floor as they were being cleaned and they looked a fair bit bigger, so maybe it was just this room... it was kind of on a corner. The hotel has a great location close to bus stops etc and walking distance to shops and nice restaurants. Parking is quite expensive (about $33 a night) and we weren't told about it on arrival so it was a little surprise on checkout! The breakfast (included) is really good which is a big bonus. We also had a quick meal in the bar attached which was fine. It's a really nice bar, but I wanted to pay with a traveller's cheque which the manager refused to take. I mentioned this to the reception staff and they said he should have taken it and they would raise it with him, so clearly he just couldn't be bothered... not great.

The room service button didn't work on the phone so I ordered through the front desk. Room service called me back to confirm the order. The food arrived within the hour.

No worries though, we ate whole grain toast, yogurt, fruit, and one day opted for the always available egg & pork choice. The coffee surprisingly good for coming from a big urn.

I chose the St. Regis based on reviews, price, and location. Located about a block and a half away from the City Center SkyTrain stop ($8.50 from the airport, $3.75 to the airport) in a Central Business District fringe-type environment, the St. Regis is a renovated 6(?) story building very close to other downtown hotels and the main mall. I found it to be a very clean and fresh smelling place, even in the smallish lobby. Rooms are accessed by small elevator or a wide, clean, and well lit stairwell. I found the room to be on the smaller side of medium being about 12\"x15\" and the adjoining bathroom was on the larger side of medium. The hallways and rooms are done in a grey modern tone. The rooms are equipped with a 32\" flatscreen tv. As others have noted, the mattress has a thin synthetic protective cover on it. If I didn't dig for it, I wouldn't have noticed it. I find the first night in any hotel to be a rough night. Here, I found the bed to be just below what I'd call very good. The firm mattress is buffered by a relatively thin pillow-top. The pillows were great. There has been reviews that mention how noisy the rooms are. I differ on that completely. This is a hotel in an urban center. There will be noise is downtown areas. My room was on the second floor on the Dunsmiur St side (hotel front). I heard very little and my sleep, light as it was, did not get disturbed by street old building noise. In comparison to other Vancouver stays (such as the Marriott... 300 feet from the seaplane terminal) it was soothingly quiet. On the service front, it was excellent. The front desk staff were warm and I felt that they were taking care of me. There was a hand written note welcoming me to my room and it was a nice touch. The hotel is very mindful of security. The access to the rooms is immediately adjacent to the front desk *and* you need a room key to activate the elevator at all times. No nickle and diming. The water in the room was complimentary, as was internet (and good internet speed at that). The toiletries are of good quality and there were two nice bathrobes ready for use. The room came with breakfast, that is served in a large dining area at the bottom floor of the hotel. The room is large, open, well lit and clean. The service was quite good with cheerful, fast, hot food delivery... substantial quantity too. If I were to change something it would be the quality of the juice served. The orange juice was reconstituted watery second grade supermarket box juice... really... not worth it. Unless you have to have the the spacious lobby, the extra large elevators to a high floor, or want to pay 60% more + internet charges, you should choose the St. Regis. You are very close to everything that matters and the service is first rate. \"Boutique\" hotels can be a gamble at times. The odds are well in your favour at this one.

There was no valet service or no sign for parking. Corner of Seymour & Dunsmuir were very busy street and after driving around both corner from Seymore to Dunsmuir still couldn't find any signs. Called hotel and was told to park in front of the hotel and just turn on emergency light and there's parking structure next to hotel that we need to pick up key from front desk. I did see that alley but has sign you can't go in. It took us 15mins just go around the block to come back to front of the hotel because it was one way street. My husband was in the car with emergency light and I ran in and ask front desk for key so he can park the car. Night clerk at front desk told me, I needed to check in in order for them to give us key to park our car, meantime, my husband is in the car with emergency light, everyone behind him are honking. I demand a key first because she was having me wait to service other guest that arrived after me and was given key that end up not working, my poor husband had to wait for another customer to arrive before he can enter the parking building that is next to St. Regis. By the time she finished check me in, she has given me receipt for 3 nights when I only book for one night, good thing I had confirmation with me for 1 night, ( I HAD BOOKED DIRECTLY WITH St. Regis, didn't use any 3rd party service). It took about good 25 mins by the time we arrive to our room, when I tried to use my key to enter the room, key wasn't working and I was kept trying. Few minutes later, someone open the door !!!! OMG, she has given us wrong room. Went back to front desk and asked to give us another room because someone else was already in it. She tried to give us room next door but another clerk told her that room was just been occupied by another guest. When she gave us another room on different floor, I had asked her to make sure and she said this time she knew she won't make the same mistake. When we finally got to our 2nd room, room was exactly what I had expected, this was reason why I wanted to try St. Regis. We visit downtown Vancouver about every 2months for personal and business. I love to try new hotels price arrange from $100 to $200. And we have company Christmas Party later this month so I already booked 2 rooms for staff and just wanted to make sure my choice was good choice. So when we wanted to come to Vancouver on Thanksgiving weekend for one night, I wanted to try, just to make sure. Good thing I did, because all the bad experience, by the time we were in the room, no matter how good the room was, it didn't matter. They spoil everything for us. One very strange thing was, I found very nice hand written St. Regis card with manager's signature address to us next to guestbook, how is that possible ? So 2nd room was correct room after all. I did find two long hair on bathroom floor and had to walk in rain to return parking key. With all this, they still charge $25 for parking ! Should have stay other hotel that offers valet parking.

After a LONG flight from the East Coast and a 25-30 minute cab ride, my sister and I arrived at the St. Regis around 2am. IVAN (graveyard shift) checked us in promptly and professionally, and made us feel very welcome. We had room 105 at first, which I felt was not suitable since we needed two beds. Booked through a third party, so the preference was not conveyed properly. Not the hotel's fault, and after a quick phone call downstairs Ivan was waiting and ready to take us to room 112, which was satisfactory and our HAFH for 5 exciting days and 5 amazing nights. Vancouver is a super cool city, and the people made it even better. Those Canadians really are nice, Eh? The room was spacious with two double beds, one flat screen TV with decent amount of US programming, relatively large marble bathroom with double sinks (major extra points here) and medium sized walk in shower. Electronic safe was easy to use, and AC worked well. The only thing I really craved was an iPod dock to play music whilst getting ready or lounging. Breakfast ends around 10am so we were down there around 9am every morning. I never saw the waitstaff turn anyone away if they came right at ten, so maybe on weekends they extend the time until a little later. The waitress is nice but didn't catch her name, and CRAIG is the other waiter who also works at the front desk. Whatever your question, Craig is the guy to ask. Very knowledgeable and detailed in his instructions. I was able to have my choice of coffee, OJ, small bowl of cereal, toast, muffin, cooked eggs, bacon and potatoes. They have more options, just ask and they will most likely have it. We didn't have anything planned, and was going to wing it this trip so we went to the front desk to ask for directions to Robson Street. BENJAMIN (morning shift) pointed us in the right direction, as he did every morning thereafter. Just like the staff before him, he was courteous and helpful. Benji and Juan helped me find a Vietnamese restaurant for lunch one day, and it didn't matter that it took 15 minutes but the fact that they kept patiently searching is something a world traveller like me totally appreciates. Thanks guys! Robson street is lively, with tons of stores, restaurants and cafes. We came here everyday, which is totally unnecessary but we just loved hanging out with zero direction. Very fun at night, too. We took a cab to Yaletown Brewery for lunch, and it was a comfortable, darkly lit space with a view into their brewing room. Food was tasty, and the Wheat Ale was refreshing. You can walk, just mind that it's about 15 minutes. Dinner at Glowbal was a tad too noisy and food too salty for a future return trip. The next morning my friend came to stay with us, which made her the third person in the room. Still pretty comfortable with 3, but may opt for a suite or connecting rooms next time. We also had a sushi dinner at Blue Water Cafe one night and it was pretty good, but not the best I've had. There's a mall right around the corner with a Sephora, in case you forgot anything you can pretty much find it in there. I brought an umbrella since it was going to rain nearly everyday, but the front desk has some available for your use. Two computers in the side room and a mini library with books. Low key pub next door with a friendly Russian bartender and reasonably priced drinks. They had drink specials everyday for around 5 bucks. Also showed the Machida UFC fight on Saturday night, fyi for my fellow fight fans. ADRIAN (afternoon shift) helped secure reservations at Cin Cin. I can't even tell you how great the customer service is at this hotel! You could be wandering aimlessly by the front with a blank look on your face and someone will inquire if you needed anything, without being intrusive. Gym passes to nearby Steve Nash Sports Club are 15 bucks a day. This is the first time I did not go to the gym, so I cannot tell you more than that it seemed top notch from pictures I saw online. Ate at Cin Cin the last night, and while service was lukewarm and even borderline unacceptable, food was good to great depending on what you ordered. Wine was excellent, never even heard of Okanagan wine which was surprisingly nice. We frequented the Loose Moose (divey but fun bar) two times, liked the unpretentious and lively atmosphere. Two tiny nitpicks, one the cleaning...the woman is very sweet, the level of cleanliness is high, but maybe they need to hire one extra maid? Our rooms were always cleaned last or next to last around 3-4pm, which was slightly annoying. Also, one of the girls at the front desk was indifferent, so maybe at another hotel it would have been standard but at the Regis it definitely stood out. There's one elevator which could be slow at times, but there is a stairwell and hotel is only five stories high. Exchange place one block away that had good rates. Craig can tell you where it is. Noise level was low, never even unpacked the earplugs! Location was convenient, we either walked or took a taxi everywhere. As many other people already mentioned, the train station is 1 block away. Juan checked us out on the last day, and there weren't any sketchy charges or anything so we were off with smiles. Overall, I loved this place, you will probably love it too, and we'll be back in January '10!", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cLovely little hotel\u201d", "Author": "VWebb", "ReviewID": "UR47917253", "Content": "I booked two rooms here and was pleased with them both.

Other great perks were the location (just one block from the metro), free local phone calls (amazing in this day and age), and free wifi. Downsides: The breakfast which was just o.k., mainly because some of the wait staff are not good communicators. (Example, my wife asked for TWO fried eggs, \"over-easy.\" The waitress asked what that was and we (assuming that perhaps fried egg terminology was different in Canada than the US) explained that it means to flip the fried egg over halfway through cooking so both sides of the white are cooked and the yolk is cooked slightly. Her response, \"oh, that's called a fried egg.\" She returned a few minutes later with one fried egg, over hard. Go team!) Breakfasts aside, the stay was just about perfect. The only other thing that could have been improved is that the low-flow showerhead was very weak -- the kind that requires you to rise off one inch of your body at a time.

The room was beautiful and it was great being able to control the temperature (with a thermostat) ourselves. The staff was very friendly and helpful which always makes a hotel stay better. We ate at the hotel restaurant (St.Regis Bar) both nights and the food was excellent. We had four different entrees between the two nights and we loved them all. The restaurant has almost the same exact menu as room service so you can basically see the menu before you go there. The prices in the restaurant are a couple of dollars cheaper than room service, and don't come with an $8.00 delivery charge, so you are better of going there. Breakfast was also very good. The cooked potatoes were very salty in my opinion, but they were still delicious. Having the free internet in the lobby was extremely helpful considering we had a rental car but no directions to where we wanted to go. In the informational book inside the room it says that you can print from the computer for a small fee, but I was not charged anything. Or, if you have a laptop you can connect it to the wall in your room and view your computer screen (and DVDs) on the large flat screen tv in the room which I thought was really neat! There were only two things we didn't like, but they were minor and not enough to change my opinion of the hotel. First, we had a room facing the street and it was quite busy and noisy. I did not mind the noise at night and lost no sleep because of it, but my husband did not sleep very well. He heard every bar fight and ambulance that went by (which seems to happen more often than you would think). Also, the first time parking can be quite stressful since the parking garage is in the tiny back alley behind the hotel. If you just remember that even though the hotel is on the busy 3 lane one-way street, there is 3 minute parking available directly in front of the hotel doors on Dunsmuir St. From there the staff can help you get out your bags and show you to the garage. We initially passed up the hotel and got caught in a series of one way streets where you couldn't make left hand turns, and ran into a closed Granville street, all of which threw us way off course. When you have hundreds of people walking around, and cars being rerouted due to construction, it can get very crazy very quickly!! On the plus side, the parking garage is very nice, clean, and safe since you need a magnetic card to get through any door or even operate the elevator. I would gladly stay here again now that I know to get a room facing the alley and how to park!!", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBliss\u201d", "Author": "ScotsWanderer101", "ReviewID": "UR36997625", "Content": "A fantastic hotel with excellent staff and food.

This small boutique hotel is centrally located in Downtown Vancouver and is an incredible value for the price. The newly remodeled rooms look great, and the beds are fantastic. I had a better night's sleep than I've had in quite some time. PRICE: We booked a \"Smart Double\" from the hotel's website for just $109CAD. For that, you get about the best location imaginable and a lot of extras. This hotel doesn't nickel and dime you either; there was a generous supply of free bottled water in the room, free internet, chocolates on the bed, even a free cooked to order bacon and eggs breakfast. ROOM: Our room was a bit on the small side but had a big bathroom with two sinks and good lighting. There was a large shower but no bathtub. The shower itself worked well and there seems to be no plumbing problems in this historic building. Our room was nicely decorated with the most comfortable beds! And the room also had a plasma TV. I don't believe they actually subscribed to any HD channels to go with it, but we had full cable TV -- about 50+ channels. INTERNET: The room is wired for all this stuff, and internet access is free; but the computer stayed at home on this trip. To check email or use the web, you can use the business center off the lobby and save yourself the trouble of lugging around the laptop. BREAKFAST: They serve breakfast until 10AM on weekdays, and even later on the weekends! So many places cut off breakfast early, so this was a pleasant surprise. In addition to made-to-order bacon and eggs, you can also grab toast and pastries from the continental breakfast bar. We had good table service. Our waiter brought us coffee and even my toast when it was done toasting. PARKING: The hotel charges $25/day for self-parking in the garage of the building next door. It wasn't totally clear to us how to get in and out of the garage on foot until we left, but otherwise, the parking was reasonable and included in and out privileges until check-out time. We wanted to stay in our parking spot after check-out (to see more of the city) and the hotel staff happily obliged. LOCATION: The St. Regis is close to everything! We walked to Granville Island and to the West End. It's a bit of a walk to go as far as Denman Street, but walking down Robson is a great way to spend a few hours. Canada Place and Pacific Centre are literally within a few blocks. Gastown is just a few blocks in the other direction. You could walk to Chinatown -- several blocks east of the hotel -- but I'd recommend against it. The neighborhood between the hotel and Chinatown is a bit dicey, with addicts and prostitutes congregating. It's probably more annoying than anything, but not Vancouver's best side in any event. SKYTRAIN: The hotel is literally next door to the Granville Station, and that may be an option for getting around, along with Translink buses. I checked the prices and they sell day passes for something like $9CAD. You can buy them across the street at Shopper's Drug Mart. Buses, SkyTrain and SeaBus (to North Vancouver) are all included on this pass. I would emphatically recommend this hotel. The staff is helpful and pleasant, the location is awesome, the amenities are mostly included in the price, and the value for money is as good as it gets. What a great base for exploring Vancouver. PS -- I didn't mention the restaurants, but the hotel has its own bar and grill. They also have relationships with a couple of others, including the fancy Gotham Steakhouse next door.

What to like: + great and clean rooms. + friendly staff, especially Benjamin at the front desk (seems to work most evenings) who had great suggestions for restaurants. If you're going out for dinner and don't know where to go but know what kind of food you want ask him for advice, we did it three nights in a row and were delighted with the food every time. + Complementary water bottles on the room every day, great for days of shopping or sightseeing. + Good hot breakfast. + Wireleess internet worked great. Maybe not very high speed but much better than on most hotels. What's not that good: - A bit noisy rooms at night (traffic and loud people on the weekend). Did not disturb me but if you need complete quiet when you sleep you might have a bit of trouble. I don't know how this is compared to other hotels downtown, might be hard to get it completely quiet downtown. - Showers: No bathtub in room 503 but instead shower with many settings on the showerhead (normal, rain, champagne, jet, massage).

You can purchase a temp membership to the Steve Nash gym next door, I would have liked to use this but the gym wasn't open late enough on weekends for me to use it. Parking is in the condo building next door on P1 so not directly linked to the hotel, though it would only take 5 minutes from leaving the hotel to your car door. The hotel also had a nice touch of leaving a welcome card and the business card of the general manager in an envelope on the bed when you first enter, it was hand written as well, so a nice gesture.

Our group had to book a lot of rooms last minute because our previous reservations fell through. This hotel is not ostentatious, it is actually difficult to find their front entrance, but the staff is very friendly, the rooms are comfortable, particularly for the rates they charge, and it's a good downtown location. They know what amenities are needed and how to keep costs down. All the rooms are labeled \"suites\". There are down comforters, and large pillows. We had a double room which included 2 full size beds (some other hotels in Vancouver have double rooms with twin size beds), a couch, bureau, TV, and desk. Shampoo and soap are in dispensers attached in the tub. Our room was decently sized, but I think all the room layouts are different. The rooms have window AC units, which is difficult to use, because you have to keep the curtains open to get any airflow, and there was an office building across the street, so you have to weigh the options between a cool room and privacy. We had brought a little mini fan which helped to circulate the air. You need a key card to access the elevators and the stairwells are locked most of the day, so the building is pretty secure. Breakfast is included in the morning in a lower level eating area. It is the same everyday: assortment of breads and muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea. If you want something hot, there is a Tim Hortons across the street and Starbucks attached to the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to Gastown, Pacific Centre Mall, and the convention center/cruise dock. The only negative thing about this hotel is there is no onsite parking. They recommend you park your car at Pacific Centre Mall, which is the most expensive place (though secure) at $22/day (if you park on Sunday it is only $4, but you have to move your car by 5am the next day).
