This hotel was beautiful. Well, let me clarify. The lobby and ground floor were nice, and our room (a corner room on the 32 floor) was unbelievable. Glass walls on two sides, views of the bay, huge flat screen, entry foyer, wonderful bed with premium egyptian cotton sheets, desk facing the water with computer set up and free wifi, and enormous marble bathroom with beautiful tub, rainforest shower, tv, and top of the line robes and towels. The housekeeping service was attentive, nonintrusive, and detail-oriented. Illy espresso machine, light dimmers... I could go on and on. As far as other things in the hotel go- we didn't eat at DB Bistro, but we did check it out - very Mad Men styled. The gym was amazing - views over the water, tons of machines, and an overall zen-like atmosphere, surprisingly! A few less than stellar points, however - the pool, while very pretty (and empty every time we went) is not in the direct sun, and is on the 19th floor, so the view from the pool is of the complex across the street. The hot tub was minuscule (but luckily, there was also never anyone ever there!). Also, we were really excited about the basketball court, but the ball court and tennis court are actually the same court, so the hotel either converts it into one or the other. While we were there, it was a tennis court reserved for Sony Ericsson open. Also, parking was $35 a night, plus valet, so factor in a tip every time you want to drop off/pick up your car. These little drawbacks were insignificant, however, compared to the beauty of our room. We biked to South Beach, and it wasn't far at all.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is amazing!\u201d", "Author": "GlobalTraveler72", "ReviewID": "UR126491303", "Content": "This hotel has one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in.

Very nice, modern hotel. The rooms were very comfortable, good size and state of the art. There was a computer with free wifi in our room. The views were amazing. Took part in the Club level. The service was very good and the breakfasts very nice, although it would have been nice if they had rotated at least one new item each day. The \"buffet\" was exactly the same every morning. Likewise, the nightly appetizers were a little uninventive and weak. Still, all in all, a good value. The pool was very modern and nice with an excellent view. It was quiet despite being on the 19th floor in the middel of a busy city. Sun was a bit of gamble at the pool as the neighboring buildings would often shadow the pool. There were some other unique offerings by the pool such as a billiards table, a full size indoor basketball court and a virtual bowling alley. All impressive, but all required additional fees which really made them worthless. The casual restaurant on the second floor was OK, nothing to rave about. We did not rent a car because the cost of parking at the hotel was about $30 a night. There was a great water taxi to South Beach available about a 10 minute walk away. The water taxi took about 20 minutes to get to South Beach and was a great boat ride. It cost $40 round trip for two adults. Not too much to do in the downtown in Miami. Not a thriving downtown area like NYC or Boston, for example. Everything is nearer to South Beach.

First the positives: * Good location - several restaurants are walkable or within a short driving distance, but there are also multiple restaurants on-site. It is centrally located to Miami Beach, and other downtown Miami hot spots. * Staff was top-notch - probably the most friendly, polite, and helpful staff in downtown Miami. I cannot say enough good about the staff. The front desk, concierge, cleaning staff, etc., were all excellent. * It's not fair for anyone to expect it, and I'm not sure it would have affected the review, but we were upgraded from a standard room to a beautiful suite (for no reason, just that the hotel wasn't crowded that weekend, and the staff was being nice). * The room was very large and very clean (floor, restroom, bedding, etc., were all very clean). The room was also very quiet. We heard no noise from neighboring rooms, nor from the outside. * Normal rooms contain one large beautiful 52 inch TV - suites contain TWO 52 inch TVs and one smaller TV embedded in the bathroom mirror. Couches and beds are very comfortable. This may not be important to you if vacationing in Miami. But if it's raining, or, if you're exhausted from a long day of touring, the rooms provide a nice, quiet, atmosphere to relax. * The rooms are also very business friendly. In our suite was a computer terminal connected to the internet. No, it is not a full-fledged PC. But, for 90% of the things you need to do while traveling (looking up restaurants, directions, menus, things to do, etc.) web access without bringing your own PC is great. They also have a nice desk working area. Now the negatives: * Note: These negatives are just being really picky, so I really wouldn't put too much weight to them. * There is a small coffee bar with pastries, bagels, etc., that would be great for a small breakfast. It would have been nice if the coffee bar was open a few more hours during the day (especially the morning). Also, my wife craved a Starbucks (like are found in many Marriott hotels). * While the hotel's restaurants were quite good. They were also quite expensive, and the food was not quite up to other high-end, top-notch Miami restaurants. (Note that the ambiance and the service at the restaurants were, once again, excellent).

There is a plethera of good hotels to choose from and I decided to treat myself for a couple of days. I considered the obvious: Four Seasons, Mandarin, etc. But I decided this was one of only two JW properties that carries the Marquis designation and I knew is was less than a year old, so I figured it would be there to impress. It was. It is at the southern end of downtown Miami, across the street from the Knight Center, Miami Tower, and easy walking distance to Bayside and walkable to the northern end of Brickell Ave. It could not be more central. It is attached to the new Wells Fargo tower. Both buildings are all glass and marble. The lobby is elegant, but simple. All marble and wood. Reception and check in were simple, quick and efficient. You begin to notice the technology when you are required to get your room key close to a sensor in the elevator to go up. The process is the same for the room door - get the key close, but no swipe or insertion. The room was beautiful. On the east side of the building, on the 34th floor, I had a view of the bay, port and many other buildings. Floor to ceiling glass provided the view. There is a large flat panel tv - I would guess 50 inch on the wall. The desk had a built in computer with internet access and wi-fi was free and blazing fast. The bathroom was all marble, had two sinks, a tub and shower and plenty of other treats, including a second tv in the bathroom mirror that is visible from the shower and tub (But not throne). The mini bar was well stocked and surprisingly affordable ($4 soft drinks, $5-6 beers, etc). I ordered room service both nights I was there. They arrived in 15-20 minutes with a pleasant employee. A burger and two beers ran $32 all in - frankly less than I thought it would be. And it was well prepared. I looked at the exercise and entertainment facilities that take up two entire floors. The weight / exercise room is as good as some cutting edge gyms. It is the best hotel gym I have ever seen. There is also a spa, which I believe has some cost. Additionally there is a pool on 19th floor, a full court indoor basketball court, a virtual bowling ally, billiards, and a golf school, yes inside. I did not try the restaurants. The ground floor French restaurant looked nice, but frankly was above the price point my company would pay. Again, it looked nice though. The hotel bar is on the second floor, which is a bit afar from the lobby. I usually like to have a drink and people watch, but the location is not good for that. Also on the second floor is a nice lobby with fireplace to sit. It was raining one day I was there and the tv lost its signal for quite some time. They use Direct TV. I understand the satellite needs the signal, but it seemed to struggle much more than mine does at home. In summary, it was a real treat to stay here. I would go back - but my budget dictates that it be only for special occassions.

We also ordered a bottle of wine from room service that was there in a flash to open and serve. I will also tell you that our $200 room was sooooo much nicer than our $1000 dollar a night room at Atlantis, the Reef in the Bahamas. It was a welcoming site to have a fantastic room with stuff we had never seen. Im sure for the savvy traveler that a swanky hotel is a standard with all the bells.

All staff I encountered were extremely gracious without being over-engraciating as can sometimes be found at Ritz Carlton. The food and beverage option is top notch and prices were surprisingly fair. The health club is world class and equipment there as top of the line as I have seen anwyhere in the world. And finally the accomodations, you could not want for more!

On the first day of my three night stay I raced to the hotel between meetings and VIOLA a room was ready at 11:30a. Nice touch, greatly appreciated! The friendly front desk staff upgraded me to a corner unit on a high floor, not at the bargain rate proclaimed by others on this post, but still a very good deal. There's no question that the property is quite lovely - the decor and finishes are visually appealing, high end and aligned with my style preferences. The room is large, the views amazing. The bathroom is huge and I would have liked to have been the granite and stone contractor for this project. The 50+\" TV is nice and the work area is up to Marriott standards. My rate came with breakfast buffet each day which was way better than average, in a very pleasant dining room. I also had access to the concierge lounge. Now typically these are not open on the weekends but the Marriott guest services book in the room lists complimentary services for the concierge area and under each category (breakfast, hors d'oeuvres, drinks and snacks) it says DAILY, and lists times. Silly me, I took DAILY to mean EVERY DAY. Apparently not. And when I went up last evening to get a soda, the refrigerators were all but empty. The service staff frustrated me the most. The first night I suffered through what must be one of noisiest HVAC systems going. I thought I was sleeping next to a swamp cooler and nothing I did made the sound abate. The next day I called FOUR TIMES before someone came. That someone didn't speak much English but whips out his temp gun and shows me that it's blowing 55 degrees and that it's all the windows that make it hot and . . . hold on cowboy, uno momento, I'm not HOT, I just can't hear myself think! Turns out too that he was a little chapped, having claimed to have come to the room twice before. I showed him that if he rang the bell, it couldn't be heard over the HVAC unit noise (and I guess he was out sick the day that they illustrated KNOCKING as an alternative means of attracting attention). He did play with the EMS unit and programmed it so it blows less forcefully, but it's still noisy - a disappointment for such a new hotel and for someone like me who values quiet. My specific area of complaint is housekeeping. When I got to the room it was clear that it hadn't been cleaned well - dust, fingerprints and, more telling, t-parts of plastic from clothing price tags in two areas of the room. Always makes me wonder what ELSE hasn't been cleaned. Day two the maid showed up while I was in the room. If she spoke any English I'd be surprised because I couldn't communicate with her at all. She sort of made the bed (this will be relevant later) and cleaned the bathroom and at my request vacuumed in the way maids do - in the center of the room. After she departed I walked into the bath to see that the towels weren't replaced. (Oh, and never mind that my Marriott member profile specifies extra towels for every stay and I've only ever received them once.) I called down and requested towels - finally got them, but without a bath mat (to step out on). Jeez. Last night I was out, and came back to find there had been turn down service. THIS MAID made the bed! Hello, what? To me it would have made sense to make the bed in the morning, and NOT in the evening, but what do I know. Also the dirty glasses still remained and just now, as I'm watching the current maid clean (at 4:05p) I had to ask her to take them as she prepared to walk out of the room. So today . . . it's Saturday but I was in Miami to work. I was out of the room by 7:15a. I turned ON the \"make up room now\" light and confirmed that the green light was illuminated. I returned at 3:15p thinking I had two hours to relax before having to go out again. But what's this? NO SERVICE. At 3:15p I called downstairs, got a lame answer from AYS which I won't go into here then requested a manager. Flavio apologized and said he'd send someone right up. Someone did show :30 later, and has just left, which gives me an hour to shower, decompress, and get out again. I will check out tomorrow but as much as the property is visually appealing, the room with the view intoxicating, the mark was missed on the things that are important to me and it's unlikely I will stay again. Clean and quiet weren't there, and the illogical room cleaning schedule baffles me. (And don't get me believing someone will actually clean the room within the eight hours from the time I illuminated the button if it isn't really going to happen!) The staff is generally friendly but only the front desk and the concierge really seemed to hit the service deliverable.

On the bright side, did manage to improve my pantomime skills. It is Miami however but the fact the one can't communicate basic guest needs to staff was frustrating. 2. dinner at db Bistro Moderne was a catastrophe - one entree was uneatable, other meals were mediocre at best. And the noise! My God! No exaggeration to say dinner was a shouting match. You'd expect painful din at some two-bit roadhouse but not at a restaurant with the price points this place commands. 3. Finally, to cap the entire \"experience\" off, upon checking out and waiting for our valeted vehicle (which did seem to take a bit too long - a complaint common by some in our party - but grudgingly acceptable due to the high volume of cars in & out and the gyrations one has to endure to get to the place) only to receive it with the radio at full volume tuned to some local Little Havana station and the A/C blasting HIGH.

We really enjoyed the facility. It was a little difficult to get to, but once we got there we were well satisfied overall. We stayed on the 35th floor facing the harbor, so the views were great - turn off the lights at night and sit back with a bottle of wine with your loved one. Very romantic. The room itself was huge. The king bed was perfect, and there was a 60 inch or so flat screen in the room. Also had a computer in the room, though it was super slow and only allows you to open one browser window at a time - made it kind of a pain to surf sometimes. The bathroom had a separate tub and shower, with two sinks. Lighting was perfect throughout. Had in room Lilly coffee. Have to say it was one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in, and we have stayed all over the world from Seoul to Hong Kong, and even Dubai - all in 5 star hotels. The problem is that other than the room, it was not what we have come to expect from a JW, or any other comparable brand of hotel. We are sticklers for good service, and that is why we stay at the JW line of hotels normally. The staff at this place were a little amateurish. The funny thing is that we found there were several international trainees working - and they provided the best service at the hotel. The normal staff were inattentive and not too helpful. Have to say this was the case in the concierge lounge too. However, we had a Thai lady with \"Barbara\" on her name tag that was great. Kumar in the lounge was awesome too. Other than those 2, we didnt come across any other staff that seemed to care about service. As a disclaimer, we are comparing our treatment here against other JWs we have stayed in throughout the world. So if you are used to being pampered at other JWs, dont expect it here (disclaimer #2 - am Marriott Rewards Gold - got free upgrade to concierge floor, but only after requesting it. Staff that checked me in didnt even realize I was Marriott Gold until I pointed it out to him. Not that this is a big deal, but if you are Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum, this is one of the perks that usually come automatically - is a bit embarrassing to have to point this out to someone who does this for a living). Had the staff been better overall, would have been a nearly perfect stay. We only ate at the lounge during our stay, and it was for breakfast. We have eaten at over 20 Marriott and JW lounges throughout the U.S. and the world, and have to say this was in the bottom three - not because it was that bad, but because other JWs are that good. The food was ok quality wise. Selection was less than average for a JW. They have evening drinks and canapes, but did not make it to the lounge at that time. Parking is valet only for $38 a day. Bottom line: Awesome place to stay if you are not a stickler for service. I do recommend you stay if you can get a great price. If not, try the Miami Airport Marriott instead.

It's good but not great so there is plenty of room for improvement. The concierge and other staff should have a better idea of things to do in the area. For example, the concierge sent me to the Design Center area for shopping on Saturday and most of the stores were closed. This is something a well trained concierge should know. Since the hotel is new, the hours of operation for the Wine Boutique and chocolate shop were inconsistent. The spa/fitness center did not have classes/yoga over the weekend so I ended up going across the street to Exhale Spa located at Epic Hotel (very nice)!

We stayed 3 nights over Thanksgiving prior to a cruise and had booked months in advance and their opening with a special Marriott Rewards rate. I was surprised not to get any upgraded room as I would have thought would be offered to a Platinum member but the room was great in any case. Large room, internet pc in room, comfortable bed, huge bathroom with soaker and large shower and TV in the mirror of the bathroom was a cool touch. View was nice from the 37th floor overlooking the bay and city but the trash on the roof outside the window and dead bird was a reason to keep the light shade closed.

A few examples: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Available clean tables \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Its large and even with all the tables and being empty all the tables had not been cleaned from the last guest with dirty dishes etc..

After close to 20 mins the hostess just offered milk and when we said no we will wait for cream she walked away without a word to go clean off other tables and not even check if she could get cream.

Being a few weeks old, there are a few minor issues to work through but I was quite impressed with the service and the facilities. My reservation was in order and even the refridgerator I requested in advance was waiting in the room. A box I sent in advance of my stay was given to me when I checked in. I often have to make several calls to receive a box like this but this property handled it flawlessly. The bellman showed me some of the finer points of the room which I appreciated. For example, the Illy coffee maker does not turn off automatically (since they don't know which of the cup sizes is in use). I might have missed the free bottles of water or the larger coffee cups if I had not been shown where they were. The room was beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable. There was a PC in the room with free usage PLUS free Wi-Fi. The bathroom was great - long with two sinks, a very comfortable bathtub with a book holder, and a strong, hot shower with a rainforest shower head plus a separate wand. Toiletries were also wonderful including the great lavendar bath salts. Nice stool for shaving/makeup and a lighted mirror. Plenty of storage in the bathroom and in the room. To turn on all of the electricity/lights in the room, you have to place your key firmly in a slot by the door. I've seen this in Europe but not in the USA. At least I knew where to find my key. Also by the door are buttons to push for \"Do Not Disturb\" or \"Clean The Room\". They turn on a red or green light outside your door. Housekeeping does honor these so don't forget to turn off the \"Do Not Disturb\" when you leave or you might miss out on the nightly service. The pool and workout rooms were great. Electronic bowling was fun. The basketball court made me wish I played. Ate at DB Bistro. The $32 burger was good but not really worth the price (the fries were soggy, too). Friends had other items (such as the scallops) and completely enjoyed their meals. Desserts were inventive and tasty. I did have a few quibbles and these are VERY minor. Hopefully the hotel will take care of what they can to make a great stay even better: - There was no Menu function on the 55 inch TV so I couldn't check my bill or check out via the TV - The reading lights were mounted kinda high - not exactly an easy reach to turn them off when lying in bed - Housekeeping was a bit inconsistent. There were varying amounts of towels each day. Somedays a bath mat, somedays not. The bath salts were not replaced one day but were the other days. - Since this is a new hotel, taxis don't always know where it is. The official address is not yet in a lot of GPS units. I finally started telling the taxi drives that the hotel was across from the Hyatt and the Epic. - The front drive was not run as smoothly as the rest of the hotel. I had pre-ordered a taxi and they gave it to someone else. Took them 15 minutes to find another one for me. Taxis don't seem to know to drive by this hotel. - I had booked four rooms. My friends were all given rooms facing East (towards the bay) while I got a room facing west (looking into the bank building next door). Don't know why I didn't get a better view (I'm gold level in Marriott Rewards). - When I heard alarms in the hallway, I called the operator who had no idea what was going on. Turns out they were testing the alarms. - The TV in the bathrrom does not have sound in synchronization with the bedroom TV. If you play them both at the same time, the sound can be quite annoying. Highlights: - The in-room coffee from Illy was the best ever in a hotel room - The lobby almost doesn't look like a lobby - just a sofa and a few cushioned seats. Front desk clerks were always effecient and quick. - Amazingly comfortable beds - Elevators were usually very quick - Loved all the technology from the phone on the desk where I could program a wakeup call to the in-room PC. To top it off, this hotel has amazing help in the concierge lounge. The service there was great. Jason, Martin, and the other lounge employees pampered their guests. The lounge breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, pastries, fruits, cheeses, lox, etc. Always a good way to start the day. In the evening, wine and beer were complimentary. Bottled water (Fuji, Voss, Pelligrino, and Perrier) along with sodas were always available. Desserts consisted of fresh fruit or pre-packaged snack bars. The lounge also had large-screen TVs, greeat seats by the bay-view windows, and two computers/printer. One comment about Concierge level. Since I'm gold, I get conceirge lounge access. I had booked a concierge room because the initial literature suggested there was even more tech in those rooms including larger televisions and surround sound systems. Turns out the tech is the same in all the rooms. Since I already get lounge access, my extra $30 a night (over the standard room rate I booked) turned out to be a waste. I would not pay extra again since I didn't really get anything for the extra money. Just so you know, downtown is pretty dead at night. During the day, the traffic was always backed up but at night the taxis could fly right through downtown.

It was very disappointing to see the ladders and areas still being worked on. Upon arriving at the front desk, I stepped up to the desk to check-in. Although there were no other guests there, the front desk person ignored me and carried on with whatever he was doing.
