The only problems I found were the bad shape in which the window covers were in (if we didn't put another piece of cloth covering the window, anyone who passed outside could clearly see everything inside the bedroom) and the constant sound of a machine working (presumably something related with air conditioning) that wouldn't allow me to have a deep sleep. Also, the walls are extremelly thin so you could hear everything that was going on in the water pumps (I always woke up when someone decided to take a shower at 6 a.m.).
