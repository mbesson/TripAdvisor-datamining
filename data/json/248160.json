They have a rarity here: 2 pools, one of which is very deep-great for scuba certification, and another on the rooftop. Last year we paid $600 pesos/nite and this year we couldn't get a room for less than 800-1000, which is still good value, just a bit out of our price range. Rosario at the front desk is still the helpful friendly and efficient guy. He did everything he could to get us a room in our price range so no fault here, that is the price of success. We met the owners who also seemed like great guys. This is our first choice for hotels in downtown Playa-we joked with Rosario that we should write a lousy review so their prices would go down and we could get a room!

The familiar faces make it feel like home; which, in such a touristy area, is no easy feat. The rooms are quiet, spacious and very clean; if you prefer cool and shady, the first floor is a great option. The higher up you go, the more light and warmth there is. It is a little bit of jungle by the ocean! Then, on the top floor, is a pool and a nice view. Perfect for days when the surf is too rough. Each room that I've stayed in had a safety deposit box and a refrigerator - both very nice amenities. I love the location - just off the main drag, two blocks from the gorgeous beach and La Tarraya (great restaurant right on the beach shaded with Palm trees), and close to the bus station for day trips to Cancun or Tulum. The front desk folks, who speak English, are always helpful and friendly. Another plus is that it is connected to the hotel next door (which has a good restaurant) and Yucatek dive shop. My boyfriend loves to dive and raved about his trips both in the cenotes and in the ocean. One time I stayed here while travelling alone and felt very safe and comfortable. Can't wait to go back!

The courtyard is pretty and the room was large, but wow did we have problems: 1) Had great difficulty communicating with anyone- if you don't speak Spanish, this isn't the place for you. 2) Our floor was flooded the 2nd and 3rd day there when we came back to our room- not sure if the shower somehow leaked out or housekeeping poured buckets of water on the floor. They sent someone with a mop eventually, but the floor was still dangerously wet. 3) There was no pool- when we booked we were told there was one. They had \"privileges\" at a pool far away and in bad shape on the beach. 4) Sheets and the covering on one bed were stained- looked to be a fresh unwashed stain, and had to ask 3 times to get the bed changed- they eventually dropped off a sheet set, but we were stuck with the stained bedspread. 5 ) Our refrigerator made such loud noises we had to unplug it to sleep at night, and was never fixed- we had items that needed to be kept cool. 6) The stove requires a lighter- not provided, and we didn't have matches. 7) The electricity went off for most of a day and evening- there were no flashlights, candles or any other help provided. I had to go to a gift shop on my own in the evening (husband and son on an outing) and bought candles and matches. This was maybe the worst part of the stay and cinched our decision to leave.

The rooms are, as advertised by the hotel small, but they insisted four of us would fit in their master suite. Yet, on arrival we were cramped into the room like sardines. A staff member, before we had even entered the room, stereotypically attacked us warning us not to \"drink too much or come in from a night out late\". I found this insulting and presumptious. Our toaster was broken, and the management held off fixing it for the whole week(which we accepted), yet they charged us for breaking a flimsy cup; the term double standards springs to mind. There is also no phone in any of the rooms, so when you wish to receive a private call you must use the office phone; which they are reluctant to allow you to use or will constantly tell you to \"hurry up\" if you are using it for more than 5 minutes. The management also sent a rude note through the door,on the second day, demanding we pay; we had hardly set our bags down at this stage! In conclusion to their disgraceful PR methods, they topped it off on the last day of our stay by introducing us to the owners; when we confronted them on the rude behaviour of the management etc., they asked us to wait in the lobby for a few minutes and they would be with us. When 15 minutes passed, I became aggitated and decided to go upstairs to the owners room. Here I found him locked in his room afraid to confront the situation in his hotel- highly unusual, but surely this sort of manaement will be detrimental to the hotel in years or perhaps months to come.
