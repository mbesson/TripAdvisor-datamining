They also have a Pizza Hut/grill on property at the pool that provides room service as well, and we have used both for convenience.

It was also quieter there and we were able to get our quick queue passes and tickets for the universal bus from the expedia desk in their hotel foyer. Hotel also has a small mini gym, and convenience store at reception. It is close to CVS store/pharmacy and TGI's too. The room we had was a junior suite, with a mini lounge as we ended up being upgraded due to the hotel not having a record of our booking (tour operators fault). It was a nice spacious room, although a little noisy as it was above the main entrance of the hotel and we were awoken by buses pulling up outside on a few mornings. The pool was quite small, but for the amount of time we spent here it was enough for the kids. Food at the pool bar was good too. Pizza, chicken fingers etc. All quick and hot. Just what you want after a full day at the parks. Fairfield Inn is ideal if you are visiting seaworld, aquatica and discovery cove, with a regular free shuttle bus available.

This is going to be a long review... THE ROOM The room was lovely. Very well maintained, everything in good condition (as it is a relatively new hotel), spacious and welcoming. We had two queen beds - and that was booked as a standard room so we were extremely happy with this. Nice size TV with plenty of channels - they even had the Manchester United game on which kept my partner happy. Lots of storage space for clothes and suitcases. Microwave and fridge in room which was handy for when we were too worn out by the end of the day to face the public at dinner time. Air conditioning worked well. Hairdryer, ironing board and iron all included in room - very glad I didn't bring my hairdyer along as this one did a decent job. Nice, clean bathroom with powerful shower and regular bath. BIG mirror. THE STAFF The front desk, housekeeping and maintenance staff were all so good at their jobs and nothing was too much. They were all so cheerful and very helpful. Not much else to say about them really! HOTEL FEATURES The pool is a reasonable size and well maintained. There are plenty of sunloungers and pool towels always available. As there is so much to do in Orlando we only went to the pool once during our two weeks. There is a bar in the pool area which has nice food. There is also a jacuzzi which is just bliss at the end of the day - and it is open until 11pm. The hotel is interlinked with the Springhill Suites next door (you have to walk through the pool area to get to it which takes less than a minute). This is where the 'gym' is located. The 'gym' consists of a selection of weights and some cardio machines - no floor space or resistance machines for a proper work-out but enough to keep you active during your stay. The Springhill also houses a coffee bar which serves Starbucks beverages throughout the morning. It is also where you will find the computers for free internet access and the Expedia Local Expert desk. This was probably the most useful thing to us on our holiday as they know everything about what to do in Orlando. Michael Brugnone ran the desk on most days and he was extremely knowledgable. He helped us arrange tickets to see an Orlando Magic game (which I highly recommend) and, as it is a Seaworld hotel, he arranged our FREE QuickQueue tickets for the rides at Seaworld - along with many other things. He is a very helpful man indeed. While at this desk you may end up chatting to someone from the Marriott Vacation Club. This is all about getting involved in a timeshare thing. They take you to the local vacation club, show you around the apartments, offer you deals and try to convince you to get involved. When it's all over (approximately 2 hours) and you've managed to convince them you don't want to get involved, you get a $100 gift card to take off your hotel bill! This was handy as we had ordered room service from the pool bar, TGI Friday's (which is nextdoor to the hotel) and I had used the dry cleaning service. Then we used the remainder in the hotel shop. Also, if you do not use room service they allow you to redeem it against park tickets. Not only that but the rep at the hotel will give you voucher books to spend at the outlets which also came in handy. LOCATION This hotel was in the perfect location for us. We did not hire a car so used the public transport. We bought 14-day iRide passes from our Virgin rep in advance, but you can get these from the Expedia desk. This got us to Seaworld, the shopping areas and a couple of water parks. There are shuttle buses from the hotel to all the other parks excluding Disney. It's a little too far to get a taxi to Disney everytime so we jumped on the Lynx 50 which cost $2 a ride. There is a Publix supermarket a 10-minute walk away. There is absolutely no need to hire a car unless you plan on going places further afield. ISSUES There were only two problems we came across on our holiday. 1) Our in-room phones stopped calling local and international numbers and we could only call the front desk. This only happened a few days before we left so we weren't too fussed. 2) There was not an in-room safe. We kept our passports locked in a safe at the front desk and every day my partner had to take his MacBook downstairs to be locked in the office which had CCTV. The UK equivalent of this hotel is a Thistle hotel. But this is even better. You don't have people running around carrying your bags for you - but the service is fantastic and we would deifinitely stay again.

You can get discounts to the dining at the SeaWorld restaurants as well. And right across the street there is a Thai restaurant, a good sushi place, a Denny's and a TGIF. We rented a car and went to Downtown Disney one night and Universal CityWalk the other. It's very easy to get around from the Fairfield Marriott. You could pay more to stay at the nearby Renaissance or one of the better hotels in the area, but for a short trip with a lot of time at the parks, the Fairfield is easier on the wallet and you can upgrade your vacation in other ways.

We walked through the lobby several times throughout our stay (morning, afternoon, evening, and night) and never was there a time where someone was manning the concierge desk.

As our plan was to visit Sea World, Universal parks, Busch Gardens and Aquatica we decided to stay on I-Drive. The transfer from the airport to hotel dropped other holiday makers off at their hotels I started to worry as some of I-drive looked tacky and a bit run down, however, as we progressed down I-drive the area improved and I was really happy when we got to the Fairfield. We found that we had been allocated a lower floor room despite e-mailing to request a higher floor. However, I mentioned my request and the room was quickly changed and we got a seaworld facing room on the 6th Floor, I found the reception staff to be friendly and efficient. The room was clean and presentable, what we saw on the website was exactly what we got. Breakfast was good, nice to have a quick bite before getting straight off to the parks, the food was average but a real money saver as it was included with the price of the room. The breakfast staff were \"fantastic\" really helpful and chatty with the kids, it was very much like the \"Disney experience\" with great customer service. Shuttle to the parks, we used this service alot, the drivers were great, they really went the extra mile, one day we boarded the bus and found that it was bound for Universal and we were going to Aquatica, we were just about to go and jump on the I-trolley when the driver insisted that we stay on and he took a detour to drop us off (only a minute or two out of his way, but very kind). We used the I-Trolley quite a bit and also the linx bus to downtown disney (only 20mins from Seaworld, so easy to get about. Pool was nice, very quiet, and the pool bar really convenient (limited Pizza hut or Springhill menu) also reasonably priced. We also had room service from the pool bar, this was a life saver after an exhausting day at the parks. Housekeeping was good, the only issue was that they kept leaving De-caff coffee and I need caffine to get me started first thing but I mentioned this to reception and was given a handful of sachets to keep me going. Conciege service at Springhill was great, very helpful, we got quick que passes for Seaworld a few times and Michael at the desk remembered my name when I went back which is a nice touch.

On check-in, our rooms were ready but they were unable to have all rooms on the same floor. 2 rooms were together and 1 was on a different floor but this did not bother us. Check-in was easy and quick. Front desk staff were very helpful and friendly at all times. Not once did we feel that we were annoying them by asking for help or asking access to the safe behind the front desk. On entering the room for the first time we were very impressed. All looked very clean and still looked like a new hotel. Bed linen was clean and fresh. View from our room looked onto SeaWorld which was also great. In general, housekeeping was done everyday however it seemed that they came either too late (ie we arrived back at 4pm some days and the room still had not been done but was evetually done after we came back from dinner), or it was done too early (ie we wanted a lay in but housekeeping was knocking on the door at 9:30am). Housekeeping could be improved. Like I said when we originally entered the room for the first time it all looked clean but during our stay it was gradually noticed that little small things are being skipped over. By this I mean the carpets are not hoovered right up to the edges and you do notice dust gathering. Also dust under the flat screen TVs was present. The only other thing was that when you sit on the toilet you do notice grime under the sink rim. Apart from this there was no mould around the bath and the decor of the room was very good. I hope they can sort this out because these are the sorts of things that start the reviews going bad... Breakfast is free in the morning. Our family are vegetarian so we only ate serial/toast/yogurt so it was good for us. However the fact that it ends at 9:30am every day means you can't have a free breakfast and have a lay in at the same time. Staff at breakfast are very welcoming and friendly and they keep the tables clean quickly. We did not experience any long queues whether we arrived at 8am or 9:15am. We used the Guest Services in the sister hotel next door. Michael was very helpful in getting us our SeaWorld/Busch/Aquatica multi tickets and he also handed us our free Quick-Queue tickets which were good for our visit to SeaWorld. The location of the hotel is very good. Right on International Drive opposite SeaWorld's but you would need to walk or take the shuttle to the entrance to SeaWorl. Very easy by car to Florida Mall, Outlets, Wallmart, the Turnpike for Miami, SeaWorld, I4 and Universal and the MCO airport. There are plenty of eating places nearby within walking distance (however we had a hire car so never walked anywhere). Pool area was clean and welcoming. There is a small snacks bar at the pool which was good and plenty of towels to use. One of the days the pool area was closed due to refurbishment. We got 2 days notice for this and I feel this should have been noted on the Marriott web site where I booked these rooms. We were at the parks that day anyway so it did not bother us however we did hear others complaining about it in the lifts. Gym was used a couple of times which is basic but still worth going to. We did not get the sitution of many kids running around in the corridoors late at night which you normally get at most hotels. Check-out was quick and easy also and it was mentioned to us how appreciated it was that we stayed there. The hotel does not have any type of of security gate at the complex entrance like other hotels do. You can just drive in to the car park, however the hotel complex did feel safe to be in and around. The only thing we did not like was that in 3 of our rooms were left coins out and housekeeping would take them. It says in the room info booklet not to leave money out so we can't really complain. However in my room I left approx $5 coins out next to the TV (as I do not like to carry coins) and they were taken. The same time these coins were taken I also left approx $5 worth of quaters in another part of the room next to a wall and next to a Washing detergent bottle as we wanted to wash our clothes before our return. It would be obvious that those quarters were for me to use in the laundry room but these coins were also taken. These coins were gradually built up in a pile over approx 8 days before they were taken. Overall, I would stay here again over any other hotel. We have always stayed at the Marriott Village before but the constant traffic congestion around that hotel put us off this time and therefore decided to stay here.

Since the hotel is located on International Drive, I needed a hotel that was close to everything. For the most part, Fairfield Inn at SeaWorld was a good choice, but it wasn't without its flaws. Here are the pros and cons: PROS: Very clean and modern hotel with the usual bells and whistles. Opened in 2009, and is located at International Drive and CFP (Central Florida Parkway). Theme parks within driving distance, including SeaWorld and Aquatica. Guest room was very clean, the pool area was attractive (even though I decided not to go swimming), and I got to check in early. Guest room included a flat-screen TV, microwave, mini-fridge (as a tradition, I try to save money on meals), comfy bed and a spacious bathroom. Hotel staff was friendly and courteous for the most part, even though I don't remember all their names. Plenty of stores and restaurants within walking distance, including a Publix store. CONS: Have fun waiting for the I-Drive Trolley in the scorching hot Florida sun. There weren't enough trolleys that came on time, so I had to wait a while for one to arrive. The breakfast area was a zoo, and there wasn't enough variety. I basically spent the next two days having breakfast at McDonald's. The video arcade was very small, and the Family Guy pinball machine had a technical malfunction. Your room key is required to get anywhere within the hotel and the neighboring SpringHill Suites. VERY annoying. You can only get wired internet in the guest room, and the computers at the business center were slow as heck. The A/C in my room kept turning itself on every 20 minutes, but thankfully I managed to turn it off. I enjoyed my stay at Fairfield Inn at SeaWorld, but I won't be returning to this hotel. Instead, I'll stay at a hotel near Disney and Universal for next year's trip.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolingbrook, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWatch out for the bed runner\u201d", "Author": "CelticGreenEyes", "ReviewID": "UR117193484", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and found it to be a good choice - good location for my business and well accommodated, especially for a Fairfield.Inn.

I was VERY surprised as Marriott properties are usually more customer focused than that. When I said, \"no it is not ok\", she said, \"well, I will tell housekeeping.

Across the street to Seaworld and Aquatica. Close enough to see the fireworks each night from the pool. A few turns off the Central Parkway to I-4 and over to Disney. A right turn down International Drive to all sorts of restaurants, shows and entertainment. (Be sure to see the magic show at Wonderworks.) CVS and TGIF are right in the parking lot area. Staff is very friendly, accomdating and aims to please. The hotel and pool area are clean. Pool is shared with Springhill Suites and has a great kids splash area. They served food and drinks outside by the pool. Breakfast is complimentary. Now the negatives: First impressions mean a lot. Upon arrival we were assigned a king sized room. The room was quite small and not very accomodating for 2 adults and 2 active kids for 7 days. I went back to the front desk and asked them what had happened to my reservation for a suite with a sofa bed. They said my reservation was not for a suite, which confused me because that was the room I reconfirmed the evening before arrival. The staff changed our room, but informed me the it would cost $14.00 more per night. I was tired from driving and agreed to pay the extra. After a good nights sleep I decided to go back down to the front desk and tell them I was not going to pay the extra room rate since I knew that the room I booked was a suite and somewhere between reservations and front desk something was lost. They agreed to take off the extra for that night, but I wanted to make sure I would not be charged for the remainder of the nights either and they agreed to the original rate quoted at the reservation. They were very good about it and I was pleased by their friendly attitude. Breakfast was decent, but the hot items needed to be reheated in the microwave. It's hard to serve hot foods to dozens of guest. My biggest problem was the WiFi connection in the room. It is not truly wireless. You must plug a connecting plug into your computer and if you cannot get connected you call a toll free number and they give you instructions on how to reconfigure your pc for their wireless. BIG MISTAKE on my part. Changing my settings resulted in completly crashing my pc and upon arrival home, had to completly reset my laptop back to factory settings. It was a big mess. I should have just used the pc's they had in the business center or gone to the breakfast area where wireless seemed to be working. You also only get a 24 hour certificate and must renew this every day or you loose the connection. So if you want to surf the net in your jammies, forget it. The next problem was on the day before we left. We were a bit disappointed to come back late at night from a hot, sweaty day at Disney and find that they did not clean our room or provide us with clean towels. The front desk had the security guard bring us fresh towels. When we check out the next day they did give us a $40.00 credit for not having cleaned the room. The last thing we were hit with was a short sales pitch about rebooking the hotel or a Marriott condo resort timeshare for a later date. The offer wasn't bad but I wasn't sure I wanted to return to that hotel, so we did not buy into the package. This Marriott hotel was a far cry from the one we had stayed at in Cocoa Beach just a few nights before. I would have to say I was a bit disappointed, but would still might recommend it to somene who wanted to be as close to SeaWorld as possible.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay every time\u201d", "Author": "305_Perez_Family", "ReviewID": "UR116655380", "Content": "A fantastic find especially if you are visiting Sea World!

We usually stay at 5* hotels but since we were traveling with other family we had to find a hotel that would suit their budget and our \"need\" to stay in a nice, comfortable place. We stayed at a studio, which I was pleasantly surprised. The studio had a living room with a sofa bed ,plasma TV and a desk. In the room we had a king size bed and a plasma TV. We had plenty of storage space. The bathroom was very simple with hairdryer, some toiletries and very clean. The location was very good, situated in a quiet part of International Dr. , close to supermarkets, malls , walking distance to Sea World and 15, 20 minutes to Disney Parks. T.G.I. Friday is adjacent to the hotel and they deliver to your room. Also supermarkets are very close so we just bought some healthy snacks in the supermarket. The bus stop that takes you all the way \"up and down\" in International Dr. is right in front of the hotel. Very convenient for those who don't have a car. The breakfast was included and it was basically, eggs (each day in a different style) , yogurt, fruit salad, bagel,toast, cereal, coffee, milk, tea and orange juice. They do have a starbucks coffee counter at the lobby, but honestly it is not a \"true\" starbucks shop they just have a counter and use the starbucks coffee and charge the same. I tried but it didn't taste the same to me. What I liked the most about this hotel is that comparing to others in the same price range this is by far the best. It is very new and the service surprised me for a 2 1/2* I would recommend to get a room as far as possible from the elevator ( they have the in site laundry next to the elevator) , this is a family hotel so be prepared to hear kids talking really loud and sometimes screaming etc... We don't have kids yet so kids screaming sometimes bother us, and in the room we stayed we didnt hear anything (we got the last room in the end of a long hallway).

We vacillated between wanting the grandiose resort experience, and saving money, until we finally decided on the Fairfield. Deciding factors were the promise of the QuickQue (like a Fast Pass for the rides at Seaworld) and the convenience of the location; Fairfield is across the street from Seaworld, Discovery Cove, and Aquatica, the 3 parks to which we had purchased tickets, and Orlando traffic is notorious. Things you should know: The Fairfield shares amenities with it's sister hotel, the Springfield Inn. Think of two towers separated by a common pool. The concierge is located at the Springfield. They only have 100 QuickQues for both buildings. If you want a QuickQue, you have to wait in a (sometimes considerable) line at the Springfield Inn in the early morning to request a QuickQue for the next day. On the day we arrived, they had already given out all the available passes. We did get QuickQues for other days, because we arrived at the concierge desk early. They will only give out the passes for the next day, so you have to go each morning to obtain one for the next day. Also, shuttle buses are inconveniently timed. Although they advertise a shuttle to Universal Studios, there is only one AM pick-up (at 9:40, so you arrive well past the park's 9:00 opening to meet the crowds, and one PM take-back shuttle. Shuttles to Seaworld and Aquatica run more frequently, but don't expect Disney bus schedules; these shuttles definitely don't pick up each 15 min. A $4.00-plus-tip 5 minute cab ride is more convenient to get back or forth without the constraints of the shuttle bus. Also, even with the hotel being across the street from the parks, it often takes a 20 min shuttle trip, because the shuttle stops to pick up guests from other hotels. The pool was much nicer than expected; some websites erroneously show a picture of a plain, rectangular pool listed under this hotel's address. The picture is really of a different Springfield Inn in Orlando, not the one listed at Seaworld. The poolside grill does not open until 3:00 pm on weekdays, and it is slow service, but the entire atmosphere, with the palm trees, tropical music pumped from the speakers, and the sound of the fountain's running water from the water features/kid's zone, is lovely and relaxing. On our trip, the pool never appeared to become overcrowded - maybe everyone was at the parks, considering the pool is shared by both the Fairfield and the Springfield Inns. Although we asked for 'early check-in', our room was not ready until normal check-in time at 3:00 pm. But check-out time was a fabulous 12 noon! Rooms were clean and bright, and the queen beds were much appreciated when we considered that the more expensive hotels were providing double beds. However, the windows faced the parking lot, and we could hear the trucks rumble in the street and noisy people coming into the hotel from their cars. The morning complimentary breakfast was a true money saver. Don't come past 8:15 or you may not get a table; it gets quite busy in the eating lounge. They had 2 waffle irons to make your own waffles, but the wait could be 10 minutes. We usually opted for the pre-made scrambled egg disks (one morning was hard-boiled eggs, very strange morning fare), a meat (sausage or ham), oatmeal or cold cereal. There was also fruit, yogurt, bagels and bread to toast, juice and coffee. Very nice. A CVS across the parking lot supplied us with very convenient staples; a mini-fridge in the room kept the beverages cold. The TGI Fridays also in the parking lot was convenient and excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful in a limited capacity; don't expect a full-service hotel that will awe you when you walk in. Do expect a newer, clean, convenient, smaller hotel well worth the money.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant.

I generally stay at other hotels in the area, but I was drawn to this hotel b/c the promise of perks to guests going to Sea World like \"Quick Queue\" passes, transportation back and forth, etc, etc... We checked into the hotel around 2PM and mentioned we'd be going to Sea World that night with our annual passes as we dont like to take the small children in the heat of the day. Fast forward to 4:30 ish when we were ready to head over to the park... we went to the concierge desk to find out it closes in the early afternoon. (The concierge desk is where you get quick queue cards, arrange for special tours, etc, etc...) We then asked if someone from the front desk could help, we were told \"no\" b/c their concierge is run by Expedia and they have no access to it. They were rude about it, and very \"not our fault, blame Expedia\"... but I had to point out to them that they were CHOOSING to have Expedia run their concierge. I just think having a concierge desk close in the afternoon is crazy... especially in Orlando where folks spend their nights at theme parks, restaurants, looking for things to do, etc, etc... (Isnt the purpose of a concierge desk to help people looking for information / things to do?) When I told the \"Manager on Duty\" that the primary reason we came to this hotel was for the \"Quick Queue\" passes the hotel promises their guests, he told me that they only have a few to give out each day, and they go first thing in the morning anyway. (Like that was supposed to make me feel better!) All in all, it is a plain hotel. Not great, not bad... to me it was the Sea World perks that made me choose there, and now that I know they aren't really legit, I'll choose elsewhere next time.

The big pluses for this particular hotel were: -close to SeaWorld and Aquatica -free QuickQueue passes for SeaWorld -free breakfast -pool looked fun -free parking, as well as free transportation to the parks The lobby was very nice, a little more \"hip\" than what I expected from a Fairfield Inn! The hotel shares certain things with the SpringHill Suites next door, and when I was over there, it was a little swankier than the Fairfield, but both were nice. The hotel is very close to the parks. We were able to see Kraken and the SkyTower from our room. There is a TGI Fridays and CVS right outside the hotel, which was very convenient. Park transportation was ok. In the morning, the bus was right on schedule and it was easy to use. However, there were only set times for return, so you had to plan accordingly. The hotel pool was nice, and all the kids in our party enjoyed it (ages 10, 7, 3, and 1). The zero-entry feature was nice, and it's hard for kids to resist the various spray features. There was also enough room in the pool to hang out and relax away from the spraying and kids :) Breakfast was good. There are two waffle makers (regular and chocolate waffles), bagels, yogurt, toast, fruit, oatmeal, muffins, cereals, orange and apple juice, milk, coffee, tea, etc. There were a few other hot items - one morning was eggs and breakfast potatoes, the other morning was ham and eggs. The eggs were just these circular disks that I didn't try, because it didn't look very appetizing, and there were plenty of other choices anyways. Staff was very friendly and helpful. At breakfast, there was a staff member making balloon animals and such for all the kids. Our kids got a real kick out of that! A great feature was the Quick Queue passes for SeaWorld. However, on the morning we were visiting, there was a computer glitch, which caused us to wait on line for quite a while (30+ minutes), and we ended up having to leave our info and return to get the passes. Then, once you are in SeaWorld, you have to go to another window to turn the passes in to get the actual bracelets. It's a bit of legwork to skip the lines, but worth it to bypass the lines for a few main attractions. Not sure if I would pay for those passes separately, but it's easy enough to stay at a nearby hotel to get them.

I have stayed in the general area of this hotel 4 times this month and out of the other stays this month, this has been by far the best hotel. The hotel is very clean. The furniture and decor is very moden from the lobby to the guest rooms. The room smelled clean and fresh and looked clean and fresh.Bathroom is a good size. I had a King Suite which has a mini fridge and microwave as well as a seperate sitting area with desk, couch, chair and flat screen tv. The bed was comfortable and had another flat screen tv in that area. The pool area was nice. A great place for families with young kids to have fun in. A game room and a nice pool side reasturant as well with quick service. The hotel offers a small free breakfast in the mornings with your basics. Juice, coffee, yogurt, breads, fruits, waffles etc. Nothing special but it does the job and being free will save you money. The hotel desk staff was very friendly and very helpful. When I asked for suggestions on where to eat with a 5 year old they printed out a list of places that were offering \"kids eat free\" options for that evening. Other times when I needed some thing I was helped quickly and with a smile. I only have 2 small complaints about the hotel is that the free internet is wired so your stuck at the desk to do work on your laptop unless you stretch the cord as far as you can to maybe sit on the couch in an uncomfortable manner. In a hotel as moden as this and as nice as this they should go the extra mile and get wireless internet in the rooms so that people can sit where they want in their rooms to get their work done. Also their little shop downstairs with drinks etc is way to high on their prices. A little frozen meal that costs $1.98 at Walmart was over $5.00 downstairs. Every thing was over priced. Do yourself a favor and don't buy from their shop, go over to CVS which is right there. More expensive then walmart but still far cheaper then the hotel.If it weren't for the internet and shop prices, I would give this hotel a huge A+.

Wal-Mart is very near for any necessities and of course for driving to the outlet malls (Premium Outlets is a mere 5 min drive from the hotel) and Florida mall. We also drove to Clearwater and Honeymoon Island (absolutely gorgeous). What we found was staying at this quieter end of I Drive is that it is easier to get to places as the I-4 is easier to get to than other places on I-Drive. In fact, getting to Disney and back was as quick staying here than using Disney transport when we have stayed in Disney properties in the past. The hotel staff were very friendly and the room was always cleaned very well. You also get a good view of Seaworld fireworks at night and the brilliant Aquatica water park is a 10 minute walk away (though we drove there - only $12 to park) as we had a 'stroller' and there aren't pavements all the way.

Had the best bed in the world and a bzillion pillows! No joke, every night, the minute I pop my head on to the pillow I fall asleep LIKE THAT! It's THAT amazing that I am now purchasing a new bed back home that has to be that comfy! Huge flat screen TV. Other standard ammenities inc. Coffee machine and hair dryer, Free Wi Fi and lots of towels that are replaced every single day. LOCATION: Great! Opposite TGI Fridays; walking distances to a super market, a pharmacy, KFC, McDonald's... Directly outside of the hotel is a stop for the I-ride Trolley that goes up and down International Drive with regular stops to the many attractions on International Drive including Prime Outlets. So therefore, even though we did not have a car, we still got around pretty easily W/O having to waste any money on taxis because of this trolley. CLEANLINESS: Room was cleaned everyday-although there were days when I felt that it was at a minimal standard, suffiecent but not great, AND for some reason, maybe its the humidity in Orlando; but I felt that my bedsheets were a bit moist each night? It was like that for the whole trip... Overall SERVICE, AND HOTEL AMBIENCE is great! Loved it, it was casual enough for two 19 year olds to feel safe and relaxed on our first holiday to the USA. Receptionist were very lovely who would help you with anything. They even let me use THEIR spare computer when the FREE computers for guests were taken. Loved it, but since Orlando has so many hotels, I would consider trying some place else, however I do highly recommend it to anyone. Only NEGATIVE : No room safe!!! However you are able to store your valuables in personal safes in the reception desks-it is annoying to keep going down to the desk to retrieve and store your things though. Unlike other Orlando Hotels, Fairfield Inn @ Seaworld is simply a typical hotel. No extras like kitchen, fridge, stove, kettle.

When we came back later in the afternoon, our room was ready and was clean, spacious, and comfortable. It was a brand new hotel and had a new carpet & paint smell that was, at times, overwhelming, but that was our only complaint. Breakfast the next morning was really good! We marvelled at how well the staff kept everything stocked and replenished. My daughter took the last orange, and in a few seconds, a gentleman was there adding more to the basket. The same was true when my husband took the last cup of coffee! The pool area was great for small kids. My kids were there for over an hour. We went early in the morning and there were no towels--despite us asking several times at the front desk for some to be delivered.

For $ 45 a night we couldn't complain, because the hotel was clean, the room was clean and the pool was clean. I have to also say, that their front desk clerk was very helpful and accomodating because at check in, I inquired if the rooms had a refridgerator. We were informed that our room did not but if I needed something stored that he would happily do so in the main refridgerator of the hotel. Given that I am currently nursing, and did not have my daughter with me and needed to pump, it was nice to know that they would have accomodated me.

One of two booked rooms wasn't ready by 6pm when I checked in 2. Room had faulty lighting which was _never_ fixed during my stay 3. Housekeeping failed to clean room first day and was late in cleaning on day 2 4. I had items stolen from my room -- *** NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE On the plus side, the staff were very friendly and the hotel amenities rated about 8/10. The pool was very nice and it did have internet in the room (NO WiFi though). Note: There is no safe in the room nor at the front desk. There are no security cameras anywhere on property, either. The management tried to address items 1-3 by giving me half off one room for one day, which was really just a token gesture if you think about it. Most importantly, though, was the theft. I had two small bags of electronics (hand-held gaming systems) and a laptop stolen from the room on the day I checked out. My family and I went to the pool and we took most of our items but my sons accidentally left their belongings in one of the rooms. The room was locked and a hotel staffer entered the room about two hours after I left. The entry by the staffer was expected since I had checked out; however, upon finding my stuff in the room the staffer should have contacted the front desk and had them taken from the room. Instead, he took the electronics (and left the other bag untouched) and then just locked the room. When I figured out that my sons had left their belongings in the room about 3pm, I returned to the room and then discovered that the items were stolen. It was a traumatic experience for my pre-teen sons. Of course, I spoke with the hotel management, who were very concerned, but that's about it. They filed a report with Marriott, which led to a claim being filed at the corporate level. I also had the police come by and I submitted a report. In the following weeks, Marriott Claims said that they weren't liable for the theft since there was no proof of anything (that I had the items and that they were at fault). It wasn't until the police made an arrest and I wrote a letter to Marriott Corporate that they re-opened the case and subsequently compensated me for the loss. All told, the hotel should have recognized their fault up front and at least made an effort to compensate me. It's horrible that I lost $1300 worth of items and it took over a month and an arrest for them to give me anything. I would have been happy with a hotel credit for the lost amount so I could use it at another Marriott hotel. Instead, I had to go on the offensive to receive compensation. I love the Marriott properties and will stay at another Marriott, but this particular hotel is now on my \"do not stay here\" list, despite its proximity to Seaworld and the rates. I expected more from a Marriott and this place just doesn't meet those standards. -R", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairfield Inn & Suites Orlando at Seaworld", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d1391738-Reviews-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_Orlando_at_Seaworld-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$112 - $170*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10815 International Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32821</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515869", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/ea/dd/fairfield-inn-suites.jpg"}}
