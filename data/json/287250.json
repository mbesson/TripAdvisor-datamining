As described: hotel is in a dodgy area of Barcelona. The Ramblas is not as close as you might hope. The rooms are very basic and they have no atmosphere at all. The bathrooms are sufficient. The breakfast is a joke. The lobby area is nice for a hotel like this (but don't expect to sit in a lounge chair though, no space for that). Don't forget: it is a 1 star hotel (or a minus 1 star hotel as a colleague joked). The elevator is an adventure by itself: like riding the Tower of Terror at Disneyland. But for big suitcases it seems the only option.If you're on a tight budget and have not too many other options, this one could be considered.

We just returned from a three night stay at the Coronado Hotel and found it a very strange experience. They are remodeling, so maybe after they're done it will be different, but we were puzzled.Parts of it are very modern and ritzy - marble floors in the bathrooms, brand new sinks, lovely new lobby. Other parts, however, were pretty terrible - scary old elevator, leaking bathroom ceiling and HORRIBLE shower!First of all, the good. Since they've apparently just remodeled, the bathrooms were very nice with marble floors, beautiful sinks and nicefurniture in the rooms. They give you a small TV and a large closet.Also, the bathroom has an electrical outlet which can automatically convert voltage to American. The lobby was lovely and the staff was friendly (we had an early flight and had to leave at 4:30 am. The front desk ordered a taxi for us and had a pitcher of orange juice waiting for us downstairs.) Breakfast was good - nothing gourmet, but hearty and free. They offered cheese  ham on toast, croissants, cereal, and juice. Also, the location was good. We were about a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas and didn't have to use our metro ticketsat all. We were a little concerned about safety in the area, but thatmight have just been in our heads as we didn't see anything that looked too dodgy.The worst thing we encountered in the hotel was our shower. It was tiny, which we're fairly used to from our other hotels in Europe, butthe worst part was that the shower curtain did not go all the way down, so the bathroom floor became entirely soaked everytime we took a shower. We tried all kinds of ways to prevent this from happening, but nothing worked. Seems like the people above us had the same problem since we arrived to find our bathroom ceiling leaking. Due to the remodeling, the floor of our room was covered in a thin layer of dust, which, in combination with our wet feet from the shower, made for a very unpleasant experience.They made our bed daily but did not wash the sheets (the dust from our muddy feet remained in the bed during our whole stay.)We did not spend too much time in our hotel, so it was fine for us. However, if I were to return to Barcelona I would probably stay at a different hotel (or at least wait until they finish remodeling.)", "Date": "May 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR681163809", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Smithla6"}, {"Content": "OK, I wouldn't stay there again       view from room,facing toward Las Ramblas", "Date": "Sep 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR129336482", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "RufusRex"}, {"Content": "Didn't like it With a 7 minute walk from La Rambla, you'll find this hotel. Okay, it is in a sidestreet, but not that close to La Rambla as the hotel itself likes to pretend on its site.This is for the budget traveller. Do not expect anything fancy. I have to disagree with some comments here. I didn't find it to be in a dodgy neighbourhood. La Rambla itself I found dodgier at many times of the day. On the other hand: the hotel is extremely noisy. There are many sounds coming in the rooms from the street which will probably keep you from sleeping.Another comment I read here was how clean it was. I found a hair on a new towel... it wasn't mine.I also have to disagree on the breakfast. It was very basic and simple and not tasty. They had some cereal (if you like that) and furthermore: cookies, coffee, orange juice, tea and water. Plus dry bread you can toast and a lot of very sweet (too much sugar or butter) croissants with butter and jelly. There is a bakery around the corner if you fancy some variation, so rather skip the breakfast,The hotel is undergoing refurbishment. And now it looks really like a warzone. The hotel is indeed in need for refurbishment. It looks like an old hotel and the materials used look very used. The floor in your room might be broken and the elevator and stairs appear to be from a scary movie. The walls show bursts and need a paintjob. Definately not what they show on their website.The beds are ugly but comfortable. The bathroom is small but has its functions. The hotel offers a load of gadgets. From soap to a toothbrush and from shampoo to a shaving kit.I found the price high for what you get offered, especially considering all the refurbishments that are going on. You can do much better for a better price in Barcelona. All in all I would not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR643015657", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "DrTripper"}, {"Content": "Clean, friendly staff and good location Stayed in this hotel for three nights last weekend. The hotel is basic and clean. The rooms aren't spacious but I wouldn't call them small for a budget hotel either. Bathroom was okay, shampoo, tooth brush and paste, shaving gear, etc were provided and there was a hairdryer. We stayed in a twin room, the beds were very comfortable. Not too hard. There's a telly, BBC world was the only English spoken channel, and a safe for free to use (you have to ask for the key at the reception). There was some work going on in the hotel, but only during the day and we never heard anything. The staff was very friendly and spoke good English. The airco wasn't very powerful, but we thought it was okay.The only thing I didn't like was breakfast. There was a small plate with a croissant, a small bun and some biscuits for every guest and you could help yourself to cereals and/or choco pops with milk. Also there was juice and coffee/tea. I had not expected much, but had hoped for a bit more choice than this. Another thing I aprreciated less, was the noise our neighbours made. But I guess some people just don't care or realise that most (budget) hotels are quite noisy.The location was perfect for exploring the city. The hotel is in a side street from the Rambla (about 10 minutes walk) and only 200 meters away from the underground station Parallel. If you don't mind a bit of walking, you can see many things (i.e. the beach) by foot. Whenever you get tired, the underground takes you everywhere. I payed 17 euro's for a 4 day travelcard, not expensive I thought. The hotel is in El Raval, it used to be a 'bad' neighbourhood. Some parts are still a bit dodgy, but we (two fair haired women) never felt unsafe walking to the hotel at night.Bottom line: if you're looking for a basic hotel that's in a handy location, this is the place to be.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR238186751", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Dutchlassie"}, {"Content": "Good price value / 4 thumbs up We all liked this little hotel for the price. There were four of us traveling so we had two rooms. The rooms were basic but impeccably clean and included all the essentials: a good shower, plenty of hot water, decent lighting, a hair dryer in the bathroom, and a basket of toiletries like soap, bath gel, a razor, a toothbrush, shampoo, etc. The AC ran very low, but this seemed to be true of more expensive places we stayed on other legs of the trip, too. The room had a TV, a phone, and a safe. Decor was simple but clean and neat. Breakfast was basic, but fine - OJ, coffee or tea, cereal, a croissant, some cookies, yogurt. Although there was construction on the street, we were surprised at how well we could block out street sounds by closing the window. We had one noisy night - on Saturday, there were late night revelers coming in at all hours and being loud in the hallways. It's a late night town - one of our party went out jogging at 5:30 am on Sunday morning and couldn't believe how many people were just heading home from Saturday night partying!Most of the staff were very helpful, particularly the guys who staffed the desk afternoons and evenings. They spent a lot of time talking to us and making excellent recommendations. One young woman who staffed the desk most days was officious and rather annoying, probably our only complaint and a minor one. We found the location to be fine - a block or two from a major Metro stop on Parallelo and about a 10 or 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas. We liked the neighborhood - it had a local non-touristy feel, and we 4 women felt quite safe walking home at night. There was a friendly little market across the street, and several cheap internet cafes nearby. We were also delighted to discover a few excellent restaurants within a block or two. Half a block away was Elche where we had delightful meals and superb service at a very reasonable price in a lovely little dining room. Very friendly place, specializing in Valencian and Catalan rice, paella and noodle dishes served with seafood or meats. Another night, on the recommendation of a fellow on the desk, we ate at San Telmo, an Argentinian restaurant a block or so away - an absolutely charming restaurant with excellent food. Two of us aren't beef eaters, yet we found wonderful local fare. Almost all the people dining there were locals - the place was a real treasure. A complimentary glass of cava after the meal and a strolling Spanish guitarist added to the ambiance. The hotel was doing over the lobby and the breakfast room/bar while we were there. They also have a new website that seems to reflect this upgrade. We stayed here as part of a travel package, but I would recommend this place as a good value hotel for budget travelers.

I would immediately say that the staff were good but the hotel not so good. On check in we discovered that our online booking hadn't been entered into the system (I've heard of this happening if you book through another website) and there were no rooms available. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and we were offered an apartment across the street instead at the same price. The apartment was extremely clean but smelled of stale smoke which never went away during our 3 night stay. The linen and towels were changed daily, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom okay - just a bit shabby in terms of age. However not only were there road works immediately outside the door but the noise from the street from passerbys woke us continously from about 4am onwards each morning. I definitely wouldn't reccomend anyone to stay in the apartment at all. The hotel is within walking distance from Las Ramblas but i would strongly reccomend that you don't walk home at night. It is located in an area i would consider to be fairly dodgy - the one night we walked we passed several prostitutes and felt very unsafe. The other two nights we got taxi's in and out of the centre.
