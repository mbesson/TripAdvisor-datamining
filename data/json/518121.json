{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the Lido Vanna and Massimo were the loveliest of hosts, as was there son, Orlando, and the two beautiful Czechs girls who were there for the summer to learn Italian.My wife and I got engaged on the veranda overlooking the Sieve River valley below. The pool was fantastic in the summer, as it was hot. Vanna's food was delicious! And, Massimo always willing to take us into town for groceries, or into Florence (only about 25 minutes by car) for culture.The house is lovely, there are many rooms of varying sorts available, and all are comfortable. Maggie, the dog, was always around to say hello. And, we frequently took the bikes out for rides through the hills. I also went horseback riding through the area (Vanna arranged it for me), and I had a blast, Gallopa!I really recommend this place, and cannot wait to return our next time through the Florence area...Many thanks to Vanna and Massimo for accomodating us!", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR873571352", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "zfallon"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d518121-r8712928-Casa_Cheli_B_B-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "518121", "Price": "$94"}}
