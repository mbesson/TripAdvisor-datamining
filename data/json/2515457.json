Upon arriving, check-in was quick and easy. I was placed on the 18th floor of the South Tower (1843 to be specific) and had a gorgeous view of the bay. It appears that the majority of the balconies are on the North Tower, though. All I had was the standard hotel window that opened about 4 inches. It was your pretty standard Marriott room. A nice queen-sized bed, 32 inch flat screen tv, an over-sized chair with ottoman and a recently updated bathroom with marble counters and a nice glass enclosed shower. No bathtub though. I do wish that the shower head was a bit higher. I am 6' and I still had to duck a little to get under the shower head. Everything was clean and well kept, nothing disgusting about it what-so-ever. Now for the good stuff, the restaurants on site. First night I want to Roy's Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine, which is located right out back of the hotel near the harbor. What a great place! A bit pricey, but still worth it. I had the macadamia crusted mahi-mahi & it just melted in your mouth. Great cocktails here as well. On another day, I tried the Tequila Bar & Grille that is located poolside. It's a decent lunch with HUGE portions. If you are just hanging out by the pool (which by the way is AMAZING), this is a good place to grab a bite to eat. There are many other dining options available around the area. Just a quick walk North up the boardwalk is a slew of restaurants that all have fresh fish and nice harbor views. Then there is also the Gaslamp district (about a 5 minute walk) that has a little bit of everything available. Traveling by taxi to the San Diego Zoo cost ~ $15. Not bad at all. Coming back from SeaWorld cost ~$35. So if you don't have a car while you are there, options for transportation are available. The one thing that people should know about is the train that passes through at night. I personally wasn't too bothered by it most nights since it was just a passing whistle and I am used to city noises. But on the Wednesday night the train must have just stopped in front of the hotel and blew it's whistle for a good 30-45 minutes straight at 2 or 3 AM. Overall, I would say this is a decent place to stay in San Diego if you are visiting the convention center (or even going to a Padres ballgame) since it is close to everything.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Br00klynB", "ReviewID": "UR127518570", "Content": "Great hotel with great views, wonderful pool and fitness center.

And I have to say that the cleaning service was very good and the maid remembered a special request that I had made the day before. Truly, my only complaint is one which the hotel has no control over. There were two railroad gates that clanged closed repeatedly for the trolly and occasional train all day and almost all night. And a lovely 1:45 a.m. train that loved to blow the whistle. We were on the 21st floor and I felt like we were sleeping by the tracks. So my best advise... try for a harbor view.

The overall feel of the hotel reminded me of a very large convention hotel complex that tries to pass itself off as a nice place for a resort stay with the latter just not fitting the bill. Rooms. We were given a two double bed room on the 25th floor with a city view and small balcony with seating for two small chairs and an end table. The room itself was clean, basic and business sterile. Popcorn ceilings. Reminded me of something I would think was extra special in the early 90's. Bedding, furnishing and decor were of course updated but nothing special. Beds comfortable. We were especially tired from a morning at Disneyland and subsequent drive to San Diego and visit to a college. We checked into our room and surved the pool area. There is an area with a bar and outdoor seating/fire pits however this area was too crowded to eat so we ate along the pier someplace. Fun walk around the marina area. Came back to hotel to hot tub but I declined after having to move several beer bottles, plates of food, wet towels.. out of the way. I was very tired and looking forward to a good nights sleep after a busy day. There was a large group party in the room below us. It was only 9:30pm so I was not going to ruin their party by complaining of noise. The party was noisy but not out of control. You do hear the trains but that did not bother me enough to inturrupt my sleep. I had trouble getting to sleep, something I normally don't have a problem with, and awoke at midnight to extreem noise. The people in the room next to me were pounding on the walls, yelling at the party below me and shouting at the top of their lungs. I called and complained at 1am. It stopped for a few mins and then started back in again intermittently for the rest of the night. I'm not talking a noisy group of people here. I'm talking about men in their 20's screaming at the top of their lungs and pounding on walls. I got little sleep and was a wreck the next am. I did complain to the front desk. They appologized and comped our self park after I asked them to. They also offered us a late check out which I was unable to take them up on because we had to drive to Santa Monica. To their defense they did say that the party scene was not the norm and they had over 20 noise complaints that night. They said it is typically a great family place to stay. To be honest I would not stay here again even if I had a good nights sleep unless I had to for business and I did not pay for it. It was just too business convention and sterile with no real feel of resort to me.

Plumbing; I know there are hundreds of millions of Americans and the USA is the most powerful nation on earth... So I want to tread carefully here... But how come we need \"toilet plungers\"? Not only was a plunger provided... It was necessary :( We were on the 19th floor for goodness sake.. surely gravity should work?!! Restaurants were a little lacking. Here's what we have... LC's breakfast only, didn't go there. Sarbuck's stall... Tended to be a bit busy. The OUTDOOR Tequila bar and grill. Shut when it rains, freezing when it is dry and it's February, even when it was open we didn't fancy that. Roy's, look that up separately. Good but pricy and rather off campus. Lounge bar....

Even though I did not pay personally for the stay, I did not think that their rates were out of line with other hotels in major cities. My room in the south tower was awesome, with a beautiful view of both the city and the bay. The sunrises were beautiful. The room itself was spacious, clean, and well-equipped. I had the best nights' sleep on this room's king-size bed that I have ever had in a hotel. (I personally did not even notice the trains in the night, although my room faced in that direction -- that's how well I slept.) The desk area had a panel that allows you to plug in up to four devices, plus it had input plugs for HDMI, laptop DVD's and other audio/video plugs. I assume that these would allow you to watch a movie or play a game that was your laptop, with the video showing on the widescreen plasma TV monitor. The bath was spacious with a walk-in shower with a rainforest shower head -- ah, bliss! No problem with water pressure or temperature. I agree with other writers that prices in the hotel shops were very high. While the floor vending machine had soda for $2.00, the price at the gift shop was $3.49. Hotel staff were uniformly pleasant and knowledgeable. My companions and I ventured out into the Gaslamp district for dinners, and found varying quality, mostly chain restaurants (Hard Rock Cafe) or what I would consider to be overpriced touristy restaurants ($10 for a side of broccoli with a steak!) sandwiched between bars of all types and touristy shops and boutiques. We also took the ferry to Coronado Island one evening and checked out the San Diego Zoo, both great experiences.

I opted ahead of time not to bring my laptop since I find it ridiculous to have to pay $13.00 a day just for internet access. I also opted to not get a rental car since parking charges are extravagent. A shuttle from and to the airport is $16.00 round trip. Everything else I did was within walking didtance of the hotel.

Compounding this fee was that we had to walk approx 2 blocks to get to the elevator to our room from parking. Our room overlooked the bay... which also overlooks the pool/bar. And the pool/bar was noisy at night, even late. We had to close the door to the balcony that we paid to upgrade to because that was the only way we were going to get sleep. Finally - this hotel got really busy Friday night - there are lots of meeting rooms and it is next to the convention center. Had to wade through a ton of convention-goers, all with the obligatory drink in hand. The elevators were extremely slow - i had unloaded our car and slogged the two blocks from the parking with our luggage, then had to wait about 8 minutes for an elevator headed up. By this time, quite a crowd had gathered. I got lucky and was standing in front of the one that opened, but quite a few people were left to wait for another one. $20 for a roll-away was a bit steep.

We weren't sure how we'd like the downtown hotels near Broadway. We wanted someplace within walking distance from the station and walking distance to attractions/restaurants/shopping. We got all that and we were happy with the beautiful view and the price was right! To check in we had to wait in line - that was a first for me. The line took about 15 minutes to get through. Once we had the key in our hand, we were off and running to enjoy our 24 hours in SD. We tried out their pool on a breezy, chilly December afternoon - the kids were happy even with the kiddy pool closed. The great outdoor bar nearby provided the entertainment for the parents. But I wouldn't take the kids to the fire pit areas once the evening hours hit. Quite a bit of romantic PDA going on. We were so happy to find that the Children's Museum was so close - 3 min. walk and a great playground was there too. The BIGGEST downside was the HUGE freight train that went through downtown at 2am! It blew it's horn f-o-r-e-v-e-r!! And it echoed through the whole downtown - I can't imagine anyone sleeping through that - although our kids did! :) The one that went through town at 6pm was entertaining for all to watch, but 2am, really! Not the hotel's fault obviously, there should be some noise ordinance rules or something...so I am giving this hotel a \"4\" because of the unfortunate train experience. We did not eat at the hotel - explored flavors of SD instead. We had a very disappointed 9 year old when we told her that we wouldn't pay for the very expensive room service!

We booked it for 3 reasons. 1st we are Marriott Elite members. 2nd the hotel is pet friendly. 3rd location. We were very excited to check into this hotel to get away from the cold weather and ring in the New Year. We were royally disappointed. The hotel is undergoing an extensive renovation. The hotel lobby and common areas were recently redone and are beautiful. The rooms in the north tower were also redone and are nice and comfortable, but I would not say they are anything special. The south tower is currently closed for renovation. The hotel had a wide mix of people from families to people in town for the bowl game and New Years eve to people doing business next door at the convention center. While I felt the hotel was extremely busy, it was not out of control or very loud. After a short $14 cab ride with the most unfriendly cab driver in all of San Diego we arrived at the Marriott Marquis. Our check in was swift and we were in our hotel room with in 10 minutes. We were assigned room 419. a corner room on the 4th floor. Sounded nice, but upon arrival what we found was a very small room, with a tiny bathroom. We made the decision to stay and unpack and go about our day exploring the city. But we ran into problems when we got back. The room was so small we kept bumping into each other. The bathroom was so small that only one person could be in it at a time, which made getting ready extremely time consuming. At the end of the night we noticed the toilet would not stop running which kept waking us up. When we got up the next morning we decided we had to say something, Our rate included breakfast. So we went down to the first floor restaurant and waited to be served. The restaurant can only be described as a mad house. It was over run with families who let their children run wild. The staff was overwhelmed and slow. The hostess forgot to call our name and crossed us off the wait list. After waiting a half hour and noticing people who got their after us were now being seated we said something to the hostess. After saying that she called our name, which she didn\u2019t because I was standing next to her the entire time, she sat us down. We immediately got on line for the omelet bar which was average, but extremely slow. Following our breakfast which took entirely too long, we went to the front desk to complain about the room and service thus far. The woman at reception was nice and apologetic and moved us from our 4th floor room to the 19th floor. Our new room was 1925. What you need to know about the hotel is the north tower is shaped like a football or oval. The largest rooms are towards the center. When you get to either end of the building the rooms get considerably smaller. This was evident from the second we walked into our new room and reinforced by the bellman who helped us move. Room 1925 was right off the elevator and was probably twice the size our original room. It faced the pool and had amazing views of the bay. The bathroom was much larger and had a separate toilet and shower area. It also had a much bigger closet and more drawers for storage. The great part about this room was it faced the bay and had fantastic views of the water and Coronado. We also we had a birds eye view of the Red Bull No Limits jump across the Embarcadero Marina. The service at the Marriott Marquis Marina was lack luster and the employees did not make us feel special being that we are elite members. For the most part we found ourselves frustrated with the service more than usual. There were several small instances, starting with our original room that all added up. One of the biggest was the lack of communication. After spending an entire day out we came back at 4:15pm to find our room was not made up. When I called down to \u201cAt Your Service\u201d they said it was because we left our small dog in the room and not in a cage. I understand why they would not enter the room, but we really wished they would had told us that was their policy upfront. They tell you there\u2019s a $75 pet fee up front. How come no one mentioned anything like \u201cThe maids will not enter your room for service if your pet is not caged or you are not there\u201d? So that lead to me calling down 3 times for maid service. Each time I was told they were on the way. A maid finally showed up an hour and a half after my first phone call. Another frustration we had was paying for wine glasses. We picked up a bottle of wine along the way and called down for some glasses to enjoy it. The woman who took our request told me there would be a $3 per glass charge since it was a room service request. I find that ridiculous. And I have stayed in many other Marriott\u2019s where there were wine glasses already in the room. Some good parts of the hotel, it\u2019s location is great. It\u2019s on the water. It\u2019s a 5 minute walk to the Gaslamp Quarter. It\u2019s a 2 minute walk to the convention center. The pools are very nice. The gym has been renovated and has all new equipment. One cool thing is you can take a water taxi from the hotel across the bay to Coronado, it\u2019s $6 per person each way. It\u2019s a 15 minute ride across the bay to the Coronado Marriott Resort and Spa. It was a relaxing ride and one of the best days we had in San Diego. I will say the walk from the Marriott in Coronado down to Orange Avenue and then to the beach was 2 miles. So there\u2019s a lot of walking. But if you can do it, walk down to the Hotel del Coronado and have a drink and some food on the deck. You won\u2019t be sorry. Other things about San Diego: Most of the cab drivers were not very friendly. Balbo park is beautiful and worth a trip to see. We had amazing dinners at two restaurants: Bencotto Italian Kitchen in San Diego\u2019s Little Italy. Our second recommendation is Searsucker in the Gaslamp Quarter. Make reservations at both, you won\u2019t be sorry and it will make up for the lack of service at the Marriott.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Halawis", "ReviewID": "UR122351551", "Content": "A 1 minute walking from the convention center, 5 from the gas lamp quarter.

I had a beautiful view from my room of the city plus a bit of the water and the Coronado bridge. It was a hassle to go to the lobby to use Wi-Fi. The alternative was to spend $12.95 per day. Location: being right at the Marina, there is great walking, and bikes for rent. Fitness center: they have a trainer in their gym who leads a fabulous Zumba workout, which is not offered often enough. Other: the staff are great: pleasant, helpful, considerate. Can't say enough about them. Food: the breakfast wasn't great, but there is a place within 3 blocks with a more reasonably-priced, great breakfast (I do not eat enough to be impressed by $22 breakfast buffets).

They do offer towels at the pool along with a few float toys. There is also the lounge by the pool and that was great, decent prices, drinks were delicious :) the Marriott also offers S'mores kits to enjoy at one of there many fire pits located around the pool area.

The Marriott offers a wonderful array of treats to feed or snack on during the Comic Con event that are available in the Lobby near Starbuck's. Yes, I said Starbuck's, happy happy, joy joy!

Thats ok as spouses join their spouses for the meeting but don't expect a quiet swim or any quiet at the pool. Drink service at the pool was speedy. Drinks were strong. The pool bar at night had live entertainment and they did a great job. It actually gets chilly at night and almost every table had a heater. The fitness center...nicest I've seen at a hotel...looks new and lots of good equipment. Not overly impressed with breakfast choices BUT...it's a big hotel so thats how it goes. One restaurant off the lobby serving a buffet or ala carte. Too expensive. Walk into town and get something if time allows. Ended up getting coffee and yogurt with fruit at the Starbucks in the lobby fort 8 bucks. One final note...the concierge services were A PLUS......they made reservations for us several times..one restaurant had customized our menus and a complimentary dessert compliments of the concierge.

The rooms were very clean and the bathrooms had real wood in them in full length mirrors on the backs of the bathroom doors. It\u2019s a great hotel for business. As a matter of fact, the convention center is literally next door to the hotel. I think the main highlight of this place was the pool/bar. I apologize for not having pics of it; I honestly was too busy drinking pina coladas to remember to take those pics :). The staff is very nice and attentive and its definitely one of those hotels that can cater to the family with young children, the energetic 20-somethings and the more mature ones that just want to sit back and talk over a beer\u2026or two... or three. I admit the largest area of the pool was closed that day so I didn\u2019t go in but it looked amazing. The Marriott is right on Seaport village, next to the embarcadero and 3 blocks down and across the street from the Gaslamp. Some tidbits to those going to SD for the first time... the Gaslamp is filled with restaurants and bars so make sure to check that out. Seaport village is a tourist trap but very nice and fun to walk around. The zoo and balboa park are MUSTs. If you have the time (and love Mexican food) check out the carnitas at the Old Town Mexican Cafe. If you love desserts, I recommend you go to Extraordinary Desserts. If you ove burgers, go to Hodad's. Parking in downtown is horrible and expensive but its worth it. if you love crab, check out Joe's Crab Shack. For steaks, Mortons or Loui and Mickies. For breakfast you must go to Hash House a-Gogo. A fun date night with live music at Anthropology.

The temporary entrance was at the North Tower. This made unloading and reloading luggage a challenge, especially since I was in a walking cast during the trip. For those attending meetings at the Convention Center, the South Tower is your best bet since it's the closest to the Convention Center. However, the concierge lounge is in the North Tower (why they don't have two surprises me at this level of a hotel). After a day of walking, it can be the last thing you want. The pool area was under construction as well, but my room was high enough in the tower that I wasn't bothered by the daily construction noise. If your room is facing the city, beware of the train horns and bells during the day and night. It can be bothersome for light sleepers. Overall the staff was good although the bellmen were a bit abrupt when I was trying to simply \"run in\" to check in. They charged me $5 to do that, which was absurd and I told the bellman that much. He shrugged and said it was hotel policy (later, I found out that it could have been \"waived\" but I feel bad for the people who are too exhausted from their trip to really argue or complain about it). Valet parking and self-parking. Well. Because of the construction, I opted for self-parking (the aforementioned walking cast meant that I wasn't up to doing much walking due to pain), since the self-parking was on the South Tower side. Spaces are hard to come by, especially at night. My room faced the bay, which was nice and kept things quiet. Room service was its traditionally expensive self but okay. The menu was the standard Marriott menu. I've stayed at this hotel several times and this isn't the best time I've had. It was mainly due to the construction but the housekeeping staff wasn't consistent with the level of cleanliness. The service in the restaurants was poor as well.

They came in and changed out towels and toiletries each day which not all places bother with. Pros: The conference staff were very attentive. The food for the conference was quite good and they had a nice variety over the two full days we were there. Also, the views were amazing. I overlooked the harbor one way and also the city the other way. Great views! I did pay a small price of hearing a harbor out sound his horn 5 times all three mornings I was there at 4am.

Really. I did not have any unpleasant experiences. Everything from the check-in experience to the check-out experience was efficient and professional. The concierge desk was always manned with very knowledgeable, eager staff. I needed information on a couple of occasions and they were very thorough and without delay. There is a Starbucks in the lobby that is convenient for grabbing beverages and pastries/etc. on the go. However, they do close rather early--7pm. There is someone who shines shoes during the day and he is very good and quite pleasant. The gift shop is fairly typical of a hotel in that there are a limited number of drinks, snacks, and over-the-counter items such as pain relievers and toiletries. Parking is $24/day, also typical of a downtown upscale hotel. There is a very nice restaurant called Roy's that is connected to the hotel. The food is considered Hawaiian Fusion. I ate there twice. The food was very good, but beware as some of the items are pricey for the quantity served--ie. the Cioppino. $25.00 for a bowl that had just a small amount of the broth. I did not eat inside the hotel, so I can't speak to the quality. The location is very good. The USS Midway is within walking distance, as is the popular Gaslamp district. Horton Plaza, which is an outdoor mall is about 3 blocks and has a variety of stores, including a CVS drugstore and a few eateries. Nordstrom and Macys are the 2 high end anchor stores. There is a trolley stop just across the street from the hotel. There is a grocery store about 2 blocks away, Ralphs. They carry both conventional and organic products. Their deli wasn't impressive though. I sampled a few items and thought they needed to go back to the drawing board. Other than the deli/items made in the store, I was pleased with the store. Keep in mind, the pool is closed for renovation. They have made arrangements with one of the neighboring hotels for their guests to have pool privileges. Although we didn't use the pool, this was nice to know because often hotels announce the pool is closed and make no concessions or arrangements for the hotel guests. They are doing considerable renovation in this area and it is apparent that it will be simply gorgeous when completed. I believe the target completion is late May, 2011. The hotel is connected to the convention center so there are often a lot of people at the hotel, but don't be put off by that. We never experienced a noise problem or a crowd problem.

The pool was not open yet and will be really nice from what we could see through the windows. The negative of this hotel-once you get by the shear enormous size- is that the rooms while redone are very basic as is the bathroom. I would say barely one level up from the newer Marriott Courtyard we stayed in by the airport. The bathroom is very small and the amenities are from Bath and Body Works but no shower gel or cap. The towels are new but kind of scratchy.

The North Side Park had a car show and various street vendors on the weekend. It was a great area for walking. The park on the South has exercise stations along the way. When you go out the front door, it is an easy walk to the Gaslamp District and Horton Plaza. It is adjacent to the Convention Center and the morning it was raining, they had a clearly marked path through the parking garage to the Convention Center so you didn't have to go outside. Unfortunately, part of the walkpath was underwater and you had to splash through puddles. The restaurants were pricey but the food was very good. I also attened a conference dinner in the ballroom that had very good food for that type of event. I ate breakfast there twice and they have a (pricey) buffett which I passed on. It took longer than it should have when I placed an order. They are definitely trying to get you to stick with the buffet. I also ordered a room service breakfast my last morning and it failed to have the fruit with it that should have been included. There are a ton of other restaurants within walking distance.

So I'll be brief and try to hit the key points for me, during this mid-August 2010 stay. First, location, location... This is tough to beat, especially for a Convention Center event. This hotel is literally next door to the SDCC, requiring merely a walk down the steep entrance way, past lovely flowers and facing the trolley tracks and Gaslamp District, and a short walk (~ 1 city block) to the A-side of the huge convention hall). If distance is critical (limited walking, accessibility, etc.), the South Tower is slightly closer. The hotel, as I read \"here\" before booking, has 2 Towers, and both are fine, straddling a huge pool and the lovely marina which adjoins Seaport Village (great sunsets and several \"artsy\" shops, fresh cookies, seafood restaurants, fireworks on weekends, horse 'n buggy rides, nice place to stroll). The North Tower has many rooms with small balconies, a major appeal to me, and reason I requested this. Savvy travelers have described how the South Tower has more modern amenities (e.g., large LCD TV's) which may be true, but it has few balconies and I was happy with my room's old but empty refrigerator (to stow a sandwich for next day or milk/beverages) rather than overstuffed \"refreshment bar\" one needs to dance around to fit a stick of cheese, or risk paying exorbitant prices for. Only one bottle of spring water to fit that bill, and there's a small store with early/late hours in the lobby between the two towers, selling sundries, snacks, even liquor, along with post cards etc. So it's easy to live close to the room and hotel and do a lot of eating out, as well as storing some food & drink for snacks and packing for day trips. (Did I mention the San Diego Zoo? I will!) I was solo and there for a professional conference so mostly work-oriented, and the convention center proximity was ideal to lug things back and forth. Like many huge convention hotels, the wait for the elevator around dinner time could be fierce, but what can be done? ;-) Parking lot got full which might be annoying to some, but then there was valet parking. I'm sure expensive, but that's typical too. I used cabs or public transportation, both easy. Doormen/concierge - all cheery, helpful, hard-working, quick to pull out maps and share personal knowledge of the area. Gaslamp Quarter is \"just across the tracks\" literally (well, down the ramp, across the trolley tracks, and 2-3 blocks South to the heart of it, the entrance being at 5th Ave). A 10 minute walk to the bus and 1/2 hour ride and I was at the Zoo on my one day off. It's as good as it's reputation. Allow a full day! Other than location, amenities were fine for me, maybe not as decadent as some might expect from a 4/5 star place, but the balcony view of the Marina and Coronado Island made up for that! (Same with the not-state-of-the-art TV which I could not plug my computer into, but that was ok, and was \"forced\" to take my little laptop screen out to the balcony to look at my zoo photos with.) My bed was King, and comfortable, with a massive collection of pillows. Maids when I saw them (my way out) were friendly, one taking pride that her photo was on the desk - \"that's me!\". Always clean, unobtrusive (left my work materials alone, put away the excess pillows, replaced glasses, etc.) Compared to some conference hotels, the pool and marina really screamed \"resort!\" and were both pretty to see and lovely to visit. There's a poolside bar some enjoyed plus several restaurants, lounges, and conference-related hospitality suites and a lounge. The Hawaiian Fusion restaurant, Roy's, sits atop the pool area and its lower floor opens up to tables on the \"boardwalk\" along the marina, another good place to catch a sunset. Bath amenities: ok. Desk: nice. (Bring your own broadband or prepare to pay for it, like most US convention hotels.) Balcony: great. (Mine had two chairs, no table, but was a great place to think, reflect, even try to do some work). Only did room service once - and it was quick (and as is common, expensive after the various delivery and service fees - but still I enjoyed the breakfast I had one morning). I didn't really get a chance to see specifically child/teen/family friendly things, other than the pool (and of course the ease of seeing sightseeing musts like the Zoo and Sea World, etc.) Really oriented towards Convention crowds, but when the crowds thin it must still be a nice place to lounge at the pool, explore the Gaslamp Quarter and elsewhere by night, and use as a base for seeing San Diego. I didn't have much leisure time within the hotel itself, as it was my convention base camp, but staff were responsive and friendly, and did I mention the location? I'd love to return to SD, and would have no qualms about staying here again if I needed to be right at the Convention Center, or nearby. If I had one pet peeve, it was the neighbor who seemed to be studying anvil and pickax use early morning and late night. Paper thin wall, at least with a connecting room, which I should have had the presence of mind to avoid, but forgot. Still, I had such a great view and room overall, two earplugs and a wake-up call took care of that.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice pool and location but expensive parking and other things\u201d", "Author": "AZGuy85255", "ReviewID": "UR76237485", "Content": "Some friends and I stayed at the Marriott Mariner prior to a Deep Sea fishing trip.

We stayed in the North tower and while some reviews have said that it is more dated than the South tower, we still found that the decor was lovely and the beds more comfortable than any we'd slept in. While expensive, the food at the restaurants is delicious. Roy's was a wonderful early dinner by the water for two tired travelers but expect to pay top price. The landscaping is gorgeous. The pool area is like walking into your own personal tropical paradise. The hotel is a short walk to many downtown locations and we enjoyed a morning jog on the docks through Seaport Village (which also hosts several wonderful restaurants and fun shops.) *The hotel has an EXCELLENT fitness center (and they have free apples there) The bad: Prepare to pay $24 daily to park your car IF...and that is IF they have a spot available for you. THey provide parking for the marina as well and when we returned from a day at the San Diego Zoo we couldn't find parking anywhere and were told that we could valet for $35.

Walk two blocks to Richard Walker's Pancake House for incredible oversized breakfasts.

The most worrying aspect of my stay was a locked emergency stairwell. The elevators are currently being refurbished, so the wait was quite long at times. Being on the third floor, I got tired of waiting one day and decided to take the stairs down to the lobby. The stairwell closest to the elevator (and the designated evacuation route for the rooms on that side of the tower) ended in a locked door- there was literally no other door to get out between the locked bottom door and third floor. Glad there wasn't a fire! The North Tower rooms are aged and a bit shabby. The bed, however, was extremely comfortable.

Rooms are also noisy- sound echoes in the halls, and there is a large gap under each door, so you hear everything in the halls. Earplugs were necessary for sleeping. Parking during Padres games is an issue. At $24 per day to self-park, I didn't even try to valet the car. Be forewarned, the hotel sells parking to folks attending ball games at Petco Park, so if you are attempting to return to the hotel around the time a game is starting, there may be no parking. Parking structure for the North Tower is creepy, dark and drippy from leaking pipes. The whole approach to the North Tower from self-parking is weird- you feel like you're in parts of the property that are normally hidden away from guests (stacks of stored chairs outside the tower, trash area, etc). The Starbucks on site is convenient, but they charge double what a Starbucks normally charges. Gulp! Reservation agents were pleasant but a bit hapless. The hotel had a special rate of $149 a night for the Bar Exam. They had mis-booked my reservation and goofed up my email address, so I phoned them to confirm my reservation and find out why I hadn't received an email confirmation, I learned that I had been booked for a stay that was one night shorter than I had requested at booking. The agent didn't even apologize or offer anything to try to fix it. I ended up having to pay the rack rate of $199 for one night. Some sort of apology or recognition that they had screwed up by getting the check out date wrong and failing to send the confirmation email would have been appreciate. The \"high speed\" ethernet consisted of a modem which felt like it was overheating. Noticed that it was actually just a phone line (not an ethernet cable) that came out of the wall and into the modem. At $12.95, it seemed way too questionable, so I opted not to use it. Is it really too much to ask to expect decent Wi-Fi in my room? The \"express checkout\" on the TV (as per the instructions slipped under my door on checkout morning) was actually non-existent. Grrr. All in all, there were plenty of little irritations that would prevent me from ever recommending this hotel.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, Texas, USA", "Title": "\u201cCompletely Happy with our Stay\u201d", "Author": "luv2laughnetime", "ReviewID": "UR73636960", "Content": "This hotel is fabulous...everything from the service to the location.

With 200,000 people converging on one location for Comic-Con, I think the Marriott staff did a bang up job. We were checked in hours early and they were polite, efficient, and even, dare I say, cheerful, when it had to be a very stressful time for them. The rest of the staff was just as friendly, helpful and polite from the maid to the valet to the concierge. The view from the north tower balcony room we were given could not have been more beautiful (see pictures) and it was nice to sit outside after the hectic convention each day. The location was also the very best possible if you are going to any function at the San Diego Convention Center. The convention center is practically connected to the Marriott through the parking garage or a quick walk down the sidewalk. On Friday and Saturday night there was a fireworks show over the bay, but I don't know if that's a weekly thing. It was a treat for me! I was a little concerned about all the complaints from other posters about the train noises, but I never noticed them at all. There was also some concern about the wait for elevators. Granted, a line would form after a big event let out, but I never waited more than a few minutes. Everyone there understood the situation and just dealt with it. The only complaint *I* have is the price. I understand Comic-Con is a godsend for the tourist industry in San Diego, and I also understand the concept of charging whatever the market will bear (after all....I paid the price, right?) but seriously, $450 a night (non-refundable) for a simple room with no extra amenities besides a 2-cup coffeemaker? Plus $34/day for parking and $12/day for internet service? That's almost $500 per day for a room that would never get half that if it were anywhere else at any other time.

My king room was clean and bright, and the balcony was a nice space-addition, even though it was tiny -- just being able to open the patio door made my room bigger. Unfortunately, the tv is a tiny 22\" CRT. The mini-bar cupboard contained no fridge. And the $12.95 per day internet connection was useless -- a wired connection, it cut in and out worse than any wireless I've ever had. Staff in the hotel were ambivalent but not cold. My room was well-tended and I never felt rushed by housekeeping staff. Only on checkout did I experience a frosty staff person -- grunting his way through my checkout, he at least comped me two nights of internet hookup. Just neglected to talk to me at all through the entire process. Pricing in restaurants/room service were typically high for Marriott properties. Food is very good, however. Fitness centre is enormous and modern. The resort-like pool area is highly popular and cramped, though staff are quick to tend to your needs. Just beware the $11 drinks from the Tiki Bar. Poolside menu is promising but the food was below average. Other restaurants were limited in terms of hours -- even the onsite Starbucks is closed by early evening. All in all, yet another Marriott property that defies the distinction of the brand, and instead just exemplifies mediocrity.

We specifically asked for a quiet room and were placed in the north tower on the 17th floor in a room with a balcony. We were happy! We got settled, unpacked and were about to settle down for a good night's sleep. That is, until a freight train went by, constantly blowing its horn. It was so loud in the room, even with the door and drapes closed completely that you almost had to cover your ears. I'm not at all a light sleeper, but I had trouble sleeping due to being awoken every few hours. Our 1 year old didn't sleep very well either, as every time a train would come he would wake up crying. Internet access was $13 per day, which is definitely on the high side (should be free). In the morning, i took a closer look at the sliding door.....it has single pane glass! What were they thinking? Single pane glass in a hotel that overlooks heavily used train tracks? The simple addition of a dual paned sliding door would have made our stay so much better. Another oddity...the rooms (at least in the north tower) are very oddly shaped. Think triangle shaped instead of rectangle. The odd shape, gives the illusion of less \"living space.\" We stayed here years ago and remember the water slide, which we thought would be fun to go down with our 1 year old. Turns out, they got rid of the water slide too :( On the plus side, the staff was friendly, the location was great and the room was very clean.

The hotel is the perfect choice for a special occasion or it could be an excellent choice for any occasion. Probably because my wife is a Gold Marriott Rewards member, we were upgraded to the Penthouse floor (25th floor) of the South Tower which also houses the Concierge Lounge. Our room was beautifully furnished and appeared to have new furniture and carpeting. I believe this hotel was originally built as an Intercontinental Hotel (before they became a part of the Holiday Inn consortium). We had a stunning view of the San Diego bay front as well as a part of the airport. Having the Concierge Lounge at our disposal was a real treat. The first night the offings were chile with build your own nachos, spinach and artichoke dip, vegetables with hummus, an assortment of international cheeses and crackers, deluxe mixed nuts, fruit bowls anda nice choice of yogurts. Later in the evening (beginning around 8:00 PM) the lounge offered chocolate torte cake, cheesecake with raspberries, lemon bars, hazelnut - toffee bars, assorted cookies including raisin oatmeal and chocolate chip. The lounge personnel were very kind and courteous. The lounge itself is beautifully decorated and takes full advantage of the fantastic view of the water. There are two public access computers in the lounge. The hotel houses a Roy's Asian Fusion restaurant that is located along the marina and yacht club. Diners may eat indoors or on the sunny patio outside. One tip: if you go be sure to order the chocolate lava cake. Order it when you are seated as it takes a few minutes of extra preparation. We thought this Roy's had a better ambiance than the Roy's we had eaten at in Hawaii at the Ko Olina Resort Hotel. Our only slight criticism of the hotel was the problem we had getting a wireless connection for our laptop. We simply used the wired connection and left the computer in one place. We also noticed some slight noise from one of the rooms next door. I also feel the $32 per night valet parking fee is unreasonable, but there is really no alternative except self parking which is $22.00. All in all, this is a wonderful property and I think it would be hard to top when staying in the San Diego area. In our opinion it's while worth paying a bit more to have Concierge Lounge access.

The biggest issue in the hotel are the atrociously horrible elevators. It was a joke with everyone in the hotel--we never knew if the elevator doors would actually open on your floor, or if you were doomed to ride up and down, up and down until the elevator decided to stop where you needed it to. Love the pool area but wonder why management chose not to open the poolside bar during the week when over a thousand Husker fans were just itching to spend their money??

You had to be connected to the internet via the cord on the desk which I found irritating as I like to be on the internet while sitting in other locations other than the desk.

Check in took all of about 45 seconds before I had my key, a smile from the clerk and was on my way to the room. When I complained about the internet problem, they removed all charges including the day that it did work before I even inquired. Nor did I get hit with a cancellation fee when I left early. Housekeeping and room service were reliable and prompt. The grounds are nice. I hear a lot of people complaining about the elevator but except for my last night there when hundreds of people checked in at once, I never waited long. Location is convenient for conventions, and a $5 cab ride from the train station which was my mode of transportation from LA. Roy's Hawaiian restaurant was very good food and service, and a prime location with great views from indoors and out. Swimming pool area was pretty small but attractive. To go drinks for the pool area were available from the bar on the Roy's patio, and a telephone outside the gate could be used to order room service food.

We've stayed at this Marriott a few times over the last dozen years with great results, but it's not a luxury hotel anymore. We stayed the night attending an event being held in the Marina ballroom and we called to check availability for an early check-in and were told that the hotel did not sell out the night prior and so rooms were plentiful. I asked for bay view room and was charged an extra 30.00 for the upgrade into the south tower. I pointed out to the desk clerk that we've stayed before and received the same price as the city view as the rooms were available anyway, but with no luck. The south tower is dated but relatively clean. The air conditioner did not work well so in the afternoon, the western sun really heated up the room. Our room had an outstanding view of Coronado and the harbor, but the windows were dirty on the inside (not cool). We went out for the evening and returned to find our bed turned down (which was nice), but oddly enough, the phone had been moved. When we checked out the next day, two phone calls reflected on my bill and I promptly asked to have the charges removed as we had not used the phone. The desk clerk was indifferent to my concerns about someone using the phone in a guest room while the guests are not in, but she removed the charges. DW's pub is horribly overpriced for drinks and it didn't get much better the next day. The breakfast service at LC's was poor, although the waitress was nice, the restaurant was really understaffed and the overall environment was confusing. At one point, the couple next to us got up to go to the buffet and another couple was seated in their chairs by the hostess. The scene that ensued was comedic to watch, but not a happy event for the overworked waitress that had to clear up the mess and apologize to all. And to end it all...we then stood for 40 minutes waiting for the valet service to reclaim our car.

A short cab ride and $12.00 later, I was very warmly greeted by the Marriot bellman. My check-in was early, smooth and my messages and pre-arranged packages conveyed promptly. Return to the airport was similarly quick and efficient. I had a standard King on the Marina side. A million dollar view. The room itself was comfortable, well kept and the window opened for some lovely sea air. It was not special or spectacular but very comfortable and serviceable. Soft water in the showers. Good bed and linens. The best part was its location right next door to the convention centre. I'm not one for breakfast, so I grabbed a Starbucks coffee and croissant and went off to my sessions. for early morning sessions, or returning to the hotel after the Gala dinner the convention centre the location could not be beat. For extra conference excursions it was located right near SD's Fifth Avenue and the Gaslamp area. It was a short walk to Macy's, Nordstrom's and Ralph's and an excellent restaurant area. Notably NOBU, which might have been worth the trip in itself. The hotel also is located on the sea walk area, also very pleasant for lunch or an early morning walk. The DW's bar/restaurant was casual and reasonably priced with generous portions. Roy's Hawaiian Fusion for finer evening dining, excellent as well. On the last day, I did the full breakfast at the LW. I was informed that the buffet was not available due to low occupancy. I was warmly greeted and offered coffee and juice which I accepted. It added $8.00 dollar to my breakfast bill that came in at 25.00 and change before tip. It was very generous (too generous, what's with the ginormous US portions?) in size and OK, but I wouldn't have it again. All service contacts were friendly and consistently good.

Bathrooms have the shower and toilet in a separate room and the sink in an open space adjacent to the main room. That means if one person is getting up earlier than another, you'll see the light and hear them washing up. Meanwhile, the bathroom itself is very tight so if you're in there washing your 3 year old, there isn't a lot of maneuvering space.

Annoying, but typical of higher hotel tiers these days. Check-in was smooth, efficient, and friendly. Room service was punctual. My oatmeal was hot, my juice cold, and service was friendly. Bath & Body Works toiletries have replaced San Diego Marriott branded soap/shampoos. While the new ones are fine, I always prefer a room that has some personality by carrying its brand throughout a room (this can be seen at high end spas like Miraval or any Disney property). The room was clean and well appointed with easy access to electrical outlets. The beds had a soft plump comforter though the mattresses were a bit tired. The HVAC cycles with a loud click but turning the system off solved that problem. The downside here is noise. I checked in on Friday night. There was music somewhere in the distance which I heard through the sliding glass door to the balcony. The trams which run along the nearby boulevard were not annoying, but a significantly louder \"something\" came through in the early hours of the morning - a freight train, perhaps. Also, the plumbing needs some attention as it makes a loud whistling noise in my room when others have their sink or shower on. Since this is California, many east coasters are getting up and showering at 4 and 5 in the morning. The whistling pipes woke me, and I'm a sound sleeper at that hour.

We could also hear the elevators. I also couldn't help but notice that we had no chairs on our balcony, while everyone else had two. I didn't care that much anyway, since we were in town to visit the zoo, Sea World, and other sites-not to sit on the balcony. It's just one of those \"little things\" that I tend to notice. Another thing I noticed was that each day, housekeeping placed different itmes for our use. One day we would get shampoo, bu the next day we had none. On our final day, we noticed that mouthwash was also an item that should probably have been provided daily. It was also annoying that they threw away the cover for my electric toothbursh. And one day our waste bins had a bag, and the next day they had no bag, so we used our grocery bags. The staff are very polite and helpful, which definitely helped.

The cabs hang around in front of the place, and the valets will bring one for you. Oh, and for breakfast, be sure to check out Cafe 222 while you're there. We also ate at Richard Walker's, but we weren't all that impressed. Avoid The Cheese Shop. For dinner, check out Chive, and Sally's (next door at the Hyatt). Sammy's has great pizza (Horton Plaza area). But honestly, the best deal we found is to go to the local grocery store, Ralph's. We ate lunch and dinner there a few time, and it was great! The food is fresh, you can eat outside, and there is no one to tip! We made sure to stop by prior to our excursions, to stock up on snacks and drinks. In summary, I cannot reccomend the Marriott Marina. The next time my daughter and I visit San Diego, we'll stay elsewhere. Perhaps the Omni or Emabassy Suites. Or maybe the 202 Island Inn, right next to Cafe 222. We may even stay at The Keating, which seemed a bit noisy when we visited, but it's absolutely beautiful. One more thing to consider: I paid for our trip using a debit card. The Marriot did not charge us for daily incidentals, which is why I cancelled my reservations with The Keating. If you're using a debit card, be aware that some properties can charge as much as $300 a day for things that you have not used. On a credit card you won't notice this, but when using a debit card, you'll certainly notice it! The Omni and Embassy Suites also have a policy for dealing with debit cards, just in case you're like me, and don't use credit cards.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, priceless view but noisy...\u201d", "Author": "CaTraveltheworld", "ReviewID": "UR18906901", "Content": "I stayed three nights at the Mariott.

The hotel has nearly 1400 rooms, yet probably only about 250 self-parking spots. So, if the hotel is even remotely busy...guess what... you are stuck paying the $32/nt to Valet (plus tip of course) instead of the $21/nt to self park. We rode around for awhile and found ONE available spot and grabbed it. However the rest of the trip we weren't so lucky and ended up paying the steep valet rate. This hotel seems to be built out of cardboard as it was incredibly loud, even on the Bay side. We could hear every little thing our neighbors were doing, even above us. This included hearing the guy in the hotel room next to us doing his \"morning business.\" It was the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at, and that includes staying in the middle of NYC or Kuala Lumpur. You would think a bay side room in San Diego would be somewhat quiet...not the case at this place! Since there was a convention going on they also gouged people on price and our room (standard king size room with no balcony) was $515/nt. (We didn't have a choice in hotel and if so we definitely would not have stayed here at that price.) So by the time you tack on tax, valet, tips, internet, etc it can get all the more pricey. The other major problem at this hotel was our rude maid. Upon checkout on a Sunday morning at 10am, we found a note on our door that she had written herself that exlaimed, \"Please take down your do not disturb sign so I can cleanyour room!\" Ummm at $515 a night and at 10am on a Sunday morning!? Excuse me!? Bad bad bad customer service. It would have been one thing if it was say 2:00pm, but it was 10am on a Sunday the day we were checking out! Give me a break. And to top it all off we received a grand total of 40 AAdvantage miles from staying here because someone messed up and only included our internet charges when awarding us points. I can honestly say this is about the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and I always try to be optimistic about things too so I will end on a good note by saying a concierge guy by the name of Chris was wonderful. He was the one redeeming thing in that entire mess of a hotel.

If you like trains you will LOVE this property. I have never stayed in a louder hotel and I stay about 100 nights per year in them. I was in the North Tower with a balcony looking out over the city and part of the marina. Each night from about 11:00pm to 4:00am large freight trains would make their way through the city. They go about 3 MPH and, due to the large number of crossings, constantly blow their horn. And one night they decided to switch cars and it sounded like an earthquake each time the couplers hit. I used to live close to a railroad track but I have never experienced louder trains. It may be because the sound echos off of downtown buildings. With all of the screwy laws California has I am surprised they do not have some type of noise ordinance restricting the trains to certain hours. Unfortunately many hotels I assume have the same problem since Harbor Avenue is one of the primary streets. The pool area is nice and service was good.

The renovations make the area larger and, unfortunately, it can get crowded as people -- especially groups -- wait for taxis, buses, etc. At the time of my stay, they had not begun upgrades of the sleeping rooms, but were working on the outside restaurant near the marina. Despite signs indicating it was open, the restaurant was in fact still closed. DW's Pub in the South Tower serves the traditional Marriott bar food and you have the option of sitting in the bar or by the large windows overlooking the pool and gardens. Molly's in the North Tower features an upscale, expensive menu. The wait staff here were very prompt and the sommelier stopped at each table to chat with customers, which was a very nice touch. There's also the standard Marriott breakfast buffet also in the North Tower. The rooms are the standard, older-style Marriott rooms with the upgraded bedding. The desk is a decent size and the lamp has two outlets to plug laptops and phone chargers into. However, if you have more than two things to charge at the same time, you'll be hunting around for unused outlets. The bathroom was moderately sized and featured Bath & Body Works amenities. Housekeeping was efficient and respectful of my \"do not disturb\" request and the concierge was very helpful. I had a King, City View room that did not have a balcony. Although I was close to the elevator, I didn't hear the binging all that much, However, I could occasionally hear my neighbors, especially as they were entering and exiting the rooms, closing the doors with a loud slam. The meeting and banquet staff were some of the best I have worked with in a long time, easily exceeding my meeting expectations. The catered food was excellent and they had no quibbles about bringing in a specialty wine for my event. Keep in mind that this hotel is *huge* and next to the convention center. It's great for families that are traveling since the pool area is nice and there are plenty of places to walk. The hotel's location is nice as well, within walking distance of an open-air mall (about 15 minutes) and a few blocks away from the Gaslamp District. Why settle for hotel food when you have a wide variety just down the street? Downsides to the hotel: The noise. With freight trains and passenger trams on the \"city side\", be ready for clanging at 3 a.m. as the freight passes. Even when I had a Marina View room, I could hear the clanging. You will also probably be able to hear noisy neighbors. Internet access fee. $11/day. As a business traveler, this annoys me to no end, especially when I can go down the street to a Courtyard and wireless access is free. Fitness room not in the hotel. A minor quibble, of course, but you have to exit on the fourth floor and walk over to the convention center. Getting lost between North and South Towers -- As I mentioned, the hotel is huge. If you are staying here for a convention, be sure to request a room in the South Tower since it is closest to the convention center. The Business Center is located in the South Tower.

We ate at Taka Sushi, where the food was good, but the service was slightly obnoxious; white rice was an additional charge, and it was a few dollars; come on, a bowl of rice should come with the each meal, or be $1 maximum. The hotel's pool was large, but a bit cool. The food in the hotel is a bit pricey. Definitely try to get a room looking out over the Marina side. You can see US Navy ships going by, as well as military jets. Very clean hotel with good service. The food in the convention hall was a B+. When we stayed there, internet was an additional charge. We went to the San Diego Zoo, and the SD Zoo's Wild Animal Park about 45 minutes north, the Wild Animal Park was amazing, better than the Zoo downtown.

We live in Orange County, California and wanted a nice get away vacation that did not entail having to fly or drive to far. San Diego seemed like the perfect idea as there is so much for families to do. Upon arrival, I immediately ran into problems checking in. I had reserved a city view king room using my rewards points and the room type was guaranteed . The front desk person said that only doubles were available as the hotel was completely sold out. I told her a king room would only work as we had 2 little ones and they would be sleeping in cribs. After spending about 5 minutes working on the computer and making some calls she informed me they did have a nice king room available in the south tower overlooking the pool and bay. She also gave me 2 gift bags for the boys that contained little toys and trinkets. A very nice gesture on her part. In the end we ended up with a nicer room then what I had booked with awesome views. My oldest son was so excited when we saw the room for the first time he kept jumping up and down. He especially enjoyed seeing the boats and trains go by. The room was clean and well maintained. No issues with tired looking furniture or worn and stained carpet as previous guests had noted in their reviews. All in all a very nice room. We enjoyed using the pool and the close proximity to Seaport Village, USS Midway and other attractions. Many guests had noted that they could here people in the rooms next to them and this was not an issued for us until the last night of our visit. We had a hard time falling asleep that last night as kids in the room directly above us were laughing and running around until midnight. Things got quiet once their parents came back to the room. We were then awakened 5 hours later by the people next door getting ready to leave for the airport. Then the guy on the other side of our room woke up at 6:15am and started talking to his girlfriend and burping. So if there is anything negative to say about this hotel it can be noisy if you have loud inconsiderate neighbors. One other downer, do not trust the valet parking attendants. We had $5.00 of quarters stolen out of our cars center console. Overall, our experience was a good one and we will have no reservations staying at this hotel again.

The hotel is very large and hosts conference crowds with San Diego Convention Center next door. We booked a few months in advance. As travel date approached, I called hotel to confirm our reservation. I was concerned because I was not travelling with my wife and kids for arrival first evening. My wife and kids were scheduled to arrive late (9:30 PM) on a Saturday night from east coast for check-in (so it was after midnight for her and kids on EDT). I was already in San Diego at different hotel, and planned to meet my wife and kids next morning after they checked in. I also completed on-line form the hotel sends where you can select options for your room so it is prepared accordingly upon arrival. I entered comment again about concern with my wife arriving late with two small children, just to make sure everything was set, and that she could check in despite reservation under my first name. With slight delay in airline travel, my wife arrives at Marriott at 10 PM WDT (again, 1 PM EDT for her and kids coming from NJ). Suddenly, the hotel is over-booked - - they have no room available for three very weary travellers. So, my wife and kids get trucked by Marriott over to the Omni several blocks away. Omni turns around and puts my wife and kids in a smoking room (my daughter is asthmatic), so she has to come down to the lobby and request another room change. By the time the kids get in bed, it's nearly 11:30 PM WDT (2:30 PM EDT on their clock). Talk about being annoyed!! Marriott should be happy that I was not with my wife and kids that evening, or they would have had quite a lobby scene that evening. I was very angry after e-mailing and calling hotel, and being assured that everything was set just a couple days in advance of final trip and arrival. Marriott picked up the Omni bill, but that was insufficient concession under such circumstances. I met my family at Omni next morning. Marriott picked us up and drove us back over to Marriott to store our luggage (we had to wait a bit for the van, which again took away time from our vacation - - and no time for breakfast), and we walked back right past the Omni to Petco for Sunday afternoon Padres game. Since we could not check in before the game, we finally checked in after the game, and I vented to the clerk upon check-in. After I complained at check-in, Marriott tried to do the right thing, and they comped us our first night at the Marriott as well. After dumping our luggage in the room, I left my wife and kids in the room while I went to pick up a car rental near the airport. While picking up the car, the general manager at Marriott Marina had typed a letter of apology and delivered it to our room with a selection of snacks and a small Marriott beverage cooler as a gift. Without these concessions by the hotel, our rating would be different / lower. Other than getting bumped, the stay was mixed - - some good, and some not so good. The hotel was hosting a very large conference, so it's not the most vacationer-oriented location in San Diego. Conference attendees can jam up the lobby, pool-side, lounges, etc. But, not much different than large hotels with all vacationers in that respect, just an over-abundance of adults rather than families with kids. The hotel itself is very clean. The hotel restuarants are expensive (as to be expected, particularly when hosting corporate types on expense accounts), but apparently quite good. As far as amenities, the Marriott Marina has best pools in downtown / harbor area of San Diego. The kids absolutely loved the pools, which are open until midnight. The hotel hosts kid activities during day at the pool. Although oriented toward the conference crowd, this is still a fairly kid and family-oriented hotel for this part of town. The fitness center is on of the better ones you'll experience at a hotel - - quite large and well-stocked with equipment for all levels. Tennis courts also available. The hotel is very well-staffed. Personnel are very service and customer-oriented. the concierge was very helpful with directions to attractions. As for the room, it was a reasonable size and clean, with sufficient storage space. The sink area has good amount of counter space, which is important when travelling with a family. We had a room with a balcony over-looking the pool, bay/marina, and bridge to Coronado Island. So, the views from the room were a bonus. What we did not like most about the room, however, was the bedding. The mattresses seem to be old and not at all supportive (way too soft), so sleep for the adults was less than ideal. Also, the temperature control in our room did not work very well. During the evening, we had to leave the air conditioning run continuously in manual mode rather than use automatic mode set to a specific temperature. Room support provided extra towels and pillows without any problem. Our maid was very nice, and did a nice job. We had requested a microwave on form submitted prior to our arrival, but it was not in the room by first evening. We called hotel services a day later, and they delivered a microwave within a half hour. When you're paying this much for a hotel, you tend to expect a bit more in terms of comfort, particularly with respect to bedding and temperature control. Location is one of other good features of this hotel. You can easily walk to Seaport Village and other bay waterfront attractions, as well as GasLamp district (including Horton Plaza mall), and Petco stadium. Walking is safe, although homeless are fairly visible in GasLamp/downtown area. So, Marriott Marina is very convenient to a very large amount of shopping and dining locations without the need to get in the car. Trolley services is avaiable across the street for those who want to travel to select other locations such as Old Town or Fashion Mall, but a car is necessary to get to some of the other major attractions in San Diego - - such as SeaWorld, Coronado beaches / Hotel del Coronado, Balboa Park / Zoo. Still, we enjoyed the ability to experience local area by walking, which you can't do if staying out in Mission Bay or certain other \"resort\" areas across San Diego (where a car is required to go most anywhere). GasLamp is loaded with bicycle taxis as well, which are always parked at intersection outside the hotel. The young folks that pedal these bicycle taxis are mostly from other countries and always anxious to give rides anywhere in GasLamp / Downtown area. We took one just for the experience - - $10 to go about 10 - 12 blocks. By car, many attractions, beaches, etc. are within 15 - 30 minutes. The hotel is convenient to the airport, I-5, and many locations via car. We visited Zoo, Old Town, Coronado, and SeaWorld by car without any problems. Would we go back to Marriott Marina if visiting San Diego again in future? After this experience, we would consider it, but may be inclined to try a different hotel after weighing the pros and cons of our specific experience. If you want to stay in this area of San Diego, a few other fairly equivalent options exist. overall, San Diego is a great location for a family vacation. So many things to see and do, so plan a week if posslble, and plan activities in advance!", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cShould Have Listened to the Other Reviewers\u201d", "Author": "gopheliad", "ReviewID": "UR8460976", "Content": "When it comes to business travel, I am loyal (for the most part) to Marriott.

First of all, I\u2019d be upset to pay $300 per night for the cheapest room here because rooms are pretty outdated and bathrooms don\u2019t have a ventilation fan (hello, 2007!). On a bright side, the hotel looks stunning outside and the view from top floors facing marina is amazing. The pool area is lovely but it gets overcrowded during day time because it\u2019s not big enough for the size of the hotel. If you want to relax, come there after 6PM. Mattress was too soft for me, but I guess many people like it to be soft. Small refrigerator wasn\u2019t working and when I called front desk to inquire about it, they said that it wasn\u2019t a refrigerator but a cooler and I could bring ice in it. I just don\u2019t like when instead of accepting a problem, people try to make you look stupid. I know how refrigerator looks like and I can clearly read a label inside of it which says \u201crefrigerator\u201d. Well, you cannot blame Marriott for one rude front desk person, can you? ;) When we checked in at 12PM, we didn\u2019t have any problems; the guy at the front desk was courteous, polite and fulfilled my request of getting a top floor room and 2 beds instead of one. I don\u2019t have any status with Marriott and I was quite impressed that they gave us a requested room that early. Location is the best part about this hotel \u2013 it\u2019s close to almost every major attraction in San Diego and proximity to Seaport village is a big plus. Many reviewers mentioned train noise, which can be very annoying but I think that all neighbor hotels have the same problem. If it potentially maybe a problem for you, better look at different areas of San Diego or bring earplugs. Overall, for $300 per night out of your own pocket it\u2019s a rip off, but if it\u2019s a corporate event =you\u2019re paying $0) or you can get the room via discount hotel sites for +- $160 per night, go for it!", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cover-priced for what you got\u201d", "Author": "DavidLau", "ReviewID": "UR7830795", "Content": "I stayed at the Marriot Marina in June 2007 for a convention and then stayed a couple of days for leisure. Since it was a large convention, the room cost me $299/night. For that lofty price, you got a decent room but nothing special. My room had a view of the convention center instead of the bay (more $$$). The bathroom was decently sized but the toilet was not in its own partition. Also, the bathroom didn't have any ventilation fan, so it was steamy after a shower. The shower head was a Grohe (expensive German brand), but the volume of water was not very high. I believe a major advertising point for Marriott are their \"perfect\" beds. For me, the mattress was much too soft. They certainly give you a lot of pillows though - two small ones and two larger ones per bed. Some bright points: I had ordered food from room service a few times during my stay. One time, I had ordered a plate of steamed veggies (not enough healthy food while on the road) and what I received was a very nice combination of small squash, cherry tomatoes, broccolini and asparagus - I was impressed. For their beds, they use down comforters instead of plain blankets. There's a gym and small pool system on the bay side of the hotel but I didn't have time to use either. The main reason that I chose this hotel was its location - right next door to the convention center. Given the amount of walking I was doing those days, I was grateful that my room was close by.

Sea World is a 15 minute easy drive. The view of the city was very nice from our balcony. The buffet breakfast was very tasty and fulfilling. The kids enjoyed the pool, mostly because they brought their own pool toys. On the negative side: Four of us were staying, yet we only had two sets of towels despite asking several times for 4, even on the second day when the staff was coming in to clean. The ice machine never worked on our floor. Didn't realize both beds would be doubles which don't work for 4 people very comfortably. We ordered a roll away bed which did come in a timely manner. My 13 yr old reports it was pretty comfortable. It took up what little space was left in the room because it's pretty big for a roll away and the rooms are small. We thought we should just order 4 roll aways so we could all be comfortable. Hope you like train whisles and the dinging of cross arms because you'll hear it every 5 minutes on the city side. The food at the Pub was nasty with very slow service & little attention to anything. My salmon sandwich was a raw salmon which was never mentioned on the menu or by the staff and it's very expensive. I got some weird, tasteless chips with the sandwich which were gross. The waiter didn't know what they were called and said that no one seems to like them. That was just the beginning of the battle with food. There is nothing for kids to eat in the whole hotel(for lunch or dinner), unless they can exist on chips and popcorn from the gift shop. Starbucks closes at 7pm so the hope of eating their sandwiches was shot when we arrived at 8 after a long day out. We ordered from the room service menu out of desperation. The sandwiches looked exactly like the Starbucks sandwiches, only double in price, not to mention the tax and gratuity they add to your bill. The last morning we spent looking out upon the city from our balcony and noticed a Ralphs grocery store a couple blocks away. Wish we had known about it so we could stock up on much cheaper food for our refrigerator. Live and learn.

We had a beautiful room on the 18th floor of the North Tower and enjoyed the spectacular view of San Diego bay and the Coronado Bay Bridge from our balcony. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated, the pool was great and the hot tub was our favorite destination after a long day of walking around at the many area attractions.

The trolly to Old Town stop right in front also. Another thing that was really convenient is the computer in the lobby which allows you to print out your boarding passes before you leave for the airport. Saves you having to do it at the airport, so that was a plus! The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is the $25 per day parking fee for valet (self parking is $19). I think that's really high, but all hotels in the area seem to charge around the same amount. And, it was always nice to pull up to the front of the hotel and have one of the valet parkers say \"welcome back... how was your day?\" or always ask if you need directions somewhere before you left.

The pier is just an elevator ride down to the lower level and stroll through the pool area to the pier. There are numerous restaurants in the hotel. We didnt go to any of them though.

It is also within walking distance to the Seaport Village, which is a bit touristy but has several restaurants and shops on the water. It is a nice place for a stroll or a jog. Check out Cafe 222 for breakfast. It is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. LC's in the hotel is great for breakfast. They have an extensive buffet for $18 and a continental buffet for less. I was very happy to see many healthy selections on the menu including a whole wheat French toast with light syrup topped with strawberries and bananas. I have never seen this on any menu, and it was very good. There is a gym at the hotel. It is actually part of the Convention Center building and attached to the Marriott. You have to walk briefly outside to get there. The gym is very spacious with many treadmills, stairmasters and stationary bikes with high quality TVs attached to each machine. There are free weights and weight machines. The gym is accessible through the South Tower. This would be a bit of a walk for people staying in the North Tower. The concierge was helpful in finding restaurants and entertainment. They provide a great map of the surrounding area and restaurants. There is a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel.

We did expect some waiting for an elevator, but this problem was exacerbated by the fact that only 2 of 6 elevators were working on the South Side. What would have been a 3-4 minute wait for an elevator, turned into 10-20 minutes anytime I wanted to leave the room. The stairs were not an option as I was staying on the 25th floor and have a disablity. 2. I had my phone REMOVED from my room. Perhaps worse than that, the staff proved to be incompetent in handling the claim. I left my cell phone in the room as I was travelling with a group and I hadn't charged it the previous night. When I returned to the room the cell phone was no longer there. This happened on the 2nd day of my trip and I was at the hotel for 8 days. I called lost & found and the \"took a report\" and said they'd call me the next day.

After the third time I was quite confident nothing would get accomplished through the \"Lost & Found\" department so I spoke with the manager on duty. I explained the situation to the hotel manager, VINCENT who told me to call lost & found. I explained to him the situation and told him that there is no congruity in lost & found and they don't really know what's going on because I've filed the same report 3 days in a row. He snapped back that they do know what's going on and he would get back with me shortly. Of course I never heard back from VINCENT, but I did get a call from \"Lost & Found\" to \"take another report\". So... after 4 reports and speaking with the hotel manager I never recovered my phone, nor did I get any phone call which I was promised.

We had booked our accomodation 9 months prior to our stay for convenience while attending a convention. We requested a non-smoking king room with a bay view and balcony and were fully prepared to pay for these requests. Two weeks prior to our arrival we emailed requesting confirmation of the details and these were confirmed. We also had a computer print out of the intitial confirmation - done through our conference conveners and had this with us at check in. We arrived around 5pm after 16 hours of international travel. At check in little was said directly to us upon our presentation of our booking reference etc. The desk clerk immediately picked up the phone and began a conversation with someone - almost in code. We sensed all was not well. We were then advised that the hotel was unable to accomodate us in a king non smoking room bay side with balcony as we had not specified non-smoking and all rooms of that specification had been allocated. They could however provide us with a king smoking room bayside or a non-smoking room city side (at a reduction of $20 per night). This was despite the fact that the computer printout clearly showed confirmation of a non-smoking room. We would not accept this and drew attention to the fact we had booked months before, had our request confirmed and it was clearly stated. Suddenly a room with bayside views and king sized was available (without balcony) and as we were so tired we accepted. We made our way to our room (unassisted) and as soon as we opened the bathroom door the smell of cigarette smoke was evident. We went about our activities for 2 days before requesting a room move. The smell of smoke never disipated and at times was worse - causing sinusitis and congestion. It was again explained that a non-smoking room may not be available and whilst listening to the \"coded\" telephone conversation it became clearly apparent that baseball players get total preference. We were eventually given a room 5 floors below our initial one and this was free from the smell of cigarette smoke. The desk attendent also explained that floor 22 (our initial one) is below a smoking level - this would explain why the bathroom was smelly - smoke came in through the vent. This is a noisy hotel - trains go by frequently throughout the night and the noise appears to be funnelled between the two accomodation towers. Be prepared to loose sleep. You can hear your neighbours as well. In addition to this issue - dirty dishes remain in the hallway all day. The conceirge was not knowledgable. We did find the bed comfortable and it was nice to be able to lie by the pool - although no one approached to determine if you want a drink or snack. This place is overrated and we were glad we had made the decision to stay at another hotel for our additional 4 nights after the conference finished, particularly as we were going to have to pay an additional $120 USD per night to stay in the same room at this hotel.

Long story short, is that we went on to find about six channels (free of charge or personal request) with what would be considered soft porn (even a hotel staff confirmed this). After I called the front desk they informed me that they could block the free, in-house channels for us (afterward we did find a note on top of the TV that said this), but that there wasn't anything that they could do about the other 2-3 cable channels that they subscribed to that had pornographic material.

We chose the Marriott Marina for its location, near the Gaslamp Quarter with shops and restaurants and with a view on the bay at the same time. Both came as expected and made our stay quite pleasant. The hotel is very large with two towers of over 20 floors. Traffic in the lobby over weekend was quite crazy, but on Monday the hotel returned to a more relaxed and acceptable atmosphere. Check-in was efficient, though a bit cold. However they accepted to swap our 6th-floor room with an identycal one on the 19th, as we did not want to get noise from the pool below. Valet parking can be messy with long queuing, on the contrary they booked us restaurants in a very efficient mode. The room we were given was small but acceptable with two queen-size beds. Bathroom size and equipment were below the standard of the hotel class; towels were small and not very soft. No mini-bar in the room but the small fridge was working properly. Room size was a little disappointing, we found hard to place luggage around. One of the two towers has rooms with a tiny balcony. Not a great extra but day and nightview on the bay's harbour is pleasant. There are two swimming pools, mostly crowded during the day -given size of the hotel- and not particularly clean. The pool bar is however a special place at sunset and night, thanks to some nice seating areas and a few tables with fire in the center. 2 and 3-seat bicycles can be rented near the pool area to have some fun with kids in Seaport's streets. The Marriott Marina is at walking distance from the joyful Seaport Village and from 5th street were lots of restaurants and shops can make your stay in San Diego a wonderful, though expensive, experience. We dined at the Yacht Club, with music and fireworks in the bay. Careful and brilliant service and excellent meat and fish. Breakfast is unfortunately a disaster at LC's: 20 to 30 minutes wait-time for a small place with average choice of food are simply not acceptable for such a place.

I went with my wife and our 5 year old daughter. I had spent 3 nights there in the South Tower 2 years ago and it was magnificent, this year, everything was horrible. The price of the room was $285 a night that included parking and breakfast in the morning. The room they gave me was a high room in the North Towere but it smelled like mildew. I went to the front desk to see if they could get me a room in the South Tower, they did not have any with a balcony which I had paid for, so they offered me a different room in the same tower. I agreed but when we got to the new room we noticed the smell was less prevelant but the smell was still there. The room in itself was very average for a Marriott. We decided that we would just let it go. I had also asked at the time of check in for \"the card\" that we were supposed to give us that indicated that we were entitled to the breakfast and discout tickets to Sea World, the Zoo etc. I was told that I did not need the card and to give them my name and room number. I had gone to someone else at the hotel front desk and asked them for the card as well and they gave me the same answer. The next morning we went to purchase our discount tickets to the zoo and the lady asked me where my discount card was. I told her that I had asked for this card twice and they did not have them. She told I needed that, and I could tell from her attitude that she thought I was making this up to get discount tickets. She checked with the front desk and found out that I did have that package and got me the card which stated that I could get tickets to the zoo. Fast forward, we get to the zoo the zoo won't sell us discount tickets telling us that we should have got them from the hotel. I call the hotel they tell me to come back to the concierge desk and they will credit my hotel bill I did return and they did refund the discount but not before I have spent more of my time staigthening out their mess that they so discreetly delivered to me, but I did get plenty of attitude from the lady at the concierge desk with no apologies for the problems. Fast forward again, to check out time and the luck of the draw I get the same nasty woman who had got me the change in rooms. Guess what? Same attitude. A thank you for staying? NO, nothing. The one thing is that I was confronted by the bellman demanding to me what did I need when I parked out front during check out. Now the topping on the cake, they charge me $5 for an Evian water that I did not open and did not drink, but they charged me for it after I had already checked out. I called to ask them to correct this and they gave me some other number to call to get it corrected as they said it was over 24 hours from when I checked out. AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! It's a shame because there were a lot of great, warm wonderful people that worked there, but not enough for me.

The experience wasn't *terrible, by any means, but there was a constant trickle of annoyances, from a broken shower handle that cut my hand (and was apparently the source of the bloody shower curtain that was there when we arrived....) to the thow-up-the-covers-and-call-it-made approach to bedmaking our housekeeper employed. The refrigerator didn't work and smelled of mildew. The bathtub didn't get cleaned well once while we were there. We didn't get the foam pillows we requested in advance, and our inability to get TWO extra BATH towels, every day for the duration of our stay, requested in writing via the Marriott website (and confirmed) in advance, reached the point of absurdity. By the end of the week I did a commando raid on a housekeeping cart to get the towels. We got six bottles of conditioner, and only two of shampoo, over the course of the week. The pool area, which looks lovely, still, was festooned with little dabs of duck poop from the three families of ducks that live there. Worse, it stayed in the same spots from day to day (ew). The piped-in muzak at the pool was incredibly loud, and the bass was turned WAY up so you got hours of constant reggae beat, full-blast. We'd go ask at the pool shack for them to turn it down, they would, and then twenty minutes later some other shack employee would blast it again.

The hotel has several noteworthy qualities; some are highlighted as follows: 1. Striking architecture and lush landscaping. An almond-shaped tower and its neighboring concave-curved tower, both with dark, reflective glass, are unique to San Diego's skyline. 2. Comfortable and clean guest rooms. We appreciated the bed with six pillows; sofa, chair, and coffee table; and a small refrigerator. The spotless bathroom had thick towels and ample sundries. 3. Variety of food service. We enjoyed the full buffet breakfast at LC's in the North Tower and salads and sandwiches for lunch at the Yacht Club Restaurant. Tasty and generous room-service meals for dinner were delivered in 30 minutes. 4. Hotel maintenance. We made one phone call to the hotel operator to report our broken desk lamp. It was repaired in an hour. 5. Reservations and registration. We called the hotel directly to reserve our senior-rate room. Upon arrival we received everything for which we had asked, and the staff made us feel like welcome guests. Other comments: 1. We arrived when there was a great deal of activity at the city's convention center next door. We were caught in the wrong traffic lane for hotel registration and spent 20 minutes to correct our error. 2. Valet parking cost $25 per day for hotel guests. With all of the activity, we were grateful to use the services of a polite and helpful vehicle attendant. 3. There was loud music from a nearby outdoor amphitheatre on both Sunday and Monday evenings. This could be a positive for some. However, we prefer selecting our own music and listening when we choose to do so. When we closed the balcony door and drapery, the sound was mitigated but could still be heard in the room.

We had a great opportunity to visit several Marriott hotels in the area ( for other reviews from this trip check out Marriott Coronado Island Resort, Courtyard San Diego Downtown, and Gas Lamp Marriott) The Marina Marriott was probably my favorite hotel we stayed at. We always like to have a nice large pool area, this one rivaled any resort. There are 2 pools, lots of chairs and towels, extra room on a near by grassy area for lounging when the pool area gets to crowded. They have a great Tiki bar by the pool and food service delivered right to your lounge chair. Pleanty of servers in the area to get you anything you need. The grounds are very nice, we really enjoyed the fire pits and sitting areas, there is a restaurant overlooking the marina, I think another 2 inside on the lower level, one is more casual, the other is more upscale. There are also 2 bars up on the lobby level a pub type and another more of a chill lounge. The hotel has two towers, the North seems to be a little newer and had a more contemporary feel, the South was also nice but has a more standard hotel feel, perhaps to be restyled, but both are clean and nice. The north side did have balconies on the majority of the rooms however, so maybe just more expensive in general.

The room was new bright and clean, no dust or vaccum omissions as reported in an earlier review. We opened the drapes to reveal a fabulous view of the bay, Coranado Island, and a small bit of the city behind us. We stayed for four nights and most everything was beyond expectations. The poolside area was very nice, plenty of lounge chairs, great towels for sunbathing or swimming, poolside service was exstensive, we had a craving for something more than the poolside menu offered and the server brought over a full menu from the Yacht Club resturant. The bar area was lively, always lots of people enjoying cocktails or conversation. Two large plasma TV's offered whatever game was on at the time. The lobby area was well laid out, with one person waiting to direct the guests with questions. Starbucks on premises, a little higher priced than usual but convienient. Fitness area was quite a walk away from the north tower however, plenty of aerobic equip and weights for use. (think of the walk as a warmup) Overall, a few blemishes, the first morning we had no water, the staff informed us that the servicemen were working on it. I went to the fitness area, came back and the water was back on. Not a big problem, and they did compensate us for our inconvience. We had a bill error and reported it to the staff and it was instantly taken care of. Also the Hertz desk staff was freindly and helpful. I never had any problem with the train as reported in previous posts. There were trains going all the time but it never seemd to interfere with my sleeping and I am a fairly light sleeper.

Like other readers wrote on here, the South Tower had no balconies (some for some rooms), but most didn't and even though they probably had a great view too, they didn't seem as nice. The pool was a nice size but we didn't spend much time there because it was only in the high 50's this week, yikes! We walked (not far) every evening to Seaport Village which had little shops and great restaurants. Upstart Crow was my favorite coffee stop because they had great coffee, pastries and books to sit and read (or buy). There was a homemade cookie stand that was great too. The Fish Market was at the farthest end of the village (a nice hike), next to the SS Midway ship. We sat outside (on the lower level) right on the peer and had the best PRAWNS in cocktail sauce. Saw the sunset...etc. really good food. Negatives? Well, someone wrote before about dust behind their dresser and even put a picture on here. I too felt they needed to really concentrate on those little details. They needed a good vaccuum to go along the baseboards, etc. I complained to the concierge and he made sure they vacuumed really well the next morning.

The hot tub was very nice and felt wonderful. The location absolutely can't be beat. You are literally steps from Seaport Village (lots of great shops and restaurants). You are also right on the edge of the Gaslamp District. It's walkable.

Although a parent's dream perhaps, I think that's called child neglect. The concierges were quite variable; some fabulously helpful, while others were downright dismissive. One day the valet presented a family member with the WRONG CAR! They couldn't find the correct car, so we had none of the car seats for that group. This nearly ruined our outing that day. Some of us were charged for both self-parking and valet parking. One family member received her bill a day early and called to say that wasn't her checkout day. They agreed she was indeed booked for one more night, but insisted she would have to move rooms anyway. This was the last straw.

I had the Wild @ Work Package which included breakfast, bayview room, free parking, and a discount on restaurants (which we didn't use) We arrived late from the East Coast on the 1st and were given a balcony room on a high floor in the North Tower, as I requested. We were very hungry, but no restaurants were open (it was about 10 pm), so we had to order room service. It was pricey, but not ridiculous for room service. The room was clean and nicely decorated. However, as we went to bed I noted that it had a pass through door to the next room, and the person next door was clearly watching TV. It was very loud. The elevator was also close by and you could hear a 'whooshing' sound. The next morning, I went to the front and desk and asked for a quieter room. They mentioned that about half the rooms had pass throughs, but found me one on the 16th floor that did not and was slightly further away from the elevator. We set up there and that room was much quieter. I also liked that the beds faced the open balcony, so you could actually see the Harbor while lying down. The rooms have refridgerators which is a nice touch, also--there is a grocery store (Ralph's) two blocks from the Convention Center to buy soda/water at. I also announced a few minor cleanliness issues--some dust accumulate, etc. Nothing major. The decor in the rooms is modern and fresh and looks fairly new, as does the North Tower lobby (where there is a fairly bad lounge singer on weekend nights). Two problems areas: Elevators and parking. I'm not sure if all the elevators were working, but in peak times the waits could be bothersome...10 minutes or so and very crowded. Self parking was also a problem. I'm not a fan of valet parking and my wife and I like to go out and back a lot (plus self park was included), but space was pretty tight and at times we had to fight with other cars for spaces (like at the mall during Thanksgiving shopping week). Perhaps when the hotel is less busy, it isn't a problem. Also, you have to give your room number and name to the attendant and wait while they look it up (problematic if you change rooms like we did the first night)--I wish they would install a device where you can just insert your room key and go. That would be much simpler and faster. Breakfast each morning was very high quality. The package included the full buffet which featured the standard Marriott omelette and waffle bars, among other goodies. However, since it was Labor Day weekend it was very crowded. Servers were friendly and trying hard, but I don't there were enough to handle the crowd. Wait time was around 15 mins for 2 people, plus a decent sized wait up at the buffet. Still, I'm a picky eater but the food was excellent and I would recommend this, especially if you have a package. We didn't eat at the other restaurants because of all the options around San Diego. The location of the hotel is fanstastic...adjacent to a board walk that includes the Hyatt and Seaport village. Its an easy walk down to the USS Midway, which by the way was an outstanding attraction. Its also just a short stroll over to the Gaslamp Quarter, but the setting is nicer than the hotels there because its a little more sedate and relaxed setting. The grounds of the hotel are quite nice and tropical. There is a large pool, but as another reviewer noted it was quite busy with kids during the day. At night it was very nice (though San Deigo weather makes it a little chilly). The jacuzzi was crowded at night (they could use a larger one) and a bit too hot for my tastes, but my wife liked it. Overall, this is a very nice hotel. We did look around the city at other hotels and ended up being very happy we went with the Marriott Marina. We were also considering the Gaslamp Marriott which is only a few blocks away, but that new property is very 'chic' and didn't strike us as anything special.

The rooms are a bit larger than the usual downtown hotel and on the harbor side of the hotel they each have a balcony with a nice view of Coronado across the bay and the yacht harbor below. The desk was convenient for working with cable access available. My room had a safe large enough for my laptop computer. The North Tower contains the breakfast restaurant (Las Cascadas) which has an excellent breakfast buffet, and the lunch/dinner restaurant (the Yacht Harbor) with outdoor and indoor eating. By my third breakfast, the restaurant staff knew me and vice versa. I felt the hotel staff was friendly and proud of this beautiful hotel. One waiter was very rude on one occasion, and I reported this incident to the restaurant manager, who sincerely apologized and went out of her way to be extra nice to me throughout the rest of the stay. Apology accepted! I ordered room service one night and it arrived in just 20 minutes. The hotel is just a five minute walk to the Convention Center. Here is a tip to save a minute or two getting there. When wallking to the Convention Center, instead of walking out the front door of the hotel and turning right, instead, go almost to the end of the lobby on the South Tower side (near Starbuck's), and then take the escalator down to the parking lot and from there the Convention Center is a few feet away. This might not sound like a shortcut, but it is. The Gaslight District is walking distance away from the hotel - about eight blocks. This hotel is the closest hotel to the SD Convention Center and there are many places in the hotel lobby to meet informally with other conventioneers. The price was a bit steep at $255 per night plus taxes, but this is a clean, professional, spacious, and architecturally attractive hotel.", "Date": "June 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't feel like a large resort hotel\u201d", "Author": "RADNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR3589303", "Content": "Stayed in early April, 2005 for a scientific convention.

This hotel is ideally situated between Seaport Village and the Gaslamp Quarter. You are in easy walking distance to Petco Park to see the Padres play baseball. I would also suggest taking the Marriott ferry across the bay over to the Coronado Marriott. We had a great time walking around Coronado too.

This is a high volume hotel that does a lot of conferences, so the lobby and adjoining hallways are often quite busy. It lacks much personal touch or attention to detail.

The fitness center is nice but it is on top of the conference center on the next block, so it requires two elevator rides, stairs and walkways to get there - a challenge for anyone in a wheelchair.

The noise from the nearby train is not horrendous, at least if you are on the bayside and used to urban sounds. The pool area is quite beautiful, but there is no view of the bay. And seagulls and ducks are the most frequent swimmers in the pool. It is not quite disgusting, but knowing the germs such birds carry, I would personally not allow my children to swim in such a pool.
