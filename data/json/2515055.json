That said the rooms are adequate and clean. The bed was large and comfortable. The room has a large flat screen TV mounted on the wall. With some difficulty and small hands you can plug in a HDMI device to play personal video through the TV. The bathroom is narrow and this is not helped if you are on the top floor with the sloped gable roof taking up some of the head room in the shower and at the bathroom sink. Be careful you don't crack your head (like I did) when taking a swallow of mouthwash. We got a very good rate for this hotel from their direct website (under 95 Euro's a night) which beat all of the usual hotel booking sites on this occasion. At that sort of rate I would say this hotel is very good value. We considered extending our stay for another couple of days but the rates for those nights had jumped to over 180 Euro's a night! The breakfast was good and complimentary at the time this is being written. Also complimentary was a coffee machine, snacks, softdrinks and water in a small lounge area in foyer of hotel. The hotel website however states both these things are free until 31st December 2011 and I guess this might change after that. The internet is free but is hopelessly slow. You get a login each day from the front desk that allows you 24 hour access with a maximum of 200MB download and 40MB upload (forget backing up your photo's or video's to your cloudspace).

We ended up at this hotel location by accident, after having a difficult time with their sister hotel site- Joyce hotel which would not honor a reservation we had booked months in advance. However, we enjoyed the 3 days we stayed at this hotel location, and staff was unbelievably accommodating, and gave us a lovey room on the 5th floor overlooking the street and view of the Eiffel tower. The room was on the small side, as was the bath, but well designed. There is no wardrobe to hang clothes inside or stash your luggage if you stay for any length of time, just a couple of extra large pegs with hangers. Fantastic air conditioning, and lovely view from the room of the Eiffel tower My only complaint of this hotel was the safe. It is in a small cabinet right when you walk in the door. If you did not keep it closed with a code, it hits you directly in the ankle or shin bone when you walk along the small space to get to the bathroom! My husband enjoyed the breakfast bar in the morning, and as others have noted it was lovely to have a cool drink waiting in the lobby when we returned from a hot day walking for miles in Paris. Nice little hotel for the money, very nice staff & helpful staff! Read the fine print for cancellations as I am sure they are the same as Hotel Joyce which up'd our rate dramatically when we tried to cancel 2 out of 5 days when our flight reservation was changed by the cruise lines.

True, it was clean, but that\u2019s my only positive impression. First of all, the location is not that convenient. If you want to be close to the Gare du Nord, especially if walking with heavy luggage, rethink the choice of this hotel. The Metro stops are not that close either for those carrying luggage. Since I did not want to walk up a hill with my luggage back to the train station (yes the hotel is on a hilly street), I asked for a taxi at the hotel front desk. The response I got was that calling a taxi was not possible. I asked the front desk person if there was a problem with the phone or if the taxis were on strike and he simply said no and walked way. Needless to say I was shocked by his rudeness, since the few reviews I read here about this hotel (notice that up to now there are not that many) had a different experience with their service. In addition to the not-so-convenient location and bad customer service, here is another problem: the hotel advertises that there are refreshments (free of charge) for all guests in the lobby. Well, I stayed in this hotel four nights and the small-sized fridge where the mysterious beverages where allegedly placed was always empty. And I tried during different times of the day and evening! The fact that the hotel rooms don\u2019t have a small fridge inside did not help either. Also lacking is a place to put your clothes (there 3 or 4 hangers on the wall and the room was very small). The free wifi was slow (if it worked) and to use it each day you need to ask the front desk for a code that lasts only 24 hours. Breakfast was lame, although it was included in the hotel price. No many choices: bread, jelly, butter, small cheeses wrapped in a plastic package, the type you buy at any supermarket, a few cold cuts, coffee, tea, water and orange juice.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nairobi", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Cosy Small Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nairobi75", "ReviewID": "UR115081803", "Content": "Stayed here in April, 2011.
