The location is quiet and beautiful - situated on a small peninsular overlooking the sea. The gardens surrounding the cottages are spectacular, full of birds, butterflies, colourful and well attended. The VIP cottages are clean, very spacious and comfortable with full aircon, fan, sunken bath and 2 showers - one of which is outside in a small, private garden/courtyard. There is also a beautiful swimming pool in the grounds, serene and well maintained, which provided a wonderful contrast to the rough sea, with its spectacular waves and surfing/body boarding potential. We were met at the airport by Indra, who had excellent English and was very welcoming, including a much needed bottle of cold water! The drive was about 2 hours as the roads are small, busy with lorries and mopeds, but plenty of interest. At the hotel reception, Rondy met us with a welcome cocktail and a big smile, which was a feature of all the staff at Puri Dajuma. The whole team was polite, attentive and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the hotel restaurant every evening, the menu was varied and the food lovely. No Bali belly for us during the whole holiday!We hired a car with driver before we went to Bali through Aroma Bali. The rate was very competitive and the driver first class. This was a good move as the trips organised by the hotel were expensive by comparison. This is the only negative comment we would make about the whole fortnight as overall we had a fantastic time both at Puri Dajuma and in Bali and would go back tomorrow without hesitation.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR723101489", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Glyn-Julia"}, {"Content": "Great cottages We stayed for 2 nights recently and were impressed with the cottages. Cottages are large and very clean with comfortable beds. The gardens are just lovely, swimming pool excellent and the restaurant serves great meals.

Beautiful setting and quality cottages, combined with excellent service made this a memorable 5 night stay. Despite the seclusion our teenage boys rated this highly, having the pool to ourselves for much of the time. Body surfing on the local beach and diving in the north of the island were real highlights. Dajuma is thoroughly recommended to anyone wanting to get away from the main resorts and find peace and tranquility.Guy, Ilkley, England", "Date": "Apr 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR586923785", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gzcunnin"}, {"Content": "Affordable luxury This resort is a very little known gem in west Bali. I got to know about it because of its advert on a surfing guide. Checking out their website it looked all right, so I booked it up for a week. To reserve a cottage they were happy with my word on an e-mail, no deposit required. It all seemed a bit casual, and I must admit I was expecting a rather scruffy place.To my absolute surprise, the resort turned out to be at least 4 stars. Individual luxury cottages with a large bedroom, bathroom with inside and outside shower, patio overlooking the shore. The staff were extremely friendly, respectful and welcoming. My wife and I were very impressed with their professionality and good spirit.The resort was mostly empty, and for some days we were the only occupants. More people turned up in the evening to dine at the restaurant, but during the day we had the pool all to us. One of the staff told me that they finished the building work just three months after the Bali bombings, and their business has never really had the chance to pick up.For us, the resort worked out perfectly well: I spent the early mornings surfing at the nearby Medewi break, while the wife had a massage and relaxed by the pool. The beauty of the garden, the cottage in Balinese style and the candle lit dining made us feel like we were having a second honeymoon. The value for money was high: the cottage costs USD95 per night including breakfast. One week cost us (including all food, drinks, transport to and from airport and massage bills) about USD900. All in all a place I can thoroughly recommend as a valuable alternative to the busier places in the Bukit peninsula.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR186227889", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jacopo"}, {"Content": "ein kleines Paradies   showReview(19568587, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR705646740", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Enibas2008"}, {"Content": "Superbe h\u4e48tel au calme!       vue d'ensembbe", "Date": "Aug 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR977188062", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vimatilff"}, {"Content": "Une autre fa\u83bdon de d\u8305couvrir Bali   showReview(5619458, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR558885994", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Dan_of_Paris"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1234719-d584503-r17127428-Puri_Dajuma_Cottages-Pekutatan_Bali.html", "HotelID": "584503", "Price": "$146"}}
