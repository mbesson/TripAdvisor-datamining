I have traveled the world & been in countries & hotel rooms that were definitely different. My big three for hotel rooms are safety, cleanliness, & staff. I grew up coming down to the beaches here with my parents, always having a weeklong rental. Looking for a place to stay that I felt safe, had a decent room, & affordable price I found the surf villa! I mean don't expect a brand new hotel room where you'll be paying several hundred a night, but if you want a nice decent place with pleasant staff. I highly recommend staying here.

This is an OLD hotel, it has it\u2019s own HISTORY in it! There are just few buildings like that left in OC! And as for me every time we stay there the place is cleaned well, cozy atmosphere, with basic needs. The manager and staff are always friendly and caring. And moreover we love the location, love reading on the front porch, with the price they offer you cannot beat it. It worth the money you spend. And I suggest this place to all my friends and those who are interested in diving in history of Ocean City and emerging in the amiable atmosphere.

The pictures on the website does not give the room justice. The 2 bedroom apartment is a hole in the wall, with the feel of a stingy basement. Windows are boarded up, very claustrophobic. The beds were made up but the mattresses are covered with some plastic cover which swishs every time you move. The sheets were stained. There is no cover sheet provided for the sofa sleepers. Bath towels are not provided, neither was bath soap. The bathroom is so small that you need to walk sideways. During our 3 night stay, housekeeping only came once and only cleaned the bathroom - nothing else. There were 6 of us but only received one key- one per room, the reception guy said.

We found this family owned and operated hotel a few years back and have become faithful customers! The owner is friendly and always accommodating, the location is superb and you can't beat the price. It is close to the boardwalk and bus stops. It is a beach house that was converted into 2 downstairs apartments and regular hotel rooms upstairs with a big covered front porch. I have always found the rooms to be clean, when walking into the lobby it is always neat and smells like it was freshly cleaned...the sheets always smell freshly bleached. I have stayed in the upstairs rooms and the front apartment downstairs. The front apartment was remodeled this year and was very nice, and again...check the prices, you won't find anything in this great location for what they are charging. As far as other reviews saying it is a party spot...I personally stay at Surf Villa every year that same weekend, the Spring Car Cruisers weekend in May. Most of Ocean City is a party that weekend. The town is full of classic cars, and with that comes the burnouts all night long and in turn the visitors line the streets to watch this activity. The owner can't control who is on the public sidewalk near his property, that is the job of the O.C. police, and in my opinion they do a pretty good job of enforcing the laws. Bottom line, if you don't want a party type atmosphere then don't book ANYWHERE in O.C. for Cruisers week or Bike week for that matter, the same can be said for any other beach town. I personally find Surf Villa very cozy and charming, and I like the fact that it is owner operated.

Disgusting doesn't even begin to cover it. Rooms are tiny and obviously haven't been renovated for 20+ years. The glass doorknob came off in my hand when we first entered the room. That was the first sign of things to come. The cable box was duct-taped to the tv and there were only 2 channels. The carpet on the floor was stained. I didn't even want to take my shoes off. But these things in and of themselves would not have been enough to chase us away. What sealed the deal for us was the absolute disgusting condition of the bathroom, the shower in particular. The shower smelled of mildew, the shower curtain rod was rusted and the water ran either scalding hot or cold - never warm. The water pressure wasn't adequate enough to even rinse the shampoo from hair, let alone the slimy feeling from just being in there. After my disgusting shower, my husband and I decided to leave and find another hotel. Of course the manager told us there were no refunds. But I contacted my credit card company and got an immediate chargeback due to the disgusting conditions. This place needs to be knocked down and rebuilt.

My major gripes: 1) the floor was filthy; I wore white socks for just a few minutes and they turned black! 2) the furnishings were terribly aged 3) the mattress was sagging in the middle and in dire need of replacement 4) the window-mounted A/C was barely adequate 5) the electric socket (only 1) in the bathroom was too small to fit anything modern into 6) the toilet took 3 flushes to get anything down 7) the faucets in the bathroom required tremendous torque to stop the leaking 8) was only supplied a bare number of towels/washcloths 9) maybe 2-3 hangers in the closet, and they were all mangled and old 10) the television set was set on a stand way too high to watch comfortably.

When you check in you get a parking pass for the lot behind the hotel, which has room for 8 cars and which is first come first serve and for parking at the comfort inn 2 blocks down. You have to walk up the steps to check in and if your room is upstairs you have to walk up the tiny stair case. Not recommended for people with walking disabilities. The doors are hard to lock; they lock by bolt lock, which in order to lock the door has to be pulled up and in. when you walk in the room that's basically it. I had a single queen bed which was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept in. There was a whole in the center of the mattress so you would roll to the center if you were in the bed with someone else. The sheets had stains but I brought my own. The TV is a 19 inch mounted on the wall so no way to hook up a game system if you were looking to. When you walk in the bathroom the door doesn't open far enough because the toilet is in the way and the shower is large enough to turn in and that is basically it. Before the stay i read the reviews and I was a bit scared but it wasn't as bad. I called and made sure my room had a bathroom and they told me all of them had private bathrooms so I\u2019m guessing they were recently added. I didn't let them clean the room but after the third day a girl brought me towels but when I asked for toilet paper she didn't understand what I was asking, and there is always someone in the lobby.

The only thing we like about the hotel was its location, being a block away from the boardwalk. The first thing we did once we calmed down was lysol everything that we would possibly have to come in contact with. Just the presence of the room made us feel uncomfortable as if the room was infected. The room was the size of my bedroom and the bathroom was the size of my mother's closet! The remote to the ac did not work so we were unable to adjust the settings. The sheets had stains on them. Thank God I always travel with my own bedding. We immediately lysoled the bed down and covered the bed with my own bedding, leaving the hotel's bedding on the floor. The floor had multiple stains on them which made the room appear even more unsanitary. The shower head was rusted and the shower floor tiling was chipped. The bathroom sink had to faucets. One for hot water and one for cold water which means you can never have warm water! Its either you turn on the cold or the hot water. I have never felt so uncomfortable in a hotel in my life. We were so germaphobic that weekend that we had to laugh at ourselves. I am so glad that I came prepared with my big spray of lysol.

I would never advise anyone to stay at this hotel unless they are ok with dealing with the circumstances that we dealth with. Do not believe the pictures on their website. The only thing that matched the photos in the website with the actual rooms was the quilt on the bed. The queen bed that we slept on looked like the full size bed that I have in my bedroom. Also, since when does a hotel not have a telephone in the bedrooms? There was not telephone, no blowdryer, and no outlets in the bathroom to curl your hair or blow dry it. To top it all off, the rooms are not sound proof at all. We could hear everything from the people outside to the housekeepers spraying the rooms in the morning. It sick and I would never in my life return to this hotel again. Please believe me when I tell you, this place needs to be knocked down and built all over again into an updated comfortable hotel.
