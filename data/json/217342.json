The pictures online are VERY deceiving. Upon check-in, we were notified that there would be a daily charge for parking. Perhaps this is something that should have been mentioned prior to booking. I believe that it is disgraceful to charge your guests for parking at a hotel that they are already paying for. We were expecting to have a nice, oceanview room (which by the way did not come cheap- we paid $100 for the night). We got a room on the top floor, which was a hassle because we had to carry all of our luggage up the narrow stairs, since the elevator looked like something that was build in the 1920's. We walked down a dark hallway to our room, and once we walked in, we were it total disbelief. The room was the dirtiest, most disgusting room we had ever seen. The walls (which were supposed to be white) we covered in filth and peeling, the carpet was so dirty that I would never dare walk on it barefoot, the beds were covered in filth and had cigarette burns in them, and not to mention BED BUGS. Along with the bed bugs, there were all other sorts of bugs walking around on the walls, and to top it all off, the door did not lock. It looked like what I would imagine a Crack House to look like. My husband and I decided that we just couldn't stay in there another minute. We left our luggage in the room, along with some papers and pocket change that my husband threw on the bed. We left the hotel and went in search of another one, which wouldn't be as disgusting. I felt like I was on an episode of Cops with all the drug addicts walking around begging us for money and drugs. I seriously thought we were going to get shot in that hotel. We went just a few hotels down to the Holiday Inn (which was gorgeous and I would highly reccommend), and booked another room there (we ended up spending an additional $139 for our stay there). Had we known that the Conch House was going to be so disgusting, we would have just booked the Holiday Inn in the first place for the extra $39. We quickly went back to our room at the Conch House to get our luggage and pack it back into the car, and when we walked into our room, the lights did not work. We got our bags, and when we went to take the papers and money off of the bed, all of the money was missing. We went to the front desk, and told the man that we just could not bare to stay there any longer. His response was \"Ok, well you know you are going to get charged for this anyway.\" This is disgusting and unprofessional. He did not even care to know why we were leaving or even try to entertain us by asking us what could have been done to make our stay better (which a professional would have done). I am positive that this hotel is a health hazard and must be in violation of many health codes. The Department of Health should be notified and this hotel should be shut down.

There were two beds that were in decent shape and one that was sunken in. The ocean view was spectacular. The other positive was the fridge/freezer combination was not the college dorm size, but a little larger.

Clump of hair in the bedsheets. #4-Noise was horrible! I get that it's Spring Break, but I heard everything in the parking lot, in the hall, and down the street. #5-Parking is very limited. Didn't feel the car was safe. The kicker is that the location is next to the Plaza and a couple of other great hotels. Location alone is great, very central. Walking distance to the boardwalk & shops. But the quality of the place is NOT worth the money I paid. Stay far far away!!

It is filthy. FILTHY. It smells. BAD. Surfaces are dirty in the bathroom. There is hair in the bathtub and on the counter and residue of some sort on the toilet seat. The towels are thin and stained (and don't bother asking for more- they don't have any). The bedspreads are also stained and dirty. There appeared to be boogers on the headboard along with what looked like dried marinara sauce. I can't believe this had not been cleaned. There were roaches in the hotel - I pray there were no bed bugs- if so, I now have them in my house. I was afraid to touch the mattress to check. I was literally afraid to take off my socks and touch the floor. The hotel was loud, there were several sketchy people hanging out on the premises (I think I witnessed a drug deal). I know I saw prostitutes on the property twice in two days - I would be offended if I were a prostitute and someone took me to this place- what a lack of respect. The worst part is that I couldn't move to another hotel as I was with a group and everything else was booked. I have learned a valuable lesson - I will NEVER stay in a hotel without checking for negative reviews - this place should be closed. The photograph online makes is look presentable- this is FALSE ADVERTISING and should be ILLEGAL. I am suspicious of any review of this place that is not negative- I feel certain those come from someone with financial interests in this hotel.
