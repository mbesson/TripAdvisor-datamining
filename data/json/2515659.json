Overall, it seems like they have tried to be hip and trendy but have failed miserably on all counts. The room was like a college dorm with ikea furniture. Not trendy and chic, but cheap looking. The bed was comfortable. Parking is way over priced! $35 per day. They are in the middle of a remodel so some amenities are closed. The pool is small and not inviting. While many hotels now offer free wifi, this place still charges $15 per day. The worst thing was that there is a labour dispute with workers involved in the renovation so there are people picketing outside the hotel all day. \"Shame on the W\" and \"improper treatment of immigrant labor\" read some of the signs. i dont know the reasons for the labour dispute but the hotel staff told me it was because they hired non union workers to do the renos. The W advertises that it is in the Gaslamp district - it certainly is not. It is a 10 min walk to the gaslap district. Bottom line - way over priced for what hotwire calls a 4 star.

This W is in a rectangle building on B Street, a short walk to the Trolley and to Harbor Drive as well as a short walk to Horton Plaza and Little Italy. This property continues to amaze me and each time Is tay here, I like it more and more and look forward to visiting the W in places like Milan and Istanbul as a result of my visit here. This W has an awesome reputation among myslef and my fellow SPG Platinum travelers in that we often are upgraded and given either the Cool Corner or the WOW Suite. If you are traveling with a family, the WoW Suite is better and if traveling with your spouse, the Cool corner is recommended because it has a sunken tub and is more romantic. The W is known for its' fen shui and the design and layout of the rooms are modern and the windowseat divan is always good to sit up and work on your laptop while enjoying the view of downtown San Diego. Each room has a lapdesk to allow you to sit at the window and do work, The touches of coral and ambience upon entering the rooms are relaxing and put you in a restful state. I cannot tell you that you will find a better place to stay in San Diego. The Grant is good because of its' historic features and plaster work but the W is more modern and caters to the \"in\" crowd. The key is do you want modern amenities and comfort or a room that is historic and has character. Both are great but overall, the W has alot more going for it that other starwood properties do not have. The Living Room is always busy and the bar is always packed. The Restaurant here is good. Parking has gone up to $35.00/night now and they only offer Valet parking.

Nice touches included: rice krispie treats and fruit-flavored water in the lobby during the day, complimentary bottles of water upon departure, complimentary taxi service with the \"Acura Experience\", unique room decoration (think chalkboards and window seats), very friendly staff (every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted by at least one employee; every time we left the hotel, we were offered directions and well wishes by at least one employee) Areas for improvement include: overpriced valet parking (at $35 a day, this was more than twice the cost of our rental car!), rooms are small and noisy (you can hear everything in the hallway and in adjacent rooms), pool area is cramped and does not allow much sun (note: this might be because of renovation that the full pool area is not open?). In addition, if you are walking from the hotel to the Gaslamp district, be careful as I did not find the area between the two to be very safe.

Less than impressed\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Guy_76", "ReviewID": "UR127830023", "Content": "I stayed at the W Hotel in San Diego last week and was less than impressed. Yes, the lobby is beautiful (albeit far from original, fresh, etc. at this point), the one-word names for everything ('SLEEP' / 'SWEAT' / 'SNOOZE') somewhat clever - although a bit of a stretch in some cases - and the staff attractive (it counts, trust me), but given the cost, it's not someplace I'd stay again. Yes, it looks like a super bargain if you go by big number you see on travel sites or the W site (I got rates for $100/night), but once you add in the \"extras\" - parking, internet, one meal or a drink (also known as necessities for most people) - the actual rate is twice that. Something about that just seems sneaky, gross, and cheap. And when I filled out the post-stay questionnaire (make that \"tried to fill out\" - their site crashed 3 times and I gave up), I told them that. If the W style - modern, clean, white, a bit on the \"I'm-a-d-bag-who-pays-$1,000-for-a-bottle-of-Kettle-One\" side - was new, hot or original, I could almost overlook the shady pricing. Unfortunately, the brand itself, while nice/fine/trendy/well-designed, has been around - and done by many, many other hotels, both big and small. Adding to that, the W San Diego is a bit rough-around-the-edges, and even after their current upgrade of the restaurant and \"Beach,\" will still be a little dusty. On the positive side, the staff is excellent (save for a few young d*cks parking cars), especially the maids, who are super friendly, do an amazing job, and are always smiling. Half of the valets were great; a few were grumpy (consistently) and two were outright rude. I loved that they sent a TV tech up w/in minutes when my remote wasn't working (fixed in less than 5-minutes), but got absolutely no help when I asked about an iPhone charge because mine was stolen during travel. (They'd sold out of their stock the week before and had none on hand... umm, they're $2 on Amazon- order a dozen!) The food menu is limited; granted they're remodeling the resto, but it could have been much better without a lot of trouble. Definitely not worth $200/night (after add-ons, fees, etc. - NOT including taxes) when I can get other 4-star (or even 5-star) for the same total price, and not have to walk through what feels like a club from Jersey Shores to get to my room at night. My direct feedback to them (attempted): Paying $35/night for parking (especially in downtown San Diego, which is not short on space, parking, etc.) and $15/day for internet makes me feel cheated, nickel-and-dimed, and like the hotel is being sneaky with pricing and not treating guests fairly or with respect. If you're actually going to charge that much, include it (or part of it) in the room. I realize not everyone uses/needs these services and that it raises the room rate - which isn't good for searches - but it's the W; people expect to pay more, and should get a higher level of service without having the final bill be more than double the original nightly cost after parking, internet, and one meal (w/o drinks). It's tacky and makes me think poorly of the brand.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "TerryHWashington_DC", "ReviewID": "UR127759870", "Content": "Great location... an easy walk to good restaurants in the Gaslamp district.

The carpet and baseboards of the room did show a little wear, perhaps a coat of paint and carpet would take the hotel over the top. 2. The coffee provided with room service was not very good.

I chose The W because of the branding and it looked like a great hotel with the pictures and reviews. From the moment I pulled up to the valet, the customer service was First Class. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The HR coordinator and hotel manager should be proud of the staff. I was impressed with the lobby, very Chic. The front desk was able to get me into my room about 3 hours early and gave me a great room (for my price range). That is where they fall short. When it was originally done, I could tell the room was very fresh. However, after a couple of years, it has taken its toll. The carpet had stains, the baseboards were coming away from the wall, the walls were scuffed and needed repainting, the blinds had torn cords and the built-in furniture and bed were basically white painted plywood that needed a fresh coat of paint. The location is a little off the beaten path, but if you don\u2019t have a car, they have a free service (nice touch). Also, if you are just up in your room for an hour, the valet will just leave your car out front so it\u2019s extremely convenient to get to when you go in and out. So, the only reason the W does not get a 5 star rating is for the price that I paid, I just expected the room to be almost perfect. I came to hotel to basically stay in the room and enjoy my time at the hotel, but found that I did go out more than I planned since I was a little disappointed. The nice thing is that my only critique is something that can be easily fixed with just some of the money that is brought in by the nightly charges.

Although we were only there for one night, we had a few unfortunate incidents while there. We were staying in room 1812. The shower was dripping all night long, and the room door was loose and would rattle loudly on it's hinges any time someone else in the hall opened or closed their door. Then in the morning, your housekeeping staff, disregarding the Do Not Disturb sign on our door, continued to knock several times at 9am. After a late night, this was the last thing that we wanted to deal with. When I opened the door, she said, \"Oh, sorry. When are you checking out?\" We replied that we would check out by the check out time. She persisted, asking, \"When?\". After she left our room, I then heard her do the same thing to a neighboring room, who also, incidentally, had their do not disturb sign posted. From what I heard, this man was also very displeased, and rightfully so. Is it normal practice for your staff to badger your guests out of the hotel? After paying $160 for a night, I would expect a much better experience than the one that I received.

The lobby is filled with surfing boards, and has a bar right there. The rooms themselves are pretty standard for a W, that is to say, a bit upscale.

There seems to bit of construction in progress on their second floor and their spa was either difficult for me to locate or temporarily out of service due to that construction (though I never got around to asking the front desk staff). Since my last visit to the area, it appears The Restaurant has slightly relocated and/or scaled down in size, leaving its former dining room as an odd open area with no clear use (and no direct connection to the outdoor patio). Hopefully that area of the hotel is in line for a future refurb/remodel, as it appeared to be a sort of dead space with no obvious function, other than possibly functioning as an overflow room of some sort. The family and I enjoyed our \"Fantastic Suite\" on the top floor of the hotel. Though the room did have a few problems, most were remedied quickly by staff: \u2022 The shower drain did not work. The front desk was notified and it was fixed promptly. \u2022 The bathtub's drain switch was stuck in the \"drain\" position and we were unable to switch it into the \"closed\" position. Again, staff addressed the issue very promptly. :-) \u2022 As this was the top floor of the hotel, I'm not sure what was directly above us, but the bedroom portion of the suite (Room 1905) suffered from the frequent sound of pipes banging overhead. The issue was reported to the front desk but was not remedied, though I did not ask to be relocated and in all fairness, it sounded to my untrained ear like a problem that could not be easily fixed. The sleep sounds programmed into the bedside iHome radio helped mask some of the noise, however. The suite itself appeared to be comprised of two standard rooms connected with a sliding door (though two never-removed doorstops imply that it used to be a swinging door or was simply two adjoining rooms) with one room converted into a parlor / living room. The 1 3/4 bath setup was great for our needs as my daughter bathed in the tub located off the living room while my wife and I liked the simplicity of the bedroom's glass-walled shower. (The pass-through hole in the glass was a convenient way to turn on the shower from the outside without getting wet in the process, and surprisingly let very little water out.) It's been a while since my last stay at a W, so I don't know if the guest information book that most hotels have in each room was missing in our room or the lack of such a book is part of their Whatever/Whenever service. Staff was very accommodating during our three-night stay, from addressing our repair requests, to answering questions about their complimentary car service, to simply holding open the front door. For a W property, I would have liked to see a little more polish on facility upkeep as the banging pipes issue could easily be a major concern for anyone who is not used to background noise when sleeping, and my family and I did notice little bits of litter (the errant gum wrapper, straw, etc.) in the various hallways of the hotel.

You forget it has alcohol. *Pink Ryno (bulleit rye, sweet tea vodka, fresh orange, fresh strawberry, stirrings blood orange bitters) - Sweet & carmely. Almost like an Arnold Palmer. *Stargazer (Svedka cherry vodka,, stirrings peach liqueur, fresh limes, cranberry juice, soda water) - Tart wake up drink. *Cucumber Mojito (Effen cucumber vanilla vodka, elderflower liqueur, fresh muddled cucumbers & lemons, mint, soda, spirits) - Refreshing and aromatic. I would say this is a salad in a glass. lol *Ginger Mojito (Bacardi limon, ginger beer, mint, lime, simple syrup) - A more traditional Majito with ginger spice. *Starburst (Svedka vanilla, watermelon pucker, sweet & sour) - This drink takes me back. Tastes exactly like a pink starburst candy. Amazing! *Berry Delicious (Svedka raspberry, muddled fresh blackberries, soda, sprite) - Similar to a flat cherry rum & coke. *Nobletini (Smirnoff strawberry, orange liqueur, raspberry liqueur, lemonade) - Tart and ritzy! *Hibiscus Royale (Chandon rose champagne, sweet Australian hibiscus flower, syrup essence) - Lovely if you LOVE champagne! Which I do! The edible hibiscus flower is amazing!! We hung out at the beach. This is a rooftop beach in the city.

The W hotel brand \"refreshes\" itself every 5-7 years to keep its progression as a brand, and the W San Diego appears to be on the beginning stages of the \"refresh\", so an improvement on a great property should be expected in the near future hopefully. The staff here was attentive and hospitable at all hours [we used their gym at 6:00am before our flight, and the Welcome Desk Agent was pleasantly attentive given the hour] and thier refreshment station had rice crispy squares for the season in the afternoon. The W Bar is busy at night, be prepared to show your key on busier nights so security knows that you are a guest. Their outdoor patio Beach is a great spot for before dinner drinks or a outdoor night cap, the bartender Todd was excellent and busy given it was just after 6:00pm. Major kudos to the W San Diego's concierge Joseph. We had emailed back and forth before our arrival and he had set up our dinner and activites prior to make things seamless. He gave us a great reccomendation at Candella's on Coronado Island [try their Pollo al Chipolte and the Tres Leche Cake for dessert] and he had also set us up for a solid day in La Jolla too.

Positives - The rooms are the top notch quality you'd expect from a W, with an added bonus of a sofa like area built into wall next to the window. Nice touch. - The Beach. The pseudo rooftop bar is a cute, unique take on something that is highly sought in downtown San Diego, where the outdoors and nearby club surroundings almost demand a relaxed bar that keeps up the chi chi atmosphere. The sand and driftwood stool were a good choice. - Price. Very affordable, especially for a W. Neutral - Location. It's good for a business location as it's near the commercial part of downtown. It's only okay for vacationers being a little too far from the heart of the gas lamp district. - Staff. Some of the staff was excellent, namely the front desk, bar staff and cleaning/maintenance crew. Some of the other staff was rude and not very useful. The valet's were impolite, a friend of the valet verbally attacked my friend to the point where I was hoping to see him elsewhere on our travels so I could request that he back up his threats and finally, I question the security given the fact that two fights apparently occurred in the hotel during our stay. Maybe it was an off week but I can only go on my personal experience. Negatives - Concierge. The \"Whatever\" desk was aptly named as they consistently gave us whatever instead of what we asked for. They were unhelpful helping us secure a rental car for our Mexico excursion. One woman sent us to the wrong location (14 blocks from where we wanted to be). All other requests were equally useless. - Pool area was pretty tiny and with obstructed access to the sun. That would be fine in Seattle but in San Diego, I expected a little more.

I got the \"Wonderful room\" and had a view of the ocean. It was a partial oceanview because there was a building right in front of the hotel, but it was far and the view was still something that I enjoyed. The gym isn't big at all. In fact, it is a tiny room, but I had a nice workout. Next to the gym, there's the pool. A tiny one with a few lounge chairs. There were two people when I went there and the weather was nice, so I enjoyed a little time there as well. I also went to the Beach bar, but not at night. I went when there just to check it out. I bet it can be fun at night, but didn't bother to go. I traveled by myself to go to a concert and watch one of my favorite bands play. The venue was 4th and B, so the hotel was close and convenient. Now, I was a little disappointed by the concierge service. The lady there was a bit rude when I asked her about their car service to see if they can get me to the concert venue. She said I had to make a reservation or wait for the next car available. I was fine with it, but the way she responded sounded like she was annoyed, and to be honest, I didn't want to deal with a person like that, so I took a cab. It was great because the cab was available when I needed it, the driver was courteous and he picked me up after the concert. About the noise outside, well... it is downtown and when the sun goes down, its nightlife becomes alive! The first night I could hear a live band performing somewhere outside. It ended at around midnight, I think. I fell asleep. The second night, the night I went to the concert, I came back to my hotel room at around 12:30am. There was a party going on next to my room! The people were too loud. I dialed once the front desk, but they didn't answered. The party finally ended at 4:30am. I know so because that's when I finally could sleep. I guess I could have call the front desk more times until someone responded and ask them if they could tell this people to lower the volume or something, but I didn't do it, and honestly, even though I couldn't sleep, I wasn't surprised it happened. I read the reviews and took my chances, so if you are reading this and you want a good night sleep, then beware this could happen to you. It is a matter of how important it is to you to get a good night sleep with no noise. Another thing I noticed, is that at first my room looked clean, but then I noticed food crumbs on the bench next to the window (yikes,) and the next morning the housekeeper didn't take all the trash from the bathroom. That might not be a big deal, but still, it is nice to walk into a clean bathroom after the housekeeping service. I didn't pay too much for my stay. I would probably stay there again if I go to another concert or want to stay downtown just because it is convenient, I liked the rooms, the gym, the little pool, and because it is a nice hotel for a short stay.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGoing Far & Beyond the Call of Service\u201d", "Author": "matthew f", "ReviewID": "UR118005770", "Content": "I recently stayed at the W San Diego for a two-day business conference and my experience far exceeded my expectations.

This was the first trip where I used a booking service, Hotwire, that made you book your room not knowing what hotel you were staying at until after you paid in advance. Although I was quite happy at the room rate we received, and initially at the hotel, there were some rough spots. As other reviews have said, the \"W\" is showing its age.. our room was well worn... and not the cleanest we have experienced. Our two biggest complaints are the noise.. the music from the \"Beach\" rooftop bar (on the second floor) was bothersome to us on the 9th floor with no windows open. Also there were sirens almost ever 15 minutes all through the night, there must be a fire station near by. The other deal breaker for us was the beds... they certainly were not the most comfortable we have experienced in other 4 star hotels. We were staying with our 15 year old daughter and required two beds, the only rooms at the \"W\" with 2 beds had double beds.. not queens. I have never stayed at hotel/motel above a Motel 6 that gave you double beds... especially in a 4 star hotel. The beds just are too small for two adults to sleep in. The service from the staff was a mixed bag, some very friendly and helpful and some bordering on rude and disinterested. The bartender at the Beach being the former, and the staff at the pool the later. Speaking of pool... it must hold the record for being the worlds smallest pool. On the hotels web page it states the pool is open 24 hours.. and there is a sign at the pool itself that says that as well... but when we checked in we were told the pool closed at sundown. The rooftop bar is small but nice... unfortunately when we tried to use it our first night there it was closed for a private function. Last year we stayed at the Se', another 4 star hotel in San Diego. Both the W and the Se' seem marketed at the same demographic. Both are modern upscale \"boutique\" style hotels. The Se' in every respect is a much nicer property. Our experience with the Se' exceeded all of our expectations, the \"W\"... not so much. Where the Se's rooms look modern and sophisticated the \"W's\" looks like a preschool classroom.... all bright primary colors and not much else.

I should have gone with TA and stayed at Coronado. First, when we arrived, there were employees standing around the valet area and none of them asked to help. We walked in and the lobby is pretty...\"calm beachy theme\" but not as elaborate as some other W's, check in was professional but very cold. The front desk rep declined to upgrade me even knowing we were on a b-day/anniversary trip. When we arrived to the room, it was very small but comfy. We decided to check out the beach bar & gym, both were nice and yes the pool is pretty small but still ok. When we came back to change for dinner, that was when things started to turn, the lobby turned into a LOUD nightclub (and there was really no one there). You can hear the techno music thru the entire hotel, it was blasting in my room and also the walls are so thin I could hear the other room's entire conversation as well so I asked for another one right away, kinda of annoying to change rooms. But I knew that the noise would get worse as the night progressed. We were sent to the 18th floor, still could hear the techno music echoing off the walls. If you are sensitive to noise, then you def. should NOT stay here! For dinner, we spoke to the concierge who really had no clue....actually anytime we spoke with him, he seemed to give us the \"same suggestions\"....most of the time, I researched on my BB and told him the spot and how to get there. I even had to mostly set up our trip to La Jolla, he had no clue about the area. I think he def. needs more training, he was a sweetie but really needed to delve more into his work. When we got back from dinner, we also realized we have not seen the housecleaner but figured it was the changing of the rooms, wrong, we had to actually call when the 2nd day she didn't show up. They wanted to send her up at 10:30pm but I just asked for more towels, in the 5 days we stayed here, we had housecleaning twice. The hotel is in the downtown area of a city, lots of city life so if you are looking for more of a beach experience, this is not for you, I def. will not.The area is ok & yes there are some \"wishy washy\" folks but they leave you alone and mostly we felt safe anywhere we walked and we walked everywhere. The location to the Gaslamp Quarter is great but better suited to visitors looking to party. We were looking more for the coast and beach areas, for that you should stay in La Jolla or Coronado and pay the extra, it would be well worth it just for the location. The area gets you where ever you need to go though, plenty of cabs, buses and ferrys to take you around but that adds costs so as I said, if you are not looking to party and are looking for a quiet trip, go elsewhere. On the last day, I had to give them feedback because I just was SO disappointed and we spoke with a few employees explaining all the above and how they should smile more, extend their help more. I even told one of them, they should speak to the W in Washington (service there is to die for) and ask how to improve things. I told them I felt like we were staying at a Holiday Inn rather than a W Hotel, the rooms, the service are not 5 STAR. BTW, there is a Holiday that faces the ocean and looked terrific, you may want to check it out. My friend stayed there, it was a few hundred dollars cheaper and she liked it, not love but liked it.

After wandering around trying to find someone to check me in, I saw a front desk clerk after about 5 minutes. He could not hear me and I could not hear him. I handed him my SPG Gold card and my credit card and he got the message. There was simply NO separation between the club and the lobby... NONE! I am actually a huge W fan, but this hotel misses the mark unfortunately. The club is not hip... it's just loud and annoying. The crowd was sparse but the music was glaringly loud nonetheless.... most of the people were outside on the sidewalk either smoking or escaping the blasting music where there could actually talk. The clerk later apologized for being away saying that he had been dealing with an emergency and sent an amenity to the room which I appreciated. Still, the set up in this lobby is really annoying. The room was also getting tired and worn down. The bed frame was cracked, the vanity was badly scuffed, and the cordless phone and 2 of the lights did not work. Im tempted to give in an even lower rating, but it's still much better than a Holiday Inn. Of course you expect better at the W prices.

I was able to secure a military rate of $131, which was great. When we pulled up the valet whisked my car away and was very friendly. The girl at the front desk was also super friendly and helpful. The decor is obviously meant to be chic, and while some may say they're trying too hard, I think they're trying just hard enough and succeeding. The \"living room\" (lobby) was nicely laid out during the day, and was a fairly busy semi-club later that night with lighting effects and club music. Here is where one needs to begin managing expectations. Do not bring your 90 year old mother or 6 month old child to a hotel whose thing is being young and hip, and which comes with loud music and late night revelers. Use ear plugs if you're on a lower floor and are sensitive to noise. The room was spacious and fun. The clock had an iPod dock and the window had a nice bench one could lay on. The TV was flat and big and the wall had a chalk board my wife and I doodled on. The bathroom was nice enough, but (one almost meaningless gripe was that) the toilet paper holder was in a super annoying spot behind you. We hung out at the Beach joint for an hour or so before dinner and it was cool. It was fairly empty so we got a seat on the bench and enjoyed a few drinks before the sun dipped behind the buildings. We did not hit it up late night so this may be an unfair assessment, but I can see it being a drunk-girl-in-high-heels disaster as folks try to navigate through a crowd and around furniture pieces in several inches of sand. The hotel is not quite in the middle of Gaslamp. My wife and I are from New York and have no problem walking numerous blocks to get somewhere - one Manhattan block between avenues is like four SD blocks so it's not that big a deal, but here again, expect a walk, or call a cab. Overall we enjoyed our night. The rate was great, the locations was good enough, the room was fun, and the couple of folks we interacted with were very friendly.

We appreciate a contemporary aesthetic, but too often at the W it's poorly executed. Some things were extremely inconvenient and not up to the standards of even a 2-star property. And for whatever reason the W tends to nickel and dime us for basic services that in our opinion should be considered part of the stay. It's one of the things my wife and I joke about--what charge could they dream up to hit us with this time? The room itself was not \"Wonderful\". The bathroom was nice, but the furniture looked like they bought an old hotel and just painted all the old furniture white. C'mon, guys, you're supposedly a 4-star hotel. However, the most annoying thing about this hotel is the lack of a coffee pot in the room. They have coffee, but you have to get dressed, go downstairs to the lobby, and get it yourself. Either that, or you have to order a $20 pot delivered to your room. This is the first hotel I've ever been to that did not have a coffee pot in-room. From the lowliest Holiday Inn to all the way up to the Hotel Setai you can get that. I'm still baffled by this decision. Service is sometimes delivered well, and friendly people on the staff do exist, but about half the time it seems the staff is too bothered to do anything for you. I had to check with the front desk several times regarding a FedEx package I was receiving there. When I finally received it they charged me $18 on my final bill for the privilege of them handing it to me. Seriously? We just died laughing because it was too predictable and completely W-ridiculous. These are the types of things that are extremely annoying that other hotels would never dream of charging for. Also there was no one to help us with a cab at the valet station as we were leaving. I had to go in search of anyone--no concierge, no front desk, no bellman. They were just here--where did they all go? Pros - Nice looking lobby. Interesting \"beach\"/lounge area on the 2nd floor. Cool aesthetic. Cons - Spotty service, NO COFFEE POT IN THE ROOMS, a ridiculously small pool, no hot tub, low quality cheap-motel-dorm-like furniture, not up to the standards of other Starwood properties While I think Starwood still has some great hotels, the W San Diego isn't one of them.

We were both so excited to be out of the cold and just a chance to leisurely see and do as we pleased;And that's what we did! The hotel was nice. I honestly can't go on and on about it or it's amenities because we really only used it to sleep at night. BUT... the sleep was great. Because we were on Michigan time, our first night we accidentally fell asleep by 630pm. It was a night of complete and total uninterrupted sleep and the black out curtains were a nice touch. We were on the 14th floor and didn't have any noise from the Beach bar or hall ways. In the day sometimes you could hear through the walls but it was never actually disturbing. The lighting in the room was a little on the dim side which wasn't the best for getting ready. House Keeping came everyday and always refreshed our toiletries with the Bliss products. We LOVED those. Although one day we're pretty sure they folded up our dirty wet towels from the floor and put them back on the shelf. One great thing I can say....the Acura service.... SO convenient. We used it twice and it really saves time from walking and money from cab fare. Definitely utilize that amenity! LOCATION: I've read a lot of mixed reviews about the location. Honestly I thought it was in a great spot. Yes, there are quite a few bail bonds lining the street and you're only blocks away from a jail/prison but we NEVER EVER felt unsafe. I also read there are a ton of bums. Yes there were a handful here and there but it wasn't like you had to step over them to get to your destination. You mind your business they mind theirs. We basically walked to most places. Seaport Village is a 10minute walk (Coronado island ferry, Top of the market fish market, little shops and restaurants, museum etc) Little Italy-10/15 min walk GasLamp- We took the Acura there and a Pedicab back after the bar. Pedicab guy originally told us 40$ but a friend got him down to 20$. It was a 10min drive by car. Old Town was a 12-15$ cab ride We took the bus to the San Diego zoo. $2.25 a person one way. Not bad at all. (side note, I'm not a usual public bus taker...and the atmosphere is what you expect a public bus in a major city to be)But it's SUPER CHEAP and a 30 minute ride. There wasn't much as far as breakfast places. We ate twice at Grand Central and once in Little Italy at a Trattoria. It was Amazing. I think it was one of the only places open for breakfast in Little Italy. I do have one complaint. We did order room serivce one morning. My order was not difficult by any means but it was comletely screwed up. I double of things that I only asked for 1 of and 1 of what I ordered 2 of and one whole entree was missing, and I was charged for the double items I didn't order! When I realized it, I called and let them know I was not trying to be difficult,the food we actually did get was good but just didn't want to pay for the extra stuff. The woman I spoke with said \"No problem, I'll let my manager know and have it taken care of\". I said \"Thanks\" and forgot about it. The day of check out we received a reciept with all the items still on it stating I would be charged that amount. When we checked out I once again had to bring it to their attention. His reaction was polite, and slyly asked me \"What do I think would be fair to do about the situation\" In the end he took a portion of the charge off the bill but at that point I almost feel it should have been completely comped. My husband didn't even get his breakfast!! But we aren't complainers and just shared what we did have and I don't like making any kind of scene so I just went with what was happening. All in all.

However, once I arrived at the hotel I realized why the rates were so reasonable. The immediate area surrounding the hotel was less than desirable (a county jail and huge homeless population right on the next block) and the hotel was located further out of the gaslamp district than expected eliminating the ability to walk anywhere. Yet they charge $32 a night for parking. No wonder the hotel offers a complimentary Acura MDX to use if guests are travelling within 10 miles of the hotel. The valet and bell staff were exceptional. They provided top class service and addressed us by name on a daily basis. However, the front desk staff made a huge mistake upon check-in. The staff member gave us keys to the wrong room, which was already occupied by another guest. Luckily that guest was not in the room and the bellhop had accompanied us to the room with our luggage and quickly made a phone call to the front desk and took us to the correct room and got us new keycards. We were on the 4th floor and we could hear the noise from the street all day/night. Did I mention there is a bus stop/station right next to the hotel? The room itself was on the small side and the bathroom was a complete joke. The bathroom was clearly designed for aesthetics and not for functionality. There was no bathtub and no shower door which made bathing a toddler a real challenge. The lack of a shower door made keeping the bathroom floor dry difficult and the wet floor became a safety hazard. The toilet paper holder was located so far back that it was difficult to use. The window seat was so high that only a guest who was 7 feet tall could use it without a stepstool. The television picture quality was so poor and the remote barely functional. The pool and the surrounding area were so small. There were only 5 chairs for the entire pool area and the pool itself is more like the size of a large hot tub. We had a difficult time getting a chair to put our things at 4PM which I would assume is not a \"peak time\". There was no place to put trash or dirty towels so the pool area was a complete mess. Trash like cigarette butts and napkins were flying into the pool. For such a small hotel, the elevators took forever. There was sign apologizing for the delay and explaining that it was temporary since the elevators were being worked on, but the elevators remained slow for our entire 3 day stay.

Carpet dirty and stained (I didn't even want to walk barefoot on it), the bathroom was nothing special. Had to pay for everything - for the price of hotel you think they could give you something... even at the Comfort in you get water and ummm.. a coffee maker in your room.

Charged for faxes but there was no directions on how to use the fax (face up? face down?) and no confirmation of whether the fax went through. It didn't (and I was charged anyway). Parking: the W charges $35 a night. Not outrageous or unexpected for a downtown hotel with limited surrounding parking. HOWEVER, this hotel could make it better for their guests by charging less because there are numerous lots across the street and within a 2 block radius that charge anywhere from $15-$30 overnight in addition to the free street parking after 6pm. I paid for the first night because my family member could not walk far, but the 2nd and third nights I found free street parking just outside the door. In general, it was not a bad stay.

Also, their outdoor bar on the 3rd floor is amazing. It's a nice change that you won't find at other hotels in San Diego. The outdoor bar also has heated sand, so it really is unique.

I found out that the hotel had been aware of the problem for years and usually asked to guests to make a 'towel dam\" on the floor to control the water. This place is a mess. In order to get a non-flooding room I had to take a downgrade to a standard no water view room. Gee thanks. The decor is odd for a W property. The rooms are white laminate (chipped and painted over) with a chalkboard with no chalk or erasers. Probably too many guests were writing This Place Sucks on the blackboard. I have a feeling W rightly abandoned this decor as I have not seen it elsewhere. The pool, pool area, and the fitness room are microscopic. As if that were not bad enough the entire pool area was taken over for a business meeting. It was really bizarre to be sweating on a machine while a business conference is in session inches away. I cant imagine trying to swim with the tablecloths nearly dipping in the water of the tiny pool. It is so wrong for any hotel to usurp the fitness area and pool area for private parties. The location is off putting as welI. It is next to the high-rise jail and is surrounded by the usual bail bond places and their customers. It seems most of the rooms have crappy views. My first room was of a parking lot and bus transit area. The second room view was not much better. The hotel seemed deserted and had none of the usual W vibe. The restaurants were both empty at breakfast and dinner. I did not try them. This hotel is the worst in the W chain and by far the worst of all the Starwood options in San Diego area. Avoid it, as you can find much better nearby.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cali", "Title": "\u201cAwesome experience at an awesome hotel!

The hotel is located in the centre of San Diego quite close to Little Italy and Gaslamp Quarter. The location is not the best though. Next time we might choose a hotel near harbor area (e.g. Hilton) with nice views. Check in was handled in a second and the concierge presented himself right away which was a nice touch (also gave his business card right away and told to contact if any questions). In W San Diego we also got an immediate introduction of the Acura one way complimentary transfer which we didn\u2019t get at W Times Square. We arrived by car and parked the car ourselves since the price W San Diego charges for their parking is ridiculous (triple price). The room was nice but we were very disappointed with the bathroom. It looked a bit old-fashioned and ordinary which is an absolute no-no in a W hotel (W Times Square had a nice, trendy bathroom). Bathroom would have needed a thorough cleaning (hairspray usually ends up on a lamp or other surfaces and those were not cleaned during our stay). What annoyed us was the fact that the cleaning ladies came into our room at 9am every single day. We would have kind of understood it if it was midweek but we checked in on Friday and checked out on Tuesday so most of the days were weekend (and yes, we would prefer to sleep a bit longer during weekends..and yes, we did use the \u201cdo not disturb\" sign). W San Diego doesn\u2019t have a free WiFi in the rooms which is a big flaw (same thing applied to W Times Square). We know that there is a free internet in the lounge area (Living Room) but it is not the same since you always have to bring your laptop down and find a place to sit. We loved the \u201cday bed\u201d next to the window and the coloring of the room was fresh. Bed was very comfortable. The bar/Living Room area was very nice and service good. We also enjoyed the pool area (which is very small though) and had it for ourselves on Monday. Prices in the bar were quite ok but the minibar and snacks had a pretty steep price. Would we choose this hotel next time? It didn\u2019t give us a WOW factor although almost everything worked fine. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the hotel is trendy and service good so definitely worth for a try. Maybe I\u2019ll try another hotel (with a nice seaview) and then notice that W San Diego was better but I\u2019m willing to take the risk.

We paid through priceline but she honored my starwood preferred gold member status and upgraded our room to a partial view of the bay. The maid service is exceptional. The bad: (1) elevator access. You always have to put your card in the reader slot in the elevator to get to your floor which makes for a cumbersome experience when your hands are full as ours often were. (2) No in-room cofffee which may seem trivial to some but a lifeline for me. The W offers coffee downstairs next to the lobby but they only had 1 pot and it was frequently empty which made for a very frustrating experience. (3) The \"club\" atmosphere with trance music being blasted in the lobby in the late afternoons and into the evenings was really annoying and made for a very loud hotel experience (I slept with ear plugs). (4) The rooms while clean and decorated elaborately in the same Blue/IKEA/funk complete with a chalk board and chalk, are small with limited shelf/drawer space and there is NO bathtub - shower only (and shower has no door). (5) There is no privacy in bathroom due to the apparently Asian inspired sliding bathroom door that really only blocks the opening to the bathroom, it actually does not close off the bathroom. (6) NO jacuzzi and a very, very small pool. (7) The gym was nice actually (with a variety of equipment) but with slatted doors it was open to the outside and an exhaust smell would come into the gym making it as though you were working out on the street next to a running diesel truck. (8) Location: next to a rather seedy section of down town, it was a good hike to the gas lamp district (Little Italy was closer) through vagrants and scary looking people and, with trains running through the night blaring their whistles, again, ear plugs are a must. (9) No onsite parking - you must use valet and at a whopping $32 per day, it really adds up. Good side- you can come and go as you like with no additional fee but the valets wanted tips each time they got your car for you. (10) the non front desk staff was rude and absolutely lacked elevator ettiquete. Other than the front desk who's sole job it is to greet and be courtious to guests, the rest of the staff we encountered were rude. As an example, one staff member actually brushed me out of the way so that she could get onto the elevator.

When I found out my family (6 year old, 19 month old, and my wife) and I would be staying at this hotel for 4 nights, I was a little nervous. Having read reviews about how loud it is and it is really geared towards a young single crowd, I was wondering what I got myself into. Upon arrival the valet was very attentive, the front desk person was quick and nice, and we were in our room in just a matter of minutes. The room is really nice (on the small size) but had nice touches like big throw pillows, terry cloth robes, plush carpet, and a nice flat screen tv. The one obvious problem when we got to our room was the dirty windows. Absolutely filthy and unfortunately it made it difficult to see outside. This was disappointing for my kids who would have loved to see the view. Wet (pool) and Beach (outdoor bar) are nice and had a real mix of people and are accessible on the 2nd floor. So it was never uncomfortable to bring my small children to either of these areas. The downfalls of this hotel are the valet parking ($32 day) but you can park for up to 12 hours for $22 directly across the street. Down the street near the Best Western Bayside you can park for $15 with in/out priveledges for up to 24 hours. The downfall there is that the area is a little seedy. The location of this hotel is not bad but the courthouse, central jail, and numerous bail bonds stores bring some undesirable folks to the area.

It used to be very techno-modern with subdued lighting. The concierge is right inside the doorway which was confusing for the front desk. Luckily, I knew where the front desk was. The property still has a basket of green apples at the checking and Ashley was extremely friendly and welcomed me back as if I were a close family member returning from Iraq. Wow! This was followed by delightful whatever/whenever service from Katrina. It is Katrina's pleasant and wonderful voice you hear when you contact the whatever/whenever agent.

Jessica, guest relations, did an outstanding job in surprising me wi my favorite candy and beverage. I guess the survey I filled out a long time ago really paid off. Thank you for the fruit basket, beverage and gummy bears. Thank you for researching another Starwood property whom may have annotated my record with the suggestion on favorite beverage. You can tell Umit Corut, Sheraton Suites, that he is quickly becoming my second if not bird favorite property. WOW!!!!!

Amazing. I woke up on my second morning with a terrible cold and just couldn't make it down for the 'complimentary coffee service' in the lobby. All I wanted was some tea with honey and lemon! And, the Front Desk immediately offered to bring me a pot of tea with 'all the trimmings' - to my room, free of charge. When I 'thought' my room charges were a bit 'off', they immediately adjusted my bill to reflect what I presumed was the correct estimation - no questions asked. When I arrived later than expected after a delayed flight from New York, the bartender had no problem in offering to go to the kitchen to 'whip me up a salad' so I could eat something beyond bread with my wine that first night. Manhattan has no shortage of 'expensive' hotels at any level, but we take for granted we're paying for the geography versus optimal service.

Rooftop sounds way cooler than \"outdoor 2nd floor pool\", but might be considered a little misleading. - There was black hair in my sink. - The ipod dock didn't work- I could hear music when I had my ear pressed to the speakers, but cranking the volume all the way up didn't get the volume to reach the other side of my room. - Windows in my room were filthy. - There was a waterfall when you walked up the stairs to the beach- at first I thought this was really cool. The I realized it was from the crew washing soot off the building from a fire they had last year. The W didn't cover the area where the water came streaming down.... the did put towels on the floor so people didn't track water into the ulta-hip lobby. Hopefully they don't reuse those towels... - The Acura free ride anywhere you want is not usually available anytime you really want to use it. - The treadmill that I used in the morning to work out was already warmed up. There was sweat everywhere on it. You might find this appealing... I did not. - I checked in for a meeting and they remembered to tell me that I had a welcome packet waiting for me, but forgot to give it to me. I assumed they meant it was waiting in my room, but they actually meant it was waiting with them. When I called and asked, they did bring it up to my room. So that's pretty overwhelmingly \"Not that Great\" in my book. The bartender at the beach bar was really friendly, as were the people at the desk. And the decor is really cool.

We arrived very early but our room was ready so we were able to check in. Considering we left home to catch our flight at 4 a.m. that was greatly appreciated. We stayed in a standard room with a king bed - it was very clean and comfortable and I don't recall having a better nights' sleep than here. I was a little worried when we first came in and saw the lounge area - a couple of reviews I'd read had said it got loud but it was never an issue for us. The pool is heated and open 24 hours, which was nice, and it seems well maintained but it was fairly small. For the two of us, that really wasn't a problem and we only encountered other guests there once. The concierge and desk staff were all very friendly and we got some really good dinner recommendations in the area - definitely appreciated. The only minus, which really isn't that much of a minus, is that the hotel is a little out of the way for someone who might want to be closer to the action, such as in the Gaslamp Quarter. That said, it is a very quick walk to the trolley station as well as to a number of bus stops and Little Italy is only a quick walk away. Of course, the best part is the Karl Strauss Brewery that is right around the corner so a big thumbs up for that.

We had high hopes after a lovely stay at the Lakeshore W in Chicago. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed with what we found in SD. It's a 10 minute walk to the gaslamp. What the don't tell you is it's a 10 minute walk past a jail, bail bonds joints, youth hostels and LOTS of homeless, many of which had no qualms about coming right up to your face and harassing you as you walk. Our room (#1) was an adequate size with a fairly large worn hole in the carpet and FILTY windows/blinds. Also... no bathtub. Not ideal with the amount of walking we had to do to get out of the ghetto. We had a pet staying with us, which they knew, and I was surprised that there was no sort of pet welcome anything. Not asking much... a water bowl would have been nice. (Also FYI... nowhere outside for your pet to go to the bathroom unless you like concrete.) We requested a room change but the hotel was booked. The front desk staff was lovely and made arrangements to move us while we were out the next day. We were pretty disappointed with the \"pool\" and the outdoor bar. Shouldn't this be on the roof? The Beach was a giant ashtray so we went out to dinner and then back to the room to get some shuteye. We were awoken at 3am by loud party-goers fighting out in the hall. And again at 4. When we attempted to make a groggy call to the front desk the handset on the phone didn't work. We finally figured out how to use the speakerphone and called downstairs. Someone came up fairly quickly and told our neighbors (I think there were 6 people in the one room) to quiet down. Naturally, they woke us up again at 5 but what can you do? We walked a different route the next day to the marina and chose to take a cab back to avoid walking through the surrounding neighborhood again. When we returned, our new room wasn't ready yet. They told us it would be approx 1/2 an hour. An hour later we were still waiting. The down pillows and comforter had given us both major sinus issues so we asked that they be removed. We were told that was the hold up. To change out 4 pillows and remove a comforter? We finally made it into our 2nd room which was cleaner and had no holes in the carpet. But where were our bags? Nowhere to be found. I called downstairs to have them bring them up. 25 minutes later they were still not there. I took my old room key and went back to the old room. There they were... packed and waiting. I brought the bags up myself! A bellman showed up 15 minutes after that to let me know that my bags had been moved already. Yeah, thanks. They did send up a bottle of champagne with a note apologizing for the noise from the night before. (Management informed me that they had a couple of guests from a different floor thrown in jail the night before so clearly, this is a problem here.) We chose to take our car out that night but we needed to fill up with gas. The valet had NO IDEA where the nearest gas station was. According to him, it was his first night. I highly doubt that. One of the other valets eventually sent us off in the right direction. We had breakfast at Rice on our last morning and while service was pretty slow the food was good and our waiter was super friendly.

We simply felt welcome from the moment we arrived, and the staff was so helpful in recommending and arranging activities for us to do during our stay. They are proud of their city and were excited to help us experience it. The hotel lobby is cool and laid back. My kids liked the board games that were out too. We also swam in the pool one morning and had a good time. We had a Wonderview room. It was light, bright and clean, and we had enough room and storage for 4 people. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the DVD player came in handy to entertain the kids. My wife really liked the bath products that came with the room and she also liked the complimentary coffee in the lobby, but wished it was served after 1000 AM for the late risers ;-). The location of the hotel was convenient and I especially liked the proximity to the Little Italy neighborhood. We went to this area often to eat. It was also an easy walk to the boardwalk and to the Gaslamp Quarter, but the hotel was in a quiet part of downtown. One of the best benefits of thie hotel is the complimentary Acura service. This was so convenient for us as we did not have a rental car. We were driven to Sea World, the Zoo, Balboa Park and Seaport Village, and the car was really luxurious.

The W is a reasonable walk (~15 minutes) from the convention center, closer than some of the discount chain motels I was looking at. The neighborhood is not as chic as the hotel itself, mostly office buildings and parking lots (reminds me of downtown Hartford) but it's not far from the Horton Plaza and beyond that is the Gaslamp. This was my first time in a W hotel, it's basically targeted to younger travelers, typically in the elevators were groups of twentysomethings in town for a wedding or bachelor/ette party. This could have made for poor sleeping, fortunately I didn't hear any wild parties or anything aside from the TV next door (though I should note I am a heavy sleeper). My room was on the 17th floor - very comfortable bed, one of the nicer hotel bathrooms I've seen, everything was clean and the furniture and decor had a modern chic to it (even if upon closer examination you could tell they were closer to the level of Ikea than something you'd see advertised in the New Yorker). Downstairs by the reception is a bar and seating area that are good for meeting friends. I didn't try the (small) pool but did use the gym, which was more or less your typical gym for business travelers. Next door is a brew pub to grab a pint, and if you're hungry for some cheap but tasty Mexican grub, I recommend Taco express which is one block north on State Street. The staff was very helpful and friendly, but the one drawback I would point out is the $12.95 daily charge for wireless access, and the wireless speed was not up to par for the purposes of VPN use or video streaming. Since I stayed five nights, I skipped the hotel wireless after the second day and managed to limit my wi-fi use to the conference and coffee shops. Overall, I had a comfortable stay, and would book again - as long as I could expense it. If I were paying out of my own pocket for more than a night or two I might be more inclined to bargain hunt more aggressively.

The beach bar thing they have on the 2nd fl was pretty cool though a tad on the expensive side ($40 with tip for 1 burger and fries, glass of wine and vodka tonic.) parking as everyone says is way expensive but what do ya do. They have other public Lots in the area but they are $20 for 24 hr so I figured it was worth the extra $12 to be able to get my car when I wanted it. Another nice feature about this hotel is that they give you a free ride in an Acura if you know where your going and at what time you just call down and let them know and the car will be waiting for you", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Service - Great Location\u201d", "Author": "KylefromKC", "ReviewID": "UR56350033", "Content": "The staff at the W is excellent.

The gentleman at the bar a few feet away said he could not help us. We stayed at the front desk trying to find someone to help us for at least 7-8 minutes until finally someone came out of the back room, looking like we just woke him up from a deep sleep. After that, check in was fine, and we went to our room. The room was pretty standard, except for the chalk board on the wall. I know then W is trendy, but a chalkboard on the wall? We spent most of the 2 days outside the room. Valet parking is extremely expensive and street parking there is horrible. There is metered parking but you have to get up at 8am to feed the meter the next morning, and then every 2 hours after that. Also, it seems this area is a main hangout for the homeless population in San Diego. One of the nights we literally had to walk through bodies to get to the hotel. Another pet peeve of mine was that the door man was too busy talking to one of his coworkers to open the door when we went out. He had his hand on it, but was not paying attention to those going in and out, so we pushed the other door open.

If that guy would have been at the elevators to prevent unwanted people from getting to the room tower I wouldn't have ahd a problem with it, but he was there to make sure that the non-guests paid their cover. I digress. To the parking thing. I know parking is a premium in downtown SD. Been there, done that....but you know what I think?--$35 per night for \"valet\" parking is kinda steep. I wouldn't have minded so much if they had advertised the charge on the website when I made the reservation, but NO, they couldn't do that. After telling the front desk staff that the amount doesn't appear on their web page they could have cared less. The girl told me that I can park on the street (just so I move my car by a certain time each day except for Sunday etc...) Well I looked for a parking spot the second night I was there and the closest thing I could find had homeless people (and a lot of them) sleeping 5 feet away. I didn't even want to get out of the car. Now, if I would have booked a hotel for say $45 a night, I might expect something like that, but no, this was not that type of hotel. Now, where I come from (Las Vegas born and raised), we don't let a hotel build unless there is enough parking ON SITE to accommodate EVERYONE. It may be a parking garage, but you WILL find parking. How can a hotel build without enough parking? If that is the problem of course. I think they just want to earn just a bit more per night than they advertise. The manager was summoned when I told him the fee was not advertised on the Hotel's website and he told me basically take-it-or-leave-it. When we checked into our room, we found that about an hour later, he sent some sort of gift basket up with a note stating that he had spoken to his congressional representative and miraculously had his boss call the \"parking company's\" boss and they worked it out where I only had to pay one night parking. Now I would expect this fee if in NY or SF or someplace with a huge amount of high density, but SD? If you're gonna do this, put it on your website. And, 7 months later, guess what, it's still not on their \"announcements\" page. The fees for pets and smoking and late check out are there, but nothing about parking.

I am sure that I am not out of the ordinary, but when I choose a hotel I consider several things: a super comfortable bed, a room that is clean and up-to-date (renovated or current furnishings), nice amenities (gym, pool, lobby), and excellent customer service. So, for anyone who has been to the W San Diego, it should come as no suprise that I always choose the W San Diego as my home away from home. The W San Diego is consistently excellent every time that I stay there. I always have a great room with a comfortable bed, the amenities are modern and chic ( I love the lobby vibe, fresh candles, board games...),and the customer service is first rate all the time. For example, when walked in to the lobby last week, Melissa Humble, the front desk associate, warmly greeted me by name. She noticed earlier in the day that I was checking in that afternoon so she had set aside a beautiful upgraded room. This is not an uncommon occurence at the W. Each and every time I am personally greeted and they always go above and beyond. It is my first choice regardless if I am in town for business or pleasure.

A trance-like dance CD was already playing in the room, and he was very knowledgeable when we asked a few questions. Mirrors were everywhere, and an \"intimacy kit\" was lying near the bed. Yes, it *is* what you're thinking. We were given a wristband to enter any of the lounges on the premises, and when we hesitated to stand in line later that evening, we were immediately spotted and escorted to the front of the line and let in. Wearing our t-shirts and slippers, we didn't know that we were entering the coolest bar in San Diego. The 2nd floor Beach Bar is covered in sand, and it was hysterical to watch such gorgeous people wearing stilettos trying to walk gracefully while ankle-deep in the sand. We found a bench towards the cabanas and enjoyed people-watching for awhile. The entire experience was unlike any hotel I've ever stayed at.

We handed our three bags to a staff member and received three tags. When we returned at 315 to collect our bags, we handed the three tags to the staff member who returned with only two bags. Naturally, the missing bag was the one with my work laptop. Despite numerous efforts of the staff members to locate the lost bag they could not find it. I myself went into the poorly organized luggage room and could not locate it. We spent half an hour trying to find the lost luggage and had to leave so that we could catch our train. What is particularly interesting about this situation is that there was a gentlemen in front of me who was going through the exact same problem and had to leave as well to catch the 4pm train. He was missing a bag with his laptop as well. I gave the hotel my information and left on the train. That night I called the hotel to see if there was an update and was advised to file a police report. For the first three days the management staff was excellent about updating me with news on this situation but then they seriously dropped the ball after that.

More detail: we are a couple, aged 49 and 40, professional, not stuffy, but neither of us drinks or parties much. (If you like the idea of drinking so much you end up spending $800 a night on a bar tab with a couple of friends, this is the place for you! Each of the three mornings we ate in the restaurant, EACH of the parties around us talked of nothing else but their drinking, how to get more drinks, where to go for drinks, how much they spent on drinks, what their favorite drink is, etc.) If you like Very Loud music--club music--you will love the beach and the bar at night. We wore earplugs and still it was louder than Burning Man. (If you have been there, you know what we mean.) Others there seemed to be enjoying it, though. We thought the design of the hotel was impressive--more my husband's style than mine (it is very modern and masculine--that is, hard surfaces, chrome, glass, monochromatic with a splash of blue). I felt uncomfortable walking across the lobby--it just feels empty, and I don't mean that literally--and, as others have mentioned, Very Uncomfortable in the elevators. They are very dim, chrome, claustrophobic, and you need to insert a key in order for them to work, so you are standing there with the door closed waiting to do that in this strange metal container. We liked our room; yes, we also got water all over the floor in the bathroom while taking a shower no matter what we did, and thought it strange that there was no bathtub. But again, it seems the W was built for masculine men and women who probably don't like to take baths. :0) The soaps, etc., were replenished (Bliss) and we loved them. We had a great housekeeper. The room was spotless. Anything above the 4th floor and on the opposite side of the hotel from the beach is quiet; our room was quiet with windows that open a little for air. We thought Rice had really good food, and enjoyed the happy hour 1/2 price food in the bar during the weekday afternoons (the cheese plate was excellent, as were the fries). The playful names of dishes on the menu were a nice touch. The gym and pool are ridiculously small, though, for a 4 star hotel. I've stayed in some hotels where the hot tub is as big as this pool. None of this is the current management's fault--most of our complaints are really design issues, but they do have a big impact when you are staying somewhere for several nights on vacation.

It was very, very far from perfect. I encountered many maintainence and cleanliness issues during my 4-night stay at the W. The staff put on a show of caring about these issues, but I did not feel that they were being genuine. Here's what they did right... - The hotel is very hip and trendy. They obviously put a lot of thought and effort into the decor. But, they will need to renovate every few years to keep up with the super-trendiness. - The location is good. You are within walking distance of pretty much everything in downtown San Diego. The only time I used a cab was to get to and from the airport. Apparently, they have a car service??? I was not made aware of this during my stay. - Room service was friendly and prompt, but a little on the pricey side. But, hey, it's room service. It's a luxury. Here's what they did wrong... - I had a huge issue with the cleanliness of my room (too disgusting to mention here) during my first night. I can deal with a lot of things, but this was truly gross. I asked to be moved to a different room, but they said they were full. They promised to change the bedding and sanitize the room. They also promised to add 5000 Starwood points to my account. When I returned to my room later in the day, the bedding had indeed been changed, the carpet seemed to have been cleaned, and there was a bottle of wine with an apology note on my desk. But, as of today, they still have not added the points to my account. This whole ordeal made me take a closer look at everything in my room and I noticed a lot of things that were wrong. - The cordless phone and one of my bedside lamps did not work. I told management about it and they were fixed. - The backsplash on the bathroom sink remained dirty for my entire stay. - One of the slats on the window blinds was broken. - I had a rug in the bathroom for the first day. This was taken away and not replaced for the rest of my stay. - I had to ask for washcloths on the second day. There were none left by the maid. - There was one bar of soap that I transferred between the sink and the shower for my entire stay. - Cigarette burns on the carpet of a non-smoking room. - The toilet would run intermittently throughout the day and night. - There is no door on the shower. The setup looks cool, but it's not practical. I had to wipe a puddle of water off the floor after every shower. - I was overcharged for a beer I ordered with my room service meal. - There is no newspaper. I actually enjoy reading the USA Today that most hotels provide free of charge. - There was a moldy smell in the hallway. It must have been in my room too. I didn't notice it while I was there, but my clothes all smelled like it when I got home and unpacked. - The pool and gym are teeny-tiny. - The side of my nightstand had some kind of grime crusted on one corner. I realize that some of my complaints are nit-picky, and most of these are things that I would normally overlook. But... When you're paying what amounts to be a car payment for each night, every detail should be attended to. Granted, most of these issues probably could have been handled with a phone call to the front desk. But, frankly, I just didn't want to deal with the elitist attitude I got from some of the FOH staff. I am in the service industry (restaurants, not hotels) and I would not have tolerated any of this from my staff.

I called to reception to ask to be moved and they said there were no rooms available. Disappointed, we accepted it and went on to try and enjoy our stay. I went for a shower in the bathroom and the water was boiling hot, I couldn't stand in it. They called an engineer. We waitied in the hotel room for an hour for the engineer to arrive. They fix it and I went back to my shower. A few minutes later the shower dial falls off the wall and I can't turn the water off...the water returns to boiling hot temperatures and I am scaleded with shampoo still in my hair. At this point, my fiance to be and I go to reception...close to tears at just how awful the experience has been so far. They credit my room with $50 for food (which covered the overpriced breakfast) and say an engineer will be up again. This is not how we want to spend the rest of our day, waiting for engineers! It is only when I get so upset that I am in tears (with my soaking wet hair dripping in reception) that the manager offers to move rooms, why should it have to get to this point for them to correct their faults! The service is just so bad. They move us to a SMALLER room. I am just so glad to have moved that I accept it.

Our problem was that although there was the basic shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion, there were no shower caps, and no q tips, however, they very swiftly provided these things for us. Also, there was a coffee maker with coffee in the room , there was no cream and no sugar and no tea bags. Since we drink tea, we called for tea bags, and very shortly later a lady brought tea bags, with ceramic cups and boiled water and honey and it was the tea works, all complimentary!

My criticism of the hotel is as follows: 1. The lighting (lobby, elevator, room) is dim everywhere; 2. The hotel room was small, the bathroom was really not up to the standard of a nice hotel, and the room was showing signs of wear (chipped paint, spots on walls and carpet, dirty room service menu); 3. The walls to the hotel were very thin and you could here everything from the next door room, thankfully we were on a corner and had only one shared wall; 4. The hotel turns into a nightclub, at least on Saturday, and besides having to walk back through the lobby with men ogling my rather pretty (in my humble opinion) teenager girls, the thump thump thump of the blaring music kept us up late into the night - and our room was on the 13th floor. FINALLY, 5. The room had a overly strong fragrance that I couldn't figure out -- it wasn't unpleasant, just like too much air freshener. We even opened the windows to try and dissipate the smell. Only later did I put two and two together -- when I came out of the elevator on my way to the room and ran smack dab into a woman with her bulldog.

The staff seemed to take an enormous amount of time with each guest as they chatted away while other people were standing in line. Rooms were not ready even at 6pm. There were a few disgruntled travelers waiting for a room and becoming short with the staff. The loud music also made it very difficult to communicate with the reception staff. It was very important that I had 4pm late-checkout the next day and I was told it was no problem because there were plenty of rooms. However, the next day, I was disturbed no less than 5 times via door knocks and phone calls as to why I hadn't checked out. Check-out took about 20 minutes because the receptionist could not work out how to add a mini-bar charge to the bill.

The second receptionist apologised and said #1 should never have been at the front-desk because she was not trained. The hotel has a 'hip' and 'anything is ok' attitude but they really should just hide their beads and get the job done rather than trying to live up to a 'fun' brand. Even the 'concierge' couldn't seem to arrange a taxi, and instead stood on the corner trying to wave one over. I ended up doing it myself.

I fell asleep in seconds and didn't wake up all night every night, which is very unusual for me. I am still blown away by the comfort of this bed and the whole design of the room inside was really nice with fun colours, lots of pillows/cushions, big bathroom, big TV and fun things like a big blackboard and chalk to write on! Pool was out of order when we were there, so I can't comment. But it seemed small and just surrounded by walls, from what we saw.

The Acura service was great and we never had a problem finding a ride to travel around town. The roof top bar was great in the evening but also relaxing during the day while lounging in their cabanas.

Instead of cool and cutting-edge, it now feels dated and in need of refreshing. To start with the positive, all of the staff have been courteous and professional. It's unfortunate that their politeness is not enough to make this hotel a worthwhile place to stay. The hotel did not honor my request of a high-floor room far from the elevator (even though it was made both through my travel agent at the time of booking and AGAIN with a same-day call the morning of check-in). Instead, I was placed on the fourth floor in the room ADJACENT to the elevator, low enough that I could hear the constant music playing in the lobby. When I complained, I was told the only other available room in the whole hotel was a smoking room. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but when I was dispatched to this room, I was appalled. The room smelled as though 50 people had been chain-smoking in their all night long. There were burns on the carpet and duvet, in addition to chipped paint on the desk and black scuff marks all over the wall. The room was so filthy I wouldn't have taken off my shoes, never mind slept in the bed. Another call, this time to the manager. Finally, I was place in a room on a high floor, and while it's fine, it's absolutely NOT worth the price. The music that blasts from the lobby 24/7, the pitch-black elevators that are reminiscent of an 80's strip club, and the trying-too-hard-to-be-trendy-but-not-trying-at-all-to-comfortable rooms make this a hotel best enjoyed by those under 25.

I hadn't had that nice of a sleep in months! My most favoriate part of the hotel, though, were the unique decorations and sundries. As I unpacked my bags and checked out the room, my mood quickly shifted from frustration and wanting to run to happiness and wanting to see what other cute things they could think of. The lighting was a bit to get used to, but every where you looked, the W thought of some cute way to \"tag\" items. An example was the little pencil on the night stand -- it said something like, 'Write down your idea.' Kind of corny, but different which made me smile constantly. The staff were also incredible! One of the ladies in our meeting rode up the elevator with one of the staff; they had a small conversation about the lady's recent cold still lingering; and the staff member sent her up some soup on the house. What an awesome touch! That's the Ritz example of empowerment for the customer!!! All the small unique touches turned me into a huge fan of this hotel!!

From reading reviews we knew it would be a busy place with lots of people utilizing the bar. It was noisy on the first level, but the staff was very accommodating upon our arrival and honored our request for a room that was on an upper floor facing the cruise ship pier, even though we were in a discounted room. Our room 1813 was the best room for cruise passengers. The beds are great and the pillows even better. Extra pillows, towels and robes were provided. Washcloths were nice and thick. Throw pillows were fun, especially the beach ball. Room was very soundproof. The room had plenty of space. We never heard any hall or other room noises. We enjoyed seeing all the young adults having fun in the lounge area. We really loved the funky and eclectic d\u00e9cor of the W. The location was awesome. We could and did walk to great restaurants (Caf\u00e9 222, The Yard, The Field and Central Cafe) and also to Seaport Village, Gaslamp area, and we even walked to the cruise ship pier when we were ready to board. The only negatives, which were minima, was that the air conditioning really wasn\u2019t very cool and there were no drinking glasses in the room for taking medicine etc. We just used the wine glasses provided. Snack bar and mini bar items were high priced as is typical. We do miss the ice buckets and ice availability that does not seem to be a common amenity anymore.

Beach was great (except late-night on weekends). Different and fun. 3. NOT FOR KIDS. I saw children there \u2013 not good hotel for both kids, at least the 0-17 yr old type. 18-23 yr old would probably love it. Also, not for older cocktail crowd. 4. Weekend scene. Bizarre, and more than a little cheesy. Lobby turns into nightclub. We did not find it as hip as other reviews have said. I guess, if you think hip means a lot of \u201cearly\u201d twenty-somethings. We did not get it. To us it just came across as a bad Club. A Lobby with chairs pushed to side for the local post high-school San Diego crowd. In fairness, the Hotel does a great job in clean-up; by morning, never knew it was there. But I agree with many posters here that it seems that when weekend comes, guests are secondary. 5. Location not bad. We like to walk, so not a problem for us. In daytime, can walk to places \u2013 good 4-5 blocks to Gaslamp or Bay. Little Italy close (but we did not go). At night, not really unsafe, but pretty dead in area. We cabbed it at night. Hillcrest is good area, and Gaslamp not far. House car was not \u201cfree\u201d as some posters here state. We were told would be the same price as Cab. In fact, it was more. 6. Did not eat at Rice, not that impressed by looks but really cannot say. Had drinks at Magnet. Fine.

It sparked my interest after seeing the hotel being featured on the Travel Channel's 'Great Hotels'. I was drawn by the beachy theme & fun, bright colors watching the show, & the real thing was just as great! The hotel itself was a little obscure to find as the building itself isn't too tall, & parking is hard to find (there is valet parking @ the hotel entrance, & parking for a fixed daily fee in the periphery of the building). The check-in was easy, and a bellman helped us with our bags as we entered the disco mirrored elevator, that can only be used with a hotel room key. We had a Wonderful Room on the hotel's top floor, so our views were lovely. I thought the most interesting parts of the room included the chalkboard on the wall area (my bf & i wrote love notes to each other in) & the modern design of the restroom. The shower had a clear glass partition that was engiously designed to be just open enough not to spill water everywhere. But the absolute BEST thing about the room was the BED!!! It was one of the most comfortable beds you could ever sleep on! In fact, the day after, my bf & i even overslept past our already late checkout @ 2 pm (we had the 'Feel the Wuv' package), just because the bed eases you to sleep in a matter of seconds! We also explored other aspects of the hotel. We ate dinner @ Rice, their restaurant. And since it was a weekday (Wednesday), we were one of the first to be seated, and for a long while, were the only customers in the place! The food was great though!!! I would definitely recommend the Braised Kobe Short Ribs for you meat eaters out there!!! And the pricing wasn't too bad at all for a 4 star hotel, at less than $30 per entree. And the most awesome part of dinner were our free desserts from our super nice waitress. I had mentioned on our reservation that it was our 2 year anniversary, so they made our desserts complimentary!!! We decided to try 2 things (try the Really Good Freakin' Chocolate Cake <- that's what it's actually called!), & were happily surprised to see that BOTH were free!!! We then checked out the rooftop bar, Beach, the same night, & had fun listening to good contemporary pop music while sitting next to the bonfire, or cuddling in your very own cabana. Our romance package came with champagne, & it was delivered to our room with chocolate covered strawberries & 2 bottles of champagne on ice! The following day, we had a run in their treadmills equipped with mini tvs & headsets while you exercise (with complimentary water & towels), & this gym overlooked the very cute pool (that was only 4 1/2\" at its deepest, but that didn't stop us from swimming in it : ). Then we had a couple of treatments at their Away Spa at a very special half-off rate (Feel the Wuv), & we both had a fantastic, very relaxing time. My boyfriend had the Muscle Massage metro man service, as i had the Sweet Temptation body treatment. They even offer you a private room with tea & magazines while waiting for your appointment. Both 60 treatments cost less than 1 regular spa treatment at less than $130! The front desk was also very helpful. We got extra toiletries (their Bliss products are awesome!), & they suggested a cute French cafe for lunch just a short couple blocks away from the hotel that also had a nice bakery. Overall, our stay at the W San Diego was very pleasant. Just make sure to check-in with a credit card that has a high balance (over $700 for a less than $400 room), & prepare to pay outrageous fees for valet parking ($28 for an overnight stay), but besides those negatives, this boutique hotel is an overall nice stay for a short getaway.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cA Cool, Fun, Hip and Young Hotel\u201d", "Author": "thekld", "ReviewID": "UR8697355", "Content": "I stay in a lot of Starwoods because I think they have one of the best rewards programs. So I decided to try the W San Diego. This hotel was fun, energetic, hip and very cool. POSITIVES: 1. The bed. This is a given in all Ws which, I believe, all use the \"Hevenly Bed.\" I love this bed, it is pillowed topped and has nice linens and a huge (and heavy) down comforter. It is so comfortable. I was so impressed with this bed the first time I stayed at a W in 2002 that I actually bought one. So its nice to have the same bed in the hotel that I enjoy every night at home. 2. The room. My room was bright and airry with beatiful blue-and-tan color scheme. Very beachy in apparence. It had a beautiful widndow seat covered in cool and funky pillows with wooden shutters and a great view of the city. I especially liked the pillow that looked like a beach ball but complimented the color scheme of the room. 3. The lobby and bar. Its huge and very inviting. Its also very fun, lots of cozy couch and seats to sit in and enjoy the music, and the whole club-like bar scene that goes on in this lobby. Very fun, enegetic and young but also very loud. The second floor overlooking the lobby also has cool places to sit and hang out and people-watch the entire lobby while enjoying a cocktail. 4. The bar on the second floor. Its outside, it has a beach theme with sand, fire pits and cabanas. Very cool evening scene. Lots of fun, friendly wait staff and a really nice place to hang and enjoy a drink or three. NEUTRALS: 1. The bell staff and front desk was average, no one really stood out they kind of just did their job. 2. Location. If your going to stay in San Diego to visit the Gaslamp District at night this hotel is a bit of a walk to the main drag of bars and restaurants. 3. Price. I believe I paid $229/night booked through spg.com. While this is a little on the high side I felt it was worth it. NEGATIVES: 1. The elevators. Extremely SLOW! Maybe I'm impatient but waiting two or three minutes for an elevator to show up on your floor is excessive. 2.

We got a \"whatever,\" don't care nonchalant attitude, and requests were given \"whenever\" hotel employees feel like it. Stayed at the W Hotel for 1 night on Sunday, 9/2/07 (Labor Day weekend). One of the worst experiences ever, especially considering this is supposed to be a renowned, botique hotel. First discovered that you can't self-park; good thing is that there is valet, which is free. Arrived at the hotel at 2:30pm, told our 2 rooms were not available yet, would only be a \"few\" minutes & that they would call us when they were ready. A \"few\" minutes turned into 3 hours!! Every half hour, we would check in at the front desk (we spent our time waiting at the bar) and were told that the rooms were not ready yet. After much prodding, first we were told that that the hotel was overbooked because of rooms booked thru Expedia & that the people who had booked for 2 nights (Saturday thru Monday) were only supposed to be there 1 night, while the hotel itself booked those \"available rooms\" to people who called the hotel directly. Then, we were told the rooms were not ready yet because they were still being cleaned. We were offered a couple of \"free drink\" tickets for the bar to compensate for the wait. They finally gave us $50 off per room. I also found it odd that since the W hotel is part of the Starwood chain hotels, that they did not offer to check with another Starwood hotel, like the Westin to see if they could accomodate us. After talking with a few people, I also found out that the people in the hotel lobby which was literally crowded (could barely find an empty seat) was filled with people because they were also waiting for their rooms. While at the bar, we also ordered some appetizers, which arrived 45 minutes later because 30 minutes after we first ordered, the bartender told us that the kitchen \"accidentally\" did not put in the order; our compensation...a free drink. The rooms themselves were so small; dorm room-style, actually. Floors in both rooms were smelly & damp, like they just steam-cleaned the carpets or something. The windowsill couch had stains on them. When we called for 4 extra towels and a white bedsheet (not the itchy beige blanket), it took 1 hour to arrive and we only got 2 towels and the itchy blanket of course. Apparently the hotel did not have \"any runners\" available that day and the manager was doing all the runs, which I find extremely ridiculous because 1) this is supposed to be a high-end hotel where you expect excellent customer service; 2) I find it odd that a hotel does not have anyone working in the housekeeping department at that time; 3) it was a weekend and especially Labor Day weekend, a holiday weekend, where you expect hotels are usually busy especially in a popular city like San Diego. So, more excuses there. We did receive complimentary cookies and milk with a note apologizing us for not being able to book the 2 rooms next to each other or at least on the same floor (1 room was on the 13th floor, the other on the 12th), unfortunately only 1 room got these cookies, the other room \"lucked out.\" I will definitely warn people to stay away from the W unless there are no other nice hotels to stay at and they don't mind waiting for hours to get something.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cW was comfortable and fun\u201d", "Author": "kkonray", "ReviewID": "UR8522157", "Content": "A girlfriend and I spent two nights at the W to to relax.

One of the first things you're likely to notice as you drive over from the airport is that you're only a block away from the courthouse and county jail. Some of the streets along the way to the Gaslamp district are lined with Bail Bond shops (and drunk / cracked out homeless people). The safest way to get to Gaslamp is to walk down the street from the W is on State Street and then make a left at Broadway. As many of the other reviews have noted, the W is absolutely not for everyone (specifically, families with kids of any age, people over 40, etc.). The average age of the staff appears to be in the mid-20's, and I believe this is the clientele the W is catering to: young people with massive disposable incomes. If you fit in the demographic though, you're very likely to love the stylish decor. The lobby has a 2 - 3 story atrium overlooking a bar area that gets cleared out weekend nights for DJ's to spin music. The \"Beach\" rooftop bar is accessible from the 2nd floor. The elevators are surprisingly dark, lit only by some dim LED lights. We were given a room on the 13th floor (nope, we weren't superstitious). No room upgrade or anything extra for having a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold card (and we arrived at 1 or 2 p.m.; maybe this W doesn't care about loyal SPG customers?). We were able to get a slightly later checkout set for 2:30 p.m., though. The room itself was very stylish. A huge king bed with soft (350-thread count) sheets. A ledge in front of the window has a day bed/cushion where one can lounge there and read or do whatever. The downside to our room was that the carpet appears to have seen better days (definite stains and wear & tear), and the in-room air conditioning unit was really good at keeping one wall cool, but the rest of the room felt stuffy or warmer. The bathroom shower has a European-style window covering half the shower area, with a porthole in the middle so water can still spew out onto the floor depending on how close you are to the shower nozzle. The shower knob controls only the temperature, not the flow of the water. As another review noted, the toilet paper holder is not next to you, it'll be a twist and a reach behind you. Instead of some art or print, I liked the chalk board in the room. Perhaps this room was designed to host weddings and bachelorette parties. Combined internet / local and long distance calls are $25... a rip off, when compared to Marriott's typical $10 all inclusive rate at their resorts and hotels. Internet access (by itself) is $13 for 24 hours. Parking is $28 per day now. If everything you're doing is within San Diego, forget the car and take a cab to & from the airport and around town (or bicycle cab, they hang out in front of the entrance, too). You'll save quite a bit of dollars that way. The attached restaurant, Rice, serves very delicious dinners, but just as in the hotel lobby, there's ubiquitous stylish music in the restaurant as well. We were seated right underneath a speaker so that was a wee bit distracting. Overall, I thought this was a very unique & stylish place to stay, I'm glad I did it this one time, but I don't think I would stay here again. but if you're not doing Priceline or some other super deal, hold onto your wallet, this place is likely to drain a lot of cash. For our two day stay, plus parking and one night's dinner at RICE, my bottom line bill was just over $750.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the W Experience\u201d", "Author": "TCinSF", "ReviewID": "UR8227950", "Content": "Plusses - Shower head - great pressure, very relaxing. - Very comfortable bed and bathrobes. - Beach bar - cool, casual vibe. - Good service. - Hip, modern decor. - Lots of towels and countertop space in the bathroom. - Flat screen TV. - Bliss toiletries.

I know what the W is known for and won't comment on that. Unfortunately, the W San Diego did not meet my expectations of a hotel in general. These were my problems: ROOM I didn't receive my comp upgrade because I'm an SPG Gold member...but i didn't really expect it since I arrived at 7pm. We arrived in our non-smoking room only to find it reeking of smoke. Yes I'm one of those sensitive people who get instant headaches from smoke smell. After a long drive in traffic form LA, the migraine started. We were told the smoking rooms are only on level 5. That's nce and all but I'm not imagining this. The Whatever/Whenever girl came upstairs and said she thought it was ridiculous and she's a smoker. The offered to ionize the room to get rid of the smell (30minutes) or wait for a clean room. We tried the ionize first since they couldn't give us a time frame for a clean room. it didn't work. They had also cleaned a room I suppoe in that 30 minutes because we were moved to another room. Smelled great. We go out to the club, come back, ROOM REEKS OF SMOKE. We thought we were going crazy. The W couldn't move us at 2am and we didn't want to since we had unpacked everything. They could only offer us a candle. So my morning was miserable because I had the headache from smoke, the fragrant candle, and the wine I drank the night before. They didn't have any tylenol on hand but they would get it for a $12 fee plus the tylenol cost. i decided to let it heal naturally. They finally moved us the next day to another room. This one was good to go and we remained there for the rest of the weekend. The shower drained clogged as well but we were tired or the issues. we could not be in the room until 3pm. which leads me to what we did during the late morning and afternoon. POOL I foolishly booked a hotel with intentions to bask in the sun by the pool when the hotel website never showed a direct image of the pool area. The pool is ridiculously small. There were only 7 lounge chairs. We took sick pleasure in watching guests come into the pool area and look puzzled...bewildered. it was really funny because we did the same thing. Of course all the chairs were taken because there are only 7. They try and trick you too by putting tall mirrors on the adjacent wall so it looks like there are 2 mini pools. It was also funny to see people walk that way and realize the people they see were themselves. This was all funny because we did the same thing :) The poolside service was slow and we needed to remind the server that we wanted menus, that we ordered food, that we needed water. I don't know why she just didn't right stuff down. There were some annoying kids in the pool too...it was extra annoying since you couldn't slink away to a corner of the ppol and be to yourself. The pool was too small. Annoying kids....not hotels fault...small pool...hotel's fault. So we left the pool to go get a quickie massage. SPA Very small as well...don't expect a great spa experience. My girl Jennifer/Jessica was very relaxing...which was good since I needed it. But again...don't expect more than a nice treatment...no real amenities here. Did we eat at the W? yes we did FOOD 1) Rice was great on decor. we had breakfast. It was pricey but that's typical of a hotel. I enjoyed it but my order was messed up the first go round. I don't know why waiters like to test themselves by not writing things down. But i really did like my breakfast. 2) poolside food was good. we had the kobe mini burgers and they were great. the sexy fries...not so much...skip those unless you need the kill a fry urge. the chicken wings were ok...but im not a big fan of sweet flavors...but my friends liked them. we had an issue getting our dessert. it wasn't on the pool menu but they said we could have whatever whenever from the regular menu...guess that's not really true. the pool girl kept coming back and saying \"let me check on it\" an hour later when we needed to leave for our massages, she said the cook never started it. ????? very strange...i don't know how she didn't realize this. 3) in room dining was ok. the best thing was teh banana creme brulee. the grilled cheese with tomato and basil wasn't melted. the crab snadwich was good. too much bread though. 4) bar drinks were good. they carry Effen black cherry vodka which is a good vodka. I mix it with diet coke. We tried the Kiss N Fly and Porn Star...both pleasant. I preferred the Kiss N Fly. The GOODS All this being said...this is how the W compensated for their shortcomings: 1) sweet bellman (Welcome Ambassador) Eric. He was there for all our room changes, check in, and check out. He might have requested that so we saw a friendly face. But I'm glad he got our tip money. 2) they W comped us one night (as they should have). we didn't ask for it. they gave it when we needed to change rooms for the 3rd time. but if they didn't, i was gonna ask. 3) the pool girl gave us 2 free drinks for the dessert issue 4) the W gave us 3 free drinks the first night while we waited to have our room ionized. 5) they smiled through every issue even though it felt like they wanted us to go back home. Sorry! i'm paying you. alot. the W isn't one of the cheaper Starwood properties. 6) the fun atmosphere in the lobby, the decor...but that is expected of all W hotels.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, OH", "Title": "\u201cSlick Ticket\u201d", "Author": "GiggaMan", "ReviewID": "UR8057214", "Content": "This joint is the TOPS.

Just about everything about the room was great. The lobby is beautiful and is like an oasis when you enter. The outside beach bar was great for hanging out. Groovy lounge music is played throughout the hotel - nice touch. The gym is great, because it is essentially outside - had a lovely workout. The pool area was nice, but very small.

This happened on our last night only. We called the front desk & they sent security up within a few minutes. It took awhile for them to settle. This, of course, can & does happen at all hotels & requires a bit of luck. The last annoyance comes from street noise, which is no worse than any other downtown hotel in San Diego.

First and foremost, it's important that you know what you're getting when you book a stay at a W hotel. This is not the Hyatt Regency. If you are looking for quiet, dimly lit oak bars, antique looking room furnishings or for anything conservative, you should look elsewhere. The W is all about being trendy from the lobby bar to the rooms to the staff. You're going to get bright, vibrant colors (in the San Diego W, it's a blue and yellow color scheme). If you have a problem with techno music, rock music or rap music, look elsewhere. If seeing people consume alcohol is an issue for you, look elsewhere. The W caters to a mostly hip, upscale crowd, business travelers and the like. Hotel: Many have said they had trouble with parking here but I had no issues. Hotel is all valet (maybe it wasn't in the past). You drive up, you get out, you hand the guy your keys, he hands you a ticket and you're done. Easy. Took me 30 seconds from driving up to having my bags out of the car and on my way. Decour is ultra-modern. Bright colors. Trendy lounge/bar on the first floor that shares space with the lobby. On weekend nights it will be crowded with well dressed hipsters drinking martinis. Gym and small pool on the 2nd floor. A few free weights but mostly cardio machines. The tredmills, bikes and elipticals all had in-console TVs and radios (and some of them even worked). Staff: If the cool college kids who live down the street bother you, so will the staff. I found them all nice and very helpful. When I called down for my car it never took more than 15 minutes for it to arrive. Room service was fast and polite. After being on the road for business for nearly two months straight, I didn't feel like leaving the room one night and the room servince menu didn't have what I wanted, so I called Whatever/Whenever and had them go pick me up some Thai food from a place a few blocks away. Had my food in 40 minutes (shorter than the room service wait on a Friday night) for a couple of extra bucks. Room: Great. A little small but that's typical with W rooms. Well decorated in bright blues and yellows. 36\" flat panel TV. DVD player in room if you brought movies with you or you can check them out from the hotel library. Excellent toiletries. Cant beat the lemon/sage body wash and lotion. Restaraunt/Bar: Three, three, three bars! Lounge bar is attached to the lobby and has a few stools and lots of couch/lounge space with games like chess, checkers, etc. This place is pretty popular and expensive. Magnet bar is down the hall and worth checking out. Beach bar is up from the pool on the 2nd floor past the pool and has a sand floor, fire pit, hanging chairs, and palm trees. It is usually packed in good weather. Was little chilly during my stay and I found the beach bar to have the funnest people and best bartenders in the hotel. Other: The W is not cheap. I travel for work, so I don't care because it all gets expensed. You are going to get hit up for everything here. Bottle of Voss water? Paying. Parking? 25 bucks a night. Internet access? 12 bucks a day. Pack of M&Ms from the mini-bar? 4 bucks. Be smart. Clean everything out of the mini-bar, stack it on top, and fill it with your own snacks and drinks. When you leave, put their stuff back in.

Since arriving, we'd always entered the hotel through the more convenient side door, always a doorman there to hold the door open & welcome us.

When we responded that we were hotel guests (we are in our mid 40's & had our 13-year-old daughter in tow, clearly not barhopping), he rudely replied that it didn't matter & we had to abide by the rules. His aggressive behavior and words frightened our daughter, so we stopped at the front desk to complain (after entering through the main door as forced, of course). The clerk said that the W had no rules preventing us from entering through the side door as usual, and that Norm's behavior was inappropriate. At our request, she promised to have the hotel manager call us. Days later and still no word. Unacceptable for this property. Needless to say, we checked out and spent our next 3 nights at the Westin Horton Plaza. The staff there was wonderful, our room was larger and the location was better overall.

During the third night of my stay there was no hot water coming in any of the top floor rooms.

Desk area was large and had no troubles with the high speed internet connection. I took a long nap in the chaise with an extremely soft blanket. The bathroom was also spacious with a great soaking tub (perfect both pre and post race) and some nice bath salts.

Having stayed at other branches of the W, I really enjoyed the light and airiness of the decor and loved having a wall of floor to ceiling windows and the wooden blinds. Very comfortable! Service from valet, check in and room service was always friendly and prompt. Everyone made a point of greeting me and inquiring about my race, my stay, etc... Room service was prompt --- the food was presented nicely and was good but not excellent --- just what I would expect from room service --- although I found the menu to be a little limited. I did eat at Rice one morning for breakfast and my food was very good and very plentiful plus the service was appropriately friendly. I did not take time to enjoy the lobby (the Living Room), the bar (Magnet) or the outdoor space (Beach). I did peek in at the pool which is laughably small --- more like a plunge pool than anything else. The gym (Sweat) seemed well equipped as well. I did stop by Beach (with the warm sand floor) on Sunday evening after the race but did not stay as I didn't feel particularly comfortable alone but would definitely return with my spouse. Perhaps, the trendiness has died down, but I never experienced any overwhelming crowds. The location, for me, was ideal. Easy in/easy out for the airport and for the other locations I visited during my long weekend. I did not find the neighborhood to be unsafe or unsavory. It is a very short walk to the Horton Plaza, to the trolley stations and to the waterfront. For what it is worth, I did spend some time with friends who were staying at the Sheraton Marina and found that location, while convenient, was far from relaxing. I was much happier with my hotel selection. My one regret was on the morning of my check out as I truly was disappointed to be leaving and returning home to Boston.

It was truly unlike any other hotel stay I'd ever experienced. It's one thing to stay in a nice hotel with an aiming-to-please concierge and staff, but if you couple that with some incredible nightlife at the hotel on top of the wonderful decor in the rooms, then, well, you've got a happening place. Such is the W in San Diego. One quick caveat to the previous reviewers who characterized the area as \"dead\" after working hours--this is not the case at all. The Gaslamp district is just six blocks away, which is either a ten to fifteen minute walk or a $4 cab ride. It's not like you're having to drive to La Jolla (twelve miles north) to find something to do. Sometimes it seems that people expect several restaurants, bars & shops within one block of a hotel. A tad bit unreasonable, eh? Also unreasonable: the previous reviewer who said that the exterior of the hotel was \"blah.\" First of all, who cares? And second of all, it was not \"blah.\" How many other hotels have a fifteen-story waterfall projected on the side of the building? At any rate, the hotel staff was amazing. With the exception of a phantom $23 minibar purchase (which was taken care of immediately) and a slight miscommunication with the hotel lining us up a ride to the airport, everything else was spot on. Do keep in mind that I'm part of the younger crowd, and that is what the W is angling for with their business plan. The interior is very modern and sleek, as are the rooms. The focal point of the rooms is a room-length desk (odd, but it works). The beds are extremely comfortable--down-filled pillowtop mattresses, fluffy pillows, soft sheets, the works. The most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in, bar none. The W Hotel also has a \"Whatever, Whenever\" service (just push the red button on the phone) that will pretty much get you \"whatever, whenever.\" Need a shaving kit at 4:00 a.m.? No problem. Want room service at any hour of the day or night? No problem. Need a reservation at a local restaurant, or need help in finding one? No problem. Need tickets to a local show or concert? No problem. The concierge guys (especially Chuck, who did an excellent job in securing us reservations), will go out of their way to find you what you need. One final thing to remember is that the hotel, on Friday & Saturday nights, essentially turns into a nightclub. The lobby, known as the \"Living Room,\" turns into a dance club complete with DJ (there's a bar at one end, opposite the front door). It was kind of odd on Friday night to watch people trying to check in amid the chaos of the dance club atmosphere. If you are a hotel \"resident,\" they will give you a wristband so that you don't have to stand in line to get up to the second-floor rooftop Beach bar. Beach is outside and is complete with sand and a copper fire pit and private cabanas. We spent a lot of time up there, just hanging out. We did not get around to checking out the restaurant Rice or the other bar in the hotel, Magnet. All in all, it was a great trip, and I'd definitely stay at the W San Diego again. Just keep in mind that it skews towards the younger crowd, although even though the lobby may be a raging dance club, you wouldn't know it in the rooms--completely silent. Overall, it's a good place to stay for the price and it is convenient to downtown and the area attractions.

The valet staff was quick and efficient. The price for valet was a high ($26 per day), but if you plan on going in and out a lot then it would appeal to you.

In fact, we wondered if this hotel was for us and soon found out it definitely was. The rooms are spacious and decorated in cool blues. There are chalk boards in the rooms, which is quite interesting. The bathrooms have ample space; the only suggestion I have is to add towel racks. The location is very convenient. Horton Plaza is a 10-minute walk; Seaport Village is a 15-minute walk; and you can even walk to Petco Park which is a very pleasant 25-minute walk. We weren't expecting to walk as much as we did but the hotel was so centrally located. The lobby, AKA \"Living Room\" turns into a night club on Fridays and Saturdays. The music is urban hip-hop and the vibe is definitely hip. I have been talking about this hotel non-stop and have recommended it to 2 co-workers. The weekend we stayed was the weekend of the Comic Convention so the rooms were $399, but we were able to use our Starwood points.

Also, the guests here were extremely friendly; everyone at this hotel was here to have a good time, and we talked to a load of people at the hotel lobby bar (a great place to come back to for a nightcap, though not a quiet one). The rooms were smallish but very nice & different from your average upper-range hotel, with the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in in any hotel anywhere. The rooms were pretty modern, which we found refreshing. If you're looking for a B&B or Marriott-type atmosphere, skip this place.

Let me start off with the good...my husband and I loved the decor of the hotel, we loved our room (Kool Korner) and bathroom and we didn't mind the nightclub in the lobby. We had no trouble getting from outside to the elevators and we had no problem with the noise or the people. The only thing we didn't love about the hotel is the service. We arrived at 3:30 (30 mins. after check-in) and were told out room wasn't ready. The woman at the front counter checked our luggage (one piece) and asked for our cell phone number. She said would call us when our room was ready. In the meantime, she said we could a drink at the bar and our room would be ready shortly. We ended paying for our own drinks and after an hour of waiting for our room (we wouldn't have went up and checked on the room earlier but we were trying not to get worked up over it) my husband finally checked on it. The same girl was working at the counter and said our room was ready. She didn't apologize for not calling nor did she apologize us waiting so long for the room. She did tell us though that our luggage would be sent up to our room. We got into our room (loved it!) and then proceeded to wait another hour for our luggage to come up. We ended up calling the front desk trying to locate our luggage. The gentleman that answered the phone apologized profusely and said he would send it right up. We waited another hour and my husband finally had to go downstairs and get our luggage himself. Since the front desk manager wasn't around (go figure) some other supervisor apologized and said he would have front desk manager credit us $50. It turns out, our luggage was in the closet next to the front desk and sitting right there in the front for anyone who opened the closet doors. Before we left, we filled out our comment card and took the review online. You would think after taking both of those surveys, someone would have contacted us and apologized again but no. I finally ended up emailing Starwood about a month later complaining about the service. I did get a call a few days later and the employee and I played phone tag for a few weeks. The one thing that upset me was that whenever I left him a voicemail, it took him 3, sometimes 7, days to get back to me. When my last voice mail was never answered, I emailed Starwood again. This time the gentleman I was playing phone tag with emailed me and actually had the gall to tell me there was some confusion as to who called who last. He did apologize again and said that he would credit our SPG account 10,000 pts. which is good for one night free. I know, some of you are probably wondering why we waited around for an hour each time something was going wrong. The reason why we waited is because we do not like to be the people breathing down the employee's necks (even when we pay $350/night) and we really do not normally complain about anything. We are pretty mellow, go with the flow people. I guess we learned our lesson. I think what also made me frustrated with everything is that this was the only trip my husband and I could afford after buying our first house last summer. And look how it turned out! I do also have to say that we were given a 4pm check-out but that was before everything started happening and I specifically asked for it. I would have to say that if the girl we encountered at the front desk took care of us better, we probably would not have been as upset as we were.

The hotel's elevator's are lit by 4 dim halogen spots, the elevator lobby has videos of serenity images throughout and the only way to distinguish between a hip guest and the concierge is the small metal \"W\" pinned on his collar. Is it expensive? Yes. You are in San Diego in the heart of downtown. Breakfast is expensive and drinks cost more than a 6 pack of Keystone at your local grocery store. Is it pretentious? No. For the most part, the staff are hip people who want to please and make this a unique experience. If you want the Four Seasons, it isn't. EVERYTHING screams \"hip\" so loudly that it almost becomes overbearing. Is it spacious? I can't speak to every room. We had a beautiful room on the 18th floor. UPGRADE to the Kool Korner Room. It was huge, nicely appointed and beautiful. We loved the linens and towels so much, we are buying a complete set for the house. Is it worth the price? Depends on you. If you are hip...yes.

Not in a million years. PETS: The W has a policy regarding pets. It is a VERY generous policy. They encourage you to bring your animals with you and charge you accordingly. But, this W is in the middle of downtown with VERY FEW places to walk the dog. While it is friendly and accomodating, you literally have to walk past 10 homeless and sleeping individuals to get to the nearest grass area which just happens to be in front of the downtown jail/court house.

I read the reviews and thought that the place would be okay. The staff was friendly and very attentive. When we checked into our room what a surprise! The room was very small. I requested one bed but got two. There was very little room to walk around the room. The bathroom was tiny. They could probably do without the large desk that takes up 1/4 of the room. If the room was a little bigger or had only one bed the place would probably be okay. We checked out of the hotel quickly (Starwood Preferred Guest Customer) at no charge and checked into the Westin Horton Plaza with a much bigger room and more amentities.", "Date": "June 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1784484", "Content": "I don't know what is wrong with the people who posted negative reviews.. My fiancee and I stayed at the W last weekend and it was great!! The concierce was great, the room was great and the food was great.. I don't know what the regular rooms are like but anyone who has stayed at a W knows that you should always get a Kool Korner King. The room was spotless..Huge bathroom and a great bed.. It is very close to the Gaslamp and all of the major attractions. They also have a complimentary town car service that is available to hotel guests for use in the downtown area. Yes it is expensive, but you get what you pay for.

First, the positives: the location is great; the place is very stylish; the staff is eager to please; the bars (both lobby and the \"beach\") are usually busy with a youngish good-looking crowd; great beds; DVD and CD players in rooms. The Negatives: Tiny rooms, small \"valet only\" parking lot; bad heating/cooling system; staff can be annoyingly cloying; tiny, open-air gym; tiny pool; ridiculously expensive. If you have been to a W Hotel before you know the formula; I will not belabor the point. Suffice it to say that when the main consideration is style, other things suffer. The parking situation is terrible. There is not enough room for all the cars when the place gets busy, and the \"valet only\" nature means that you cannot just go down to your car to recieve an item; you must have the valet go get your car for you because you are not allowed in the lot. There are no overnight lots that I could find in the immediate vicinity, so this is a pain. There is plenty of staff, perhaps too many, and they are so in your face with their pleasantness and eagerness that it is a little over the top in my opinion; my girlfriend and I were constantly rolling our eyes at their false attempts at camraderie. Undoubtedly, some people like this treatment - to each his own. The rooms, unless you pay big bucks for a corner King, are New York sized (read: tiny). Ditto the pool and the gym. Also, the gym is completely open to the elements: when it is cold or rainy or windy (yes, these things happen in SD!), so are you. The CD player in my room was not up to snuff like the one at W Seattle, but I love the DVD player in every room. As for the heat and air-con unit: this thing was rattling all night even though we had it off. And we could hear everything the people in a neighboring room said through the shared ducting system. Yikes. My main issue with this place is the price. The rooms are costly, and so is every little thing there. My continental breakfast was nearly $30 when all was said and done.", "Date": "March 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest service anywhere!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1667247", "Content": "Lori and I had the best time!
