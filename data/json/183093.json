Normally we stay at the Sutton Place Hotel but this time I decided to stay at the Town Inn for nostagic reasons. Thirty years ago when he was six we stayed at the Town Inn and had a wonderful time. The rooms were good, the location central and the swimming pool was fantastic. This time I checked the hotel web site to learn that the hotel had been completely refurbished in the last year. Because of the web site and particularly the photographs of the updated suites we booked a two bedroom suite for two nights. Upon arrival we were informed that all the balconies on the north side of the property were under renovation. Not only were many of the balconies missing there was a warning posted in the lobby that there could be considerable demolition noise between 9:00 and 4:00. We were given a suite on the opposite side of the building with assurances that the noise would not be a factor. When we arrived at our supposedly refurbished suite we were greeted with a suite that had definitely seen much better days. The room was not properly cleaned. The floors, window sills and furniture were dusty. The kitchen counter was badly damage as if an electrical appliance had shorted out and burned. Both the range and fridge were old and dirty. There was a large closet in the suite that contained four old ripped and filty mattresses and box springs that were obviously being stored there instead of in the garbage where they belonged. If that was not enough, the room had a definite musty odour. When I complained to the front desk they offered to upgrade us to two one bedroom suites as no other two bedroom units were available. Unfortunately the new suites were on the construction side of the building and in one of them the balcony had been demolished but the door from the living area was not only unlocked but open. A small child could easily have wandered through the open door and fallen 15 stories! While these new rooms were somewhat better they also had a distinct unpleasant ordour as did the hallways and elevators throughout the hotel. Needles to say we refused to stay and checked out immediately. This property should close its doors until they have truly refurbished and demolition construction is complete. The amazing thing is that they are charging $189/night plus $20 for underground parking. So you might be asking the question:\"What did you do?\" it's simple. I called the Sutton Place and booked into a two bedroom suite for $262/night (parking included). Something I should have done in the first place. You may or may not be able to home again but you should defintely never go to the Town Inn.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "windsor, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBED BUGS!!!!\u201d", "Author": "tbrat2001", "ReviewID": "UR123419011", "Content": "I stayed at the Town Inn Suites on December 30, 2011 - January 2, 2012.

But the surprises didn't end there... the kitchen utensils were dirty and just sitting in the living room we felt dirty and we had only been there for a couple hours. The next morning I woke up to find a bed bug on the sheet that I had just been cuddling with. I jumped up and ran to the washroom in total disgust. My friend and I checked the bed and found 5 more bugs, some were brown and some were red, which means they had fed. Ughhh just the memory of it grosses me out and its 3 weeks later. I called the front desk to let them know what we had found and asked them how they were going to handle this; since now I was terrified that I was going to bring them home. The front desk girl spoke to her manager and called me back. They upgraded us to a luxury suite on th 20th floor (which meant a minimum wait of 15 mins for the elevator cause it was so slow) and gave us a free breakfast (which sucked and took way to long for them to cook and when it finally came out the bacon was burnt) and they gave us money and detergent to do our laundry and then garbage bags to put all our clean clothes in. So much for site seeing that day, we spent the whole day doing laundry. Hell I could of done that at home. lol The housekeeping surpervisor came with us to check out the luxury suite. We lifted the mattress to make sure there were no bugs and thank god there was not. The supervisor went on to explain that the rooms on the lower floors are sometimes rented out a month at a time and the people that rent those rooms dont always tell the hotel if they find bugs. I dont care what she said... it was obvisious that, that room had not been cleaned or checked before they rented it out to the next people because if it had... housekeeping would of seen those bugs.

The balcony's were a little sketchy and as soon as we got in our room I was the first one to jump in the shower and about 5 minutes in the water went cold. Needless to say I had to cut my shower short and the 2 other girls I was in the room with had about enough time to get wet and get out. We had to call down to the front desk to let them know that our closet door wasn't hanging anymore. It was resting up against the wall and we didn't want them to think we trashed the place.

It has a lot going for it: central location; suites that are like little apartments with lots of rooms and equipped, 'breakfast' (continental) included; pool and exercise room; free Internet off the lobby (charged in the room). What it lacked was cleanliness. The coffee pot and a cup had not been washed. The bed sheet had been used (lipstick stain and hair), which, because I was exhausted from travel and arrived near midnight and didn't get to bed until around 2 am, I didn't notice until the next day and yes, major ICK!). The towels were suspect. I think this was not the hotel's fault but the maid's. I believe this person took an easy route and either forgot to clean this room (though the bed was made) or the previous occupant left early or worst case the maid was trying to 'get away' with something. I didn't take the chance so for my 3 nights I put the 'no maid service' on the door, preferring to make my own bed rather than feel that it was all iffy. The hotel was good about this, so I can't fault them. It's an inexpensive hotel for Toronto and you won't likely get these prices and amenities elsewhere in the city.

The well meaning excuse given to me by the front desk was that \"probably the last occupant had been a long term resident and they hadn't had a chance to refurbish\". They were obliging in getting me a knife and plate, but a colander, I was told, they didn't have. For what you get it is very bad value. Paying extra for the internet also adds insult to injury. One plus point, is the staff, who were helpful and courteous, but sadly there is only so much they can do, and short of learning how to fit new kitchens, it's just not going to be enough. There is no quick fix to this place. The whole building from the parking lot, to the elevators, to the balconies, needs to be re-done. A final note: The TownInn website is shockingly misleading with it's pictures and i seriously doubt the efficacy of some of the reviews which gave this place high marks.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't be more dissappointed\u201d", "Author": "azephyrgirl", "ReviewID": "UR115900943", "Content": "The front desk clerks were not friendly or helpful.

And now the specifics: We got a package on Travelzoo which included full hot breakfast (otherwise $8.95 each per day), parking with in/out priviliges (otherwise $20 a day) and free wi-fi internet (included for everyone I believe. It was $119 a night. Free or even low-priced parking in a nice hotel in Toronto is non-existent...breakfasts at similar or nicer hotels cost roughly $16 - $20 per person, and internet can run $10-$13 per day.) So...in terms of what was offered it really was the best value in Toronto...however... 1) Room (see photos) - I guess it was clean but it didn't feel clean. There were holes in the carpet. Wallpaper was peeling off of the walls in the bathroom and in the space just outside the bathroom between the bedroom and living room. I guess the couches in the living room were updated as they were a dark brown leather kind of material, but the rest of the furniture in the place looked old. The air conditioning control unit was detached from the wall. The sliding closet door in the bedroom wasn't attached well and felt like it would fall off if we actually used it. The balcony was not clean. Couple of scuff marks on the walls. Kitchen had old appliances. This was billed as an \"updated\" room. I guess it's possible that it was 'updated' far in the past. Didn't feel updated. 2) Wi-Fi - Such an important feature for us when traveling so we can check in with home without racking up international roaming minutes....We also use the net to check on locations we're visiting and buy event tickets, make reservations etc during the vacation...Typically we use the laptop in the bedroom...DSL router was in the living room and my laptop didn't connect at first...called the front desk and they routed me to an offsite technical support help desk. Wow...I'm in the hotel for 5 minutes and I'm now engaged in a technical support call. Eventually I unplugged the DSL router and brought it into the bedroom and plugged it in there...lucky I knew how to arrange the router, phone line filter etc to make it work...from that point the signal worked as we needed it where we wanted it. You'd think though that, in such a tiny one bedroom apartment, there wouldn't be a signal issue going between 2 rooms. 3) Breakfast - I guess they have no-breakfast packages, continental breakfast packages, and fuil hot breakfast packages...I read the reviews here about the twisty hall way to find the breakfast room so I was prepared for it...that didn't really bother me...the restaurant actually shares an entrance with the unique Noir restaurant (dining in the dark experience...blind waiters) so if you wanted to avoid the twisty hall via the lobby you could enter from the street and pretend you going to the nice restaurant. The continental was muffin, fruit and coffee. The full hot breakfast had several items on it but it was limited...no cheese to add to omelettes, either brown or white toast as opposed to any other bread choices....the potatoes were very good...the rest was fine but after a few days we just wanted to feel like we were on vacation at breakfast so we went to the Sunset Grille around the corner on Bloor street (which has a $3.99 breakfast special.)...plenty of other breakfast options in the neighborhood...if you really don't care and just need fuel to go...then this was fine...though if dining is an important part of you vacation experience..then not so fine. 4) Elevator - Not as bad in our experience as in previous reviews. Of all the times we rode up and down to and from the 18th floor...one time we had to wait about 5 minutes...all the other times it came very quickly. (Funnily I was a little disappointed it wasn't awful as I was prepared to get out the stop watch on my fine and time the lengthy elevator waits to report back her...but it was a non-issue.) 5) Staff - Everyone we dealt with was very friendly and nice...any issues the hotel has is not their fault. 6) Location - Decent enough...not exactly downtown (I think they call it mid-town.) Very close to Bloor Yonge Subway which intersects 2 lines and can get you anywhere. relatively easy walk to ROM museum....some restaurants and pubs close by...I think we would have rather stayed closer to downtown though. At the end of the day it met all of our needs...though with 4 star hotels downtown available on Hotwire and Priceline for less than $100 a night, I wish we'd done that and just paid for the parking, and internet and enjoyed breakfast on the town.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSickening and Repulsive.

The Town Inn is a remodeled apartment building, >25 floors. It is between the Gay District and Yorkville.

The only complaints I have is that the advertised \"free\" breakfast is an extra $9.95/guest. In addition, as long as you never go anywhere other than your hotel room or the lobby it is safe. It is a long dark twisted route to the eating room. Also an elevator was not working during my stay, and i had to wait almost 20 minutes for one. As an aside, I had left my ipod 16 GB touch in the hotel in the bed. I didnt realize this until I was back at my house, and I must commend the staff, because instead of keeping it and pretending they didnt find it, I called, and after a few verification questions, they confirmed that they had it and would come pick it up.

You can go do a quick grocery shopping right around the corner and cook in your room, everything you need to use is right in the room. Comfortable beds, little balcony but nice. They just did a little upgrade and a wonderful job they did. Staff very friendly and helpful. Nice Pool, and workout room. A parking garage with a heated ramp so easy to get the car out in the winter, but a charge for parking. There is parking around the area but i felt better having the car parked at the Hotel. Either way you would have to pay for parking. It is a little further up on Younge street but its a nice walk to the Eaton Center, with all kinds of shops and restaurants to look at as you walk down the road. If walking is a problem just around the corner is the subway. When we get there we don't see our car till we are ready to leave. I felt safe walking around in the area. I highly suggest if your looking for a comfortable place, downtown, and affordable this is the place to stay. I really think once you stayed you will come back.

We were checked in by the hotel's General Manager, who did not smile once and informed us that if our room received more than one noise complaint that we would be kicked out. Definitely not 'legendary' or 'warm' customer service that I would hope for from a hotel in Downtown Toronto. Although the hotel suite was large (as mentioned above), the room was extremely dated. The wallpaper was bubbling and even missing in some areas (had been ripped) and the kitchen appliances looked like they have been around for a few decades. My main complaint is about the underground parking. I parked my car in the lowest level of the 'secured' underground parking which you needed a swipe card to enter. When I returned to my car in the morning, the antenna had been removed from my roof, and my front grill had been completely ripped off... with a piece of my bumper removed.

I was confident that my car would be fine as this was a secured parking garage. Very disappointed.

The hotel informed me they would contact me within a few hours. 2 days later, still no response.

We aren't a particularly fussy bunch so it wasn't a great problem but for those who are interested, the issues we did encounter were: ants in the kitchen (dealt with by hotel staff no problem), unclean bathroom on arrival (wasn't in too bad condition and didn't take us long to clean up but had the maid spent an extra 5 mins in there all would have been fine) and one of the bedrooms didn't have its own radiator and relied on a vent (between the two bedrooms) pumping warm air to the other. Not ideal for privacy but again not a big problem. Aside from the cleanliness issues outlined above, we generally found the hotel a good place to stay. The bed's were comfortable, the location good, the local area safe and hotel staff (mostly) helpful. Quite a good option for a family travelling on a budget. Again, for those who are interested, the gym area and business centre (one computer in quite a public space) aren't upto much but the pool was handy for a quick swim and not too cold. In fact, had a swim most mornings.

The one bedroom suite was our choice as it had a pullout. The bedroom was just like the picture as was the sitting area and kitchen. The decor is somewhat tired but when on holiday how much time do you spend in a room anyways to be looking at the decor? I went away to do things so this suited us just fine. The bathtub had been painted in spots yes,the hall carpets a wee bit tired,the elevators slow but lets face it you get what you pay for. There was an old mattress in the closet for which we were grateful for as the pullout was small enough ,more like a small double really. We had a dining table for 4 and a kitchen table for 2 which was great as the other 3 hotels we stayed at had 1 or 2 chairs or the 4 of us so we ate in shifts! The T.V.s worked fine,the phone was expensive as tax is added to all calls regarless of the duration. The internet is expensive but it is everywhere else too,in Florida it was nearly $5.00/hour so $10 a day is not bad. I would not bother bringing my laptop again as it was usless to me in the end. The pool is a salt water pool and was a welcome treat after a hot day,towels are down at the pool and it is generally empty. We brought drinks from our room and sat on the outside deck while the children swam,what more could you want. The elevators are no slower than most apartments considering the volume of people who stay. The housekeeping staff keep the cleaning trolley in the hall and we asked that we not be disturbed for the week and we cleaned ourselfs,we simply went to the staff and got was required for the day. If I was staying again I would bring some basic essential items,dishwashing liquid,a cloth for dishwashing, tin foil,fabreeze(it was expensive there) and powder for washing your clothes as there are machines. I would also check the room upon arrival should there be anything you may require and the staff will get it for you. When I needed a can opener it did take some time to get one,I needed a larger pan and a roasting dish would have been nice too,so if you have an idea just make up your list before hand. There is a Metro shop down church which is a larger supermarket that I discovered on my last night which is cheaper than the shop on Isobella. The main subway is within walking distance beside the chemist and other shops. There is a pub just up the street that has nightly specials,I had a quesadea with fries and a pint for $11. plus tax,not a bad deal. The LCBO is the off licence located at the subway too. The air con was loud but it was at every hotel I stayed at and it did drown out the noise of the city so this was nearly comforting to kids who are not used to the noise level. All in all I would go back after having stayed in other cheap places in Toronto this was the best of the cheap for us, a friend travelled with me and she too would stay there again. I guess I feel a little defensive of the place as some reviews paint it as a hovel to be avoided at all costs. I don't bother renting a car any more as parking is generally $18-25 a night plus the rental,plus insurance,plus parking charges while out and tolls. It is cheaper to take taxis or public transport.

The carpeting in our room was stained, the counter in the kitchenette was stained, the volume button on the rickety TV set was broken so volume was very low, tiles in the bathroom were chipped and broken.

There was a piece of litter under the bedside table, clearly visible. On the positive side, the staff were very helpful and friendly. And to be fair, we've stayed in much nicer rooms at this hotel. I'd recommend asking for a clean, renovated room; maybe you'll have better luck than we did.

One of my fondest memories is sitting on the balcony at night while an almost full moon hung over the city. --- The location. Being two blocks from the intersection of Yonge and Bloor (the busiest intersection in the city) was extremely convenient for walking around or taking the subway. --- The hot complimentary breakfast. Love those sausages! -- The people at the front desk. They were very friendly and helpful. I just wish they knew more about the local restaurants, however. What I didn't like: --- Our unit only had one bathroom and no microwave. --- While the rooms were nice and in very good condition, the outside balcony had peeling paint, etc. --- The wait for the elevators. I think I spent more time waiting for the elevators than I ever did waiting for a subway! Overall, I was very pleased and would stay there again.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Town Inn Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d183093-Reviews-Town_Inn_Suites-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$99 - $233*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">620 Church Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M4Y 2G2</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "183093", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0f/d7/0fd761b2497c65aea4164515f5be82151large.jpg"}}
