On pulling up I thought at first that the taxi driver was stopping for directions, not realising the hotel was next to us. It is situated on a main street and an alleyway. Inside I was not reassured by a small lobby, tired and uninspiring. On being shown to my room I was likewise less than unimpressed by tired furniture, poor wallcoverings and a bathroom that showed signs of poor workmanship. To find my double aspect room had windows overlooking the main road with lots of trams and traffic whilst the second aspect opened directly behind the outside bar, and I really mean the windows opened onto the area behind the bar, I could reach out my hand and get a beer if I wanted one, you could imagine how I felt having spent the last 18 hours travelling. However the restaurant/brakfast room was lovely, even though the breakfast was less than inspiringly presented. The quality of the breakfast was fine. The hotel staff were all excellent, working hard to make you welcome and feel your custom was valued, with no eye to tips etc. The location is fabulous for all of the main attractions of Istanbul (Sultanahmet area) meaning a stay of 3-4 days is all that is required. I found my initial concerns about the hotel fading away as the days passed and realised that actually it was clean, comfortable and run by people who wanted to make your stay a happy one. As my wife was joining me after 2 nights I moved out to a previous reservation paying twice the rate that I had been paying in the BW Sophia. The hotel, whilst lovely, was within 300 metres and had a smaller room. I hope this is not considered too negative a review because in all honesty if I was told I was staying there again on business I would be quite content.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cPractical position, however rather noisy.\u201d", "Author": "Rossotraveller", "ReviewID": "UR117570420", "Content": "People working at the Saint Sophia are very kind.

Literally next to the Ayasofia (Hagia Sophia) and the room had a small balcony terrace looking directly at the Hagia Sophia. Blue Mosque, Basilica Cystern and Topkapi are very very close. If you come to Istanbul and see only one thing make sure you see Topkapi Palace. Truly amazing. The suite in Best Western is a decent size. Queen size bed, lots of space to walk around. The ceiling on top floor is low and many times I bumped my head. The area above the bed has some strange cloth arrangement over it. A nice touch but unnecessary for my taste. Decent size wardrobe for storing your clothes and a safe too. It had an iron already but I had to ask for an ironing board. The TV is small but has hundreds of satellite channels for you in every language you could ever want - English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Afghan, Iranian, Turkish etc etc. That can be a problem because you have to scroll through hundreds of channels to find the one you want. But BBC is channel 1 which is very useful. The Jacuzzi / Hot Tub is nice and large. And they clean it every day if you are using it. The toiletries provided are decent too. They gave me a shaving kit and Toothbrush kit every day. But maybe this is just for customers in the suite. They didnt replace the shampoo though which was strange. Air con is a problem. It says it has two setting - hot and cold. But when I tried to use it both the settings were blowing hot air. A real problem in the summer, so you have to leave the door open to the terrace. But as the suite was facing the back of the building (towards Ayasofya) this wasnt a big problem. Wifi is a bit slow on the top floor. And sadly the lift was non-functional so you have to carry heavy luggage up and down the stairs. Staff were kind enough to help me on day one, which was very useful and is quite common in Istanbul. A good option to choose if you cannot find something else. I ended up here because everywhere else was booked solid. If you get a chance try the Alemdar restaurant across the road. The food is great there and the staff are good too. One of the waiters is very funny and he speaks many languages. People come to that restaurant just for him.

The very efficient air conditioner kept us cool and easily blocked out the traffic noise when needed. The bathroom was large and had the hottest water and greatest water pressure that I have ever found in Turkey. The cleaning staff was friendly and always diligent about their work. In fact, every single staff person was outstanding and a real asset to the hotel. All their names escape me, but I remember Fatih was often helping us at the front desk.
