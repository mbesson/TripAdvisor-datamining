The view of the ever-changing harbor and the Sydney bridge is spectacular, although it doesn't come cheap [$1,500/night], and the proximity to the Opera House and quay is unparalleled. I can't, however, give the hotel five stars for one quirky reason: The thermostat has only two settings---21 degrees Celsius [70 degrees F] and 25 degrees Celsius [77 degrees F]. My wife and I normally sleep at 62 to 65 degrees F, but you can't turn the thermostat in this room below 70. WTF? So, we have to keep the door to the outdoor patio open at night, which works, except you hear the noise of the harbor and people walking below and light comes in at 6 am.

The view was absolutely fabulous and the vibe of Circular Quay at night was amazing.

Never came across any cockroaches that people have mentioned in other reviews. One thing I absolutely recommend is ordering the chocolate-coated strawberries - Yum!

We pay the extra and get the harbour-side room rather than the garden-side room. It is definitely worth it. Each suite has a kitchen with washing machine and clothes dryer, biggish refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, coffee-maker as well as the usual kettle and toaster. The bathroom has both shower and spa. There is a dining area slightly separated from the lounge area; a bedroom with queen / king size bed and desk for laptop - we had complimentary internet access - and a balcony with small table and two chairs. We have not yet eaten in the hotel restaurant, so cannot pass comment on the standard of their food, but the little bar has fairly good bar food and a wonderful painting by Australian artist Marion Borgelt. It is just a short stroll along the quay to the Opera House if you want theatre, opera and dance. There is also a Dendy movie theatre about half-way to the Opera House and several good food places on the way. We chose this time to eat at a new-found gem in Balmain (review to come) as the weather was so good and the multipass travel tickets so reasonable that a ferry there and a bus to return was pleasant and relaxing. I do have one quibble with this hotel - one that stops me giving it an \"excellent\" rating. The bathroom floors have been very poorly designed and in each of our three or four visits, we have had a room where the water from the shower spills out into the main bathroom area and must be mopped up with the floor mat. The tap water from the basin also tends to spill out onto the vanity top rather than be completely caught by the basin. This can make for a wetter experience than we would like for a top-end hotel. However; it is a small irritation and can not take away completely from what is otherwise a fantastic hotel stay. If you are looking for the complete Sydney experience and are able to give yourselves a wonderful lift, gift or surprise, I can recommend the Quay Grand.

Room 608. I had great expectations for our visit, however, I was a tad disappointed. The reception area is really basic, however, the staff were very pleasant at all times. At a cost of $1338 for two nights, definitely this apartment is not good value for money unless you need a kitchen and a laundry. The view of the harbour bridge is really lovely and it is interesting to watch the coming and goings of the Sydney Ferries at the terminal at Circular Quay. However its proximity to the Circular Quay railway station means that you get to hear the trains coming at going and at night, this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charm me. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the rooms was a bit dated however and lacked the wow factor. The pool area is nothing like it is portrayed in the photos and is a small pool and tiny gym with very little equipment. The Eco bar was so noisy with a DJ at night that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a conversation so moved to the foyer. Eco bar hosts the breakfast in the morning and again this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to write home about. On the first morning, the repair man was fixing a floor to ceiling window that had come off it hinges so the room was freezing. Breakfast consisted of a continental buffet and hot food needs to be ordered separately. On both mornings the food was cold so overall a really disappointing breakfast and not what you would expect in 5 star accommodation. Overall, the apartment complex lacks soul and the wow factor and given there are so many other really good places to stay in Sydney, that also have a view of the harbour, I would not stay here again.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location\u201d", "Author": "BJS55", "ReviewID": "UR126547100", "Content": "Will definitely stay here again.

The service was excellent - all of the front desk staff was always willing to help, answer questions, look up stuff online, order room service for me, and always with a friendly attitude. At check-in, I asked if I could \"make a deal\" on the Internet service charges since I was staying for a whole week, and was given the weekly WiFi package for free! I really appreciated this gesture since I was so far away from home and wanted to be able to stay in touch each day. (Plus, I had already paid a small fortune for my weekly stay!) The 1BDR suite was huge - I estimate close to 900 sqft. The $1,000+ I saved on booking a Garden View suite instead of Harbour View for the week I was glad to have saved since Sydney is so very expensive. The Garden View suite had nice views and it was very quiet. Maybe if I only stayed a couple of nights I would have sprung for Harbour View, however there are many cafes/benches outside of the hotel and a bar and restaurant within the hotel where you can enjoy the views at any time. Also, the pool area has a sitting area on an upper deck that overlooks the harbour as well. I was on the 7th floor, suite 709, a corner room. No earplugs needed at any time. The suite was very clean and the bed super comfortable. I used the in-suite washer/dryer twice and was grateful to have that amenity. I ordered room service on three different occasions and the food was very good and I never waited more than 15 minutes for delivery. The tap water tasted fine, so I kept refilling a couple of bottles to store in the fridge rather than buying bottled water (for $3-$4 a pop). The location, on the east side of Circular Quay, couldn't be better. Most of the activities I did involved taking ferries, and the wharf is just steps outside of the door of the hotel. I also enjoyed daily early morning walks around the Opera House, harbour area, and the Royal Botanical gardens. Lots of walkers/joggers out at sunrise, but no crowds so a great way to enjoy the views and see the Opera House up close (good exercise going up and down those steps, too). Also, only a 10-minute walk to The Rocks area, with good restaurants. Within a 5-minute walk are a Starbucks, convenience stores, fast food, and a few bars/restaurants if desired. I ate breakfast daily at a place called City Extra which was reasonably priced for Sydney (avg of $13 for breakfast) and was less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and offered outdoor seating with harbour views. I would highly recommend this hotel if you can afford it and if you are staying for an extended period. It is more comfortable to have an entire suite to relax in, rather than a cramped hotel room.

We stayed in a two bedroom apartment overlooking the Harbour. The location of the property is nothing but perfect and the view is absolutely breathtaking. It it si the view one is after and the rest of the rpoeprty and service is not important then this is the place. We paid for a 5 star serviced apartment and expected a 5 star service.Considering what we paid it is expensive. On arrival at the reception while checking in I gave instruction to the staff to enquire on quotes for a car and chauffeur for a full day. to go to the vineyard and fruit picking. II had impressed on the guy that that is the nly free day we have and to please make sure I have a car. The guy assured me it will be done and he will leave whatever quotes he gets with his colleague. on returning later in teh evening, I discovered that a private tour guide was recommded for my use if I wanted and no quotes on any car and chauffeur. When we checked in the bathroom in the 2nd bedroom was not properly cleaned. I didnt do anyhting about it hoping that the maids will clean the bathroom the following day. When we returned the next day after lunch we noticed that the bathroom was cleaned at the top, towels changed and the beds were tidied in a hurry, the runner for the bed was left where we left it on the floor the night before. The floor of the bathroom was left as it was when we left. So I called housekeeping and someone by the name of \"Dan\" took my call. Having explained to her she sent a Nepalese help up to clean the floor. We were shocked at the amount of dust and hair that was swept out by this man. Finally the day before our departure I booked a van to take us to the airport. I approached the reception in the morning to arrange for the transport. The same assurance was given to me by staff that \" it will be done\". Again we returned at midday....I checked to make certain that transport was booked, A lady attended to me,.....she found nothing in the system....nevertheless she assurd me she will ratify this and book me a van. When we returned in the evening, we again found that no reservation was made for a van to take us to the airport. Finally the staff on duty that evening immediatelt booked the van and confirmed the same with me. Having had this experience I had to call the reception again the next mornng that the reervation was made.. The efficiency and friendliness of the staff at the restaurant is commendable.

Compared to the room rate, it seems really penny pinching and splitting hairs. We didn't realise the movies were at extra cost. After going to get dessert and a bottle of wine and sitting down to watch it, we then had to agree to pay $15.95 for the joy of doing that.

The room was TINY, the whole apartment was. It made for a very claustrophobic stay. I wish I hadn't taken this advice and paid for extra rooms. Plus, the rooms were tired and old, not new and modern like I imagined. The washing machine was moudly and stank, the tumble drier didn't work after 20 minutes, and the kitchen utensils were not cleaned at all. The housekeeping was poor, and somedays nothing was even done in our room, and when it was done, it wasn't done very well.

It rattled so loudly and we thought it might spin out of control and hurl itself out of the closet like a meteor, smelled (awful), and was always unbalanced despite all of our makeshift additions to prop it up... making laundry a hassle and unpleasant. It was also a Tiny, little machine which Stunk of mildew, AND it did not wash our clothes well. The regular cycle also took about 90 minutes, thats right folks, 90 minutes. Despite this the kids clothes still had their ice cream stains etc. As a parent looking to pay extra for the convenience of amenities like a washer and dryer while away on vacation, I would expect that these much touted appliances be in current and working order. Did we mention this to the hotel at the time? No. Why not? Because it was doubtful that they would, and we were not inclined, to have a new washing machine installed in our unit during our stay. We also had no desire to pack and move rooms and I suspect that all the rooms have similar model decrepit units, and if not, shame on Quay grand for not updating all the units. We also saw roaches in our kitchen which we read about before on other Tripadvisor reviews. We hoped this would not be the case but there they were taunting us.

As our stay was going to be at the end of our big Australian trip and it was our 15th wedding anniversary, I decided to splash the cash and book a Harbour view room. I mentioned in our booking that as it was our anniversary and the booking was a surprise for my husband, I would really appreciate a room on a high floor to maximise the view. When we turned up at the hotel I was immediately impressed by the staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The person who checked us in took us to our room and chatted away to us as if we were old friends. The hotel had noted my comments on the floor level and put us in a brilliant room (903 I think) on the 9th floor. We travel a lot for both pleasure and business so are guilty of being a bit jaded when it comes to hotel rooms and views but even my husband was stunned by the room and the view beyond the window once we got through the door. We loved the fact that it was a suite and it was very cleverly designed to make the most of the space. The furnishings were all in very good condition, the room was spotlessly clean and although the bathroom wasn't uber modern I wouldn't have called it outdated or old (and I am very fussy about my bathrooms). The piece de resistance was our balcony where we spent some very pleasant mornings and evenings watching the ferries come and go at Circular Quay and the sunset over the bridge. I thought the room was brilliant value given the view, the balcony and the proximity of the hotel to the key attractions i.e. the Opera house, Botanical gardens, Circular Quay etc. However what really set the hotel apart was the quality of the staff. Everyone we met and dealt with was unfailingly helpful and pleasant. Everyone seemed genuinely keen to make sure we had the best time possible in Sydney and at the hotel. And we were particularly touched when we got back to our room one afternoon to find a card from the hotel congratulating us on our anniversary. Someone had taken the time to note from my booking that it was our anniversary and then give us a card when we arrived. That level of service and detail is absolutely brilliant and really sets this hotel apart from some of the other (more expensive!) hotels we stayed in on this trip.

All the staff were informed of our stay, so we never needed to explain our situation when taking the dogs out to toilet. This is very important. The suite is spacious and worth the $900 or so a night. The corner balcony with the best view is tiny, and the furniture gets in the way of the door, but you put up with it for the view.

At night, the view is just as good, so it's easy to stay up all night and just watch.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNo better location in Sydney.\u201d", "Author": "plugga_syd", "ReviewID": "UR119695089", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in a Harbour View Suite for two nights and were blown away by the view.

The bedroom had views towards the city which was lovely when all lit up at night. The bed was extremly comfortable and the bed linen spotless. The bathroom had a spa bath and separate shower it was very clean, not overly luxurious but this is an apartment not a 5 star hotel room. The kitchen was fully equipped with a full size fridge, oven, microwave and small dishwasher. There was even a washing machine and dryer. It also had all the cutlery, glasswear and cookwear you would ever need. The room has double glazing so when the door to the balcony is closed it is very quiet. We walked every morning around through the Botanical gardens with spectacular views of the Opera House and Bridge. There are so many restaurants and other places to eat right on your doorstep and the Rocks area with it's pubs and markets or the city for shopping are within walking distance. A few pointers it did get quite hot in the apartment when the sun was shining in. There is an outdoor blind which is operated by a switch on the wall opposite the dining table it is a good idea to put it down on a hot day before you go out as this and the blinds keep the apartment cool for when you return. If it is very windy though the blind does automatically go back up which is quite amusing when it happens and no one is touching the swtch!.We did have an extra person for 2 nights and needed the sofa bed , this was made up with linen, pillows and a quilt and there was an extra blanket if required.All the staff were extremley helpful, even the cleaner asked if everything was to our satisfaction when we were going out which was very nice.

Right on the harbour with the opera house only steps away. The bar has incredible views of the bridge & so, I am lead to believe, do the harbour view rooms. We stayed in a garden view room & the view was ok but we did not expect an amazing view so that was fine. The room was spacious & clean but in need of a bit of updating. However, there are more than a couple of niggles only because this place is not cheap at all. Firstly - I emailed the hotel a week or so before we left to explain arrival details - we were expecting to arrive at appx 10pm & thought it best to inform them. I got no reply so I emailed again - still no reply. There were no problems as it turns out but I still would have expected a reply. Next: There were 3 in our party - the extra person incurred quite a high surcharge which was ok - we knew that the 3rd person would be on a sofa bed, but - the bedding was awful. The sofa was made up with only a thin beige scratch blanket. I called housekeeping & asked for a duvet - I was told (abruptly in my opinion) that the hotel did not carry extra duvets. I appealed & explained that it would seem bad practice to leave one paid guest with innadequate bedding - she was quite cold & the blanket wadid not have a nice feel. the member of staff rudely repeated that they do not have extra duvets but said he would see what he could do. Nothing was heard from that request again. Next day we made the same enquiry at reception & were told that they could only send another blanket - which they did this time but now my friend simply had 2x scratchy blankets, hardly 5 star in service or quality. Shame. Also: the apartment was really only set up for 2 people - even though we had paid that high surcharge. 2 chairs on the balcony, 2 coffee sachets, 2 lots of toileteries... it seemed a little like that 3rd person wasn't all that welcome. Also, 1 afternoon we came back & found that my friends sofabed was only partly made up. there was abandoned pillows in the middle of the bed in a pile & no pillowcases on or left anywhere else. This was quickly rectified, but still??. Lastly: we stacked up the diswasher each day & turned it on but housekeeping only unloaded it once during our stay. We did enjoy our stay, the hotel has redeeming qualities & most of the staff were very helpful. But I don't think I would stay there again for the price we paid.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "SLPExplorer", "ReviewID": "UR118988202", "Content": "Thoroughly enjoyed my stay for eight nights overlooking the Botanic Gardens.

We came by car (very easy to get to when coming from the north side) and used the valet parking which worked very well. Arriving at a busy time meant we had to park a little way down the street as the lay-by at the door will only accommodate approx 3 cars. The entrance was a little hard to see on the rainy evening when we arrived. The porter retrieved our luggage and our car was parked with no problem. Parking is in the same building so it was easy to retrieve some extra items after the car had been parked. Paolo the Porter, Sarah and Patrick on the desk all get big ticks from us!

We didn't hear any of the street performers or crowds on the Quay, which was very nice, and even better, when returning to our room one night, we could hear the young kids in the next room shreiking as we passed the room in the hallway, but once inside our room, it was silent. There are a ton of dining and drinking choices right outside the doorstep--- walk a block or two away from the Quay to find some choices in a more affordable price range (try MOS Cafe up at the Museum of Sydney, or the little Indian restaurant around the corner from the hotel). You also have very easy access to all tourist spots via ferry, bus or rail just outside, and it's about a 10-minute walk to The Rocks.

I didn't receive any reply. When we arrived the receptionist (an early 30's man) quickly told us that they were fully booked and that there was no chance of an early check in. Though disappointed, I accepted that they were under no obligation to help as the official check-in wasn't until the afternoon, but his somewhat arrogant attitude was unfortunate. However, five minutes later, whilst still completing the forms he'd given us, he suddenly announced that he'd managed to re-organise things and was able to get us a room immediately. We were then shown to our room which, lo and behold, had the flowers sitting in a vase that I'd requested! It became obvious that, when we'd arrived, he hadn't checked his booking system and, on discovering his mistake, rather than come clean he'd suggested he'd done us a massive favour. Having said that, the room was good, the view spectacular (down on to Circular Quay and across to the bridge) and the location perfect. The service from the other members of staff was flawless.

I was willing to leave it at that but then at the airport a large cockroach dropped out of my coat where it had been hitching a ride. Just not a pleasant way to end a vacation having to unpack/isolate all luggage to ensure no cockroaches travelled back with us. Compounding this was the fact that the hotel sent us a web form to provide feedback. I provided the same feedback that is in this review and received back a form letter with a noreply address.

If you exit out of the front of the hotel onto Macquarie street, turn left and you have a view of the opera house (1 minute walk to the steps of) and across the street you have the Botanic gardens, a great place to view the opera house and bridge and lovely for a picnic (look out for the fruit bats -an awesome sight!). If you exit out of the back of the hotel, you are on circular quay and can catch ferries to all over Sydney, including the beaches at Manly. There are lots of restaurants to choose from on the Quay, and you're just a 5 minute walk from the historic 'rocks' area with more bars and restaurants. Because you'll have the ability to make your own food, you must check out the food hall at David Jones, which is about a 20 minute walk away in the heart of the shopping district. It has been modelled on the foodhall at Harrods and you can buy anything here! We didn't discover this place until we had left Quay Grand and were staying in a hotel on Darling Harbour, but if we visit QGS again we'll definitely stock up at David Jones! The suites also offer room service if you can't be bothered to cook. One tip if you're a light sleeper -take ear plugs. The ferries are quite noisy and run from very early morning to very late night -be warned! My only disappointment really was that, given the high room rate, I would have expected free wifi.

We paid extra for a view towards the ferries and bridge, it was worth it! Here is my advice, ask for a room further towards the Opera House (further north in the building, away from city), the reason is that the exhaust fumes from the ferries tended to blow towards our room as our room was closer to the city (nothing to do with the city) if our room was closer to the Opera House side of the hotel, it wouldn't have been a problem. It was great to wake up every day and watch the water, and all the activity of the ferries and visitors.

Step out the ground floor and you're at Circular quay where you can catch all of the feries, buses, trains, etc for Sydney. A 2 to 3 minute walk and you're in the rocks. If you stay on the garden side you can almost touch the opera house from your balcony. And since we're talking about the garden side of the hotel, the harbour side is nice, seeing the bridge and the boats coming and going, but haveing the Royal Botanical Garden on the opposite side is not a bad view either and it comes with the opera house view ..so if you want to spne the extra $100.00 per day for the harbour side fine, but we enjoyed the garden side just as well. I dont think the staff at the Quay Grand has the word no in their vocabulary. While they do not have unlimited internet access anyone can use the computer at the business station for whatever they need to acomplish without charge...you just cant tie it up for needless hours just surfing. My hats off to Chloe and Mitchel on staff at the Quay and all the other staff members who helped make our 11 days in Sydney a dream. One day we came back to find the room had not been made a call to housekeeping had the maid at the door semingly before we hung up the phone. Hilton, Four Seasons, Hyatt, etc, have your people network with the Quay staff to truly understand the meaning of customer service and more importantly how to implement it.

Wow. Sydney is everything. Jaw dropping, amazing, incredible (just one point - if you suffer from vertigo like I do then be careful. Sydney is very San Francisco like. One moment you may be on level ground, the next moment you are encountering a steep angle which may give you a serious spin/ headache - however still not enough of a reason to not be there!) We went in winter which was absolutely beautiful and Sydney had a festival on where one of the highlights was the Opera house illuminated with different colours and designs!. The days were still mostly warm and the nights were chilly - perfect because the whole City was so inviting. We decided to go for the Quay Grand Suites because we got a great deal on Expedia. It was the best decision that we have made. I could describe to you our check in and check out but I won't. The only thing I have to say is that Mark and Dave the two gentleman that were at front desk are the two most professional people I have ever met. They were cheerful, insightful and best of all they were good for a laugh. I have never known two people to light up a front desk like those two did. For that alone, Quay Grand Suites is a must. You will not regret it. And by the way their advice is second to none. Not only are they well versed in extensive knowledge but they know things! The room itself was perfect. It was huge and it was perfect for a family of three. My son of four had the sofa bed which was just fine for him. The bed itself was seriously comfortable and the added bonus of a kitchen/utility area was welcome. The bathroom was spacious and the walk in shower was a treat. The hotel was ideally located at Circular Quay. You could walk out and get on a ferry in no time at all. And opposite to the Ferry stations were the Bus stops and taxi stop. And right on top, circular quay rail station. Perfect. Even better was the Botanical gardens on the other side for which you could take the hotel exit onto Macquarie Street. The gardens were absolutely incredible. A must for anyone. Things to do and remember: If you want to travel get the necessary passes that you require (available from most travel counters) - a tip: on Sundays you can get a family fun-day pass for 2dollars 50 per person. Perfect for the long trips! If you need tourist advice, their is a centre at the rocks and another situated at Darling harbour. However at Circular Quay their is a fine gentleman in a kiosk in front of Starbucks - so give him a shout! Contrary to a lot of reports - Sydney was expensive. Food was double to what we pay here in the UK. Shopping was expensive - so you have to look around before you buy! However under the Sydney Plaza there is a eating area consisting of various food outlets - try that, we found it cheaper than restaurants. The Queen Victoria building in Sydney bought back memories of home and of the grand Victorian designs that have been so central to the architecture of London - give it a try for breakfast or lunch as well as shopping. Also in the basement is a Starbucks - where you will meet the finest staff. If only all coffee shops were that appealing! If you are flying - especially with kids - take the A380, heaven! Subsequently take flights into Australia where you get there at night time - we got there in the morning and practically slept all day! We would seriously recommend everyone to see Sydney by walking where possible. We walked from Circular Quay (CQ) to Darling Harbour and all around the centre - Hyde Park was a blast - the war memorial profound and do the walk between the lights at night (you'll know what I mean when you see it!). We went to north Sydney and walked across the Harbour bridge, past the Observatory which was a treat! We took a day out to Taronga Zoo and walked Bradley's head - Taylors Bay - Chowders Bay and it was amazing! But be sure to have your walking boots on because it is a very challenging walk! We walked Watsons bay and all the way around to the lighthouse - we wanted to walk down to Bondi - but it started raining!(If you fancy getting to Bondi and don't want to walk - you can do so by catching a bus from there). At Watsons bay their is a delightful fish and chip shop - so lunch is recommended - also their is a park nearby and a play area for the kids . We went to Rose Bay and eventually walked to Bondi but didn't have enough time to walk to Coogee beach - another one for next time! However their are some lovely coffee and bakery shops (at Rose Bay), so don't forget to give them a try. Bondi was beautiful - funny because I thought it would always be more hip - but it was pleasant more than anything. And their are enough shops to keep everyone happy. We missed Manly, Palm beach which are to the North, and the Blue mountains which are to the east. We just did not have enough time to pull everything off! (oh well just have to save that for next time too then!) ANZ bank is the best bank to exchange money (their is a charge of 8 dollars though), but here is something we found - it is better to take Australian dollars from here - especially if you do not have to pay commission. Rates are just as competitive and at times better! Do not go into the currency exchange shops - they charge you a commission and a fee on top for changing the money!!! At the rocks on Friday and Saturday their is a market - perfect for fresh food and drink. Try the Turkish Gozleme - delicious. Also at the rocks centre is a sweet shop called Sticky - making fresh sweets and lollipops - really fun for the kids! Again we also missed the Sydney cricket ground and the ANZ stadium. If you have time that is a must. If you can get to any of Bills restaurants (restaurants that are owned by the renowned chef Bill Granger), then please do - the food is brilliant. I think I have covered most of what I can pass on. Sydney was five stars and the hotel was perfect. However just before I go, I do have one gripe. Again, their wasn't enough entertainment channels for children at the hotel. However that isn't an excuse for not getting there - after everything I have said I truly am lost for words, until you don't go and see Sydney for yourself you'll never know what you are missing.

The whole experience was awesome and it was literally the best place I've ever stayed at! First highlight was the large balcony overlooking the Quay. We spent hours out there watching the ferries come and go, tucking into some of the complimentary fruit platter and champagne that was kindly delivered by the hotel staff. From the balcony we could see some of the other notable hotels that I'd been considering for this special night - the Mariott, the Shangri-La, and the Intercontinental - but none of these hotels have balconies (as far as we could see anyway), and I was really glad I chose the Quay Grand!! Second highlight was the pool and gym area, beautifully modern with water right to the edge, deliciously warm and it has fantastic views as well. Only criticism was that the spa adjacent to the pool wasn't working (on Sat the 19th Sept) - but this was OK as there was a Spa in our room that easily caters for two people :-) While we didn't have dinner at the Quay Grand, we did enjoy breakfast on Saturday the 19th Sept - I'd booked a $525 parking/harbour view and breakfast for two deal, but I was wondering what would appear on our bill since we went a bit overboard at breaky. Several rounds of coffee while reading the paper, two full breakfasts and two sides each, but there was no additional charge on the bill - I was pleased to see that it really was all included in the rate. The final highlight was the quality of the staff - extremely friendly, no request is too difficult, and they are very proud of their #1 ranking on trip adviser. I would definitely go back, it was absolutely awesome - the only thing preventing me from staying there more regularly is the AUD$525/night rate.

Positives includes: * Impossible to beat location - stone's throw from all Circuar Quay ferries and train station * Great suites, including good sized lounge and bedroom plus fully equipped kitchen with utility facilities (washer/dryer) and bathroom, including jacuzzi (bog enough for 2) * Ample storage space throughout * Satellite TV including premium sports channels (in lounge and bedroom) * Quiet rooms (we did not hear any noise from the bustling Quay when doors/windows shut) * Privacy - in the sense that we were able to exit and enter the hotel directly on Circular Quay and therefore only went through reception when checking in and out. This really does give one the feeling of having one's own apartment in Sydney * We had little interaction with staff but when we did, all were polite and helpful Negatives (none of which we intend should put anyone off staying at QGS): * No free broadband/internet access - though this is an issue throughout Australia/NZ we have found. At these rates, they really ought to consider pricing internet into the room rates. For those of us from the Europe/US, having to pay for what we now regard as a \"commodity\" leaves something to be desired * On our third night, we found a 2.5 inch cockroach in the kitchen. This was dealt with immediately by the night manager and this was the only incident we had or observed. In fairness to the Hotel, the patio door to our balcony had been left open by the cleaners, which may explain this. * We had to call house-keeping and ask them to ensure that our room was vaccumed on a couple of occaisions, which though not a huge deal, was slightly disappointing for a hotel of this calibre. * In the bathroom, a gap in between the floor and the bottom of the door to the walk-in double shower means that it is prone to flooding the remainder of the bathroom floor.

The rooms are suites and large by any standard. We stayed in a one bedroom suite for 4 nights at the start of our vacation and in a two bedroom suite the night before departing, which bookended an eleven day trip. The price is high, but the so is the quality of service and there is no better address. Out the front door is the Royal Botanical Gardens, 10 feet from the back door is the Circular Quay boat dock, and 100 meters from the end of the building is the Opera House entrance. You cannot beat the views. On one side you face the harbor and the other you overlook the botanical gardens. In either case, it is beautiful. We enjoyed sleeping with the curtains open with a view of the bridge. The facility also doubles as a long term residence so you may be in a room adjacent to a permanent tenant. If you want exclusivity and quiet in a prime location, look no further. If you are looking for touristy hustle and bustle, try something in Darling Harbor. In a book I bought listing the top 10 places to visit in Sydney, the Grand Quay is within five blocks of most of them. By international standards, the rooms are very clean and well maintained, however, during the second stay we were moved to a larger room because housekeeping failed to fully clean our assigned room. It was likely an innocent oversight, and it was definitely remedied to our satisfaction quickly, with a follow up after our visit. The highlight of our stay was the Head Concierge, David. He is likely the best concierge we have ever seen. Like all good concierges, David provided detailed information about all our excursions, but took the extra step of making all the arrangements so we need only show up. He saved us a fortune in tours by planning out details on our activities down to the time, location and payment. He had a rental car for us at the front door when we drove to the mountains and arranged for its return. Talk about service. Even better, he billed everything right back to our room, so we handled all expenses at checkout, which was quick and easy. He made pre-trip contact, took care of all details on site, and even followed up after our visit. I found it odd, however, that the rest of the front desk staff appeared to do double duty as front desk clerk and concierge, when David was off duty. They provided excellent service and even had cash ready to give a cab driver, who could not make change for a $100 AUD. That was impressive. The only drawback was their lack of concierge skills. It is an area for improvement. For a reviewer who did not get a paper, did you fill out the registration form at arrival? There was a box to check for which papers you wanted delivered. I saw lots in the hallway. This may have been user error. The food in the hotel restaurant was good, but a bit pricey, as was all the food in Australia. The pool and exercise room were very small and unimpressive, but not a concern for us since we were not in Sydney for the pool. Price is clearly an issue when traveling in Australia. It is not as expensive as London, but close. The hotel is very expensive, but comparable for a boutique hotel with this level of service and location. You rarely saw any other guests at the front desk and you always felt like you had the place all to yourself, despite being near full. The facility has some permanent residents in rooms on the same floor as hotel guests. I do not see this as a problem, but found it odd. I guess with condo size rooms and a prestigious address it is a smart business move on the part of management. Provided you do not suffer from sticker shock, the Grand Quay should be at the top of your list when visiting Sydney.

I had narrowed it down to the Park Hyatt and Quay Grand, but Quay Grand had the Park Hyatt beat in just about every way. I was traveling with a friend and we were received by CHLOE at the front desk. She was charming and had the most sparkling personality I've witnessed at a front desk. As it turned out, my friend and I were meant to meet the next day with a film producer of great note, who's most awarded film was one we'd not seen yet. The film was made in the 1990s. It was 8pm the night before our meeting, and we had no idea how we'd get to see this film. NIGEL, who also worked the front desk, went to insane extremes to find the film for us. He found a copy at a video store that was about to close. He actually got the video store owner to keep his shop open for us for long enough to secure the film. Problem was it was on video. (Note: the Quay Grand Suites actually has DVD players in their rooms--very nice. Nigel managed to track down a video player for us, took it up to our room as we went to fetch the video, and had it set up for our return. That's a crazy level of service. But the service just continued on at a level I've have never witnessed at a hotel,ever. And I was the front office supervisor once at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, one of the most famous five stars in the world. If we needed a taxi, front desk staff would run out onto the street and get us one in no time. If we wanted a petting zoo appointment to get near a koala, they took care of it. When there was a malfunction of our heating unit, they moved us up to an even better room. Mind you, you can not get a bad room at this property. They're actual apartments with separate huge bedrooms with sweeping floor to ceiling views. The apartments are funished with full size washers and dryers so you can do your wash while on a long journey down under. Can you do this at the Park Hyatt? You can't. The Park Hyatt wanted double the money for a plain old room with a bed in it. For half the price, at this property, you get a full kitchen, a dining room, and living room, the hugest spa tub and shower, and service that will make you wanting to move in. DAVID at the front desk was also insanely helpful and I just really still can't believe just how above and beyond he went for me and my friend who was traveling with me. The location is ideal. Though you are in a big city, you feel like you're on an island of your own away from the skyscrapers. The harbour side rooms are well worth springing for. I totally agree with another reviewer on here, you can sit all day and night and just be mesmerized by the ferries going back and forth. So beautiful. The balconies on which to sit are very ample and comfy. Forget what another reviewer said on here about room service and the picture posted. Room service food was mighty delicious and the portions were generous. They had the craziest good cheeeburger. It was huge with excellent quality cheese and bacon on it. It was topped with pineapple and beet root. Yummy. The hummus and eggplant dip you could not fault. The ice creams, heavenly. THE POOL is indoors and one of the few around town to be indoors. It was winter, and the heated indoor pool was a nice luxury and big enough to do laps in. The hotel is surrounded by scores of fine restaurants and street vendors with fish and chips and Royal Copenhagen ice cream. There is street entertainment along the quay and it's as fun a scene to watch as Venice Beach in California. If you're pleasant to the staff here, there's nothing they won't do for you. Whoever is managing this place deserves great credit fot the superb staff he or she employs. The level of caring will be something you will never forget. We felt like we were staying with friends. Well, wait, would my friends go to the legths of this hotel staff? Hmm...I'm not so sure.

We shared a one bedroom Harbour View room which was stunning. We loved the fact that the balcony opened onto Circular Quay and we could watch the ferries come and go.

The bedroom was huge with lots of storage space and the spa bathroom was very generous - even enough room for 3 make-up addicts to share! My only gripe, and its a small one, is that I had to pay an extra $55 (on top of the $444 per night) to use the fold-out bed which I had to make up myself. It seemed a bit steep considering there was no linen provided (had to call for it) and I had to set it up and put it away every day.

The amenity areas are very modern and built for the views - restaurant, bar, pool, spa and gym. It is a fairly small hotel so we found the facilities to be very relaxed and uncrowded. The outlook from the harbour-view rooms is west and therefore directly into the setting sun so they've added sensible features like an electrically operated outside blind that filters the sun while you enjoy your champagne and nibbles on the balcony. Tough life eh? For daytime sleeping there are blackout curtains. With the balcony door closed the sound attenuation is reasonably good but you'll still enjoy the background toot-toot of the departing ferries. This hotel is in the heart of Sydney's tourist scene so expect crowds outside, particularly at weekends. Circular Quay is the main harbour-ferry terminal so you get easy access by water to other hot-spots like Darling Harbour, Luna Park, Taronga Zoo and Manly beaches. There is also a train station, buses and plenty of taxis adjacent to the quay. Walking to the Opera House, the Rocks and the Botanical Gardens is 5 minutes. Walking to the CBD and Darling Harbour is 15-20 minutes. Just to the left of the lower hotel entrance (Circular Quay entrance) there is a glass lift that takes you up to the walkway alongside the Cahill Expressway. From there it is a fairly flat walk to the Harbour Bridge and across to the northern shore. 30 minutes of gentle walking will get you over to the opposite side, not including an extra hour for photo stops. Part-way across the bridge you can take another lift up to the top of the pylon for superb views and some exhibits on building the bridge.

Stayed in Sydney last year for a wedding, plus a couple days extra for leisure. Extensively researched on tripadvisor where looked best, and we chose this one based on its reports of great service, nice looking rooms, proximity to the wedding, great views, great location, and the bonus of having a spa in our suite. Felt that we absolutely chose the best place to stay in every aspect of what we wanted from our experience. The room exceeded expectations - modern, clean, comfortable, awesome beds, fabulous views, great kitchen, well soundproofed, nice spa. The service - which I value as much as the quality of room - was impeccable - I expected it to be a bit stuffy, but they were down to earth, friendly yet professional - I don't think you could find much better service anywhere else. Only a couple of issues, very small ones - when I discovered the ironing board missing from the room and it was promptly brought up with an apology (that great service again), when i started ironing, a little cockroach scuttled out from the ironing board - so it might be an idea for them to have more vigilant pest control where they store these items? I didnt see another one our whole stay though, so not a big deal. The other very minor thing is that when we would have a shower, the water would leak across the floor flooding the bathroom floor and pool there, so when you would go into the bathroom afterwards it was a bit of a nuisance. We ended up using a couple of towels to help mop up the floor each time, but of course it would be better not to have this inconvenience. We are planning another trip to sydney soon, and I have been researching places to stay again, but nowhere seems to come up to anywhere near the standard of this hotel. It is pretty pricey but you definately get what you pay for.

It cost us just over $250 (USD) a night and was a fairly good value. We had tried to stay when the Queen Mary II came into the harbor but the room was $655 (USD) a night!!! WOW. These must be individually owned but they are nice. There is a granite kitchen, W/D, seperate living room, KING bed, 2 Flat Screens, stereo, DVD player, you name it. It's great to sit out on the deck with a glass of wine and watch all the action on the harbour. The rooms are fairly well insulated so you only hear the occassional ferry horn or passenger ship horn at night. We were there, fortunately, when only 1 day had a cruise ship. The harbor area is super busy then (restaurants, shops, ferries) and the view is of the port side of a BIG ship. If you can ascertain if a ship will be there, try to stay somewhere in Darling Harbour instead. The only criticism I had, was that the housekeeper left a greasy, rust stained large wet rag on top of one of my shirts. Woah! There was a little marital misunderstanding that evening! YIKES! Anyway, we had left a $5 tip for the housekeeper each day and she did NOT take it the next two days for some reason. Also, the restaurant had bad service and burned my breakfast badly. Therefore, I would NOT recommend the restaurant. There are plently of non-Hotel affiliated restaurants in the area for your dining pleasure.

We were blown away by how beautiful our apartment was but even more so by the view. To the left was the city, in front was the water and to the right was the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with Luna Park all lit up in the distance. We spent many a relaxing hour on our balcony, overlooking the water, watching the ferries come and go and the people on the street below us passing by as they went about their day. The king bed in our apartment was incredibly comfortable with plenty of fluffy pillows to choose from and the softest sheets we've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on. The sofa in the lounge converted into a queen bed, and was nice to laze about on during the day. There was a 4-seater dining table and fully equipped modern kitchen with top quality electrical appliances. The bathroom was large and included a shower and spa bath, which we took full advantage of on more than one occasion. Other reviewers have mentioned the noise of the ferries below from the apartment but with the balcony door closed we heard nothing. There are a number of shops and cafes nearby (our favourite was the Guylian Chocolate Cafe for their Belgian waffles and hot chocolates) and the Circular Quay rail and ferry stations are right on your doorstep. You can get to wherever you want to go without any trouble at all. And if you have any questions, the staff at Quay Grand are only too happy to help out. On the few occasions we required a taxi, one was flagged down for us within minutes by the friendly chap at reception, and always with a smile. On the day of my birthday my hubby and I headed out for breakfast and when we returned there was a chilled bottle of champers and a beautiful big basket of fresh fruit awaiting me as we entered the apartment. Along with it was a heartfelt birthday wish from the staff at Circular Quay. It was unexpected and very much appreciated. We did have a couple of small problems during our stay but nothing that bothered us too much. The door key was one of those plastic cards that you push in and pull out quickly but it failed to work for us so we were given a replacement. Unfortunately that didn't want to work either so it too was replaced. Third time was a charm and we didn't have any other problems after that. The other issue was the fridge. It decided to take a break one night and in the morning all of our food/drinks were hot. Reception got right onto it though and within the hour the fridge was in working order and many of our refreshments had been replaced.

The view was brilliant both during the day, and at night. With the doors closed, there was really very little noise from the ferries and the hussle and bustle of the world below. The location could hardly be any better. Circular Quay Station is only a short walk from the hotel, and has a direct line to/from the airport and the rest of the city. As well, the ferries leave practically from your doorstep, to all areas of the harbour. The Opera House is also only a short stroll away. The only negative is that it is quite expensive, and doesn't seem to do many cheap deals online, but I guess they don't need to! I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a superb location and view, and would pay the extra to get a harbour view if finances permit.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel in Circular Quay\u201d", "Author": "mtnrunner", "ReviewID": "UR20262012", "Content": "I stayed in a Harborside one bedroom suite for 5 days the beginning of September 2008.

The hotel has a fabulous bar located on the mezzanine level 3 called ECQ and its fun sipping cocktails overlooking our gorgeous city. The restaurant Quadrant is fine dining and expensive but we did enjoy our meal. There is also Eastbank Restaurant located on the ground floor which is great for a cheaper alternative which serves a lovely pizza or pasta. The indoor swimming pool is located on the 4th floor which is terrific as it also has a spa attached and two saunas and stream room. The staff were very helpful and cheerful. Sydney is a treasure chest , holding incredible richness and beauty in the fragments of the harbour and foreshores. The glistening fragments of light filtering over Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House are truely enchanting.

Sydney is virtually on your doorstep as it takes 1 minute to get to the ferries, trains and buses. If you have a travel pass,as we did($95 for a week, one adult and child for all buses trains and ferries plus the airport train both ways), you venture out every opportunity you have. We got ferries to places we wouldnt normally go (like Watsons Bay) because we could. We arrived at 9 am and were able to check in to our room straight away.The apartment (Rm 702)was perfect for us. Quite high up so nice view of the Harbour Bridge. No view of the Opera House because it is right next door! There was no noticeable noise from the ferrries and trains when the balcony door was shut and just a pleasant sound of people going about their business when it was open. Nice place to sit and people watch. Room service was great and very quick. The pool was very nice too. Lots of cafes right next door and a great movie theatre next door that shows art house sort of movies. We had an issue with the appliances not working in the kitchen(fuse had blown)but it was resolved quickly. The staff were friendly and showed an interest in what we had been doing.
