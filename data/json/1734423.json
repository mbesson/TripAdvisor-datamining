The location was perfect, the staff was incredibly friendly, and the room was very clean. I booked several months in advance, but the single room wasn't available the last night of my stay. I asked to be switched to one if it became available and was impressed that they'd actually kept that notation on the books for all those months. I'd definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cHostal five minutes' walk to the centre\u201d", "Author": "Olyver_Minu", "ReviewID": "UR136273581", "Content": "The \"hostal\" is located on the top floor of an old building close to Madrid centre (Plaza Vazquez).

A member of the staff is always at the reception, with the possibility to come back home late. The staff is very kind and helpful.

The location was great - Chuecas is a really fun area with great, alternative restaurants, the new market located down the road and only a block or two off of Gran V\u00eda. However, I felt really uncomfortable during my entire stay because of the \"friendly\" staff. In order to enter you must ring a doorbell and wait for someone to open the door (this always takes some time). Before you leave you must leave your key at the front in a box (this is normal in Spain to leave your key at the front desk and it never bothered me before) but when you come back you're not allowed to grab it from the box. You aren't allowed to adjust the AC temperature either in your room so I was either freezing or really hot. The internet didn't work and the bathroom was very small like another reviewer said. The walls are also super thin and I was woken up by my neighbors alarm every morning and also heard suitcases being wheeled down the hall (I was the first room right next to the lobby). Overall, I felt like I was staying at a host family's house and had to walk on cracked eggshells. I felt uncomfortable the entire time and although the location was great and the price was reasonable - I would not stay here again.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaverton, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cValue priced basics\u201d", "Author": "twigor", "ReviewID": "UR133832328", "Content": "The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The one negative was room cleanliness, which was not up to par - I found a piece of gum stuck to the top of the bed frame.
