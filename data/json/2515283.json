Our room was small but clean and comfortable; however, it was incredibly stuffy and had a smaller window and whether opened or closed, our room was on the 5th floor, over the docking area. All night long, you'd hear the incessant beeping of multiple trucks backing in and the dock person and driver hollering at each other (although it sounded lovely in the beautiful French language)!!

They rooms are typically small and overpriced. With this in mind, why not book a budget hotel? This Ibis is part of the chain and a bit \"samey\" if you know what I mean, but it represents outstanding value for money. Its handily placed and within five minutes of Metro Blanche which is on the same line as Gare du Nord (admittedly the transfer is through Chapelle and its a bit of a hike). Its right at the corner of Place de Clichy and as the website says, around 200m from the Moulin Rouge. This area of town is a little seedy at nights with peep shows etc but don't let that put you off. think Soho in London and you're not far away. there are no brothels and no prostitutes in windows. Don't bother with the hotel breakfast. the area is teeming with cafes and restaurants. Corcorans Irish Pub is close by of you facy a beer (there are actually several Irish themed bars within easy walking).

Only real issues were there was no tea/coffee making facilities (would have thought this was a given for a chain hotel) and the pillows were awful- very lumpy- we asked for another pillow each, which did improve the situation somewhat, but still, if you have the room in your bag for your own pillow, I'd heartily recommend it! There's a decent patisserie about 5 mins walk, creperie just a few doors down and plenty of other bars and restaurants around and about. I'd also recommend taking the tube to Abbesses metro station- there's loads of lovely bistros in that area, and Rue De Trois Freres has an ace little restaurant on it called Le Paname- 20Euros for a set menu that included an enormous steak au poivre, fois gras and handmade tarte tatin- YUM.

But after staying here twice, I can only say nice things about this hotel. Check-in was nice and friendly, no trouble at all. The room we stayed during our first visit was a bit cramped, but immaculately clean. It has all you need from a hotel while exploring Paris. Wifi is free, but you need login codes from the reception. It is a stone's throw from Place de Clichy metro station, which has enough metro lines running through it to take you to most of the Paris attractions. There are a lot of cafe's and restaurants close to the hotel, so you'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to food. The buffet breakfast at the hotel is not too bad, either. Good coffee, nice croissants, pastries and breads with cold ham & cheeses. There's no hot buffet though, but that's not a big deal. The second time I stayed at this place was a bit of a last minute plan. When we returned from Mont Saint Michel, we were booked at New Hotel Gare du Nord. That was a completely shady, dirty and run-down place, and we decided to come back to Ibis Montmartre. Luckily a room was available, and even more luckily, it was a larger room than the one we stayed in before! I give this place an enthusiastic thumbs up...

The hotel itself is big, and spread over 9 floors with a reasonable foyer and breakfast area. The breakfast itself is well worth the \u00a38 (approx) for all you can eat with croissants, fruit, breads, cereal, yoghurt cheese and ham. Although there are other cafes within a couple of minutes' walk this is far more convenient and no more expensive. Our 9th floor room was basic but of a reasonable size and had a very pleasant view across the cemetery at the back towards the Sacre Coeur. Although the temperature in the room was ok when we went, it felt as if it could get very cold in the winter as there was a window vent permanently open. The bathroom was simple but acceptable with only one thin towel each, but clean and functional. The bed was comfortable although lacked a valance which made it appear half-made, and we needed to ask for an extra pillow at Reception which was willingly given. The location was the best point by far - 2 minutes to the Metro (less than 5 with luggage!) and 100 yards from the Moulin Rouge. It's a busy, touristy but slightly seedy area with neon lit sex shops and plenty of beggars, but this is after all a city and there was nothing unexpected in this. Montmartre is a pleasant walk uphill and we enjoyed trekking up there each day to eat and sightsee. There are plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes much nearer (within 100 yards) but we preferred to venture further.

We wanted a budget hotel in a good location - and this was ideal! Literally a 2 minute walk from the metro Place de Clichy, which was brilliant. Be prepared for a bit of a train ride if you are coming from Charles de Gaulle as i think that total journey with transfers is about 1.5 hours. We arrived at about 11pm at night, and the area is buzzing! A 2 minute walk to the Moulin Rouge and there are a number of restaurants within walking distance that serve food until late. Be aware that this area does border on a red light district, maybe not the best for little children at night! On arrival, we were given an awful room on the 1st floor, twin beds, though i had booked a double. We did not have the option of moving as the hotel was fully booked that night. The decor was old, reminded me of student halls and the carpet was horrible and sticky! When i looked out the window, I realised we had the view of the Monmartre Cemetry - a bit spooky, so make sure to request a courtyard room on arrival if this would bother you. Fortunately, the next morning on speaking to reception, we were moved to a modern 5th floor room, with wooden floors - much much nicer! Exactly what you see in the pictures on their website. The rooms are compact, but we literally only used ours as a base to sleep. Though there are 3 lifts, they are REALLY slow - we ended up climbing the stairs every day as you could wait for a lift for 10-15 minutes! The Eiffel Tower is about an hours walk, half an hour to the Arc de Triomphe - but they are all relatively close on the metro.

We had booked 2 rooms. Where as our overall experience was quite good, it did get off to a shaky start. We arrived at the hotel at about 10.30pm quite tired from travelling all day to get there. When we arrived at check in it was immediately obvious that there was a problem. The guy at the desk first said that he thought that our flight was delayed and that he wasn't expecting us until the following day. This was not the case and I asked him where he got that information from but he did not reply. He continued to work at his computer and then disappeared to the back office for a while. He reappeared to tell us that he was going to organise a taxi to take us to another hotel (the name of which I cant recall). I told him that this was not satisfactory and that we wre tired from travelling all day. I questioned him again as to where he got the information on our flights. He then changed his story to one that the rooms were being refurbished and were not handed back on time. He then progressed to tell us that he had a room in the ajoining Mercure hotel where part of our group would have to stay for that night and the other part of our group were allocated a room on the 3rd floor. We were told that in th emorning we would have to bring our baggage to reception in the morning and that we would be allocated our rooms later in the day. We reluctantly accepted this. This meant that we were unable to unpack at that stage. In the morning we double checked with reception to ensure that the arrangements still stood. We were then told that they had had found a free room next to the one we were allocated on the 3rd floor. This was fine but I informed the receptionist that when we booked the hotel months earlier that we had expressed that we wanted a room on the top floor (as a result of reviews read on Trip Advisor) with a view of the cemetary. This was followed up with a telephone confirmation at the time and a further reminder email a week before we travelled. I was informed by the receptionist that there were no family rooms on this floor. I asked why I wasn't informed of this in my 3 previous communications with them but got no response. Despite our shaky start I have to say that we enjoyed our stay at the Ibis. It has been well covered in many previous posts as to how convenint this hotel is to Montmartre, Moulin Rouge, Metro etc and it really is. Being so close to the metro makes all parts of Paris so accessible.On two days we went to Disneyland and it only involved one train change. The rooms even with a double sofa bed in it for the children left enough room to move arround it and sore our empty suitcases. We have stayed at Ibis hotels before and knew what to expect. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The only downside was that the aircon did not chill the room enough and water did not drain away in the sink quick enough. In the mornings the buffet breakfast was excellent. There was the usual continental fare - fruit drinks, coffee, tea, hot chocolate etc. Cold meats, cheese, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, cakes breads etc. The only critisism I would have that the choice became a bit monotonous after a week. Maybe a slight variation every couple of days would suffice. Although they did provide bar and restaurant facilities we did not use them and it appeared that no one else did either. Again as mentioned in previous posts you have to pay for storing baggage. This is the first time that I have ever come accross this and I believe that this is a service they should provide free of charge. Their storrage is in the form of lockers of which there are few and I dont know what you would do if these were full.

When we arrived at the hotel, the receptionist was extremely nice and friendly - we could choose between in court view or view over Paris, smoking/non smoking room. We were given room 718 (non smoking, view over Paris) - we could even check in earlier (around 11 AM). At first, my husband was a little dissapointed due to the small size of the room, the small window and basic shower/lack of toiletries. Even more, when seeing we were not soo close to the other attractions (e.g. Louvre, Notre Dame). Then, little by little, the hotel started to reveal itself to us: the room was spotless clean, the bed very comfortable, the TV had Spanish channels, the small window had a secure lock (I thought this is very comforting for families with small children). Breakfast is extremely flexible and simply great!!!! We were impressed by its quality ( from the fresh pastries to Nutella or President butter). The cleaning lady did knoked at the door; if you like to stay until late in bed (i.e. more than 11AM), there is a sign with \"Please do not disturb\" which you can hang on the door.

We ended up using the orange free wifi access with no code, but you do have to give an email address to register for that, and there are some limitations with it, but nothing that affected us for email or other general sites.

Also, there is a grocery store nearby, down the street past the Moulin Rouge (on the same side of the street) which was good. There's also a small \"suprette\" across the street, like a convenience store, but it has less selection and is more costly than the grocery store.

Its location is excellent. Very easy to get to from CDG airport-a straight train to Gare du Nord station and then a quick change on the blue line to Place du Clichy. Our room was ready early which was an advantage as we had been travelling since 4am that morning! So, after leaving our bags and a quick change, we were ready to explore the city! Place du Clichy station is only a 2 minute walk away, and the system is really easy to use to get to all of the main attractions. Our room itself was small and as mentioned in other reviews, overlooked the famous Montmarte cemetery, where the likes of Degas and other famous artists and writers are buried. This was something that didn't bother us in the slightest, but the proximity to the rooms is literally just a stone's throw away, so it may be worth requesting a different room before hand if this is something that would make you uncomfortable. Most Ibis hotels are pretty standard-no tea/coffee facilities in the room and a very weak hairdryer, so bring your own! One complaint we did have, however, were the pillows! Extremely lumpy and like sleeping on cement! Thankfully we weren't in Paris for a 'lie in' as we wouldn't have had one! The hotel is 5 minutes away from Moulin rouge and a beautiful windy, 10 minute walk to Sacre Coeur and Montmarte village. I would recommend heading up there for meals at night and lunch, rather than towards Pigalle, if you want to stay in the vicinty. Drinks and snacks in the hotel lobby were extortionately priced, so again, try to bring your own in if you need to. Overall, this hotel has a great, quirky location and we absolutely loved Paris.

Our budget was around Euro120 per night, and my requirements were simple: good location near some sights, near a metro station and CLEAN. The Ibis Montmartre seemed to be all 3 from the reviews on Tripadvisor. The Ibis did not disappoint. We stayed here on our last leg of our Paris holiday, after staying in a nice rather expensive hotel in London and Eiffel Seine near the Eiffel Tower for the 1st leg of Paris, and I was still quite impressed with what the Ibis had to offer. It was clean and the bathroom (i requested for standing shower only, with no bathtub) was spotless. The location was good for going to Moulin Rouge (we went to the 11pm show which ended around 1pm & we walked back to Ibis, felt very safe). We also walked to Sacre Couer which was a short & beautiful walk (we walked past the cemetery and a residential area & reached the back of Sacre Couer). And with the very efficient metro, it was easy to go just about everywhere. While Eiffel Seine has a nicer bed & pillows, little touches such as a nice closet, tea & coffee, mini fridge and gorgeous decor, the room in Ibis was actually slightly larger and had a lot more restaurants and shops around the area. We liked walking around the Montmartre area whereas there weren't a lot of restaurants/cafes/shops around the Eiffel Seine area. My only gripes were: flat & tiny pillows (I'm asian and am a very tiny girl too!), i requested for a view that doesn't overlook the cemetery and got one that was facing a courtyard but the problem was that it was facing the Mercure hotel lifts lobbies and hence the curtain was drawn all the time but really who cares since we were out & about most of the time. Overall, if you are on a budget and are looking for a decent hotel as a base in Paris, I would highly recommend the Ibis Montmartre.

Great location near to the metro stop of Place de Clichy. Modern purpose built building shared with seperate hotel Mercure (same chain) next door. Lovely atmospheric views over the Montmartre cemetery which added a little of the missing character to the hotel. The staff at reception were welcoming and helpful. My attempt at French to give our names and reservation details seemed appreciated though all staff we spoke to had good English. We had a room with very comfortable King sized and single bed. The room was compact but weve been in much smaller and this was good for Paris. We were going to eat out for breakfast but the breakfast at the hotel was very good value and enabled us to take something for our son when he got the munchies later. A good selection of pastries,hams,spanish omelette,fruit yoghurts etc which was better value than the croissant and coffee down the road. (Unless that is literally all you want) At the time of our stay part of the breakfast/bar area was being renovated but there was no inconvenience. Easy walk to Montmartre or take the metro to Abesses. It is probably more interesting to walk as you caqn see the shops and restaurants and find some lovely nooks and crannies to explore.On seeing the traditional carousel at the bottom of Montmartre our son said that he was too old for most carousels but not too old for a double decker one like that! You can also easily get to the Pigalle area if this floats your boat. We were not walking too late at night and the area around the Moulin Rouge was fine mainly packed with Tourists and students. Our son was more interesting in standing on the metro air vent opposite the Moulin Rouge and letting the air gush up (like the other tourists) rather than noticing anything less salubrious. Dont miss standing on the steps of Sacre Coeur up the hill and look at the views of Paris. If you want to see the Eiffel tower light up then move over to the area past the funicular stop, at the top by a little park, and stand at the railings.You can only see the Eiffel tower from there not on the Sacre Coeur steps. When we visited it lit up after dusk on the hour for ten minutes a time. It is cheesy but magical! There are plenty of places to eat around the area either right by the hotel or further up by Sacre Coeur. The only thing we were not prepared for at the end was that though you can leave your luggage after check out until you leave it is in secure coin operated lockers so you need to have 5 Euros. At least it was secure. All in all a great place to stay .If you want character or boutique touches then don't stay in an Ibis.We thought it was great for our needs and exploring Montmartre each evening and hanging about on the butte added a different more villagey atmosphere to our trip and contrasted to our days out in the heart of Paris.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGood Value and Good Location - Overall a positive experience.\u201d", "Author": "BKearns", "ReviewID": "UR82139431", "Content": "I was a long time searching online for a hotel in Paris. The trip was part business and part pleasure, and the cost was coming from my own pocket, so I was looking for somewhere affordable, but at the same time, somewhere that would be a good base for exploring Paris and for preparing work using my PC. Other reviews for hotels in the ~EU120 price range were downright scary! It seems that Paris is very expensive for accommodation, and that sub-standard budget accommodation is the norm. In any case, when I found IBIS on the net, I was surprised by the generally positively reviews, and decided to give it a try. First point - Location. The best location in Paris would be around the station Chatalet Les Halles in the centre of Paris. The train from the airport brings you directly there. Unfortunately, the hoteliers around Chatalet seem to be aware of this, so you are unlikely to find anywhere in that area costing less than EU200 per night. The train from the airport also stops at Gare du Nord, on the north east side of the city. However, it's not an ideal place to stay for sightseeing - there is not much around there to see! I thought that Mont Martre was an ideal compromise. It is a train ride from the airport to Gare du Nord, followed by one trip on the metro to the station Place de Clichy on the blue line. Mont Martre is the artisan quarter of Paris, and you will find there the kind of ambience and character that is quintessentially Parisian and which may be lacking from other more upmarket regions. There are lots of family-run restaurants in Mont Martre with terraces which will serve \u201ccroissants avec caf\u00e9 Au lait\u201d as required. If you're there on a Sunday, take a stroll to Sacre Coeur, and sit inside the church during a service to soak up the atmosphere and the resonant sonority of the tremendously large stone enclosure that forms the main vault. The hotel is a 5 min walk from the metro station, along a main road, so it is easy to find. The sign for IBIS can be seen from the station. Rooms: The funny thing is that IBIS and Mercure Hotel are actually the same building. Mercure Hotel is substantially more expensive. Both hotels have their own lifts and reception, and breakfast areas; however, they seem to have allocated the smaller rooms to IBIS and the larger rooms to Mercure. The IBIS rooms seem mostly to be on the upper floors (mine was on the 6th floor) and they mostly overlook the Mont Martre cemetery - not the best view. However, the room size was fine for two people. King size bed, small desk, clean bathroom with shower (no bath). There are no tea making facilities in the room, which was a slight annoyance, and the internet (which is free) required a USERID and PASSWORD and seemed to be scheduled to time out too frequently. On one of the evenings when I arrived, the internet service was down, which was a problem as I had some emails to send. The rooms have air conditioning, which worked fine for me, and windows which can be opened. The TV had one English channel (BBC World), and a lot of Frensh terrestrial rubbish, that would be of little interest to the non-native guests. Other features: There is not much in the line of frills about this hotel - but there are free-to-use PCs in the lobby for people who haven't brought their own PC. Also the breakfast room is a decent size, and the breakfast was not bad value for EU7.50. There are vending machines in the lobby too, but don't waste your money there, as there is a late night store directly across the road from the hotel which sells snacks, and which has a good selection of French Wines too. For breakfast or evening meals, there is a vast selection along the roade to the metro station Place de Clichy, or along the road to the Moulin Rouge. Plenty of adult shops in the area around the Moulin Rouge too, but there isn't the intimidating atmosphere of red light districts in other cities I've visited. Some of the restaurants are more foreigner friendly than others, so the best thing to do is to move on if you are greeted by a surly waiter who pretends not to understand words like COFFEE or BREAKFAST!

Prior to leaving on our holiday, I had had an email exchange with the hotel staff and made certain requests. However, none of these requests were noted against our booking. We got what we wanted but only after repeating our requests at the time of check in. Defeats the whole purpose of making the effort to make requests in advance! The room itself was nice - not very big (as expected in Paris), but neat & clean. It had a huge window over-looking the Montmartre Cemetery - we were up on the 8th floor, so mostly saw only tree tops - but that was a nice view, as well! The bathroom was small but very well finished and laid out so there was no problem using it. We could not figure out the heating system for the room - but since it was not too cold, we did not even bother to try very hard. We were, fortunately, instructed on how to use the lift - put the room key into the slot, then press the button for the floor you want to go to. But, during our stay there we noticed that several groups of people had not been told about this and were just going up and down in the lift with no clue as to why the lift was not stopping at the floor they wanted. We opted against the breakfast, instead just helped ourselves to the vending machine coffee - which was quite good. The only thing about the hotel that we found we didn't like and/or appreciate, was the overall lack of understanding of the English language so communication was not very easy (fortunately we had no problems and did not need to communicate very much). In a hotel in a place like Paris, which gets visitors from all over the world, I believe it is absolutely essential that the staff speak and understand a fair amount of English. Some of the staff at the reception were a little rude (we were there 4 nights so interacted with a lot of the staff). There is Free Wireless Internet, but again the staff can not explain how to use it. We were not carrying a laptop and I wanted to use the Wifi through my mobile, but other than saying 'Open Orange', no one seemed to know what to do. So, we didn't end up using the Internet facility.

It is a short walk downhill to the Metro, and the Metro was how we traveled everywhere (the only way to go!). At night when we needed to get taxis home from the city center, the cost was around 12 Euro. The rooms were small, but had everything we needed. This hotel has triple rooms, which was a great plus for us, traveling with such a large group. I had pleasant and easy communication by email with the staff prior to our arrival, ensuring that all our rooms were close to each other (and they were). No nasty surprises - everything was as advertised, including the cost. The breakfast buffet is a great value and I highly recommend it. Good hotel, good location, good price. As a side note, might I advise those of you traveling to Paris for sight seeing to actually take the advice you read everywhere and buy the tickets to Versailles in advance of getting there! I didn't, and ended up in line for an hour and a half! Also, bring a back pack and pack a picnic.

The front rooms belong to the Mercury Hotel which is located at the same building. Although French people has adquired a reputation for bad mood, I have found sympathetic people most of the time in Paris, it may be due to the fact that I always tried to speak in French. People on the street are not required to speak a foreign language or to be nice, but employees of a hotel must be. The weakest points of this IBIS are the quality of training and the lack of friendliness for its employees. When I complained that the heater in my room was not working, the woman who attendanted me was sarcastic, as it was impossible for someone to feel cold in spring at Paris. Only on the next day, when I complained again about the cold in my room, another attendant offered me a portable heater. Another situation occured on my check-out day, when I woke up very early and needed to have the breakfast at the hotel; I was not worry about the early time because the information was that the breakfast would start at 06:30, but when I arrived at the restaurant it was in the dark and an employee served us just some few options. Another employee who actually \"opened\" the restaurant muttered all the time and had a bad mood, it was very unpleasant. I will not come back to IBIS Montmartre: there are many hotels in Paris presenting similar price and accommodations with better training and friendly staff. By the way: IBIS presents a policy about client satisfaction intitled \"Satisfied or your room's on us\". Do not trust on this!!! I did not know about this policy because it was my first experience with IBIS and the employees did not tell me about it. When I was back home I saw about this policy in the IBIS website and wrote them about the incident with my room heater in Paris. They recognized their mistake, but instead of sending me a voucher for a free-day room, they send me a voucher of 15 \u20ac!!! Perhaps this voucher would pay a one-day breakfast at some IBIS... This is the announcement that IBIS does on its website: \"Guaranteed Maximum of 15 Minutes. Have a problem?

The room was clean and tidy, but sparse; think Travelodge style accommodation. But the money spent, ideal. Location was excellent, 5 minute walk from the Metro; ask for a front facing room if you don't want to look over the graveyard!! The only quibble I had was the \"free\" internet. You had to ask for a pass at reception; it says \"During your stay, enjoy free Wi-Fi access, in your room, in the entrance hall for 24 consecutive hours with the Pass Day.\" I had my laptop so was easy to connect. But after about an hour, I got booted off. No bother, sign back on - no, it said I had used all my hours!! Over a 48 hour period I had to go to reception about 6 times to get new passes! At one time, the male receptionist said the pass was only for an hour of free time...... yeah right, that's NOT what it says on the pass! On checking out, I wanted to leave my luggage with the hotel as my flight wasn't until 6 that night but my large suitcase wouldn't fit in their (Chargable) luggage leave.

WHAT A MISTAKE!!! Next time in Paris (what will never happen again - not because of the hotel, but because of Paris itself) I would stay only in this Ibis hotel, or any other Ibis with good reviews. We stayed on 9th floor overlooking at Monmartre cemetery, Sacre Coeur hill and other areas of Paris. The room was rather spacious, quite basic, no fridge, a TV set, well heated (a wall-mounted powerful heater is provided in the room) and ventilated. Noise insulation was good \u2013 we never heard our neighbors. All our nights were completely calm and peaceful, no noise from the street, as there was a cemetery below. A double bed was very comfortable and rather firm, what is good for a backbone. They provided a second duvet on request - I do not like to share one duvet with my wife. Pillows were ok. The bathroom was quite spacious, clean and nice, with a hair dryer, a sink, a bath tub, toilet. Good water pressure. We experienced no discomfort in the bathroom. Minor issues: sometimes shower water got hotter than adjusted, so required adjusting from time to time while taking a shower. And another issue - - a floor in the bathroom is covered with a linoleum, not tiles. An elevator is enough for 6 to 8 people. So, no complaints about an elevator. On the 6th and 7th floor they were doing renovation work, but they started at 9 am except Sundays. That was not a problem, as we left before 9 am. Even if we stayed in, it didn\u2019t bother us. Who wants cheaper meals \u2013 a Flunch chain buffet (open 11 am to 10 pm) is in the same building (see my fotos). They serve various meal at reasonable price, but food is very very basic and average, even junk (its plus is price only, not the taste). For comparison, onion soup is Paris cafes and restaurants costs 6 to 9 euros. Flunch serve grilled beef steak with an unlimited amount of salad, chips, mashed potato, beans, some other cooked vegetables (all you can pick as much as you want) for 8 euros. Steak (with salad and chips) in Paris cafes costs about 13 to 25 euros. But do not confuse steak with beef hache \u2013 hache is a minced meat like in a burger. There are two mini supermarkets on Boulevard de Batignolles \u2013 5 to 10 minutes walk from the hotel on the left side of the boulevard . Another big supermarket Carrefour (63 Boulevard de Rochechouart, 75009 Paris, France) \u2013walk on Boulevard de Clichy to Pigalle, pass Pigalle and walk one more block (the supermarket will be on the right side if walking from the hotel). Quite a good supermarket. You can buy there hot grill chicken or anything you want. It is about 15 minutes walk from the hotel. There is another supermarket you pass on the way to Carrefour - this is Monoprix.

I'd definitely advise making use of the metro, just 1.60 will get you just about anywhere from Place de Clichy with a direct line to the Arc de Triumph and connections very easy to all the main areas.

I'm sure the staff speak English if necessary. We didn't eat in the hotel, but had a few drinks in the bar. Surprisingly, it was cheaper to drink here than outside the hotel. The communal areas are air conditioned. We really appreciated the baggage store - lockers are provided at E3 or E5 - absolutely great. Hotel didn't mind us using the facilities after we'd checked out. We paid E85 each night. I thought that was great value for the location and facilities. I'd definitely stay here again.

Area is lively as well which added to it, moulin rouge etc within easy walking distance. First impressions from outside are excellent as hotel looks very modern, inside is much like any other ibis. Small seating area, nice reception etc. The gentleman that checked us in was very nice and told us to call down if we had any questions. He also asked what side we wanted to stay on, i decided that the cemetary side would be nice as i had read some reviews here about the view. He then mentioned that he had one larger room left for us on the 8th floor, i suspected that this was his customary thing to say...however our room was at the end of the corridor and was certainly big enough, looking at the floor layout attached to door infact showed our room to be substantially bigger than the others(so if your staying ask for room 800). The room itself was comfortable, the bed was very nice after a long day of sight seeing. Bathroom was spotlessly clean. We had breakfast on two of the mornings at 8euro per person.

They recommended Ibis La Defense; arrived there only to discover it was so far away from all amendities sightseeing venues and restuarants and it was very cramped. We were advised by the only nice cabdriver we have ever met in Paris, to move to Montmarte. Yes it was very central, The price however was more than La Defense (from Euros59 to Euros102. The staff at Montmarte was not very friendly, but I believe that this seems to be the norm, with all French people. Unfriendly and miserable but then considering the gloomy looks of paris, can you blame them. The rooms were very small and breakfast so standard and tasteless. Food at all Ibis hotels in Paris really leaves one wanting...... Wanting real food and they are so skimpy on food... You can either a vegetable or rice. They should visit South Africa and USA, Fantastic Spain, Brussels and even Amsterdam to experience real cuisine where we are not afraid to dish a sincerely heartwarming meal with a variety of vegetables to choose from at a darn good price. We arrived at Montmarte Ibis and were not even informed of renovations that has begun at this hotel, only to be rudely awaken every morning to drilling and knocking down of walls, without offering a discount because of the noise and inconvenience. They even had the audacity to tell us to move rooms, without any notice. We had scramble our goods together and do so within as quickly as possible, we were told, as the builders were moving to our floor. How disrespectfull and this after were have been staying here for more than 2 weeks, only because it was fairly central. We just had enough of the incompetent staff and arrogant attitudes even the housekeeping staff at ibis, just opens the doors as they please without respect. (I must add that Ibis in Brussels breakfast are way more superior and staff more friendly). We then moved to Ibis Porte de Clichy. its not that central but if you look around you will find some nice eating places in the main road and even a nice Supermarket, that will really save you some Euros if you buy your drinks there instead of spending 2 Euros on a can of cola at the hotel you can purchase a 2 litre Coke for 2Euros. They even have a indoor heated swimming pool and sauna and at least a variety of restuarants, although the food is very very plain and standard. I have been honest enjoy and be carefull of Ibis.

I can't complain about the cleanliness of the room and bathroom, the piping hot water, the general hotel or the fantastic location (just a few minutes walk and you're in the heart of Old Montmartre). HOWEVER, when I book a room with two beds, I expect to get the room I booked. I've had this problem at another Ibis hotel - they don't seem to acknowledge that two guests staying in the same room don't always want to sleep together..... We got to our room and lo and behold, it was a double. I went back to reception and was told to go back and look under the sheets as it may have been two singles pushed together (WHY didn't they know this anyway?). I duly returned and found that it was a double. I then had an argument with the receptionist stating I had specifically booked a room which had a single AND a double bed on the Accor website (they had no twin rooms left). It soon emerged they had let a family have that room and it was 'impossible' to let two people have a room that sleeps three! Pathetic - I have stayed on my own in triple rooms before. Surely you pay for the room not the number of guests anyway these days. And it was a HUGE hotel - they can't have been full. Anyway, they begrudgingly got the maid to bring in a single bed and we were crammed into a tiny room for two nights. This just about rounded off a holiday in which I was mugged on the Metro, experienced rude waiters, a lack of vegetarian food and the Eurostar was delayed on the way back.

Not so lucky were some of our friends staying in the 3rd floor (we were at 7) who had extremely tiny rooms: if they would put their suitcase next to the bed there was no space left to move. I should also mention that all rooms are double and there is no possibility of extra bed for kids over 9 or 10 years, as the 3rd bed is apparently really small. The area is great, right the the foot of Montmartre area (which is abolsutlely great, especially at night on the steps of Sacre coeur) and next to Place Pigalle (the \"red\" district).
