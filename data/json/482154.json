This was essential because we had our 18 month old with us and it was so nice to be able to put him to bed and still be able to stay up and enjoy a bottle of wine, a movie, and grab drinks from the pool bar and hang on our patio. It was almost like we were on an actual date. The pool was lovely, and yes, the whole family was there, including the dog. The front desk staff was won over by his scruffy ways and kept giving him treats. He was in heaven - especially when we took him to Ocean Dog Beach, just a short drive away. We love Kimptons! I just wish the rooms with separate living area weren't sooooo much more $. It's worth it when you have a little one - otherwise we'd have to tiptoe around in the dark for fear of waking him up or go to bed at 8pm - but it's harder on a family budget to spend that much extra on the room.

After researching areas and hotels we chose the Gaslamp Quarter of the city for it's character and cost as compared to the more expensive hotels on the beach. I had read other reviews of the Solamar and while most were good, I was a bit concerned about the area. Boy was I surprised! What a fabulous location close to everything! The hotel is in great shape with very modern decorating and amenities. The rooms were all updated, clean & comfortable. We were on the 9th floor which I would recommend as it was a non-pet floor. The rooftop pool and bar were absolutely beautiful and I wish I'd had more time to spend there. We went to the hotel restaurant Jsix for breakfast and while they had a very limited menu and it was a bit expensive, the food was excellent. The hotel has a wine hour in their lobby from 5-6 with complimentary wine. We did this both nights we were there. What a nice way to start our evening! We met so many nice people from all over the world. The area was a bit touristy and the restaurants a bit spendy, but it's not anything we didn't expect. The \"barkers\" at the front doors of every restaurant were a bit obnoxious, but the food was delicious and the bars were fun. The hotel valet parking was expensive, but there are much cheaper options conveniently located within a block of the hotel &I didn't mind not parking on site.

Our taste buds fell in love with the exquisite house-made ravoili. To our delight, the chef introduced himself to us (we love that) at our table, and our personable and perfectly attentive waitress, Jaimie, made the experience warm and friendly, which is often lost at exquisite resturants. Our man of the night, Angel, provided us with exceptional customer service, and made sure each of our accommodations were in perfect order. The rooms are very tastefully done, and the little mini bar in our 7th floor corner room was very reasonably priced. Fifteen dollars for a medium-sized bottle of Ketel. I love that this Kimpton line of hotels favors a green way of business. They buy exclusively local, and they have a rooftop garden, which the chef pointed out, provides many greens for the kitchen. We did notice signs about that noted pet friendlyness. The staff informed us that there is no extra charge for dog guests, to our surprise.

We've been to good and bad, but the Solamar is right up there with the best we've been to. It was the first time we'd been to San Diego so we booked this place on the back of reviews and it's central location, initially for a couple of days until we got our bearings. It was that good we ended booking a further two, then another day to make five in total - the only reason we didn't stay on Saturday was that it was fully booked! The rooms are a great size - we had a room with two super comfy queen beds - and the bathroom is nice too. The design of the rooms and hotel is very 'boutique' and it was right in the Gaslamp Quarter near bars and restaurants, virtually all of which are kid friendly. Despite the location, we never had any problem with noise at all. The local public transport system is excellent, a $5 pass got us on and off trolleys and buses all day to places like Sea World, SD Zoo and the outlet shopping centre on the border (well worth visiting for shopping bargains). What sets this hotel apart from other good places though is the staff - from the moment we walked in until the moment we left they made us feel like we were the only people staying. Our seven year old was asked every morning where we were off to that day, and how she'd got on when we got back every evening. No question was too much hassle, and they went out of their way to look after us, especially the girls on the front desk who re-booked us in each time for our extra nights. In an industry where too often customers are just numbers, it's a real welcome change to go somewhere where customer service is clearly something they believe in 100%. The wine at night and coffee in the mornings were nice touches too. In short, this may not be the cheapest hotel in town but we got a good deal off a late booking website for the first few days and then through the hotel themselves after that.

The restaurant has good food (organic meats, etc.), and the 4th floor pool deck is a fun place to hang out. Try the lavender lemon drop cocktail. Yum. The staff is what really makes this property a place I'll return to. Angel and Seth, at the front desk, were particularly helpful. Angel told me about a cool speakeasy-style bar not far away, and Seth gave me extra-late checkout when I really needed it. Usually when you ask for late check out, a hotel's front desk clerk MAY begrudgingly give you until 1 p.m., but Seth gave me until 3:30. My only complaint, and it's a small one, was that on a Thursday afternoon in early February, there was no food service at the pool. (It was a beautiful, warm, sunny afternoon.) Nor was there even a menu available to check, and you couldn't get room service at the pool. I had to go to my room, read the menu (the hotel web site doesn't even offer a menu), call the hotel restaurant, have them call my cell phone when my food was ready, then go down and pick it up. Again, it's a small complaint. To summarize: Excellent service, ideal location, comfortable and slightly hip place to stay, with reasonable prices.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Humble, Texas", "Title": "\u201cComfort of home\u201d", "Author": "Carolyn L", "ReviewID": "UR124345110", "Content": "I'm quite particular concerning hotels but was not at all disappointed at Hotel Solamar.

There is a self-park lo directly across the street for $25 but the lot closes at midnight and I don't think there are in/out privileges. The only hiccup to the stay was my room keys were deactivated in the middle of my stay. The one thing I really didn't like are the horrible soap dispensers. There is no bar soap provided, only poorly working pump dispensers in the shower (impossible to identify the soap form the shampoo from the conditioner if you wear glasses). The sink only had a pump bottle of soap and no other amenities - just a price list of items they sell. I ended up walking down to the nearby CVS drugstore and bought soap. Another thing, if you are travelling with kids, you might not like one aspect of the room set-up where they have a bar (not free) that has several mid-size bottles of liquor and wine sitting out in the open along with snacks.

I think I had a uniquely poor experience which I would perhaps blame on Murphy's Law and the Thanksgiving holiday. My boyfriend and I had Thanksgiving to ourselves - no kids, no family this year, so we decided to take a little adult vacation for turkey day. We arrived on Tuesday the 22nd of November, two days before the holiday. The hotel was located on the border of the up and coming East Side Village, the Gas Lamp, the ball park and the convention center. They do not have a parking garage unless you valet, but there are two or three parking lots, with varying daily rates, right near by. This was the first thing that struck me as unfortunate but not something that was worth much more thought. The hotel itself was nice, modern and clean. They also take pets here - which was really cool to see a nicely kept property to offer. They also keep the top two floors of the property absolutely free of pets, so if you are not a fan of pet hair and dander, you have your own sanctuary. That being said, I never heard a single pup nor did I witness or experience any poor interaction with any bad pet owners or pets. Our check in person was very sweet and explained to us that the hotel was taking advantage of the quiet time during the holiday to do some repairs and renovations. She offered us a bottle of wine to say thank you in advance for any inconvenience, she also offered us two complimentary continental breakfasts from the in house restaurant J-six. Unfortunately for the hotel, we are well versed in wine and I can promise you that we would not regift or even use this bottle of wine for sangria - it was shwag, but we appreciated the gesture. Overall, our stay at the hotel was great. It was a clean and quiet place to rest our head at the end of our nights. Our main issue really came down to a problem with the complimentary continental breakfast and the restaurant J-six. We came into the restaurant on the third day, on the 24th for our complimentary breakfast. We stood in a very empty restaurant that appeared to be without a hostess. We wanted to get our breakfast to-go so we could enjoy it back up in our room. We figured this would be easy to take care of. We waited for about 10 minutes at an empty bar until a hostess appeared. She apologized for the delayed attention and explained she was new and that the one server on hand was having a bad day. The hostess offered to take our order but was immediately confused and completely unknowledgeable about the comp. continental - or what a continental breakfast was comprised of. This was the first time in my relationship where I gave my boyfriend the green light to raise hell about this restaurants total incompetence; this was after I watched the hostess and the manager grab our food from the open kitchen with their bare hands and dumping our food into to-go containers. What freaked me out more was that the chef in the kitchen did not even try to stop them from putting their unwashed hands into his food. We did not eat the breakfast, nor did we ever step foot back into J-six. We also spoke to the front desk and said we were disappointed about the miscommunication about this complimentary breakfast program. The hotel tried their best to right the wrong with us by sending us another horrible bottle of wine and covering our valet parking for the entirety of our stay. The restaurant manager, the one who touched our food, gave my boyfriend a contrived apology by phone. So, we were miffed, hungry, and disappointed, but as for the hotel itself, I would not steer anyone away from the great value and location, but I would recommend dining at any of the many restaurants within walking distance over J-six.

There's a really nice park close by at Petco Stadium. Dogs are allowed there and there is security walking around. Also, enjoyed taking the dogs to the Gaslamp district where we had lunch. We were able to tie them to the railing in the outdoor patio of the restaurant so the dogs could be with us. Had great food at La Fiesta (Mexican Cruisine and Lounge) and also at the Italian restaurant connected with it. One restaurant down. The hotel is really comfortable and give nice comfortable beds for the dogs which also match the decor of the room. Also furnished doggie food/water dishes and lots of tasty treats - a whole assortment of them. Loved the welcome VIP pet signs. Enjoyed seeing all the names of the pets staying there. Also, found the staff to be really friendly, customer focused and all seemed to love the pets too. You can tell the staff love working there. This is the third Kimpton hotel we have stayed at and we loved it. Love the out of the box ideas the hotel has like providing a goldfish for those who miss there pets, late checkout on Sundays, no parking fees for hybrid cars, etc. Kimpton hotels stand out from the rest. Oh! and they don't charge pet fees. Incredible. Another nice touch which was a surprise was that on Christmas day, since the restaurant was closed, they provided all the guests a complimentary continental breakfast. Really enjoyed it and got to meet some of the other guests while eating near the fireplace. Felt at home there and am looking forward to returning. Only wish there were more Kimpton hotels all over the place. Would always stay there if there was.

Let me start off by saying that there are a lot of positive things about the hotel. Great location in the heart of the Gaslamp district, if that is where you want to stay. Walking distance to shops, restaurants, ballpark, etc. Also, the staff is incredibly friendly in general. And there are lots of extras, like the happy hour in the lobby every evening, and coffee/tea in the morning. Rooms are pretty nice, not extremely luxurious, but there are some touches that put it above an average room, and well-maintained and clean. I wish that my review could end there. However, there were a lot of issues that occurred during our stay there that caused great frustration. The first thing that guests should be aware of is that the rooms are not that well-insulated from the noise from weekend partying. We had a supposedly \"quiet\" room, and even though our room was away from the main street, it was very loud in our room from the music blasting from the rooftop bar nearby. It kept us until 1 or 2 am! Also, we had some problems with the cable not working in one room, and the pocket doors from the suite not working in another room. It forced us to switch rooms which was inconvenient. But really the final straw is that one day we left our room at noon, REMOVED the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign from our door, and then came back to our room at 5pm. We called the front desk and said that nothing could be done for us except they could bring fresh towels. They said that it was hotel policy that once the housekeeping passes your room, we would have to make a request to have our room cleaned. We had no idea that housekeeping already passed our room! We were really upset about this. Later another staff person said that they cleaned our rooms early in the morning and then made another pass around our room (before 12 noon) but still saw the DND sign so left us alone. I have stayed at a LOT of hotels, many more than I have time to post about on TripAdvisor, and this has never happened to me - how was I supposed to know what time they went by our room and therefore was supposed to request housekeeping? I think leaving the room at noon is completely reasonable sometimes when you're on vacation - ESPECIALLY when you've been kept up until 1am with noise from the outside. I don't know why it wouldn't be hotel policy to just make sure all the rooms are cleaned until specifically requested otherwise? Very upsetting. The only reason this hotel didn't get two stars is that they handled the situation well afterwards. The front desk manager was very nice and made some appropriate accommodations. Just a final note: I think the parking rate is expensive, but completely within reason for the area.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa, California", "Title": "\u201cNice place, but not quite our style\u201d", "Author": "Love_Travel_39", "ReviewID": "UR121555092", "Content": "This is a very trendy and cute boutique hotel, and it has a clean and unique style that we really like. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable, but the rooms are just average sized and they don't have suites, so if you like a bigger room to lounge-around in you might think that the rooms are not big enough. The staff is very friendly and professional, and of course the location is what makes this hotel so appealing. The prices at the Solamar can be quite high sometimes, so if you are just looking for a decent place in the Gaslamp district I would recommend checking out the many Hilton and Marriott hotels also located throughout the Gaslamp, because they often have much better prices. Hotel prices in San Diego fluctuate *dramatically* depending on the time of year, tourist season, and when the city is less full vs. the times it gets booked-up due to a large convention or major sporting event, so if the timing of your trip is flexible and the prices seem surprisingly high you might want to check the hotel prices for different possible times that work for you. The Solamar has a wine hour every evening, which is a nice thing to offer, and the wine was fine, but there wasn't quite enough room for all of the people so it was a little on the crowded side, and they shut that wine bar down the very second the scheduled hour is over. They also have a rooftop bar at night, out where the pool is, and we were looking forward to enjoying a drink there at the end of our day, but it was definitely not our scene - it was crowded with people in their 20's, dressed to get attention, dramatic and flirty, and the music they had was loud pumping club music. It was interesting people watching, but it was not our thing so we left after one quick drink. If you like a trendy place, in a great location, and might enjoy the club scene at their rooftop bar this would be a great place for you. If you are just looking for a nice clean place right in the middle of the Gaslamp district this can be a great choice, except for the fact that at times the prices at the Solamar are much higher than the other perfectly nice standard hotels nearby.

I came in without a reservation, completely exhausted and the front desk staff was so helpful. The rooms are a bit smaller, but it is considered a boutique hotel. The bathroom was perfect! Nicer brand of shampoo and soap set. Also, if you forget certain items, they will bring them to you for FREE. Even use of a strait iron!! There are so many perks to this hotel!

We enjoyed the rooftop pool/bar/cabana area very much. This hotel is dog friendly but there are certain floors dedicated as \"dog free\". I would definitely stay here again for business or pleasure. My one \"gripe\" was the outrageous cost of parking a car. At $35 per night I felt it was pratically extortion! It cost me less to rent the car for 4 days than to park it. This is not an inexpensive hotel in terms of room costs, so to charge that kind of a fee was really an insult. They are located in a very busy area so maybe they feel they can get it. However, those not staying there certainly have other, cheaper, short term parking options. They retrieved my car VERY quickly whenever I needed it (maybe mine was the only one down there). My final thoughts are definitely stay there as you can walk to most downtown locations. The red trolly can get you to other outlying areas.

Beds are amazingly comfortable and rooms are spacious. The only drawback is the weekend party scene at the pool bar area on the weekends. I was fortunate to asked to be moved and as the hotel was not full, they moved me to a quieter room on the side away from the pool.

This may have been the best hotel stay in my entire life, and certainly on this trip. The hotel obviously is aiming to go out of it's way to please it's guests and aim for return customers. I often joked with my wife that I felt like I could walk up to the front desk and ask for anything and my wish would be granted. First of all, the room: Perfect. We asked for a \"quiet\" room, an absolute must in this hotel. There are rooms facing the pool which will keep you up nights. y asking for a \"quiet room\" you will not have this problem. Our room faced the Gaslamp area, there was a nightclub across the street, but the room had some type of sound insulation so I didn't really hear any music from the outdoor nightclub. The bed was great, comfy chairs, and a minibar fridge I kept food in without any trouble. The pool area is fantastic. Every day I sat at the pool in a free cabana, read the paper, a book, or used the free internet service. At times I was alone at the pool, enjoying a drink or just cold water. There is a pool waitress but she doesn't bug you. At 5 pm everyday they have free wine. I usually got a glass, brought it to my room, and saved it for my wife, who was at a convention till 6 or 7 pm. One night she arrived at the wine tasting at 6:05 pm, they had closed, so the desk gave her coupons for 2 free glasses at the restaurant. THe service aspect is extraordinaire! I went to a number of amazing restaurants in San DIego (including the hotel's). A few times I brought back leftovers. The next day, I went to the front desk, I asked them to \"warm up\" the leftovers, and a few minutes later I was handed back the food on a tray with fine china, with utensils and a glass of ice water, all for free! The hotel is in an absolutely perfect spot, near the waterfront, the convention center, Petco Park, and about 300 restaurants in the gas-lamp. It is convenient to use public transportation to get to the zoo, Balboa park, or Seaworld. We liked the Solamar so much, when our trip was supposed to end, I went to the front desk and inquired about extending our stay for 2 extra days. The manager let us stay in the same room, and gave us a discounted rate due to our loyalty. I will stay at Kimpton hotels from now on and the Solamar whenever I return to San DIego.

Cons: The modern bathroom sink has a high faucet and shallow sink, which means that water will ALWAYS splash on you/your clothes; The sink counter is simply too high for shorter people (I am 5'3\") so it's very hard to use; The room had a musty smell; There is no coffee maker in the room - only in the lobby - so if you need coffee before you face people for the day, you're out of luck; The room could really use more lights; No dresser (but large closet); Not enough staff at the pool bar/restaurant so you have to wait a long time to get served.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay and what a great location!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jennifer L", "ReviewID": "UR119841582", "Content": "What a wonderful hotel!

When we were finally hungry and ready to hit the city, we met Angel at the front desk who spent so much time giving us fantastic food and fun ideas! He suggested a budget friendly lunch spot and recommended taking it to go so we could have a romantic picnic in the baseball park!!

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay. The hotel is clean and well-appointed. Although I was initially a bit skeptical about its location upon pulling up to the hotel (it faces a not-so-attractive parking lot), I quickly changed my mind. It's a short walk to all major attractions in the Gaslamp quarter... something that comes in very handy when you're pulling along two small kids. Our room wasn't ready until well past check-in time, which was initially annoying. Luckily, my mother-in-law's room was ready to go so we had somewhere to relax while we waited. We stayed in a King suite that faced Petco stadium, and my mother-in-law stayed in a King room facing the pool. The King suite was phenomenal for a family - there were large flat screens and DVD players in both the bedroom and in the adjoining room where the kids stayed. Although our suite was very quiet, my mother-in-law commented that her room was noisy at night. Although there was a wedding at the hotel that night, the noise issue seems to arise fairly frequently based on past TripAdvisor reviews. If we return, I will be sure to request a room on the quiet side of the hotel to avoid the noise issue. The pool area was well-appointed and had a hip, twenty-something vibe. Fortunately for my pool-loving kids, they always felt welcome and there were often other kids swimming along with them in the pool. It was a great place to relax at the end of a busy day. We also loved the free wine reception each evening - a great feature. The biggest standout out about this hotel was the employees - they were phenomenal. The front desk was always there to help, and they were great at giving us tips for family-friendly restaurants in the area (definitely try the Broken Yolk cafe a block away for breakfast - but get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid a wait). The valet guys were particularly exceptional - incredibly friendly and helpful. One day, my four year-old daughter was skipping up the front walkway back into the hotel. One of the valets saw her, came out from behind the desk and skipped with her to the front door to open it for her - it made her (and my) day. Great guys.

The Solamar is set in the historic Gaslamp area of San Diego with plenty of restaurants and bars in the area in addition to the hotels facilities. The prices in the areas vary the Old Spaghetti House offered great value for money on the higher price side Donavans Prime Seafood was expensive but first class dinning for breakfast in addition to the hotel try the Broken Yoke one block down. Rooms at the Solamar were comfortable free coffee was available in the lobby in the mornings with water and juices at other times. Parking is the main draw back in the area there is some public parking in the area as well as some on street however overnight parking was not readily available and where it was this was expensive so the $36 a night valet parking was reasonable value for hotel guests. The valet parking guys were friendly and helpful and always asked if you needed any directions when handing over your vehicle.

I booked a suite because we were going to need a portable crib and my Mom was staying with us. The room was awfully tiny for a \"suite\". It did have sliding doors that separating the \"living area\" with a pull out couch from the bedroom area. It worked out fine in the end, it was just tiny. We went straight downstairs because my daughter was starving. We walked into JSix without a reservation. There were plenty of tables available and seemed like a really slow evening. They were horrible to us ... I had to ask 4 times before we were finally sat. I had to ask random people walking by for water and bread at least. They finally sent over the hostess with a pitcher of water of which she spilled all over the table (no big deal but she obviously was just the hostess ... poor thing). After not being waited on by an actual waiter we ended up leaving. There are plenty other restaurants to go to in the are ... so just make sure you skip this one. My mom went upstairs with my daughter and ordered them room service which she said was perfect and came quickly. :-) When we went to sleep I could hear club music until the early morning and we were on quite a high floor. Nothing they could do ... that is the part of San Diego I chose to stay in but this is just a heads up. My husband and I woke up early and went downstairs for the free coffee in the lobby and a quick smoke. The valet guy ran around looking for a lighter for us. Very nice ... We went for a swim about 10 am and the pool area was nice but was still a mess from the evening bar/club by the pool thing the night before. Only one staff member was casually putting pillow covers back on. Maybe I shouldn't judge as it was only 10 am.

Though i had to wait for my room, when i received my room at 3pm it was spotless and tidy as usual. This is what one should expect from a 4.5-5 star hotel. The lobby of this hotel is amazing. Rich woods, comfortable chairs and sofas, it felt like home or better. There was free water and spritzers in the lobby, which was refreshing in the San Diego summer heat. However, the hotel lobby and rooms are well air-conditioned, making the Solamar a welcoming oasis from normal life. Katie or Kelsie (i think that was her name) was the nicest hotel clerk i've ever met. These people here will do whatever it takes to make your stay top-notch, leaving nothing to chance. I got to stay in the Master Suite this time, and it was worth every penny. Spa tub next to a window, just when does a hotel have that? The Suites could be larger but the price is already at a value. Affordable, not inexpensive but not expensive at all, considering the total package received. I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member and they give you $10 in room service snacks (it's called the \"Honor Bar\") so i always deduct $10 from the room price. These gestures by the hotel are nice, and nice needs to always be recognized. I totally recommend this Kimpton above all other Kimptons (although i recommend those too that i've stayed at), and definitely over 99% of all other hotels i've stayed at. The beds are super comfy, everything spotless and chic in the hotel, and there is not a single thing i can find wrong with anything the entire time during both my stays.

Over four nights, we were only able to get the room temperature to stay comfortable once. The other three nights the thermostat reset in the middle of the night and the temperature in our room went up by 8 - 10 degrees leading to overheating under the very thick duvet. These design flaws were annoying, but the attitude of the staff at the pool/bar area was unacceptable. My wife went down to read and relax on the pool deck one morning.

We had a King Suite for the first 4 nights and loved it. Room 1017. The room was nice and large and super quiet. We never heard anything, except for someone getting ice one night across the hallway. Bed slept wonderful and everything was super clean. Outside our window we could see Petco Park to the right. The one problem we had with this room was the TV signal kept going out. We called the front desk and they sent someone up right then to check on it and said it couldn't be fixed, it was just a bad reception in that room. So after four days of the TV going off in the middle of a program, I asked the front desk to move us. Which they did, but to another King Room, (1027) not a suite. They didn't have another King Pet Free Suite availiable for us. We asked for a Pet Free room when we made reservations at the Solamar and found out that the top two floors at this hotel are Pet Free. And there is only one King Suites on each of these two floors. Anyway, the King Room that they moved us too was just as nice and have a view of the pool area. And yes, the TV worked great. They also discounted our last two night there because of the TV problem. We are really picky about where we stay and we felt the Hotel Solamar meet all our needs. Solamar is on 6th Street and if you walk one street over onto 5th Street you can find every kind of place you could think of too eat, just wonderful. The Broken Yoke is a short walk down 6th Street, wonderful for breakfast and lunch. Get there before 8 am and beat the morning breakfast rush. You can easily walk to Petco Park and the Trolley and buses are always available to you too.

The property: This is a new looking and feeling hotel, in a great location for access to Petco Stadium and the good restaurants in the Gaslamp Quarter. The lobby is very nice with fireplaces, comfortable seating and a quiet relaxing vibe. The best feature is the pool deck with its cabanas, bar and seating area. Although the pool is not large and there aren't as many loungers as might be needed for a lot of guests to sun and swim, it is lovely place to spend the day, with a nice selection of food and drinks available and pretty good service most of the time. The standard room: I had a king room facing the pool deck on the top floor. It was a nice enough view of the pool and Petco, as well as the streets of the Gaslamp district. Being able to open the window for some fresh air was a nice little feature, although on Saturday evening, the bar was lively enough that I had to shut the window for some shuteye.

Plain and simple. My boyfriend and I are beach people, but as a cost-saving measure we decided to book the first night of our three night stay in San Diego at a downtown hotel (Solamar). It was love at first sight, and that was just the beginning. The staff are exceptional - friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. I was greeted with a smile whenever and wherever I ran across an employee. The little extras? 1. Unlimited ice cold chamomile apple juice iced tea at check-in. AMAZING. Having a little sip of magnificence after a rough flight was just what I needed. 2. A hosted happy hour with a red wine, white wine, AND sangria. My group of three all selected the Voigner before seeing the sangria option. We were totally bummed, assuming we had missed our one shot at a beverage that looked earth-shatteringly incredible. NOPE! Before we finished plotting a way to beg the \"bartender\" for a small sip of the sangria, he offered to top us all off. And by top us all off, I mean completely refill our empty glasses. We told him we would love to try the sangria instead, and he poured us three heaping glasses of the magical elixir. It was a pink sangria made with watermelon and strawberry puree, Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, and a few other odds and ends. I have never tasted anything that good in my life. 3. A pool and lounge area that is lively during the afternoon and evening, but dead quiet in the early morning as the sun begins to shine down upon it. It's a perfect place for a morning tea and a book read. 4. A leopard robe in the room (wish there had been two of them though...) The rooms are hip, modern, spacious, and fun to spend time in. They do not smell like hotel (you know what I mean), and they actually made me forget about the beach for a while, which is a near impossible feat. My one complaint (and it's a tiny one) is that the walls are a bit thin. I could hear the people next door singing Marine songs to their kid (a new recruit?) until the wee hours. The windows are solid though -- When shut you can't hear any of the pool noise below (at least not from the 9th floor). All in all, a solid 5 stars, a GREAT deal for the money, and you can't beat the downtown location -- just steps from the Padres field and The Mission (one of the best breakfasts in town).

I would definitely recommend joining the Kimpton In Touch loyalty program as it gives you free wifi and a $10 minibar credit. We were reminded of these freebies and the wine hour when we checked in which was a nice touch. The only criticism we had of the hotel was the parking. It is $35 per night, valet only. The thing that really annoyed us about this was the signs outside offering all day (8hrs) parking to the general public for $10, this adds up to $30 for 24 hours which is cheaper than the rate the hotel guests are paying!!

My husband got ill (nothing serious, but he did require medication) and we asked where we could go for medical help, not only did we get directions to Urgent Care printed out for us, but our wonderful Erica called the office for us to let them know we were on our wY, making sure they would still be open for us! Upon our arrival at this hotel, we were very warmly welcomed by Kyle who answered all of our questions, making sure that our room requests were met! When our luggage was delivered to our room, James took the time to explain for us the wonderful places we should visit should we rent a car! Dining at JSix was also a wonderful experience! Our servers have been excellent with consistent service each time we have had breakfast or dinner. Our servers have been:Kristen, Jamie and Josie. The Maitre'd is amazing, recognizing and welcoming us each time we arrived. The nightly wine tasting is also a really nice touch. We've enjoyed sitting around relaxing as well as bringing up our wine to enjoy in our room We cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff and the hotel property itself. The location is excellent with us being close to major attractions and amazing dining options We have absolutely nothing negative to say about the outstanding service we have received during our stay here. What is especially nice is that we get to enjoy another 4 nights here to be well taken care of and pampered! We HIGHLY recommend this hotel as being an excellent choice for accommodations in San Diego! We would come back here in an instant. The level of service that we have experienced from housekeeping, to the Front Desk, to dining in JSixakes it extremely easy to recommend that any guests who choose to stay at the Hotel Solamar will not be disappointed!", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, USA", "Title": "\u201cCustomer Service issue resolved\u201d", "Author": "cello626", "ReviewID": "UR107308289", "Content": "Stayed at this property for 1 night at the end of my anniversary celebration.

Free coffee and hot water for tea was available every morning near the front desk, plus an assortment of complimentary newspapers. Nice touch ! The hotel is located in the heart of San Diego's Gas Lamp district which offers a plethora of restaurants and retail stores. Although the Solamar has a restaurant, I would rate the food as average. We stopped in after an evening baseball game hoping for good snacking food, such as burgers, wings, etc. but the menu offerings were slim. The restaurant's bar offers plenty of seating, but prices are a little high. Better to stop into the 7/11 a couple of blocks away... or the corner liquor store to get your adult beverages. Other than being disappointed because of a lack of cuisine variety, my only other negative is the hotel's fitness center...three treadmills, a rack of dumbell weights and a couple of exercise mats.

It all lacked flavor. Just a little thing. Thei bathroom in the lobby's soap dispensers were missing their spouts. So soap was dripping all over the granite.

Not only did they ignore my note but they didn't leave anything the 2nd day. There was dust on the lamp base, the bed was not smoothed out and pillows were not refreshed. Housekeeping didn't hang up the robe, and the side table top was crooked for the entire stay. * No concierge service - must wait for Front Desk to ask about restaurants, sightseeing, etc * No turn-down service * Wine reception served a low quality Cabernet (can't comment on the white wine option) * No airport shuttle service. Other notes: on our check-in, we entered the elevator with one gentleman already on it. Before we reached our floor, he slumped over, hit his head on the rail. I am certain that he had a stroke. At our floor (5), I kept the elevator open and my husband went to find help. I repeatedly pushed the emergency button on the elevator but no help arrived. A housekeeping staff arrived and took the man down and when we asked later, the Front Desk employee made light of the situation and I found out that an ambulance was not called to attend. It was very traumatic for my 9-year old and he refused to take the elevator after that - thank goodness we were only on the 5th floor. The hotel doesn't know what it wants to be. The room decor was a mix of shabby chic, spa fresh and other design elements. It didn't go together. The hotel feels like it wants to be a 4-star but with the lack of service, it is really just a 3-star with a 4/5 star price.

Once we arrived our request for a pet free room was met and we were treated with care and dignity. We had a great room on the 10th floor that even had a peek-a-boo view of the marina. We went down to the roof top pool after dark in our suits and were embarrassed to find no hot tub and a party crowd at the bar fully clothed. No one was in the pool and we would have felt out of place so we returned to our room. We ate lunch at Mary Jane's in the Hard rock hotel in walking distance. Fabulous food! Best cheeseburger ever. I am not a foodie but could not stop talking about it. My husband had a breakfast meal that he quite enjoyed. We went to Broken Yolk right next to the hotel for breakfast the following morning. We had heard they got rewarded as a best breakfast place in San Diego. We were very disappointed. The waffle was nothing more than an ego waffle, the egg looked microwaved, and we received very poor service. I'd definitely walk down to Mary Janes for a much better breakfast. Enjoyed walking in Gaslamp Quarter. We had dinner at the Spaghetti Factory. Seaport Village is also in walking distance and quite lively during the day. I even walked Down Seaport to get a glimpse of our cruise ship In the morning. There were a lot of exersizers out. I enjoyed the morning walk along the marina. We took the ferry to Coronado. If you do this be sure to read the times it picks up before buying the tickets. We had to wait an hour. We had a great time in Coronado then we returned at the time our ferry driver had told us a ferry would be there. We ended up on a ferry going downtown to the other location. The driver was very mean to us when we asked if the ferry would continue on to where we got on. We had to get off and walk. It took us an hour to walk to where we had got on. However, we actually enjoyed walking along Seaport Village. In the future I'd probably get a taxi or rental car. Anyway, point being the opportunities surrounding Solamar are limitless.

The great location is a walking distance to Petco Park, the Convention Center, the Red Car, and Gaslamp District. Our suite had awesome views of the city, Point Loma, and the Coronado Bay Bridge. Complemtary wine and snacks is served in the lobby at 6 p.m. but get there early if you want a seat. There is a nice roof top lounge, but due to bad weather (rain and COLD), there were no takers that weekend. The staff was excellent and helpful and they cater to VIPs (Very Important Pets). They also prove thick leopard pattern robes. The highlight of my trip was soaking in the tub with candles and champagne while watching the rain and enjoying the skylight of San Diego. This is our first stay in a \"trendy\" hotel and while it's not our thing (we perfer historic/old skool hotels) it was a very nice treat. The downside: You'll have to either order room service for coffee ($5 for a cup) or get your own in the lobby as there is NO in-room coffee pot -a shame for paying $300 a night. The couch was uncomfortable, and there is a $35 per night validated car park. Although the bathroom was outstanding and had the best view of the city, the mirror had streaks on it and the shower is in need of a good scrubdown as it was very slippery. The sink was not practical as water splashed all over yourself, the counter and the mirror.

This was for a 3-day getaway to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary. Per recommendations on this site, we signed up for the Kimpton InTouch loyalty program...which proved to be a great move. We were given a $10 credit to the mini-bar and free wi-fi. How cool is that? The hotel itself is really wonderful, pristine, great decor (classy but not stuffy). We were a bit apprehensive about the fact that they allow pets (we had a truly miserable experience at another hotel years ago...dog in adjacent room barked...and barked...and barked some more), but it turns out that the top two floors are \"reserved for 2-legged guests only\". Hotel staff had set aside a quiet room on the top floor for us, and included complimentary wine & chocolates for my wife & I. Very classy touch. The only drag was parking. It's valet only, and costs $35/day. Many downtown hotels charge for parking these days (kinda the hotel industry version of baggage fees, I suppose), but it really is a bummer - particularly when they don't even offer self parking. I suggested to them that part of the Kimpton loyalty program perks could be a discount on the parking rate...I think that would go a long way toward generating loyalty!

I feel that this will be a more helpful review if I just go through the list. Cleanliness- 5/5 Our room was spotless, and although Hotel Solamar is pet friendly, they do have floors that are entirely pet free. I love both options. My fiance loved the room at Solamar compared our room in Huntington Beach (non-Kimpton hotel, but in the same class), he felt like the design was better, and he even mentioned that the grout was clean in the Solamar bathroom vs HB. Location- 5/5 Located in the Gaslamp Quarter, its a short walk to everything- coffee, food, shopping. The restaurants are a plenty here and Petco park (Padres) are just 2 blocks away. It was far enough to not have to deal with listening to the party all night long, but close enough to walk to the party and walk back. Rooms- 5/5 I touched on this a little bit reviewing cleanliness, our room was spacious, comfortable. Our pillows were amazing and the comforter on the bed had the perfect balance of weight and warmth. I didn't touch the thermostat once. (I stayed in Huntington Beach for 2 nights prior to staying at Hotel Solamar for 2 nights, and the room was a sweat box walking in, but turned into an ice box if you turned on the a/c.) Our shower was nice and pressurized so I could wash the shampoo and conditioner out- very important for the ladies out there. Service- 6/5 Here is where I normally don't expect to have my expectations exceeded. Hotel Solamar staff goes beyond doing their job right, they want to make sure you're happy. Quick good service, helping out others when they are short handed- they care about their job and they care about the hotel, which shows through. I have many stories from my 2 night stay, but I'll just post one(below) and I am a nobody- just a regular Joe schmoe, staying at Hotel Solamar. <I called down for room service at peak time (6:30pm on a Friday night). The phone rang less than 5 times, and the front desk picked it up to let me know the kitchen would have to call me back, they were busy. I figured I'd just call down again in 10 mins or so. Before I could, I did receive a call back, and it was the front desk again. The in-room dining services was busy, but the front desk person offered to take my order and see if he could get it in for me, otherwise he'd have them call me. It felt less than 5 mins, I had a knock on the door. It was room service with my order! I couldn't believe I never had to talk to the in-dining services team once, and I got my order.> It was delicious by the way- I picked their seasonal vegetable ravioli- very good. Value- 6/5 I made my reservations on the Kimpton website- they were offering special pricing, I booked 2 nights for ~$110. Valet parking was $35/day w/in & out privileges, daily for $15. Parking across the street in the lot was $15/daytime, $15/night-time, no in & out, have to pay every 12 hours. I picked valet at the hotel. Sleep Quality- 5/5 I touched on this in the room review above, but the bed was very comfortable, pillows and comforter was perfect. I felt the key is having a good HVAC system, so the room is not too cold/warm- what I appreciated was it didn't blow directly on me/the bed when the fan auto turned on. I hope you travelers out there choose this hotel for your San Diego stay. JSix is a great restaurant, and I wish I could have tried more dishes, but I didn't have enough time.

In fact, one of my favorite hotels is a Kimpton (shoutout to the Burnham Hotel in Chicago!) After staying at a dozen or so Kimptons in half a dozen cities (some cities have more than one Kimpton hotel), I have come to realize that not all Kimpton hotels have the same standards. Sadly, I must put the San Diego Solamar in the \"lower standard\" category. Maybe it was nicer a few years ago when it was newer; but, it's in decline now. A few positives: central location; coffee in the morning; wine in the early evening; free NY Times (even Sunday edition); outdoor patio; good wireless reception throughout building; nice enough front-desk staff. Now for the not-so-positive: the mattresses are old and need replacement (or flipping): there are large indentations from where people have slept. The rooms are spare: perhaps this isn't much of an issue except that Kimpton touts itself as being stylish--hotel pictures show a lovely room with pillow shams and blanket throws but, the rooms no longer contain these items. Also, cabinet doors didn't close properly because the hinges were loose and worn. The carpet leading into the room was bare and torn. These small things contributed to an overall feeling of decline; maybe the room was pretty nice five years ago but now it seems a little bit shabby. Another negative: I'm a Kimpton InTouch member and the paper wasn't delivered to my door. Again, this is a small thing but 1) this is a service that Kimpton touts and 2) small things like this add up to a general sense of dissatisfaction.

We got the the hotel late Thursday night, so checking in was a breeze. However, once we went up to our room, we noticed that our window was facing the hotel's fourth floor lounge. Being light sleepers, I called down to the front desk and asked to be switched to another room. Bam, done. Five minutes later, someone came upstairs with our new room key and escorted us there. All the rooms have free internet, which is a plus (well, free if you sign up for Kimpton's loyalty program). Would I stay here again? Definitely, and would definitely consider other Kimpton properties in other cities.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - excellent stay\u201d", "Author": "tommy25", "ReviewID": "UR91477051", "Content": "Just finished a wonderful stay at this hotel with my family. We stayed over New Year's wtih our little kids. The location is great - in the heart of the Gas Lamp district and close to the convention center and many restaurants. I have never had more friendly/helpful valets and hotel staff at a hotel as I have experienced during this stay. The rooms were comfortable and decently sized. Valet parking was $35 per day - so we instead parked further down the street at an ACE parking garage which worked well and cost $17 per day. The hotel had great coffee in the lobby each morning and we absolutely loved the wine hour (each night between 5 and 6pm). We asked for a quiet room - and ended up on the 8th floor. The pool deck was really loud over new year's eve from the party there - but we expected that. The hotel staff were great for restaurant recommendations. We ate at the Tin Fish - good fish and chips. Broken Yolk - excellent breakfast - right next to the hotel - we highly recommend this place (I think it was even featured on Man vs. Food. Rockin Baja Lobster restaurant - awful food and service - but loud enough to have to eat there with our kids. Joe's Crab Shack - was fine. Saffron - (on India street) excellent Thai takeaway - especially the grilled Thai chicken - great if you have a car. A few cons though: 1) Expensive valet fees 2) The room smelled a little funny. 3) My wife's allergies acted up during our stay - prob because this is a very pet friendly hotel. After some claritin, she was fine though. 4) No locks on the bathroom doors - I don't get this. Is this a boutique hotel thing?

Nice bathroom with jacuzzi bath and really big comfortable bed.

The hotel location is excellent, right in the middle of the gaslamp district which has loads of bars and restaurants, felt really safe. We even found a secret bar, Vin de Syrah, which was recommended to us by one of the other guests during wine hour which was a really cool place. We had breakfast at the broken yolk cafe which was a few doors down, amazing portions and good tasty food, although service was a bit slow. We had dinner in the Royal Thai Restaurant on 5th Avenue which was really good. Would also recommend the zoo if you have time, we had a couple of hours in the morning and went to see the pandas but you could spend all day there, great zoo and beautiful location and surroundings. Would thoroughly recommend the Solamar as a great place to stay for the service and location which are both excellent.

Don't face the pool if you don't like noise, at nights it can get a little noisy but I didn't mind. The pool and lounge were very modern and upscale. I enjoyed the ambiance. There is late night room service as well. They're very eco-friendly and pet-friendly too.

I had arranged this stay for a group of my friends and family who were travelling together and I really liked the fun, yet sophisticated and stylish look of the hotel from pictures I had seen online. It was our arrival at the the hotel that I feel disappointed me most. We were a group of 8 persons checking-in at around 3pm in the afternoon - I had sent an email to the hotel advising them 2 members of our group were members of the Kimpton In Touch program and I had advised their membership numbers. It was evident the membership numbers were not in our reservations upon check-in, even though I had sent the email 2 weeks prior. My sister enquired about arranging a massage while we were checking in and the person at the desk suggested she join the Kimpton In Touch program to gain a discount? My sister was one of the persons in our group who I had advised the hotel was already a member! After being allocated our rooms I went up to mine. I called reception when I got inside as I had wanted a room with a walk-in shower rather than a shower over the bath. The person I spoke to, who was the same person that checked me in said that they could move me and my partner and advised I bring all our bags down to reception where they would give me the key to our new room. I double checked with them they could move us, as my partner was dropping off our rental car and I was going to have to move all the luggage back down stairs myself to change rooms, the person confirmed yes I was to do this. When I got down stairs the person who I was speaking with on the phone was with another guest and I told their colleague what I was advised. I immediately felt as though this request to change rooms was unreasonable, there was some huffing and they checked on the system where they could move me too. After a couple of minutes they advised there was no other room to move me to - it had already been allocated. I said can you please check with your colleague as they had confirmed there was another room just 5 minutes ago. The person I was dealing with advised me again there was no other room. At this point I was annoyed, but thanked them for their assistance and went back up to my original room. When my partner got back I told him what had happened and he called down to reception, he asked to speak with the manager and was told sorry the manager is on vacation at the moment? We were confused a hotel of this standard had nobody in charge while the manager was on vacation? Generally this hotel is attractive and nicely decorated. The service like in many \"trendy\" boutique hotels, lets it down though. I have stayed in Kimpton hotels prior to this stay at the Solamar and had had better experiences than this.

The Hotel and the room itself were fantastic and the quality and cleanness of the room were top quality and couldn't be faulted, we had a bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card???? Which magically later in the day to a Comgratulations card! Which was a nice touch. One of the first things we did find however was that the safe didn't work, which with our passports and cash etc we sure needed. Reported on the phone and were told we could go out and Maintence would repair, that evening when got back it still wasn't fixed, so called again in the morning to ask again and when still not repaired that evening asked reception for 3rd time. Still wasn't repaired so gave up asking!! wine hour was a nice touch, was served most evenings by a lady from the phillipenes who was lovely whenever we saw her, unfortunately on the Tuesday after a long day at the Zoo, there was a older blonde lady serving who was simply Rude and was possible the rudest person we came across, at first we thought she disliked us for bring a younger crowd, however when speaking to other guests in the lift we weren't the only people to notice this. The pool area itself was lovely and offered lovely views over the Gaslamp, unfortunately service wasn't much better when we did visit with the barman being more interested in the baseball game on, than any customers. finally when we did get home to the uk, we checked our credit card statement to find we'd been double billed for our stay, so after long call trying to get someone to help from within the hotel a voicemail was left and the problem that should never happen was resolved quickly. Overall we lovely San Diego, the Hotel we loved and the rooms were lovely, the Valet staff were friendly and the cleaning staff very nice but unfortunately too much poor customer service soured our visit.

The Solamar is in an excellent position right in the center of the Gaslamp district with plenty of bars, restaurants and shops to choose from. When we first checked in the hotel, our first impression was how dark it was in the lobby, when we stayed at the San francisco hotel we were given complementary continental breakfast vouchers as we were with Virgin holidays, these were not offered to us at the Solamar until i had enquired about them. When we entered our room (606) the first thing we noticed was the mouldy smell of the room, we dont understand where this smell came from as the room was clean and there was no sign of mould in the bathroom but it was quite unpleasant. Some other points about the room that we were unhappy about were : the lighting in the room, there was a bedside light which is great as i like to read before i go to sleep, however, to use the bedside light you have to turn the main light of the room on that is by the door so, when you want to turn the light out you have to get out of bed again. This is the first hotel i have been to where there is no hotel guide in the room, it is handy to know what time the pool, restaurant etc opens and closes and to know what time you are to check out. There is nowhere in the room to put your wet towels after you have used them, there were 4 of us in our room,so 4 wet towels and one small towel rail, so we had to have wet towels hanging over doors. While we were there only one elevator was working which resulted in very long waits aspecially in the mornings, it was out of order for the 4 days we were there and we never saw anyone working on it. Whilst the wine hour is a very nice idea, who when they are on holiday is in the hotel between 5-6, each day at this time we were still at the zoo, beach etc it would have been nicer if it was a little later. There was no coffee machine in the room and no way of getting a cup of coffee in the hotel, except for in the mornings unless i suppose you got a very expensive cup through room service. If you choose not to put coffee machines in the room surely there should be a way of getting a coffee, tea etc in the hotel. The rooms are very noisy, you can hear every door being shut in the corridor, also on the Friday and Saturday nights that we stayed, opposite the hotel was a roof top bar that was very loud until the early hours of the morning, keeping us awake. Our window in our room was so dirty it was impossable to see out of it, just as well as the view out of our window was a brick wall. Finally the cost of parking at this hotel is ridiculous, we stayed in LA, Las Vegas and Palm Springs on this vacation and parking was free at all the hotels, $35 a night to park is very expensive. We parked at the garage 1 block down on the same side of the hotel for $17 a night. All in all we were very disapointed in this hotel, especially after having such a fantastic stay at the Argonaught Hotel in San Francisco which was also a kimpton Hotel.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newburyport", "Title": "\u201cI love Kimpton hotels\u201d", "Author": "DaveNBPT", "ReviewID": "UR76120326", "Content": "I admit up front, I'm a sucker for Kimpton hotels. I've also stayed in their DC property, and enjoy the young vibe, funky style, and elegant modernism of the hotels. Solamar did not disappoint. We stayed on the top floor in a corner room and it was perfect. Everything was cozy, clean and comfortable. The bed was a little too lumpy and soft for both mine and my wife's tastes, so our sleep wasn't as comfortable as we would've liked. The pool area on the 4th floor was wonderful to enjoy. We had lunch there and a few frozen cocktails. Were a bit astounded at the price of the cocktails when we got the bill though -- you do pay for all of that style. So maybe forgo the alcoholic drinks here and enjoy them in one of the many fine, local restaurants. A nice touch is they'll print out and display a photo you send them ahead of time to make you feel more at home. One of those personal touches that anyone could do on their own, but since they thought of it, it made it seem even more special. The Internet was fine. The only tiny thing was the designers who insist on using sliding doors in bathrooms (when there was plenty of room in this room for a regular door). Sliding doors are great for doors you don't open or close very often, because they tend to be harder to open and close, and if not perfectly aligned, they don't always close tight. Case in point was in our room, where there was a very noticeable crack when the bathroom door was closed because the door was no longer level. A minor annoyance, but one endemic of many 4 star properties. If you need to be in this area of San Diego, I would heartily recommend the Solamar.

She also asked if we wanted recommendations for lunch which we declined but probably should have listened because we went to an overpriced itialian place that was not very good on 5th. While we were waiting and debating on what to do next we were called by the front desk Manager Wendy who let us know not only our room was ready but we were even upgraded to a king spa. We rushed though the medicore at best lunch and headed back. The bell staff were prompt with door service There were a pair of new faces at the front desk an Asian girl and a shorter Blonde girl who both were so nice instantly greeted me with a warm smile.(sorrry I can't remember their names thin one of their names was Page or Kim. something along those lines) They handed me my Keys and I arrived at the very modern decor of the larger then expected room. I noticed their were down pillows on the bed which I am desperately allergic to and before I could call down my phone rang. It was one of the girls at the front desk greeting me with a sincere greeting and asked if I needed anything. I let them know about the pillows, they were very apologetic and assured me knew pillows would be up soon. It took about 15 minutes. We enjoyed our stay in San Diego and the other thing worth mentioning was there was a crazy party going on upstairs and I called downstairs about 1 am on a friday. The gentleman at the front desk was very professional calm and apologetic. He let me know that someone would be up as soon as possible. I was waiting outside to point security to the right room and 2 gentleman, a stockier guy and a blonde guy who appeared to be security. They also greeted me with a smile and apolgized for the inconveninace and heard how loud it was. They let me know it might be a good idea to get back in my room so the guests wouldnt know it was me. They asked if I was interested in breakfast for the inconveniance whihc I declined and said it wasn't necessary. It was a great offer. The room did get loud once more but I heard the gentleman come back and talk to them and that was the end of it.I didn't get a chance to go to J-six or the pool bar but will on my next visit.

I love the review posted by the guy below, regarding the poolside being like the set of a beer commercial, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not wrong! I think that was a very creative way to describe it and so correct too! A small heated pool, surrounded by contemporary loungers with gaudy towels, palm trees and seating areas dotted all over, and a great looking bar with lots of people enjoying a beer in the sunshine with a few tunes. Saturday night was our favourite night, the pool bar and terrace (Lounge-six) gets packed with partygoers and was one of our best nights partying. Only one thing spoilt it and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drinks being served in plastic glasses, yack. Our room overlooked the poolside terrace but with the window closed you could not hear any noise at all.

It had everything, a massive selection of different drinks and loads of snacks too. I was very happy to see that it was actually quite well priced and not a rip off like some hotels. The beds were really comfy with quality linen and the bathrooms were superb with a super powerful shower. We stayed on a bed and breakfast board basis and the breakfast was served downstairs in the hotel restaurant called J-six. Each morning a continental breakfast was served which my wife thoroughly enjoyed, but i wanted something a little more substantial. There was an option to upgrade (for a small fee) to the All American Breakfast, and i can honestly say that it was the very best breakfast i have ever experienced in any hotel i have ever visited (and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot!).

I was shocked to find there was a $35 charge for \"valet parking\" for each day of the conference, a fee not stated in the terms of agreement. This increased the price of our stay to over $200 per day. This cost was not what our budget was planned for, since we had to stay the whole week for our class. Their statement that parking fees at $35/day are in line with fees throughout San Diego is not true; this hotel is not in New York city. The hotel itinerary mentioned a complimentary expanded continental breakfast to our hosts conducting our class, but I never did see it. The hotel attendants did not mention this to me when I checked in. I assumed that the hotel, particularly with its robust guest charges, had a continental breakfast, but during my first morning I had to order a breakfast at the hotel restaurant for an additional charge, and the time of waited service made me late for the class, so I forwent additional breakfasts for the remaining time I was at the hotel. Also, the wireless network was difficult to implement, both in the rooms and in the conference rooms. The hotel had a few types of wireless service, one of which was \"free internet,\" requiring a membership to the hotel, which by this time I did not want to join, as I did not want any future e-mails from the hotel. While I was eventually given an e-mail password to logon to the free wireless network, my laptop would frequently try to lock on the wireless service requiring a fee, since the free wireless was set to a weaker signal. I found the hotel requiring any wireless charges onerous, considering that most other hotels provide free service, and hotel charges at this place were at a premium. Finally, I found the hotel rooms lacking amenities, such as a simple coffee maker, and an empty refrigerator. The refrigerator and shelves were all stuffed with expensive drinks the guest was supposed to buy. Since there was no room to put my books up, I had to push all the drinks aside. I felt the hotel was more interested in alcohol sales than providing a functioning room for the guest. To add insult to injury, I was erroneously charged $11 at checkout for a water bottle they claimed I taken, but I had to use it to block the non-functioning safe's door from continuously swinging open.

The Valet staff was great moving cars and freeing up space for cars to enter. Had room service the first night which was good however there was a mandatory 22% gratuity on over priced food and a $3.00 delivery fee, which is excessive. The food was good and delivered in a timely manner for a friday night. The restaurant was nice we had breakfast there two mornings , standard breakfast menus with pleasant staff. The hotel was busy seems like one of the spots to stay , we saw a lot of guests with their pets and on SATURDAY the pool area is a outdoor club/lounge which gets noisy if your facing the pool/lounge area at night. The pool is small warm and nice with towels and sporadic drink service maybe around 15 lounges for guest use and a few covered cabanas. Close by is a CVS, Ralphs Grocery and 20-30 places to eat and drink.

It makes your skin feel extra soft after the bath. I think it is definitely worth it to book a room with that kind of tub. The hotel provided nice bathrobes too. We used the pool for some relaxing laps and found the water to be sooo warm. It was almost like another bath. The pool is surrounded by couches and lounges arranged in cozy nooks/cabanas with a bar and fireplace. In the evening at 5PM the hotel hosts a wine hour in the \"living room\" just off the lobby.

We also had a door key issue when we checked in late one night that ended up with maintenance working on our door at 11pm at night. Sorry neighbors! This was after 2 keys would not work upon check-in. We asked for another (equal) room instead the might be quieter anyway, since we had prerequested a quiet room and ours was right outside the pool area where the action can get loud at night, but they were bound and determined to fix the door and wanted to move us the next day instead. This allowed us two different floors, one MUCH cleaner than the other, but I can not in good conscience recommend this hotel for anyone but those under 25 that are there to party and crash.

I did the math and it would have been cheaper to park as a \"non guest\", what a joke! Coffee is only available in the lobby during certain hours, a negative in my opinion. Bed was nicely dressed with down comforter and great sheets, but the mattress was not up to par. How long has in been since they've made mattresses that bounce one side when the other moves? Every time my husband was up or down, I was flopped around. Perhaps Kimpton could order some Heavenly beds? Our room was a corner with three bright window that were able to open, a big plus in my book. There was plenty of room and even a nice closet with shelves and safe (and no mirrored door!). Bathroom was well appointed with Aveda bath products, average size tub and nice shower head. Bathroom had modern vessel sink and beautiful tile. The only down side was the lack of lighting near the bathtub/shower. Only lighting was around sink and a half wall blocked most of that light from getting to tub. No a big deal, but don't expect to do any precision shaving. They also host an afternoon wine reception, if you're into that. I'd pass the alcohol for better parking rates. We found it odd that a pet friendly hotel had no real green space for them to take care of \"business\" or play. They offered a tiny strip in the sidewalk that has obviously been overused bey their customers (and not even their property, city property). Petco park has a dog friendly area, but for quick morning and bedtime trips this hotel needs to find a better solution. The receptionist was also happy to allow us an early check-in(really early, 9 am), after an all night drive. Internet is free if you are a member of their Kimpton brand \"club\", you are able to sign up on the spot very easily. Otherwise $10/day. Pool and sun deck area on fourth floor looked really nice, although we did not have the opportunity to enjoy ourselves. We did see (from our room), movies playing one night against one wall, which looked fun. They also had several intimate fire pits and bar area. Great location if downtown is you destination. Petco park is about a half block away, lots of restaurants, close to shopping, though it's all chain/mall stores, so don't expect anything original. If you are going to the convention center, it's about a 5-10 minute walk. Great for business. If you're looking for family/beaches you better off in the mission bay area or be prepared to hop in the car.

Guests shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait until mid-afternoon when they return to the room to work or relax/nap to have housekeeping come in while using the room. .Parking is advertised on the website as $32 but is posted at the hotel entry as $35. (Either way, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculously overpriced!) The front desk claimed the rate changed either 2 or 3 months ago and that it has been updated on the website but remembering that I read it there only a month ago or less, I asked them to honor the prior advertised price. (Because the internet service didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for us, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check it during our trip). I had no less than four conversations with different front desk staff the first night and next morning before ascertaining that the parking staff (apparently, a separately-run business) approved the discount.

The price for the central gaslamp district location looked too good to be true. I was expecting to be disappointed and for this to be one of those times when the photos looked better than the reality. I had looked at other quality hotels in the area and they were much more expensive, so wasnt expecting much. However, on arrival we checked in to a very classy and upmarket reception area and was greeted with complimentary wines and nibbles (offered to guests daily in the afternoons) and then we were delighted with the appointment of our room. Large king size bed and roomy room with a fridge. Very modern fittings and decor. We got a rollaway bed for our son and there was plenty of room for it. They didnt charge extra for it (most other hotels seem to charge a nightly fee for these). The bathroom was luxourious but did not have a full bath (it was 3/4 size). The air conditioning was very good and quiet. Large flat screen TV and good selection of channels. We were on the top floor and overlooked Pitco Park. There were baseball games and fireworks most night (very cool!)... but dispite this the room was very quiet (double glazing) and it didnt impact our stay in a negative way. In fact it was fun to watch. Great black out curtains helped get our son to sleep and sleep in in the mornings. The hotel offered a complimentary continential breakfast and although it wasnt quite what we were expecting it was a lovely start to the day. It comprised of a pastry, and lovely bowl of fresh fruit and coffee/tea. You could add other items from the menu for a cost. We enjoyed the rooftop pool although it is quite small and very popular in the afternoons. The staff were very helpful and freindly. The only real negative for me was that there were no guest laundry services (other than drycleaning for individual items). There were also no coin laundries nearby. The staff did not have a solution/suggestion when I enquired and I would have thought they would have been asked for directions etc before but I definatley felt like I was the first ever person to ask this question. I had to travel a long way by public transport to a pretty scarey district out of town to do this. The outside is an old brick building that looks like it could have been a firestation or something like that....it is extremely understated. Once you go inside you will be pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a good location near to public transport, shops, many many great resturants, the waterfront etc - but that is also on a budget.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased\u201d", "Author": "Jodie085", "ReviewID": "UR34833555", "Content": "I was very pleased with this hotel (especially considering the great deal I found).

We arrived at the hotel around 10AM and were able to get right in our room which was a nice surprise. Our room was tidy, clean and very comfortable. Our view was overlooking the pool deck/bar which seemed to stay pretty busy all day. There was a yoga class held there in the morning that people seemed to enjoy and plenty of sun and beverages for the remainder of the day. The hotel location was perfect for our needs. Within a short walking distance to the baseball park, convention center and numerous restaurants and shopping areas. This made staying here extremely convenient and easy. I can't say I have many gripes about the hotel. The elevators were sometimes slow and the hot water in my shower could have been a bit hotter, but it was not uncomfortable. As I said, the pool stayed pretty busy and I found it difficult to find an empty lounge chair on the weekends, so if you are looking to get a tan at your hotel pool, get there early to claim your spot.

The wine and cheese tasting in the evening and free tea and coffee in the lobby each morning is a nice touch - even if you don't use it, still makes you feel as if the hotel is really trying to make a good impression. Free newspapers each morning. There is free wifi - though a somewhat ridiculous setup process involving joining the Kimpton Club, which is free. On the up side my iphone automatically logged itself into another Kimpton hotels wifi when we were in San Francisco. Our room had two separate areas with a living room / bedroom set up. Neither room was huge but both had enormous televisions. The two areas had a sliding door so you could lock yourself off if you really wanted to. All the photos on Trip Advisor show a walk in shower in the rooms. Our room didn't have one. So if this is important to you I would make sure you request one when you book. There are nice touches in the room that make it seem like a more personal hotel rather than another big chain. From the distinctive bathrobes, to the pinboard where they place notes about what's going on in the hotel and around town. The pool and bar area on the rooftop is lovely during the evening sun. Though one night they closed half of it off for a private function. The only thing I'd really complain about is the valet parking. The hotel seems to have the most expensive parking in the city.

The hotel's website had the most expensive room rate and 1800hotels.com had by far the BEST and least expensive rate. I called the hotel's reservation line and they matched the rate that 1800hotels.com was offering. That saved us over $50/night. We checked right in upon arrival and the front desk staff and valet attendants were very friendly. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking 6th street. The room was beautifully decorated with modern decor, huge flat screen TV, very comfortable bed with no top comforter - which we LOVED - just triple sheeting and throw pillows that matched the decor of the room. The bathroom was clean, very nice modern fixtures, Aveda amenities and white fluffy towels. The shower head was fabulous - almost like a steam shower with great water pressure. They have FREE in-room Wi-fi! That's a big plus! They have a wine reception every evening from 5 - 6pm offering a red, white and sangria. We went both nights and enjoyed our wine and good conversation in the 'living room'. Also, each morning they offer a coffee and tea reception until 9:30am. We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant, but the pizza samples that we tried during the wine reception were very tasty. We also didn't use the pool, but we did have drinks out by the back area of the pool that overlooked the street. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. We were close enough to walk to PETCO Park to see a baseball game (just around the corner). There are so many great restaurants, bars and shops within walking district of the hotel. Friday night we enjoyed a meal at Old Spaghetti Factory to carbo load before the 10K race the next morning. Then on Saturday night, we had dinner at one of our favorite restaurants, Sevilla. You can't beat the Sangria and tapas! On Sunday morning, we walked to Mary Jane's Coffee Shop, which is located next to the Hard Rock Hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be going there again on our next trip to San Diego. The only downside is the $32/night valet fee. Being from Vegas, I'm used to free valet parking. There is a $20/day parking lot across the street, but for safety reasons we opted to pay the $32/night fee.

Received a complimetnary welcome gift in the afternoon, which is always appreciated. Attended the wine hour friday before heading off to Joltn Joes nearby for dinner, drinks and sporting events. Went out to a nightclub literally across the street so this place is convenient for those attending a night out at Stingaree. 2nd day spent time at the pool, checked out the jazz festival going on nearby and walked over to meet friends up at Hooters for dinner and the UFC fight.

On my way out the housekeeper on the floor(Very friendly btw) was cleaning the room next to mine so I asked if she could clean mine next since I was going to be going out to grab a bite. I wanted to allow her time to finish what she was doing, so I figured I could hang out at the pool area, watch the yankees game and have my sandwich while the room was getting cleaned. Unfortunately it turns out the pool also has a restaurant(all i had seen was a bar) and so she told me I could NOT bring outside food. Thats fine, BUT then on my walk out, i noticed A LOT of people with outside food. My room wasnt ready, so i ate in the living room area, headed back to the pool area to sit and watch the game and as i walked around most people lounging in the pool area had outside food.

Petco Park is pretty much next door.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable Stay at the Solamar\u201d", "Author": "cmna4", "ReviewID": "UR28908708", "Content": "I just returned yesterday from a four day stay at the Solamar. I was on a mom/daughter mini vacation with my 28 year old daughter. I originally chose the Solamar for the great promo rate I heard about on the weekend edition of the Today Show. They showcased the hotel as a hip hotel and I thought it would appeal to my daughter. However, I was very skeptical after I booked it because of all the negative reviews I had read here at tripadvisor. I must say that our experience/stay was wonderful. Both of us were a little leary about staying in a hotel that allows pets because we both have allergies. I called the hotel and the front desk assured me they had a whole floor devoted to pet free rooms. (However, I could not find a place to indicate that I wanted a pet-free room when I reserved on-line. So if it is an issue for you, call them directly and request it. ) I had read many complaints about noise from the pool/bar area so upon check-in I asked for a room on the \"quiet side.\" They did not have any rooms left on the quiet side of the pet-free floor, but would gladly move us to another floor that did have quiet side rooms available. The receptionist told us that the pet-free floor was the top floor of the hotel and that we would be far enough up from the pool/bar that noise should not be a problem. Obviously we could not stay in a pet friendly room and chose to stay with our original room, #1027, We could not have been happier. Our hotel room looked directly down on the pool/bar. We were able to watch the action without hearing any of the noise. For us, noise was not an issue at all. Previous reviews mentioned an unfriendly attitude among the staff. We did not find this to be the case. Everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. Our room was very clean and up to date. Our housekeeper Maria was excellent. (We could tell she had the day off on Saturday. The room was clean, but not quite as well as when Maria made it up.) The front desk was very friendly and helpful at check-in. At night there is an evening wine reception in the \"Living Room\". They offered a white and a red Pinot on all four nights. It was not top drawer wine. But,judging by the crowd people did not seem to mind the quality of the free wine one bit. I thought the wine reception was a nice touch. I would like to suggest that they do not always serve the same exact wine every night. Maybe they could mix it up with a different red such as a Cab , Malbec, or possibly a Merlot and then a Charddonay for a white option. Something different for those of us who are staying more than one night. Still that is a minor complaint and free wine is better than no wine at all. We also received a bottle of wine at check-in that was part of our promo rate. Again, a nice touch. And we received coupons for free continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Someone mentioned in a review that they did not like that wait staff served you your continental breakfast because they felt obligated to leave a tip. We did not mind being served and leaving a tip. Juice or coffee, several choices of a pastry, and a beautiful fresh fruit bowl was the complimentary continental breakfast. I do not know if every guest automatically gets continental breakfast. But even with a tip, it was an inexpensive way to jumpstart the day. And if you are a big breakfast eater, you could always order something in addition to your fruit and pastry off their breakfast menu which we did one day. Of course, you have to pay for anything extra beyond the continental breakfast. I should mention that they also have free coffee and tea in the morning in the \"Living Room\". I am not a coffee drinker, but my daughter took advantage of this nice amenity. Some reviews mentioned that the pool was not clean. The weather was chilly when we were there, but people were using the pool. It looked very clean and we overheard a guest saying the water temperature was warm. We did not use the pool, but did enjoy relaxing by it one afternoon after a day of sightseeing. I am guessing the pool gets more use in the summer and more sunscreen residue probably builds up on the sides of the pool. If that were to happen, that would be a turn off for me as well. I loved the location of this hotel. It is close to public transportation and the PETCO stadium. We were able to walk from here to Little Italy with no problem. (On a hot day you would probably want to take the light rail public transportation known as the Trolley to Little Italy.) We also attended a baseball game at PETCO during our stay. It was nice not to have to hassle with finding a parking space near the stadium. Other reviews mentioned the cost of valet parking. We did not have a rental car so I cannot comment on this. A previous review said the fitness room was small. It is small, but I never had to wait for a treadmill. There are 2 treadmills, 1 eliptical, weights, and then a bike is actually outside adjacent to the fitness room. One morning one of the treadmills did not have any power, but a hotel employee promptly came in and fixed it. Finally, there are many restaurants and night clubs in the area. We ate at a couple of them. But our best meals were brunch at Hash House A Go Go in Hillcrest and dinner at the Top of the Fish Market. We took a taxi to Hash House A Go Go. It cost us $10.90 and I gave the driver $15. We took the Trolley to the Seaport Village stop and walked the rest of the way to the Fish Market on Saturday night. It was a lovely night and we ended up walking all the way back to the hotel after our dinner. I should mention that we did have a king room. I was prepared for a tiny room because of some of the other reviews. Maybe because I was on a cruise about four weeks ago, but I thought the room size was very adequate. The bathroom sink is annoying-very contemporary and shallow. I think you can see it on the hotel's website. Someone said it is too high. I would disagree with that. I am short and height isn't the issue. One, it is set too far back, but the real issue is that it is too shallow and water splashes every where. It does however look cool. For the promo rate and all the other pluses this hotel had to offer, the sink was tolerable for days. I know this review is long, but I hope it will help somebody who was on the fence about lodging. I am a very picky traveler who prefers 4 and 5 star hotels and who is obsessed with cleanliness. (The carpets in the hallways did look worn, but our carpet in the room was new.)

Since I'm from Texas, its not the norm to have to pay to park, especially $32 per day. So that was pretty steep and not pleasant. The valet guys were polite and tried to be quick in getting the car. Although I'd have preferred skipping the whole valet thing because I'd have saved money in the constant tips and it would've been faster. But I suspect that this was how it is at all the hotels in San Diego so I couldn't be that disappointed in the parking situation. The beds were comfortable and they had nice flat screen TVs. The rooms were very nicely decorated and I was impressed. The only odd thing was that there weren't any drawers. The bathrooms were also nice. I just love the Aveda toiletries that they provide. One complaint that I do have is that there is a nightclub in the building and around 11pm the music can be heard in the room for a few hours. Luckily I was tired enough to sleep through it but it is very loud.

The good: 1. I was able to get a good two-day rate on the Kimpton website ($158.00) which is probably the only reason why I'm here. With the economy, my company is really scrutinizing my travel expenses. 2. The location is also convenient for food and walking around the Gaslamp District and it's less than three miles from the airport. 3. The decor is contemporary, but cold. Most Kimptons that I have been to are stylish and contemporary but not cold. I couldn't put my finger on it. 4. Nice big flat-screen TV. The not so good: 1. Yes, the location is convenient, but it's also really noisy. I don't know if other rooms are the same, but ask for a quiet room if they have one. 2. The bathroom sink is really high...so this is not so good for me at 5'3\" but might be great for someone that's 6'3\". Water splashes everywhere because the sink is too shallow and gets all over my things. The bathroom was clean, but generally smallish. 3. The hotel includes internet with the room cost, except there is no wireless or too weak of a signal. You have to be hard-wired to the internet cable which restricts your mobility. This irks me. 4. Valet parking is $32.00 a night...kind of an oxymoron decision to stay here for the cheaper room rate, but throw in parking...and well...you're back up to where you wanted to avoid in price. The Bad 1. The king-sized bed in my room was so uncomfortable, I barely slept. It dips on either side, and is slightly raised in the middle. Basically the bed felt like it was 100 years old and need to be thrown out. 2. The nice comforter I'm used to from Kimpton turned out to be so worn down and thin, I thought they forgot to include a comforter in my bed. I basically had to get up at 3am and put on my fleece jacket, because I was freezing to death. 3. No IN-room coffee. So I ordered room service for breakfast, and my coffee that came with room service tasted like water. I couldn't believe how weak it was for $4, plus 22% gratuity, plus $3 service charge. I probably could have bought a coffee maker for that price. They do serve coffee in the lounge in the morning until 9:30am, but who wants to go down there in the morning when there's work to do or in my case trying to get a little more sleep due to the lumpy bed? In summary: I'm not coming back...based on the bed issue alone...and I really wanted to like this place. I still gave this place a good rating, because it is MOSTLY good for the average person on vacation...really bad for business person. There might be better beds in other rooms, and I just happened to have the worst room in the house.

My biggest complaint was with a lady that was working the front desk overnight. When we arrived I requested rooms with two queen beds. We were told that there were none available (which was okay). After completing our stay I realized that the hotel was very empty for our entire stay. I also requested extra keys as we had a larger party. I was told that they were out of keys and could only provide one per room! The next night, we came back a little late and we needed our room key to get into the front door. Because we were only given one key, we didn't have a key with us and the same lady that checked us in quickly offered us TWO extra keys (one for each of our rooms). After pulling up our room in the computer, she handed me ONE key and said goodnight. The next day, I found out that the new key worked just fine, but the original key had been deactivated!! After asking I was quickly given extra keys for both rooms by a much nicer girl at the front desk (during the day). I hope it was just a coincidence or computer error but if she pulled this because we got a good deal on the rooms she should be fired or Solamar should not sell rooms through Priceline. My other big complaint was with the stench in the hallway. Many times when we returned to our rooms we could immediately smell the stench of bathroom (#2) as soon as we entered the hallway. The vent that is near the elevator must be for the bathrooms as you can see it as soon as you get off of the elevator. Even our guests immediately noticed this. Also, the $32 valet service was not what I expected for that price. The valets were friendly, but we waited way too long for our cars to be retrieved (up to 10 minutes). Also, when we returned late one night the valet (24 hours) was nowhere to be found.

The best part of hotel is staff. The front desk staff were amazing. Even when we had minor complaints or maybe requests, they tried to be as accomodating as possible and never made us feel they were put out. We did move once because we stayed during Halloween and a loud street concert was going on right out our window. They moved us to 10th floor which they didn't have to do. The view was amazing. City, litte of the ocean. Right now there is some construction going on at properties near the hotel. The only time it even bothered me was during the weekday by the pool. Hard to relax with the construction noise. Valet parking is pricey ($32) but if you go in and out a lot, its probably worth it than trying to find public parking. So much is within walking distance. Restaurants, Petco Park (for summer events especially), nice mall. All in all, I would recommend the hotel. I have heard that some rooms experience noise from the pool bar but I would think it would have to be extremely busy for that to happen. And yes, some ocassions they do close the pool to guests to accomodate a private party which does put you off a little. They only did that once during our stay so we didn't mind.

We chose it because so many of the other hotels in the Gaslamp area were extremely overpriced, and we were looking for a hotel with a nice pool. We booked this online through expedia for about 150 per night, and it was certainly worth that amount. The rooms were clean, done in a pretty beachy decor, and were comfortable. The maids always did a good job of keeping the room in order, although they never seemed to leave us enough towels (2 towels for 2 ppl isn't enough in my opinion)...so we just requested more, which was no problem. The hotel is busy. There are lots of people there at night, especially in the pool area. Our friends had a room over the pool and they said that the noise at night wasn't an issue. The pool is beautiful and gets great sun. However, there isn't much space for lounging. They have about 6 lounge chairs out, and 3 cabanas. One day we arrived in the afternoon and there was no place to lie out. When I asked the bartender where we were supposed to sit, he kindly offered up the cabana for free (for which they normally charge $250 per day). On our last day we also noticed that they had a stack of lounge chairs behind the bar, which you can take and set up if you want to. The pool was pretty and a lot of fun! The hotel is within walking distance to some clubs, restaurants and bars, and they offer you free coffee and tea in the morning, which is a nice touch. Now for my gripes. I didn't find the hotel to be overly functional. I compare it to a really hot girl without a brain. The rooms looked nice but there was no good area for putting on makeup, and there was a lack of counter space and shelving. The pool looked beautiful, but the lack of sitting space was a bit annoying and somewhat stressful. They have sex kits for purchase in the room - lubricant, condoms, etc. I guess paying $7 for a sex kit when in dire need is worth it, but I don't need to be reminded of the thousands of people who have had sex in the bed that I'm paying $150 per night for! Yuck! They also have these strange leopard housecoats for purchase. These two things made me think that the hotel might secretly be frequented by pimps and people with weird sexual fetishes. Finally, parking was $30 per day - insane! We had no real problems with this hotel, but I just didn't find it functional enough overall.

(2) The newly-renovated bathroom had a really shallow sink. While it is stylish, it is really not very practical. Oh, also, the valet parking was expensive -- $32 a day!

Soooo glad I placed more faith in Kimpton's outstanding service than in a couple negative reviews. The whole experience was fantastic from the moment I pulled up. Yes, the valet parking is expensive (everything is expensive in SD, and Solamar's rates are consistent with the market). Based on earlier reviews, was very careful to reserve a quiet room and specified away from and above pool level. Front desk offered me exactly what I asked for, but also offered an upgraded room away from the pool, but on the pool floor. Made the right choice by taking the upgraded room. The room was around the corner and as far from the pool as possible (#434). Stayed here a whole week and did not once hear a peep from the pool. Having spent about my share of time at the pool, I can believe that some of the lower pool facing rooms might have a valid complaint about the noise from the pool's bar--especially if they open their windows--so consider requesting a room away from the pool. One of the reviews complained about thin walls. Don't really know what they're talking about--that wasn't my experience. The side walls of the rooms are as quiet as anywhere else. Yes, you can hear your neighbors when they're talking too loudly in the hallway as they walk by. But that's no different that almost any other hotel I've stayed at (and I'm pretty sensitive to extraneous noise). If I have to find faults, they are these: (1) The hotel's exterior windows (at least my room's) are getting a __little__ dirty. They open, but not in any way that the hotel could wash them without hiring a professional window washer. This is probably not the sort of thing that would bother most guests, if they noticed it at all (the hotel, firmly in Downtown's center, doesn't enjoy views of the Bay); (2) Got some bad advice from staff member trying to be helpful responding to my subjective questions: was told \"nothing to do at the Embarcadero\" (it's a nearby park that might be useful for walking your dog at this pet-friendly hotel) and \"free parking is tough up by Balboa Park\" (that just totally wasn't my experience--maybe I was there on an off day?); (3) Not too thrilled with the light filtering curtain set up--they open & close with rods that are attached to the sheer fabric by a nut & bolt--a pretty flimsy setup that was wearing out in my room. Gee, that's my biggest complaint--closing the curtains. Life must be tough. Someone mentioned the guests are pretty young here, and that's right. All ages are represented, but the bell curve skews toward the late 20s/30s. During the Saturday night of my stay, Pepperdine U. had a formal event for some of their students, who were staying at the hotel--so my experience may not have been the norm. Surprisingly, heard no ruckus from these kids! Hotel has a great location in SD's Gas Light District. No shortage of things to do/places to eat. A 5 minute walk from the Convention Center. Oh, the 5-6PM wine hour is a great way to start off a crawl to the nearby restaurants. Hotel's restaurant (J Six) and poolside bar are very good. Both a little expensive (but still within market prices). Food was at least as good (had both dinner and breakfast here) as 75% of the nearby restaurants, but maybe a notch shy of excellent. Staff is __extremely__ helpful; if you've never stayed at a Kimpton, you'll just have to understand that this chain sets the standard for service quality. Everyone....front desk, restaurant/bar, valet, housekeeping, and maintenance goes out of their way to acknowledge you and make your stay as comfortable as possible. I'd unhesitatingly recommend this hotel to anyone going to stay in Downtown SD. It's not the cheapest hotel around, but it's worth it. There are also other choices nearby if you want to get lost in a megalithic hotel (e.g., Omni; Marriott; Grand Hyatt, all nearby).

The rate was $139/night...and I was initially a bit apprehensive about this being the hotel revealed. It looked very adult-oriented and the reviews have tended to reflect this opinion...and we had two families with one pre-schooler apiece. There wasn't even a mention of cribs being available on the website---although a lot of cool services available for dogs were highlighted. I wrote the property via their website to inquire about the cribs. I quickly received a voice mail message from a very nice man who assured me that they had cribs and to call if I had any questions or further requests. And thus began an amazing experience with the Hotel Solamar's customer service from every single employee we dealt with---from the front desk check-in to the cleaning people we saw in the hall. Everyone seems genuinely delighted to see you and eager to offer recommendations on how to make your stay in the hotel and the area more enjoyable. And bear in mind our party had two almost 3-year old boys in tow (enough to make most people head for the hills). Parents will appreciate how one host named Gordie got down to my son's level, really listened and had a nice conversation with him, and then greeted him by name whenever he saw him. Each child was also presented with a little goody bag of toys, including a thoughtful pre-soaped, duck-shaped sponge that made bathtime a real treat. When the crib was delivered, it was already assembled and was made up with sheets---this in itself is rather unusual! The rooms are a little small, but very well decorated in a hip, modern style. Even the bathrobes are funky----zebra and leopard skin patterned terry cloth! Hilarious! Our bellman who delivered our luggage also kindly pointed out that the honor bar doesn't have those annoying sensors that charge your room if any of the fridge contents get moved---so if you can refrigerate a few small items of your own. The one slight service gaffe was that there was no honor bar key in our room, and it took about half an hour for them to locate an extra one. It seems that most people who get rooms via a discount website get placed on the 4th floor which is the same floor as their pool and poolside bar. The front desk lady was proactive in giving us our rooms facing away from the pool to limit our exposure to DJ noise (seeing as we had young kids), but there was some hallway rowdiness from partygoers entering/leaving the pool area. Nothing terrible though, and the pool closes at 9. The hotel's restaurant JSix is gorgeously appointed, and serves delicious breakfast for a surprisingly reasonable price! Try the Chilaquiles which are amazing! Again, the wait staff were extremely gracious and accommodating to young children. A couple blocks away, the excellent restaurant Basics serves just pizza and salad---but oh, what pizza and salad! The other family vacationing with us originally hail from New York, and they proclaimed it the best pizza they've had on the West Coast. Another great recommendation from the front desk!

Friendly, helpful people working at the Hotel-- From the men at Valet (and yes $30 per night is expensive, but that's the going rate), to the Bellman who gave us recommendations to restaurants and clubs, the Concierge who made reservations for us, to the Front Desk - who upon hearing this was a special trip for us-- possibly up-graded us to a corner room King w/spa tub. Everyone working at the Hotel Solamar was fantastic. The Amenities-- modern, well-appointed rooms, very comfortable bed. Clean. No issue with noise or house-keeping. And the crazy Zebra and Tiger bathrobes, we loved it. Nightly Happy Hour from 5-6pm, red wine and/or champagne. Tough decisions to make!! Checked out the J-Bar on the fourth floor only briefly (too cold/rain), but it seemed like a happening place (I can only imagine the summer-time). Didn't make it to JSix restaurant--too many options close by-- but seemed elegant. In closing, our experience at the Hotel Solamar was First-rate. Comfortable-clean room, great location, first-class staff. Doesn't get better than this!!", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cSan Diego: Convient and Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "JRMKentucky", "ReviewID": "UR11251193", "Content": "Hotel Solamar had a great location in the Gas Lamp District.

Beware of the falsely advertised seafood restaurant Anthony's in that area. It was average at best. The hotel featured a nice wine tasting each night in the lobby. It had a fun and relaxed feeling as people interacted in the comfortable setting. The JSix restaurant was delicious and had a lovely atmosphere. The fresh squeezed juices, though adding to the cost of breakfast, were wonderful. Finally, the roof top bar was most pleasant during the wonderful San Diego evenings. I rated this hotel above average only because the room was a bit small, though nicely decorated and quite comfortable with nice linens and matresses. We received the New York Times every morning, and any requests we made were promptly and courteously addressed. Dogs are welcomed at the hotel, but they were never a problem or too numerous.

We were in need of a nice getaway following Thanksgiving. When finding the Hotel Solomar and checking out the website it seemed cool enough with this kind of peaceful, serenity vibe. Even had yoga chick looking ultra relaxed. The picture showed a nice d\u00c3\u00a9cor, a bit trendy and then I saw a special for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Romantic Rendezvous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Perfect! The special was to include cold champagne waiting our arrival, chocolate truffles on our bed, and bed and breakfast.yummy! Sounds pretty romantic eh? Oh but NO. Once we got there, the bubbly but unhelpful reservation woman informed us that we did not have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Romantic Rendezvous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd special and instead had some other promotion. Huh? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want another special. I paid for romance so I expect romance dammit! Soon the manager (I guess) sensing a little trouble tried to help saying he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look into it and let us know if the morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Let us know in the morning? That too late! We want our breakfast in bed so this needed to be taken care of right now. Later we got a call that because of the confusion (in which there was no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confusion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), they would credit us $50 for room service (More on this in a second). But what about our champagne? What about our truffles? At least a Snickers bar or something! A bit about the hotel: Actually, in all fairness, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that bad. The location is nice in that it is walking distance to the popular Gas lamp district with lots of shopping and restaurants. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was pretty funky, no complaints. The room was nice although small. We were warned about all the noise we would receive since the bar and pool is in the center of the hotel. Hopefully, it was just a bad week for them on this Friday and Saturday night, because there may have been seven people max (2 were bartenders\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and 1 bar back). So, huh, noise was not an issue. Probably our favorite part was their complimentary wine hour where the guests can mingle in a pretty cool lounge/sitting area and if nothing else, look cool. More importantly, we found this a time to cash in on our missing romantic package, so we helped ourselves to refills oh about every 10 minutes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153borrowed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the wine glasses (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in our cupboard right now) and proceeded to purposely get very buzzed and well, romantic! In passing the front desk, another cheery unhelpful reservation girl asked if there was anything she could do for me. Well yes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6give us some champagne! I explained once again how they screwed us out of our romantic package and quite possibly jeopardized our chances of an everlasting marriage. I should sue! She said she would send up a bottle of Champagne. Ok, now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting somewhere. Not even 5 minutes later, they call the room saying they out of champagne. $&*&^! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WTF, how can a hotel be fresh out of champagne. Especially an EMPTY hotel?? Instead we got another bottle of the wine we had already abused earlier. Great. So that evening get ready for our ghetto breakfast in bed with our $50 credit for room service breakfast due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confusion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So we decide on eggs some bacon, toast, a bagel, lox and cheese. With delivery charge, tax, and gratuity\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.$47!!! Double WTF? Another nice thing was that the Hotel Solomar was pet friendly, so we brought our cute little dog, Pepper along. Even he was unhappy as he got attacked by two stray pit bulls in the Gas lamp District. So, considering everything, upon checking out we let him poop on the front lawn (and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick it up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6J/K wink) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Still, this is about how we felt about their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Romantic Rendezvous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was crap. The Hotel Solomar is actually a decent place to stay. I think the main problem is marketing it as something it is not. No, you will not have romance there (although the free wine hour helps). You will not find a happening bar filled with drunken chicks. You will not find a real yoga retreat. You will not find a spacious room. You will get an average to slightly above average place to rest your head with a touch of style.

The staff are friendly and helpful. Kimptons are boutique hotels and a nice break from big chains when you want high class and comfort in a smaller setting. The two criticisms of the Solamar are (1) it seems inconsistent that they would charge for web access -- a hotel of this class should provide it free, and (2) their frequent stayer program is VAGUE -- they simply notice how often you stay and then award you with awards.

The good news first....If you like modern boutique hotels, you will be impressed by the decor in both the lobby and the hotel room. Also, if you want to stay in the downtown San Diego area and are debating between hotels like the W and the Sofia, this is definitely the one for you because the Solamar is central to Gaslamp - near the trolleys, restaurants, and shops, while the W and the Sofia are in neighborhoods that are the equivalent of Port Authority in NYC (grungy and technically downtown, but further away from the mainstream and undesirable - I walked by and into both hotels during my stay just out of curiosity). I had requested a room on a high floor facing away from the pool as I had read on here that facing the pool basically means you will get no sleep at any hour of the day. I had called to confirm again the day before that I could get a room facing away on the top floor, but wound up with a room on the top floor facing the pool.

I'm no grandma - but I do need my sleep eventually, especially since I was in San Diego to tour the area. Its completely ridiculous. Also, the reviews on here that say that the walls are incredibly thin in this hotel are correct. You can hear basically every slamming door and chat in the hallway. That basically negated the whole \"chic\" experience for me and turned it into a lower end hotel - and this hotel is by no means inexpensive. Missing from this hotel are some of the higher end amenities like a state of the art gym and a bellboy (you drag your own luggage to your room and out of the hotel when you leave). Also there was a general aloofness to the staff. I nearly missed my early flight home because the front desk \"forgot\" my wake up call which I had requested the night before, and I got better tips on the area and touring advice from a nearby hotel than this one.

Negatives: $30/night for parking, incredibly SLOW valet service, horribly designed motor lobby which allowed some clueless idiot to block people in for 10 minutes while he looked at a map, poorly trained staff (didn't know downtown locations, unfamiliar with hotel services), the highly touted dog nightly turndown service is a myth despite being billed on the Kimpton site as well as other online travel sites (I had to call to ask for it on day 3. The staff had no clue but showed up 15 min later with a giant bowl of milkbones and bottled water.

(5) Free wireless is always nice. The bad: (1) The hotel rooms are depreciating fast. This was out second visit and within a year the bedroom furniture looks very different. Our white chair was covered in coffee stains and the walls are in need of repair. (2) Avoid the Virtuoso Suites. Our previous standard room was almost as big. The suite we booked this time was dark, the bedroom was tiny and the living room had no natural daylight. The oversized bathtub was nice but other than that nothing very exciting about he room. (3) The pool is a disaster \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seating for around 10 people in a relatively large hotel is crazy. It also seems that the pool users are mostly non-guests at the weekend. Locals come to the bar, change in the toilets and use the pool. The pool has a DJ playing very loud music on the weekends. We are in our late 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get us wrong. But on a Saturday at 12 noon you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want music so loud that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk to the person next to you as you relax by the pool (if you could get a seat that is). (4) Room service. Room service is provided by the onsite (but we were told separately managed) restaurant. We never got what we ordered and when we complained were told \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo bad.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 One morning they did not have orange juice and decided to send apple juice instead. I declined but was charged anyway! This was just one of a few problems with room service so our advise is to go out for food. (5) Bar. I think this hotel was built as an excuse to have a bar. The bar tends to dominate the hotel and tends to focus on non-hotel guests. We asked if it might be possible to get a table and it was, but only for $250. For San Diego this is a little too much even for the public but you would think that a hotel guest could get a seat without this cost. The worst thing about the bar is the attitude of the bouncers who won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let hotel guests back to their room to use the toilet. The queue at the bar tends to be long and my wife wanted to go to her room but the bouncer on the hotel exit/entrance told her that if she left she would not be readmitted. This despite the fact that the hotel is directly connected to the bar and this door is used only by hotel guests. So overall, we would save money next time and stay in the Omni down the street. From a prior visit we known that the Omni pool is bigger and far superior, the rooms are nicer and the views are better. We returned to the Solamar because it is smaller and more intimate.

And just last month my wife and I picked the Cypress Hotel in Cupertino, California when we went to see our daugher graduate from Santa Clara. I love the unique things Kimpton does with their boutiquey hotels (most have about 200 rooms) and so signed up for their loyalty program in Cupertino. That being said there are some shortcomings at Hotel Solamar as there probably are with all hotel facilities. Yes, the sink was too shallow (but very artsy-fartsy). Yes, the lighting in the bathroom was too \"moody,\" (dark in the shower, hard to shave in the poorly lit mirror, no fan to extract the moisture from a hot shower). And yes, the music out of our tenth floor window looking down on \"the 20-something scene\" below thumped all night. We came prepared, however. We were in San Diego with two other couples to attend the Padres baseball game. The other two couples were staying at the adjacent Marriott and were paying more ($259.00 as versus our $229.00) for less service. We grabbed our moment to have a drink at the Hotel Solamar bar by meeting the other two couples there for pre-game drinks, before the hip crowd arrived. We always travel with ear plugs so the noise wasn't an issue later on. We are accustomed to the expensive parking fees in that area. But we love the high thread count sheets with the exquisite decorating that Kimpton's do. We like the personal attention their staff gives and their promptness in rendering service. When we needed our car to get called up to go golfing, it was there when we got downstairs. When we called our friends to see where they were, they were still waiting for someone to bring their car around. Everyone from the reception folks to the bell men were anxious to please and engaged in dialogue. I did check around before booking my hotel for this baseball game. We wanted to be within walking distance of Petco Park and the Gaslamp district. The Omni (where we have stayed twice) was quoting $299.00 for this weekend unless you had purchased their baseball special (which had no availability when I checked). The Gaslamp Marriott was at $259.00, the Convention Center Marriott was at $289.00 and originally Hotel Solamar was at $319.00. But with Triple A (or AARP) the rate declined to $239.00 and the loyalty program took another $10.00 a night off. Cheaper price for a more hip environment with better service???...no brainer.

Our room looked exactly like the advertised pictures - and looked even better in person. A girlfriend and I left the husbands and kids at home for an overnight shopping excursion. We booked our stay through Hotwire for a phenomenal price. I called a little while after booking and requested a double bed room and was told they would try but could give no guarantees. We got the double beds as requested and our view of the city was great. The staff was friendly and offered help at every turn. As we checked out, the valet even asked if we needed any directions or other help. And the location was fantastic. Great shopping, great dining just a couple of blocks away in the trendiest district of San Diego. Will keep my fingers crossed that the next time I go to San Diego, I will be able to book this exact hotel through Hotwire. The pictures say it all about this hotel.

Whatever happened to leaving a message on the phone? I had to go down to the lobby at 11:00 PM to get a new key. Room service was terrible, dry cereal arrived with only a fork, and no milk. Several requests were never followed up on by either the housekeeping staff or front desk. The only positive service at this hotel is provided by the valets. (The parking is 30.00 per day) I paid 535.00 per night for a king room including taxes and parking. The rooms are poorly designed, no dresser and only one tiny night stand drawer so business travelers can plan to leave personal clothing items on the floor.

The good points are very good: 1 Location Fantastic location - an easy stroll to the harbour, near all the restaurants and bars in the Gaslamp area (if you like fish you must try McCormick and Shmidt at the Omni on the same street - wonderful catfish)and if your going to a Padres game, its aroundthe corner. 2. Rooms Our room had a pool view (we will come to that later!!!) and was large, clean and very pleasant. Big bed and a lounger were good. 3. Facilities Gym was small and got crowded very easily. Had breakfast in the restaurant which was very nice. Wine tastin is a must. Early evening for an hour. Worth noting however that if its not busy (as with the Sunday of our stay) they dont hang around. Around ten mins to go and they had took all the wine and no one was around to get anymore.

Its like that all day long and goes right the way through the night. This also means that if you have a pool view room get some earplugs - your gonna need em!!

It's an easy walk to the many restaurants of the Gaslamp District, an easy walk to Petco Park and an easy walk to Seaport Village. Our 9th floor corner room was said to have a 'lot more room than our normal rooms.\" I'd hate to see the normal rooms, then. There was literally no space to put clothes. One small drawer on one side of the bedside, and a mini-drawer under the mini-bar. Even smaller was the bathroom. There was no place to hang a hand-towel. We couldn't find room for our own toilet items. And the sink had good form, but no function. The biggest disappointment was the hotel staff. Pleasant but it felt like they were in WAY over their heads. We asked for directions to two nearby restaurants and they had no clue. There was no concierge to ask, since the hotel doesn't have one. When we asked for information on nearby tourist sites, once again they had none. So, I finally asked the front desk if I could see a phone book to look up a number and was told, \"Sorry, we don't have one.\" There was a Padres game Sunday afternoon, and since it was a holiday weekend, the pool area was packed starting around 3:00 with people who wanted to drink to get drunk. There was no way to use the pool, which shouldn't seem like a lot to ask for rooms going over $350/night. Finally, try to find out how recently a dog stayed in your room. While I was at the desk trying to get a phone book, three different people called, asking for a room change. One was because of the noise from the pool, the other two were because of the animal smells.

I enjoyed the atmosphere at the hotel and the staff was very courteous. Our room was cleaned early in the day and it felt very clean. We had wanted two beds, but only a King was left, but we were upgraded to a corner room which was very large. Our room overlooked the pool/club area. It was a nice view. The bathroom was very nicely appointed with quality features, but the lighting was very soft. It was nice and calm in the morning until time to take a close look in the mirror and apply makeup and the it was just too dark in there. I was surprised there wasn't better lighting or a better fan. The wallpaper was ubsosrbing all the moisture, which might lead to problems later with mold. We were greeted professionally by the desk upon our arrival. We were offered a roll away, but ended up being fine sharing a bed with my daughter. The bed was VERY comfortable. We had no trouble with the parking, (valet only $24 a day) we were always noticed by the tag in our window and given priority parking and service as hotel guests. On the weekend the club seems to be one of the hottests places to be. THe lobby was filled with security people and the elevators. THere were people posing a guests of the hotel trying to get into the club sneaking around the hotel. It was uncomfortable to be a hotel guest with all these other people lurking around. We went to our room and the minibar hadn't been restocked, my daughter wasn't feeling well and wanted a sprite. We went to go find one from a soft drink machine. We couldn't find a machine, so we made our way down stairs. Maybe there was one on the floor of the pool/gym but the area was full of people all dressed up and so we didn't feel comfortable getting off there in our \"loungewear\" to look. We asked a few people where we could get a soft drink, but they told us they were all security. We finally went to the frontdesk and were told they would send us up one in 5 minutes, but it never came up. This hotels seems to be two different places, a nice hotel of qualilty service during the day, but the weekend nights seem to be all about the club, and servicing it. THe hotel guests are not the main focus of service, or at least that was our experience. I had been moving my daughter in all day, and was looking forward to a quite soak and swim, which is a usual relaxing experienceat a hotel, but we came back to 200 people surround the pool, which became part of the decor and atmosphere of the club, not something accessible to hotel guests. It seems to me they need to decide what they want to be or offer another area for hotel guests to enjoy. For the price, for a hotel guest to be made to feel like an outsider and second for service was shocking. It is a nice place, just know what to expect and a quiet weekend of being pampered won't be it. Also, I noticed men taking \"women\" up to their rooms from the club, which seemed a bit awkward and like a skanky Vegas hotel instead of a nice clean upscale hotel. It was a strange mix, but over all during the week I would say it is one of the best hotels in SD.

Our trip to SD was a heck of a lot longer and more frustrating than it should have been, due to a flight delay and the people at the car rental company who took an inordinately long time to get us in a car and on our way.

The valet guys were super nice, and when we got inside the guy at the front desk was also incredibly sympathetic and would have upgraded us to a better room had there been any available. When he was telling us about the wine hour hosted in the lobby every afternoon, we sighed and said we should have been there for that if it hadn't been for our delays.

Decor is trendy. Bed was great, comfortable chair, great shower. Sinks were stylish but not very functional. Service was low key. Shouldn't be an issue unless you are high maintenance. Valet parking was convenient and efficient. The pool/bar scene seemed lively but a bit touristy. They have a complimentary wine happy hour, but the wine is low grade. Get a head start on your night instead. Very good experience overall. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous!\u201d", "Author": "gretchenenders", "ReviewID": "UR4982311", "Content": "I too went to the Solamar for a weekend getaway and we couldn't have had a more relaxing, wonderful time. The hotel is gorgeous! From the rich dark woods of the lobby to the large, funky guest rooms. Every detail was well thought out by the designers and comes together beautifully. The sun broke just as we arrived in San Diego so we were able to take full advantage of the rooftop bar/pool. You couldn't ask for a more picturesque setting. Although there wasn't a Padres game being played at the time, you could almost feel the summertime energy emitting from the baseball field across the street. You must take advantage of the wine hour as it provides for great people watching and allows you a chance to spend some time in the beautiful lobby, rather than just walking through it while coming and going. The main drag for restaurants and bars is just a block away which was a wonderful perk. All of the staff was warm and welcoming, from the moment we checked in to having beers on the pool deck, everyone was incredibly helpful and inviting. I can't wait to go back and I will highly recommend to anyone, regarless of your length of stay!", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cSolamar, take me away\u201d", "Author": "Elyse1316", "ReviewID": "UR4626100", "Content": "After a hectic week at work, my boyfriend and I needed a quick get away. We \"Pricelined\" a 4-star hotel in San Diego and were extactic to come back with the Solamar. I had read some positive and some negative reviews, but i wanted to check it out for myself. I think some travelers must expect their lives to go on without a hitch and no one makes mistakes, which is what I was gathering from some other reviews. However, my experience was top notch. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and polite. We entered our room and I was pleased with the clean, soothing color palate and decor. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom a nice size. We met a local friend at the pool for a few drinks and snacks. The drink menu is creative and delicious as well as the bar appetizer menu. The seating area at the pool has something for everyone, whether it be lounging poolside or having conversation under the canopy. We then joined our fellow guests at the wine hour and enjoyed a couple glasses of wine before getting ready for dinner. We returned from dinner out in the Gaslamp and wanted to join the hip crowd at the pool, but couldn't muster up the energy. Our room overlooked the pool bar and we scoped out the scene for a little while. Overall, I would highly recommend Hotel Solmar.", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA Place to Stay but don't Overpay\u201d", "Author": "cineart", "ReviewID": "UR4368541", "Content": "I don't know what's up with San Diego but it seems that all the hotels in the gaslamp area are charging New York prices. The convention center is very busy with New Orleans convention overflow and any decent place within walking distance of gaslamp is charging about $300/night plus $22 parking. I decided to play Russian roulette with Hotwire and bid a four star gaslamp area hotel for $204/night +taxes (for a Thursday and Friday night stay) I got the Solamar, a new boutique hotel that bills itself as four stars. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read the other reviews here and thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d add some comments. The staff was all top notch and I encountered no rude or sub par service as mentioned before. The lobby is well appointed and a nice place to relax and the 4th floor bar is also a nice hangout. The workout room is a joke- the smallest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen with about four pieces of equipment. The pool is also a ridiculous 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deep and therefore useless. The hotel is new so the rooms and furnishings are clean. But here is the real point of my review \u00e2\u20ac\u201cvalue. Our room was very, very small \u00e2\u20ac\u201cso small that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the requisite \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctwo chairs and a table by the window set-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in case you wanted to invite a guest up to your room. More importantly, the rooms were poorly insulated. Any seasoned traveler knows the awful sound of heavy fireproof hotel doors slamming early in the morning as Business Bob leaves at 6:30AM for a meeting. We could hear next-door conversations and the maid vacuuming at 8:00AM very clearly. All of this does not fit in my definition of a four star hotel. Yes the room was decorated in a funky hip style. But with the room size and noise it felt like the Solamar built regular, small and acoustically sub par rooms and then hired a decorator to do an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextreme makeover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adding drapes, some funky lamps and art. That just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut it for their regular $300/night rates. At $204 I felt neither screwed nor did I feel I got any value. If I paid just $5 more a night I might have been pissed. The lobby and bar may look four star but after all I am paying for a room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay here again but if I had to pay $300 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d choose the Marriot Gas lamp (NOT the other Marriot monster convention hotel by the water!!) The Marriot Gas lamp may not have a basin type Kohler sink and funky drapes but the standard rooms are big, immaculate, and have an equally unique California Craftsman style about it.
