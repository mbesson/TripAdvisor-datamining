Near Gran via, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, you can walk to most of the attractions, and of course subway station is very close. There is no need to take a taxi from the airport, you can easily take the bus (EMT Express) from airport to Plaza de Cibeles, and then walk about 5 or 6 blocks to the hotel. The room is simple, and small, but you have most of what is needed for a comfortable stay. It is very clean. Only two things to critize: there is no hair dryer on the room. I think they have only 2 for all rooms, and you have to go in the morning to the reception and ask for it. My experience was not good, because actually hair dryer was never available when I needed it. Then, heat was a little bit high, and I felt really hot. Cristina, the girl at the reception, was really nice! We had some issues with the credit card when trying to authorize it before our arrival, but she kept our reservation and was very helpful. Anyway, it was a very nice stay, and we were all day walking and getting to know Madrid, so to rest and sleep it offers a great service.This is really a hotel I'd recommend. I would definitely go back to Vazquez de Mella.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cVery convenient, clean and friendly hostel\u201d", "Author": "SC168", "ReviewID": "UR130889925", "Content": "Wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in May to do a walkabout short trip in Madrid. Location wise this was very good for us. 15 minutes walk to the Royal Palace / Plaza de Espana / Temple of Debod in the west and 15 minutes to the Retiro Park in the east. Plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. A supermarke was 5 minutes away. The place was clean and tidy. The room we had (no 13) was quite small (or cosy) but clean. The shower worked well. The aircon was strong (you will definitely need it in the summer!). As the window was facing the inner light/air well, it was not noisy (I could image the rooms with windows facing the sqaure could be noisy). Christina the receptionist and the owner's son could both speak good English and were friendly. Overall we were satisfied with it and would recommend the hostel, considering the rate charged and the location of being right in the middle of Madrid. PS: Be very careful with your money/wallet as Madrid is full of professional pickpockets! There was a money changer/telephone calling shop (not Western Union) a street up from the hostel which opens 7 days a week and we got a very good rate changing \u00a3's into Euro.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cSo loud it was nuts!\u201d", "Author": "Bobby F", "ReviewID": "UR128985548", "Content": "I am not a light sleeper. I am from NYC, I can sleep through nearly anything. But this hostel had the thinest walls I have ever encountered. It was honestly ridiculous, I could hear EVERYTHING that happened in the hostel. By the end of a night full of the sounds of back up toilets being fixed, keys jangling, night watchmen talking on the phone, full conversations from various guests at all hours, it almost became a joke! How can one place be so noisy and the walls be so thin? The hostel itself is fine otherwise, small clean rooms, in a central location. But it isn't luxury accommodations, all I expected was to be able to get a good nights sleep there and that did NOT happen. Maybe I got a bad room, but I would caution all others from risking it.
