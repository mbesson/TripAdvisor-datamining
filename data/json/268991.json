Key West is by far my favorite place, and coming from New York, avoidance of driving and riding in taxis is a primary vacationing priciple for me. So, we chose the Pegasus based on location and rate. The price was more than reasonable and the central Duval Street placement was perfect. We are of course interested in the restaurants, bars, and shops of Duval Street, as well as the Sunset Celebration at Mallory Square and all the other historical sites and beautiful walks of Key West Island. The Pegasus provides excellent proximity to all of these things. It is even quite close to Louie's Backyard (if you don't know- make a reservation and find out). But, keeping in mind the obnoxiously loud Spring Breakers, the Pegasus is far enough away from the main attractions that sleep is an actual possibility. In addition, for first time Key West visitors, walking back to the Pegasus at night is a safe option as it is right in the main part of town which is patrolled and distant enough from any dangerous areas. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk requested an additional $300 cash deposit which we were not aware of prior to this point. We soon realized that this was standard practice as a way to deter Spring Breakers from destroying the room. Not a big deal, but be ready and ask before you go. The hotel and room were spotless and innocuously decorated. The staff was very friendly and efficient. There is a parking lot nearly across the street available exclusively to hotel customers if you drive yourself there as we did. It costs and extra $10 per night- this is less than any other parking lot in the area and it is safe. All in all, the Pegasus is an excellent choice for an affordable place to stay in Key West and it will satisfy all those who seek all the island has to offer in a clean, safe, and friendly environment.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miramar, FL", "Title": "\u201cGood location - middle of Duval Street - older rooms\u201d", "Author": "FloridaMainers", "ReviewID": "UR125774133", "Content": "This was the first place we ever stayed at when going to Key West.

You can sit on the roof top and look down and people watch. (the roof top bar was closed the 2 nights we stayed there) The door opening to the rooms on the top floor (pool level) was extremely small. We had a difficult time to bring our cooler into the room because of that. My friend said \"Thank god she wasn't too much bigger, she wouldn't have fit in the doorway\". Our bathroom was newely tiled and renovated but the room was run down with an older rug and beds were just ok. We just wanted a centrally located cheaper place to stay while visiting for the first time, and that's what we got. We did further research and have since stayed at The Southern Most Hotel.

Due to booking needs we had to be in two rooms but it was not a problem. We started out in 212 and ended up in 214 for the last two nights. 214 was certainly quieter but lacking the outdoor window to the street. Note that it was a noisy street at late night so 214 would be better for light sleepers. The bed in 214 was also bigger and plusher, yielding a much better night's sleep. With some humor, the TV in 212 was too large for the room, and 214 kind of small! Neither were a problem while checking the morning news for a few minutes. The bathrooms of both rooms were surprisingly great. All new tile work much more typical of a high end hotel. They were alse extremely spacious. The rooms and bedding were very clean and we had no concerns in that aspect. With the continental breakfast which was in an excellent space and of very high quality was also a great time and money saver. Their elevator saved some steps on my aged knees too. The front desk is manned 24/7 with very nice staff too. They were helpful to answer any question or make recommendations. The location of the hotel is excellent! The parking was up the street but not a problem. The visit started off kind of cold so we did not use the rooftop pool, but the hot top was great at working out the kinks of travel!

We didn't and decided to go with the competitor basically across the street, whom cost almost twice as much, but was customer friendly. We fish tournements around the world for a living and charter our fleets the rest of the time. The one thing we all understand is customer service. Obviously, this hotel doesn't. Too bad.

The plus side to the pool area is being able to look down on Duval from the deck area. If you want location this is the place for that, the parking is close if you have a car and they have a shuttle that will pick you up or drop you off at the airport, this place is in the center of the action though and walking distance to most of the resturants, bars, museums and Mallory Square.

It is located on Duval Street, in the heart of all the action. We found the Pegasus to be clean and reasonably maintained. It's our understanding that parts of the hotel were recently renovated, including the roof, where there is a swimming pool, hot tub, and a bar. Unfortunately we did not use any of these, but our friends reported that the hot tub was in good condition when they used it. Our hotel room (and especially the bathroom) was smaller than most hotel rooms that we're accustomed to, but it was neat and comfortable. Yes, it had a window air conditioner near the bed, but at the end of each day we were so tired that the sound of it running never interfered with our sleep. Our room attendant did a nice job and was responsive to the few requests that we had. A basic continental breakfast was available every morning, and it included coffee, orange juice, milk, a small selection of cereals, bagels, and large muffins. Positive features: great location; reasonably priced for Key West; neat; very helpful staff; complimentary transportation to and from the airport; the roof is a great place to sunbathe or to sit, relax, and watch the Fantasy Fest Parade. Neutral features: small rooms; minimal counter space in the bathroom; no room safe. Negative features: none. Summary - if you're used to top-of-the-line, \"four star\" accommodations, than the Pegasus is probably not for you. But if you're seeking a nice, unpretentious place to shower, sleep, and re-charge your batteries, then do consider the Pegasus. Yeah, we wished the room was bigger, but really, why would you be in your room that much anyway? You're in Key West!!!

There was no option for you to reuse your towels, which is pretty much de facto standard these days. Everything used for the breakfast table was also made out of styrofoam plastic, with no option to recycle, everything went just straight down the bin.

First and foremost the location of the Pegasus is ideal, being right on Duval St. and within walking to distance to all of the must see attractions of Key West including dining, shopping, and nightlife. The rooftop pool was the perfect way to spend a relaxing day away from the hustle and bustle of the beach.

The place is OLD and does need a revamp, but nothing I could not deal with.

It was a small room with one double bed but it served our purposes. After walking Duval St for a few more hours, we came back to take a swim. The pool/deck area is very nice in appearance. While we were floating around in the pool, however, we saw a rat run across the deck. Yuck. And if there was any chance we were wrong about it being a rat, we were able to confirm it a bit later when the rat (I hope it was the same one) came back across the deck and climbed the lattice. I gotta say, it was pretty difficult to leave the pool and go back to our room and sleep comfortably after seeing a rat. We reported the rat to the girl at the front desk, but she didn't seem real interested.
