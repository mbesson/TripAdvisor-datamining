The internet price was only $55 for 3 people in one room with 2 queen sized beds. I also liked the free wifi promised on the website. When we got there we found out that the wifi was only free in the lobby. Since I did not purchase the wifi, I could not check the website to find out that it did, indeed promise wifi in the rooms. I have yet to find contact information to a main office to complain about that. Also, this motel was not quiet. The neighbors were noisy at all hours. The rooms were, indeed, clean. However, the room did not smell fresh. My son complained about an odor, but i did not notice it.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Luis Obispo, California", "Title": "\u201cPlesently surprised\u201d", "Author": "MySLOtravels", "ReviewID": "UR116174934", "Content": "We were Grandma and 2, 10 year old grandsons on a 3 week, mostly camping, vacation but camping costs in San Diego were outragous so thought we found a hidden prize with E-Z 8's exceptionally good price, I was quite concerned when we arrived. Some rooms literally under an elevated highway? Young people standing outside their rooms chatting with beer in hand? Folks arriving without vehicles and obviously not having flown into San Diego? For this Grandma it was a lesson in 'never judge a book by its cover'. As 4 nights were paid for, I felt I had to try. First check - mattresses for bed bugs - new matresses, and exceptionally clean floor around it. It was then that I decided to maybe give a second thought to my first impression and I was repeated rewarded by - a spotleesly clean room, recently renovated with an under-counter refrigerator, fresh bed linens and a total lack of smell - no former smokers, no over done cleaning supplies, no attempt to cover pet smells - a plesent lack of any distingushable scent. Quiet - can't say that word enough. I don't know how an older property as that could be so quiet - both from the adjacent highways and from fellow quests. Pool was clear and inviting as was the area around it. The laundry room was far cleaner than many I have experienced at accomodations 3-4 times the cost of E-Z 8. And the people - fellow guests were cheerful with spontanious 'hi' and 'have a good day', the young people that concerned me on arrived were both curtious and quiet. I kept waiting for the loud partying to begin - it never did and they were so very polite to both me and the children. Staff not only plesent, they were exceptional, giving eating, routing and advice with a feeling that they cared about what they do and about their guests. Would I stay again? Location could not be better, neither could price - as a single with young childern? I would hope my experience is not the exception - if with my husband or other adults? No question! Do it!

We knew it was a low budget hotel, but planned to do so much sight seeing that we only needed somewhere to sleep at the end of the day. The hotel was located under about 4 highways/roads and also bordered the train tracks. I was worried that we wouldn't be able to sleep well, but at night it got much quieter except for our neighbors antics. Unbeknownst to us our neighbor was a recovering drug addict that stayed up late at night. First night was okay, but second night she got in a fight with her boyfriend over $40 and she called the cops on him. The boyfriend had left by the time to cops arrived, but we got to listen to her tell her life story and embellish her boyfriends misdeeds to cops for about an hour. The next night she spent on her phone yelling at her boyfriend and then of course he finally returned to her place so they could continue to argue the final night we were there. Why didn't we leave, well we only had one day left before returning home. The second problem was the carpet smelled like wet dog. I bought a bottle of Fabreeze and used about 3/4 of it to fix the problem. Other smaller problems is that the shower wouldn't turn off all the way (but maintence did fix the next day), we only recieved 2 new clean towels each day, there was no alarm clock in the room and the streets around the area were poorly lit. I just imagined I was visiting another country and it helped me get by. Only stay here if you really need a place. Other than that it is worth it to spend $50 more to stay somewhere a little quieter and safer. After reading some of the other comments I will be sure to check and make sure that our credit cards are properly charged.", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cOK, but definitely a budget motel\u201d", "Author": "R0sie13", "ReviewID": "UR19217470", "Content": "Stayed at hotel so we could quickly get to San Diego airport for a very early flight.

First stop, the office.....great people! Very friendly and resourceful.

They had recently been remodeled, smelled and looked clean and when the door was closed, the noise was limited. This hotel had the most comfortable beds that we had ever slept on at a hotel! There is no shampoo, hair dryers, alarm clocks and all the other little extras, but we did have a refrigerator. If you are squimishy about hookers, you'll need to know that a bus from one of the local \"strip clubs\" makes a stop at the hotel! We watched them walk through the parking lot, head to a room and depart with some male clients. However; not once did the \"ladies\" address any of the males hanging outside their rooms or at the pool. It appears they are by appointment only?! Our night was not disturbed by highway noises or train horns. I've had a lot noiser rooms in higher class hotels!

I stayed at 3 locations, the other two were the Marriott Residence Inn, Downtown and the Carrillo Motor Lodge, which I have written about also. The first motel I stayed at was the EZ8. This motel is part of a west coast based chain of cheap motels. (They have upgraded motels called Premier Inns, again probably lower in price than other motels in their class.) Because it is a chain the quality of the other motels is probably consistent vs. independent individually owned ones, i.e. the motels owned by Patels. They have a website where you can book online (the site is managed by a travel agency travelhero which also has a toll free number you can book through, but despite what EZ8 website says it is cheaper to book directly since they can give you the discounts), although some of the individual hotels have a toll free number this one did not. The rate I paid with AARP discount was $45 (all prices I quote in my review are without taxes) cheaper than getting a private room at the youth hostels in that area! This is located near Old Town in what looks like an industrial area so although you could walk 10 minutes to the trolley, I wouldn't feel safe doing it at night. They do have a security guard on duty at night here and a swimming pool. The rooms have mini-refrigerators and although they have no microwaves, in the vending room which has washer/dryers, video game and food vending machines they do have a microwave oven there. They serve complimentary coffee in the small lobby in the morning. There is no toiletries, just the soap, no hair dryer either. The place is cheap because of the location (it is near the train, airport, trolley so you can hear the noises), and it is reflected in that the room although clean with no stained furniture, had what looked like rust stains in the corner of the bathtub and what looked like a curling iron burn mark on the counter next to the sink. They do not have free local phone calls, but a local phone call is only 25 cents, no matter the length. However, beware if you call and no one answers on the other end, the computer charges the call. Just by coincidence, the manager, a very affable type (important as you will see from my review of the Cabrillo), Joe Cappozzouli was on duty (I wasn't happy, but probably would've paid for those calls) and he graciously took them off the charges. (The desk clerk, Rita, was pissed about this and I could see the manager trying to mollify her!) I did not stay a second night because the mattress was too hard for me (I am used to sleeping on a thin mattress on a sofa bed so perhaps it wouldn't be too hard for others,) and because of my mothers' snoring combined with the outside noises, I needed two rooms. Knowing this is a budget motel with the attendant limitations it is good value for the money and for that reason, I give it an above average rating.", "Date": "December 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "E-Z 8 Motel Old Town", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d226602-Reviews-E_Z_8_Motel_Old_Town-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$45 - $80*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4747 Pacific Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92110</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "226602", "ImgURL": ""}}
