Terrific breakfast buffet included. Cosy bar area offers great place to relax and have a drink or coffee. Hotel's location is great - it's not in one of the well known touristy areas of Berlin but in a quiet residential street of Kreuzberg, just a short walk (approx. 5-10 min) from the subway station \"Hallesches Tor\" (from there it's a quick ride to the museums and the shopping areas in the city center or to \"hip\" places like Prenzlauer Berg or Friedrichshain in the East). It's a cheap (EUR 11) cab ride from Berlin central station and within walking distance (approx. 5-10 minutes) from the local \"Kiez\" Kreuzberg/Bergmannstrasse with lots of bars and restaurants.

A short 3 minutes walk took me to a bus stop where I could catch the M41 bus which goes to, amongst others, Potsdamer Platz and the Hauptbahnhof. A slightly longer walk (about 10-15 minutes) in the other direction and I was at the Hallesches Tor station. Despite being in a rather deserted area, I never felt any worry for my safety coming home after dark. The great thing about the location is that it is almost completely silent at night enabling me to sleep very well. My single room was spacious and clean and the bed was large and comfortable. The shower has good water pressure and the stand out point is the heated floor tiles in the bathroom! The bathroom is equipped with basic amenities and a hairdryer was offered to me during check in. As I travelled alone, the frosted glass door that separated the room and the bathroom posed no problem to me although I can see how it might be an issue if I were travelling with someone else. There are no coffee making facilities in the room but there is a complimentary bottle of water in the room when I first arrived. I only have two suggestions for improvement with regard to the room - Firstly, the lighting in the room was inadequate for night time reading. I usually read up on my plans for the next day before bed and would have liked a bed side light that enabled me to read. There is a reading lamp on the desk but the desk is a tiny one and there was insufficient space to spread my maps on. Secondly, the TV is installed at a weird angle so that I had to twist my body to view it from the bed. Placing it on the wall in front of the bed would make viewing much more comfortable. The buffet style breakfast was good. There is no hot food but instead the is a good spread of breads, cheeses, cold cuts, cereals, smoked salmon and herring salad to enjoy while gazing out at the pretty backyard (I chose a window seat every time). There is an elevator and also a computer with free internet at the bar. The reception staff are very friendly and helpful. I'd have no qualms about recommending this hotel and would myself stay there again in a heartbeat.

We enjoyed living like Berliners for 5 nights, coming home to our neighborhood in the evening. The hotel is contemporary, very clean and pleasingly decorated. Our bright, roomy, high-ceilinged room faced the pretty courtyard and was extraordinarily quiet for a city accommodation. Our fabulously comfortable bed, in the German style, had separate mattresses on a single platform, 2 cozy comforters and large square pillow. It was so comfortable that we tried to find out more about it in hopes of replicating it back home! The breakfast was the best free breakfast in my memory! All the foods appeared to be artisanal, beautifully presented and super fresh, including tasty soft-boiled eggs, fresh yogurt, granola, gourmet cheeses, beautiful whole-grain breads and rolls, freshly cut fruit salad and much more; altogether delicious. Served in a sunny room overlooking the courtyard, breakfast took us through until dinner many days! Free wireless internet too. The only cautions about Hotel Johann are the following: 1. The hotel is a 10-minute walk from the metro, longer than would probably be true in the busier parts of Berlin, and the way is not well-lit at night. 2. In our lovely room, there were a couple of strange quirks: a) There was not a lot of light in the room, making it almost impossible to see items in the wardrobe; b) If you are traveling with a partner with whom you do not ordinarily share bodily functions, talk to the management before you reserve.

We stayed in the large double room that appeared the same as the photos on the Website. The furnishings are more than comfortable and the interior finishes a visual delight. The room has high vaulted ceilings with full height wall to wall orange curtains. These curtains are not lined so daylight passes through filling the room with a beautiful amber glow. Though this provided a wonderful light effect it did interrupt our morning sleep. The bathroom also looked great, but its sliding glass door adjoining the sleeping area is just wrong. This glass door provides no acoustic nor odour privacy. Turning the bathroom light on at night filled the bedroom area with light interrupting my partner's sleep.

There are only a few places to eat nearby within easy walking distance and a greater variety a longer distance away where the nearest U-Bahn stop is located, about a 15-25 minute walk. The hotel itself is nicely appointed with clean, large and comfortable rooms. The buffet breakfast served is great with a good selection of cereal, eggs, some type of smoked fish, and various breakfast meats (ham, sausages, etc.) and good bread and rolls. Juice, coffee and tea are also available. During nice weather, you can eat on on a quiet patio area outside the breakfast room. The wireless internet access worked fine. The hotel also rents bicycles, if you are so inclined. The staff is very friendly and helpful, a big plus. My wife and I stayed there on three occasions over a two week period in three different rooms so we got a taste of the room set up. The only drawbacks that I can mention about the rooms are few. There is a translucent sliding door that \"closes\" off the bathroom from the bedroom. It is somewhat noisy to slide and leaves gaps at each end. This is not a problem unless you need to use the bathroom at night where the noise of sliding the door and the light through the glass might awaken anyone who is asleep. The shower is good but it has a partial glass partition to serve as a \"shower curtain\" which is a bit too short to keep water inside the shower. You have to be somewhat careful to avoid having a wet floor. Finally, we were there in May and the weather was pleasant but since there is no air conditioning, the room might become uncomfortable during the summer if it is hot and humid outside. To sum up -- We enjoyed our stay there and highly recommend the hotel.

It is at the front of the building and when we opened our windows, it was initially quite noisy when cars went past on the 'cobbled' street. It is a quiet road though and it never stopped us getting to sleep. Breakfast was superb in a lovely room. The staff are always busying around to make sure there is always lots of everything. Didn't have to use the reception much but the people were always polite and friendly. We also went down to Bergmanstrasse to eat - another pleasant stroll south. A tip - if you go to Pagode, a Thai restaurant which is definitely recommended, collect your own food - it is effectively a takeaway with lots of tables.

Safe and absolutely non touristic area. Just across the hotel there is one of the finest german restaurants (\"Altes Zollhaus\"). The room was pretty spacious, very clean and pretty. The glass bathroom door is not highly recommended for new couples, as it may cause some embarassment..... It also had a small balcony, which for us smokers was pretty useful. The hotel has a very cosy breakfast room (where you should not expect scrambled eggs and bacon, although everything that is offered is fresh and delicious) and also a very nice backyard, where you can take your breakfast, if the weather is good. The owners are simply adorable, extremely polite, but in a relaxed and casual manner and always ready to make you feel you are more than welcome, almost part of a big bunch of friends. I loved it!!

We chose it mainly because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor but also because the price was reasonable and it looked nice on the website. To get there from Berlin-Schonefeld, take the \u2018Airport Express\u2019 to Friedrichstrasse, then the U6 to Hallesches Tor (direction Alt-Mariendorf). The hotel is 5-10 mins walk from Hallesches Tor, on a quiet residential street. The whole journey took an hour \u2013 but I would allow 90 mins in case of missing connections etc \u2013 check-in is available until midnight. On arrival, we were greeted by a very helpful staff member who spoke very good English (a godsend considering our poor skills in German). We were in our room within minutes \u2013 after stopping to get some reasonably priced drinks from the honesty bar in the hallway. Our room was just as we had hoped it would be \u2013 spacious and comfortable with lovely furnishings. The bathroom had a sliding glass door which gives no soundproofing whatsoever, so it\u2019s definitely best to stay here with someone you know well! We didn\u2019t realise that the bathroom floor was supposed to be heated \u2013 this must have been what the thermostat in the bathroom was for (we thought it was for the room itself). The bed was an \u2018Austrian twin\u2019 \u2013 two single mattresses on a double frame and was very comfy. We weren\u2019t so keen on the feather pillows \u2013 but that\u2019s just personal preference I guess. The central heating worked fine when needed and the windows were easy to operate and provided good soundproofing. There is no air conditioning though \u2013 hopefully the high ceilings would compensate for this in the summer months. Although others have praised the selection of food for breakfast, we found it a little bit disappointing. The breakfast room itself is really nice and you can eat in the courtyard when the weather is good. The food available included cereals, bread, cheese, ham, cold veg, fruit salad and yoghurt. There may have been 10 different types of bread but we were hoping for some hot food or at least some \u2018sweet\u2019 items such as croissants, pain au chocolat etc. The other guests seemed to be happy though so I guess this just comes down to cultural differences (although I don\u2019t remember having any problems with breakfasts when we went to Austria). Overall, we were really pleased with this hotel and it is highly likely that we will stay here again if we go back to Berlin. The location may seem quite far from the centre of Berlin, but the proximity of the U-Bahn makes travelling around very easy. One useful point to note is that they are currently offering a 3% discount for cash payments \u2013 there are ATMs in the shops near Hallesches Tor.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "runningjohn", "ReviewID": "UR15506629", "Content": "My wife and I and a couple of friends stayed 3 nights.
