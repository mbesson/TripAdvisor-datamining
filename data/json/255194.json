(we didnt find the shortcut till the last day) Most of the staff were polite and we liked our room. It had a small amount of damp on the ceiling but you could see they had tried to clean it off. There was a tv in the room but we never turned it on. We went down for breakfast most morning's and you do have to get there at a good time as the week we stayed there were lots of greedy people stuffing themselves but we always found something. The lady who worked in the breakfast hall wasnt the friendliest person but we didnt care much. To get free wi-fi just go down to reception and they will give you a password. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who doesnt mind not being right in the centre of Rome. Mind you, we could see the vatican from our bedroom window and it was only a 10 min walk.

On the map the hotel appears to be very close to the Vatican, but it\u2019s actually on top of a whiny hill walking down the road takes a lot longer then it appears and you could take the stairs but that also long and difficult to traverse if you have luggage. So the location is actually more inconvenient then it appears. A/C was a problem it didn't work!!! The receptionist told me it was only on during the hours of 1pm to 6pm? What a terrible excuse. Other problem we had was the plumbing, since there was no shower in enclosure the water did not drain and so the water leaked out of the bathroom. Reported that and they fixed it the next day, but the A/C they said they would turn it on additional hours of 10pm to 4am? WTH its June and its hot but these people won't fix the A/C!!!

The front desk is staffed by accommodating and well-informed employees who are ready to help guests with directions, restaurant suggestions, etc. I needed to make contact with a Roman archaeologist, and Georgio made the phone call for me, negotiated the introductions (my Italian is not ready for a quick phone conversation), and later asked about how things had turned out. I loved breakfast at the Alessandrino. The breakfast room is lovely, or you can eat outside al fresco on the patio. The selection of food includes both hot (bacon and eggs) and cold items (cereal, yogurt, fruit, juices), as well as fresh breads and pastries. This is all included in the price of the room. The building is charming, well-maintained and clean, and it is pleasantly tucked away from the noise and crowds of the city. The rooms have wonderful large windows on vertical hinges that can be opened for a delightful breeze, or closed if you prefer the air conditioning. I stayed for ten days in July, and even though the heat in the city during the day was grueling, there was always a pleasant breeze in my room in the evening (I needed the air conditioning only on the last night I was there). On Via Monte del Gallo (the street that leads from the hotel to everywhere else) includes a very adequate small grocery and a friendly coffee bar. From the San Pietro train station, a larger Carrefour supermarket is just a 3 minute walk (this place is visible from the bus stop at the San Pietro station. I was in Rome to do research at the American Academy library, so I wanted a hotel near the Janiculum hill. I look forward to staying at the Alessandrino the next time I am in Rome, whether to study or to play. It was a great comfort to know that after a long hot day in the library or in the forum I could look forward to going back to the quiet comfort of the Alessandrino. It should be said that a taxi or car is the only sensible way to arrive or depart from this hotel (unless you are young and in good shape). The hotel is located at the end of a side street, about a block from a bus stop and three blocks from the San Pietro train station. Without luggage, the walk to and from the train station is easy and pleasant. The 64 bus departs every 5 minutes from the San Pietro train station, and finishes at the Termini train station--so on it you can get just about anywhere in Rome with only one change. Or you can take a train from the San Pietro station (this is a regional train, not a Metro stop), and go to Termini as well as several other destinations.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cNice surprise\u201d", "Author": "Czech81", "ReviewID": "UR54335038", "Content": "Good value in walking distance to public transport, Vatican city, etc. Little bit difficuilt to find it but Rome is confusing citi at all.

Before our leave for Rome, I bombed the front desk with various questions via email and they usually replied with detailed answers within 10 min! They ordered a limo that picked us up at the airport for only 40 euros per car (the express train from the airport to Termini would cost 24 euros). The only problem with our stay was that local residents once enjoyed their life too loud until midnight - it has been already streesed out in other reviews. I also have to mention that if you find a map of the area via Google or http://www.go-rome-hotels.com/hotel-alessandrino.php, it will show a metro (subway) station there additionally to the railway one. It's misleading info - there is no metro station there so if you need to go to the center of Rome, you could board a train on St. Pietro railway station that goes to Termini and get off on the second stop where you will have a free transfer to the metro (it costs 1 euro).

It is a bit tricky to find but once you know where it is there is a short cut to get down on to the main road which the staff will point out to you. It is literally ten minutes away from the vatican so very easy to get there and to main shops. The train station 'Roma San Pietro' is less than 5 minutes away to get train to airport etc. Decor - little old fashioned but considering that its 3 star and the low price paid it was very reasonable and it was clean. Like many italian hotels the shower is not enclosed, it is like a wet room. Fridge in hotel room, wardrobe and safe that was bolted down to the wardrobe so felt quite safe to use. We had a double room with kingsize bed that was v. comfortable. Breakfast is a standard affair, a few croissants, cereal, biscuits, yogurts, fruit juice. They will do you a fresh cappuccino if you ask the staff who were all pleasant. If you want any drinks at any other time water, cola, alcohol their prices are very reasonable. We sat outside on the sun terrace on the last afternoon, very pleasant and had a drink there. Security - felt safe at all times, came back late one evening about 1.30am and the desk was manned all through the night. If eating out and wanting to be near the hotel would recommend the Goose Pizzeria under the railway lines on opposite side of road to hotel, mainly locals eating there not too touristy and great pizza.

Coming from FCO airport, I followed easily the indications you find on line. However I got a bit lost in the trip from the train/subway station to the via Clemente and the streets get very steep to climb; so be ready if you have many luggages! The Alessandrino hotel is located in a remote area very close to the Vatican and very quiet, which you might appreciate at night. But it's not an easy access to the center of the city. At night, you have to take a taxi to get there. Which I did twice in a day. My room was very small but very clean and comfortable (actually someone took a picture of it; room 201) When I came back around midnight exhausted, a sketchy guy at the reception asked me if I still wanted my free breakfast at 8:10 in the morning. Earlier in the afternoon, I originally said 9 and then changed it to 8AM. So I told the guy in Italian it was 8AM and not 8:10...a weird time I remember thinking. The guy corrected it. The following day as I got ready to go out to enjoy the morning, I couldn't find my wallet. Right away I thought I left it at the front desk cause I knew I had it when I paid the cab. The nice lady at the reception this morning didn't find anything and contacted the night shift guy who didn't find anything either. I was a bit panicking cause I didn't have any money left and was supposed to reach the airport to catch a flight to Milan in the afternoon. Luckily the cousin of a friend of mine lived in Rome and met me to bring me some cash (I admit I was VERY lucky for that). So I went to see the local police - the carabinieri- to make an official statement that I lost my wallet with credit cards and driving license, after I called Visa and Mastercard to cancel my cards. In that regard, the hotel personnel during day time was very helpful and cooperative. They even let me used their acces to the web. The following day when I was in Como, not only I realized that my three credit cards have been used for expensive sums at a local Rent car agency at the FCO airport, but I remember specifically that night opening my wallet before going to bed to take business cards and phone numbers I needed, putting it back in my jeans that I left on the tiny table near the TV, and LUCKILY placing my passport with my cell phone near the bed. Which means that someone came into my room while I was sleeping and stole my wallet (I was dead tired as I landed in the morning and had been waking all day long) . I know it sounds like paranoia but I swear I had my wallet in my jeans right before going to bed. I remembered even which cards and papers I pulled out from it to be ready for my trip the following day. And the ladies who brought me my breakfast at 8AM didn't get inside the room. Of course they could have come back when I was taking my shower, but my credit cards transactions appeared to have been done originally on Friday US time...which means the day before but if you consider the time difference between the US and Europe, most likely between midnight and 6AM Italian time. Then my friends told me thieves stealing people while they were sleeping happened often not only in hotel rooms but even in private houses! Some even used spray. Which I don't believe was my case although I was very tired by the jetlag. Retrospectively, I thought the young taxi driver that took me back to the hotel that night looked a bit odd to me but more importantly, the guy working at the reception at night seemed very strange. And I remember finding weird when I first checked in earlier in the morning that the only lock at the door was the key, and I couldn't tell which way was I supposed to turn it to lock it. Once again I got lucky my passport didn't get stolen that night - I placed it near me - but more importantly that I didn't wake up to confront the thief, not knowing what could have been my reaction or his/theirs. Apart from that incident, the hotel was nice and the personnel during the day too. But I would question the safety of the hotel itself, cause it seemed everyone could have get in and out at night...

We'll get right to the point - issue first: 1) Directions to and accessibility of the hotel: This is the only time we were lost during our whole trip and it was a costly situation as no matter from where you approach the hotel (bus or train), it is uphill while lugging bags through windy, narrow, and busy streets. Even when we tried a cab on our first night, we had to lead the driver by the hand. Also, St. Peter's and the Vatican are a nice walk getting there but is a very long walk returning after touring, climbing the dome, visiting the tombs, and the local sights in the vicinity. At the end, you still have to climb back up to the hotel. Also, not many places to eat dinner nearby that any local would recommend. 2) Variable service by the staff : We had contact with 3 different staff members. Our first contact was after we arrived exhausted from getting lost and dragging our bags up there. The desk was abandoned. We each went a different way and no one. So, as last resort, I called the front desk and there she arrived. I stopped her from answering the phone to save myself the phone charge and she was not too happy. I explained that we had spent 10 minutes looking and had no idea when someone would return to the desk and that we had gotten lost and were very tired. This particular employee also did not help us to find the laundramat (back down the hill - like we really wanted to do that again that same night). Luckily, we finally found a local to help us find it. The other female staff member we came across was very professional. We got the feeling that she was very knowledgable. One night there was a man was at the desk who understood little English and was not informed as to hotel policies. Tried to get internet access from him (the wifi they talk about is 10 Euro for 3 hours-highway robbery compared to local internet shops). He had no idea how to give us access and did not understand that we needed a password and id. It was very frustrating even if he seemed like a nice man. 3) Carpet Issues in Room 105: See our pics - it was like something was spilled and something ground into the carpet near the window/bathroom. We wore shoes or socks to protect us from issues. Hint: Every 2 star we have stayed in in Italy has marble or tile floors throughout - no carpet. If you see carpet - may be it's better to try someplace else. We did not dicuss the carpet with management as we figured that any manager should already know that the carpet should have been cleaned or replaced. 4) We were not informed that the separate remote was for free TV. The brochure in the room displayed pay movies and porn. So we watched regular tv with snow and only CNN. The okay part - 1) The bed was not bad to sleep in especially after climbing hills - could have slept on a rock slab after that. 2) Breakfast was fine as we learned to hit the supermarkets for 100% juice and great meet and cheese to supplement breakfast. (FYI: Mortadella - one of their breakfast meats - is a contains pork tripe. Never keen on eating it let alone when it is sitting out on a table unchilled.) 3) The taxi to the airport they order arrived within 5 minutes of scheduled pickup. 4) The other good part is that by the time we got there, we had already learned a bit of italian and were able to take care of our own needs and did not rely on their staff after dealing with the two poor staff members. We came and went using our own initiative. Of all our stays, this is the hotel that we would not return to mainly due to the location up in the MONTE and lack of surrounding support (Dinner, computer, etc.)", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cThe kids loved it, the parents not so much\u201d", "Author": "EugeneLA", "ReviewID": "UR8358586", "Content": "Got one of the apartments for five days, because it'd have room for the entire family. The word \"rustic\" comes to mind when describing it. FAMILY ROOM Good sized. A queen sized bed and television in the bedroom with a door. In the living area, a twin bed, a trundle bed underneath it that pulled out, a table, sink, drawers with utensils and pots & pans, a small refrigerator/freezer, and a small electric range. The bathroom is shower only - and while the fixtures are fine, the walls are in desperate need of a new coat of paint to cover the mildew. STAFF One person spoke perfect English, two spoke broken English, and the early a.m. guy didn't seem to speak any. Helpful, but not above and beyond. INTERNET The apartments don't have internet. There's supposedly an internet cafe down at the bottom of the hill at Via della Cava Aurelia, but it was closed every time we went by. Ended up going to an internet cafe across town. TELEVISION Three channels - one came in clear, the other two were fuzzy. Two Italian channels, one French. LOCATION The best part of staying here was the location. This is not a tourist trap - this is a local Italian neighborhood with local Italian people. No mass crowds of American tourists loudly yammering on about their MySpace pages, no salesmen trying to hock handbags or shawls, no beggars working their act. You pass regular people and hear their conversations and their laughter - you get woken up in the morning by the sound of church bells. On the same street Monte De Gallo, there's a friendly cafe/bar with some scrumptious cheap plates of Italian food. On the same street is a small family-run mini-market - great for sodas and snacks. But these shops close early - around 7pm. If you want to eat later in the evening, just walk down the hill towards Via Gregorio. A couple great restaurants and gellaterias here open til later hours. DIRECTIONS: GETTING HERE Take the FM3 or FM5 train to Stazione San Pietro. Take the exit to Clivio di Monte del Gallo and make a right. You should see cars and motorcycles parked on your right side, along with the train tracks. Walk up Clivio di Monte del Gallo - it goes uphill, downhill, and then uphill again. At this point, look on your left - find the stairs that take you to Monte del Gallo. Walk up this hill - at the very top is the Hotel Alessandrino. Even if you've got an apartment, check in at the front desk of the Alessandrino. For more info, check the attached pictures below. GETTING AROUND The Vatican/St. Peter's is the only thing in walking distance. From Stazione San Pietro, the #64 bus will take you into the heart of Rome, ending at Termini. Very easy to use - just validate your ticket after you get on board. Be sure to buy your bus passes AND your return bus passes before you get on the bus. Or you can take one of the trains from Stazione San Pietro to hook up with the Metro. Take any of the trains north to Valle Aurelia to change to the Metro A line, or take any of the trains south to Ostiense/Piramide to change to the Metro B line. Don't forget to validate your tickets in the station. OTHER STUFF ABOUT THE APARTMENT Beware the Roman mosquitos - they're huge and bloodthirsty. We ended up closing all the windows and just running the air conditioner for fresh air. And you'll get three heavy keys - one for your apartment, one for the hallway, and one for the outside door.

Then I had directions to get to the hotel from reviews, and they were all wrong! However, I kept going uphill and asking pedestrians, and then miraculously I arrived at the hotel. At this point I was so glad to find it that anything would have been great. I asked the hotel staff how to ge to a certain church to see a concert that my daughter was in, and she told me which bus to take. At this point it was getting dark but off I went into Rome. She didnt tell me about the bus tickets, though. You have to have them in advance, you can't purchase from the driver. However, the driver just shrugged his shoulders and I rod e for free. I did make it to the concert. All of Rome at night is full of people walking and lots of tourists. I felt very safe walking around by myself after midnight, even when I went back to the hotel on the bus.. The room was nice though, clean, nice bathroom, Never mind that I actaully had no luggage, and I had to wash out my clothes each night and dry them on the air conditioner, which managed to kick out enough air to dry them by morning. The walls were thin though; one night I heard a person throw up all night in the bathroom, they must have had the flu or something. That was bad. The staff tried to be helpful, but Romans in general never tell you all that you need to know in one go anyways. I took the bus; which you can find via the big staircase, and did so for 4 days and we were not robbed. However, my teenage daughter was groped, so that was not good. We took a cab home once in the evening, and the driver found the hotel no problem, they seem to know the street Monte di Gallo. I found the walk at the end of the day OK. Good exercise. For a meal we walked down to San Pietro station and then found some outdoor places that were OK. Maybe my level of expectation is so low that it doesnt take much to please me??

The staff were young professionals who spoke excellent English and were always very helpful to me. The daily breakfast was very good and extensive. It is free for hotel guests. There is a small charge for apartment dwellers. The apartment was full of light, with tall windows and airy drapes. There were also shutters to keep the room cool on hot days, and quiet during the night. It was very nice, with a small but really usable kitchen. I shopped at the little grocery store down the street and stocked up...and cooked some good meals. Also the grocery makes fresh sandwiches and has excellent pastries and cookies. I bought a sack lunch there daily, and it was always excellent. Very nice people own the store. There is also a great neighborhood cafe, I Tigli, good for morning cappucino and stunningly fresh and wonderful pastries. Also a good place for a glass of wine and a visit in the evening. This is a real neighborhood...not a tourist location. The neighborhood is charming. The apartments are in a building occupied by Italian families. It is a great place to meet neighbors. Friendliness and a little respect go far in these meetings. A ten minute walk from the Vatican, the mornings and evenings are filled with church bells ringing. The dreaded basement apartment was beneath mine, and was only described as kind of dark by the folks staying there. They wanted the ground floor because they had small children. If you don't want that apartment, just let them know in advance. I would advise taking the train from the airport and, after getting off at Termini, take the train from track 27 or 28 (it varies), getting off at San Pietro. It's a short walk up the hill. Make sure your luggage has good wheels before attempting. Take the exit at San Pietro marked Clivo di Monte del Gallo, and then up the hill. After a short walk, couple of steps lead to Monte del Gallo. There is another entrance to the hotel that requires a walk up quite a number of steep steps. But this is not the one from San Pietro. It's really not bad. I recommend using the train to go into Termini daily, and then follow the signs to the Metro...which will take you to within walking distance of most of the famous sites. Keep your wallets in your front pockets and wear your backpacks back to front. A good shoulder bag held under your arm works, too. The Italians who use the Metro use these methods. You can buy a daily Metro/ bus/ train pass in the hotel lobby for 4 Eu. Ask them for a Metro Map. It's good quality and really helpful. Avoid the #64 bus. It is an excellent way to be robbed. The train is clean and safe, and the Metro is fast. I hope you enjoy this lovely, lovely neighborhood and its people (and cats). I can't wait to visit again.

We booked a triple and were very pleased with the amount of space, not to mention the hand painted details on the ceilings and walls of the room. Both the hotel and rooms were sparkling clean. Our bathroom was more than adiquate with standing shower, towel warmer and ample space. From our balcony we could see the top of St. Peter's Basillica and also it overlooked a wonderful, quiet courtyard. Throughout our stay the Alessandrino staff was very kind and exceptionally helpful with directions and anything else we needed to know. (Remember to leave your room keys at the front desk as you leave each day. Not only is it expected, but it's much better than lugging them around with you all day.) Concerning the stairs mentioned in another posting - There are about 100 stairs that open near the hotel grounds, but we much preferred the ambling street that wound it's way down the hill and opened nearly across the street from the Western Gate of St. Peter's Square. For an even shorter route, about half way down the street (Via de Gallo) there is a small shrine to Mary. Just to the right are about 10 low stairs to a shorter route to the bottom of the hill. Either way, the short walk is filled with the sights and sounds of Rome (small grocery shop, coffee shop, post office and residences), and is not strenuous in the least. If you plan to travel by intercity rail, there is a stop just at the bottom of the hill. I highly recommend Hotel Alessandrino to anyone looking for a great deal, great service as well as location - location - location!

I was there from MARCH 9TH,TO MARCH 15TH, 2004. The weather was cool and damp mostly. I spent three(3) days in Rome and four (4) days on the island of Malta. I satyed at the Alesandrino Hotel in Rome. It is a 3 star property located in a residential area. It's about a mile or two from the Vatican City. The location is good but it's near a train station (st. Peter's) and close to a main city stretch of road. Homeless people (who bother you by no means) stay near there also. The neighborhood, however resembles a working-class one. It's somewhat a strange place for a hotel. The hotel is nice and it is a new building although the single room I stayed in was very, very small and narrow. The staff are helpful and the continental breakfast was excellent serving fresh eggs and sliced meats. Rome- a travel must, is an experience. Their homeless situation and the poverty is overt. There was graffitti on most of the buildings. Also, the US dollar is \"weak\"(ONLY ABOUT 75 CENTS) to a Euro. Alltogether, it was a good experience.", "Date": "March 24, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Alessandrino Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d255194-Reviews-Alessandrino_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $222*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Clemente Alessandrino 9</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00165</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "255194", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/af/cc/afcc49cf0940343eab81e564c8a8bfce8large.jpg"}}
