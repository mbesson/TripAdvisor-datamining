For instance feather pillows are available for people like me - I just cannot sleep on hollowfibre pillows. When in London on business I always book Holiday Inn Bloomsbury as I have found it to be the only one where I get a good night's sleep which is crucial for work. The staff here are all extremely welcoming and friendly and many have been there a long time and recognise repeat guests which is always nice. The location is excellent and within walking distance of Euston, St Pancras and Kings Cross. I cannot agree with some of the negative reviews, I have been staying here for nearly 10 years and have never seen a mouse.

We decided to go for the Last Minute 4* Secret Hotel deal which turned out to be the Holiday Inn. We were a little disappointed as first as I wouldn't necessarily class the chain as 4*, however we went with an open mind. The lobby was great and the staff were brilliant. However the room was tiny. The bed seemed smaller than the double we have at home. The heating was on max which made it like a sauna. We had to climb behind the telly to turn it off and had to put the air con as low as possible to try and cool the room down. The bathroom was miniscule. It was actually quite hard to close the door once you were in there (like those tiny cubicles in some bars and restaurants!). Anyhow, it was a great location and we are aware that in London you pay for location so we were happy with the price we paid. Or we were until we tried to sleep! The plumbing was extremely noisy. I am a heavy sleeper but it even woke me up. Everytime someone in the hotel went to the toilet it sounded like they had flush our loo! And it is a big hotel, and there was a lot of people going to the toilet throughout the night!

Don't expect a large range of amenities in the bathroom though! Plenty of towels for one person, might of been a push for two (of course the room itself would have been a push for two).

Its location is excellent, round the corner from Russell Square tube station and next door to the Brunswick Centre which has a good variety of eateries, shops and entertainment. Walking to Covent Garden, Oxford Street or Kings Cross is easy or you can hop on one of the frequent buses to go further afield. The lobby is bright, modern and spacious. The Reception staff and Concierge are friendly, efficient and professional as are the Housekeeping staff when you meet them in the corridors. I haven't eaten or drunk there so can't comment on the restaurant or bar. Our room was on the first floor which is also where there are several training suites and conference rooms. There was some noise from the corridor - I got woken up by people talking at 4.30 am one night - but generally it felt pretty quiet. I think it was an executive room - we had a small separate lounge area with a sofa, desk and table. The bathroom was modern and spotlessly clean, with good quality toiletries. There were complimentary bottles of mineral water replenished every day and a kitkat chunky on arrival. We didn't use the safe or the minibar. A couple of slight irritations: I would have liked to sit on the sofa and watch TV but that wasn't possible due to a large pillar in the middle of the room. It would also be nice to have had a docking station in the room. And there is a hefty charge for internet access which generally means I end up leaving the hotel and buying snacks and drinks somewhere with free wifi.

Very quick check in and nice clean reception and great welcome from the front of house on arrival. We had a double room which yes is not massive but it is all you need, comfy bed with choice of pillows, good TV, hairdryer wardrobe/drawer space, desk etc... If you forget anything like toothbrush/shaving etc reception will sort it out free of charge. Their were only a couple of downsides to the room but believe me did not ruin our stay. The first being the complimentary in room tea tray. They have a thing about sugar in this hotel from our experience, unless you don't take sugar or only want one each take some of your own lol! The maid came in the after our first nights stay and left us with only one towel between us and did not re stock the tea tray so had no sugar and not enough milk and dirty mugs. We did go down to reception and ask for more towels and re-stock. Reception were very friendly and said it would be sorted, alas it was not. Second was the service panel in the wardrobe that kept falling out and making a large bang but again did not ruin our stay. The bar is very comfortable and friendly and the snacks/bar food is fabulous (huge portions) and served with a smile! Everything is in easy reach, Covent Garden, West End, Train Stations, Soho etc. We had room service several times and they always delivered on time. Room service 24 hour menu is vast and again portions MASSIVE! We ate at the hotel a lot as food was great and it suited our schedule. Overall if I was to book again in London would go back. I have stayed in other hotels in London and would chose to go back to this one due to the excellent facilities. Although other hotels have had larger rooms we paid a premium and did not have the room service that Holiday Inn provided. We stayed on 3rd floor and it was quiet for central London.

When we arrived they had no trace of our requirements however they did their best and gave us a room on the inner of the hotel. Although i note the windows have now been changed to double glassing so noise in the rooms will be less of an issue. We went to our room and couldn't believe as we opened the door. It was like opening a cupboard with a double bed and desk pushed in. At one side of the bed you couldn't even get in or out of for the wall, plus no bath only a shower. We had never had a room like this on previous visits and headed straight back down to reception. We were allocated another room, headed back up in the lift and guess what exactly the same. Our hearts sank. We were there for a special occassion and this was just not what we expected. After few minutes discussion we headed back down to reception. We explained we had stayed numerous times and rooms had always been larger etc. Reception explained that they were standard rooms and they now offered larger rooms on an executive rate and offered us one of these for an additional fee! We asked to have a look at one first and yes when they were much larger, had full bathroom, bathrobes etc etc. We negotiated the price and settled on one of these.

The breakfast was included in the package we bought. It is o.k. We didn't take the sausages/bacon etc. but others did with gusto. The fresh-fried eggs were really too runny on just one of the 6 days we were there. The bread was fresh. There was fresh melon balls and orange slices. The juices seemed a little watery. The coffee was bitter, like every other place in London except for the Italian restaurants. We were assigned a family room with double bed and a pull out couch. I hurt my back trying to pull out the couch. At the front desk, we were informed that that couch doesn't work and we would be upgraded to an executive suite. Yeah! The staff couldn't get the computer to agree. Boo! We were given another family room and the pull out couch bed was unusable: a matress so thin that you could feel each spring. The staff argued that that was what we ordered. I ignored the obvious counter-argument that we didn't order an unusable bed and instead asked them what they could do for us. They immediately suggested that they send up several duvets to pad the mattress. They've obviously had had this complaint before. This worked well. The heating/cooling instructions were given to us incorrectly and they had to send someone up. He was very helpful. The TV kept showing a big black bar saying \"Msg\" but we had no messages. The staff instructions didn't work. They sent up a very pleasant guy who couldn't help. They resolved the issue the next day. The rooms are very small and currently in need of a \"spruce up\": e.g. the furniture is chipped, but it is clean. I think it was very expensive for what we got and it is definately NOT 4 STAR.

It's a purpose built building so I would imagine that 90% of the rooms are the same size and layout. It has a new bright lobby and adjacent busy bar and restaurant. Rooms are standard Holiday Inn equipped though for some weird reason not all have safes. Why a refurbished hotel thinks it's OK not to put safes in all rooms is beyond me. The 'executive' rooms on the first floor have stylish wooden sliding shutters - they look pretty but be aware that the black out ALL hint of light so if you are a heavy sleeper make sure you set good alarms if you need to be up! The standard rooms are smaller than perhaps average but well equipped and standard Holiday Inn fair. I have found that here and at several other HI's the 'choice of pillow' concept doesn't really work as I get the impression that the maids just 'guess' which is firm or soft (as I can't tell either!) and just put the label on what the think is best! I haven't found any noise problem in any of the rooms that I have stayed in. For me the best thing about the hotel is the location - five minutes walk (if that) from Russell Square tube, 15 minutes from St Pancras or Euston and adjacent to the now fabulous (once horrid) Brunswick Centre with Waitrose, Tesco Metro and a dozen or more excellent eateries for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Normally, this means paying hundreds and hundreds of pounds to hire a hoist from an assistive technology company and having it delivered - but not at the H. Inn Bloomsbury! They are trailblazers; they have installed ceiling-track hoists in two of their accessible rooms in this hotel. This makes it one of only two hotels in London (the other is also an IHG hotel but much more expensive) that I can stay at without having to hire additional equipment - for this I would return even if I were greeted at check-in by a giant, talking cockroach - it really is worth the world, to be able to book into and stay at a hotel like a typical guest without having the bill for the trip pretty much doubled by equipment hire costs. And as it is, no cockroaches, talking or not - this is a spotless, impeccable hotel in a slightly awkward and dated building which is very much made the most of. Despite having a very busy pub downstairs and (I think?) a nightclub across the square I didn't hear a peep and slept extremely well. The accessible room I stayed in was generously proportioned and the bathroom spacious (also provided with a hoist!) well thought-out, although crying out for a wheel-in shower - that would be the final touch that really would make the Holiday Inn the absolute perfect hotel for me. The crowning glory for the severely disabled traveller is the complimentary small room with through door provided for a Personal Care Assistant - I've never come across this in another hotel and it was absolutely fantastic - actually a better setup than what I have in my own specially-designed house! Breakfast was perfectly nice, particularly the mini pastries which were still warm and frankly heavenly, but not even remotely worth the cost - they'd have to encrust it all in gold leaf or something... go for it as a special treat maybe, but otherwise pop round the corner and get something from Waitrose. Omitting breakfast makes the stay rather better value for money than it would otherwise, much though I miss the buffet. The staff are unfailingly friendly and attentive - unusual in such a big hotel. Having returned a few times I'm recognised now, which is really lovely. Makes a big hotel in a big city feel much smaller. Honourable mention to the night-time duty manager who helped us to sort out a 2am fluid spillage without so much as blinking, despite the fact that I was on the bed while it was being changed and unable to get out again - above and beyond the call of duty, that. These days I have to sleep in a special bed which I hire from the above-mentioned assistive tech company - fore-warn the hotel and by the time you check in the bed's been delivered, set up by the delivery driver and then made up impeccably by housekeeping. It's quite something to have to bring your own bed with and STILL feel like you present no additional trouble to the staff! This is now the only place I will stay in London.

I asked reception if there was any chance for us changing to a non-smoking room, and was told that we could have a new room the next morning. We were even offered an upgrade to an executive room. So the next morning I went down to reception for the room switch, and the receptionist on duty could not find any changes or notes regarding our change. All she could do was put us in an available room, an executive room, but we would have to pay an extra GBP 15 per night for this. I tried explaining that the receptionist i spoke to the previous night offered this upgrade as a courtesty, but then I was told I had misunderstood. Well, I didn't. The executive room was as you would expect an ordinary room in a four star hotel would be like. Even the window, in this non-smoking room, did open! The new room also had a minibar, the old one did not. The cost of using the wifi was high, but across the street you can use the wifi in the shopping centre for free.

The bed was also comfortable. My concern is that I booked this hotel as a mystery 4 star hotel on lastminute.com (currently asking them why they believe it is a 4 star hotel). I was very surprised when I arrived (due to the above), and there is no mention of it being a 4 star hotel anywhere in the building. I asked at reception, and they did not know who had rated it. The first person I spoke to said it was based on surveys left in the rooms. Hmmm... I asked someone else, and they said that the rating was based on trip advisor reviews, and on their parent company's opinion. So, there is nothing from VisitEngland or the AA or any other independent reviewer. Based on this, I think this hotel is being a unfair; they are not officially rated as a 4 star hotel, and it is obvious that they are not a 4 star hotel when you get there and check in, but you will probably not know this until you have booked and paid. I will follow up with lastminute.com to stay that selling this hotel as a 4 star mystery is not fair to the unsuspecting buyer. At over \u00a3400 a night for rack rate, I think this is too much, hence the poor review score. Pls note there are no fitness/swimming facilities in the hotel.

On both occassions I feel that the hotel let itself down. Firstly let me start off with the bad things: - The price is terrible for what you get. I happy to have expensive hotel, but I expect some quality. at \u00a3210 per night, you don't want a hotel which will give you a bad experience - this hotel fails. - Reception staff rude, and potentially arrogant at times. I stay in hotels pretty much 5 days a week, every week so the occassion bad experience is expected, but two stays in a row of this at the same hotel is unnacceptable. - Priority Club Members: If you a platinum member expecting an upgrade, then don't... on both my stay the said the would not be upgrading me - the a colleague of mine checks in after me with a different receptionist and gets the upgrade... where is the logic? However, if and probably when you don't get your upgrade, the receptionist does offer to send the executive basket to your standard room - a bit of consolation? Well don't get too excited, as the \"excutive basket\" is basically a Kit-Kat Chunky and a bottle of Water (which you only recieve for your first night.) - Rooms: I find the rooms very small and cramped - even the executive rooms (I had a look in my colleague's room), and on my first stay her, the maids didn't even bother to clean the room, meaning I had to re-use my wet towels, my bin was full of rubbish, an ofcourse the unmade bed sheets - not what you expect for \u00a3210 per night! - Noise: It is worth mentioning that a lot of noise seems to get into the rooms, which can affect your sleep if you are a light-sleeper - this may be because it is an extremely busy hotel, but they should try to make the rooms a but more sound-proof. This noise can come from the bar outside, the hallways or even the rooms next to or above you. Ok so now the good points: - Breakfast: I really liked the breakfasts here, the food was very good, and the staff at breakfast were very professional. Breakfast is an extra \u00a311.50, which is pricey, but it is good food to be fair. - Location: Excellently located in central London, so everything you need is walking distance - Reception/ Lobby: Very well presented, bright and clean looking. Overall, I think the negatives out-weight the positives. I don't think this hotel is value for money - this comes from a business traveller where I don't even pay for it (my company picks up the bill) and I still don't like it.

Our son was the first to use it and he was in there for ages, when he eventually came out, he said it took so long because the water wasn't coming out properly. That night I took a shower and there was hardly no water at all and yes it took me ages too. The following morning I complained to the management who said that they would get the maintenance up to fix it. When we came back that afternoon we checked the shower and it was just the same. The worse thing for me was not being able to wash my hair, unfortunately my hair is very thick and shoulder length and I will be very honest, if I had put shampoo on my hair it would have taken ages standing under the trickle of water trying to get it out. That night we were going out to dinner and a show, so I had to go and buy dry shampoo to get me by. We complained three times regarding the shower, which never did improve after it was seen to by maintenance.

The approach makes you feel as if you are visiting a factory. Room was very small, bathroom the same, but all places in London are stuck for space. Breakfast good, staff very professional, but barely a native amongst them. Mind you, London these days seems organised solely for young people from member states of the EU to do some overseas work experience and perfect their english, so this is not so unusual. The system for the lifts has, I think, become commonplace in Holiday Inns, where the thing won't move without you inserting your room card (=very irritating if you have your bags and stuff). There is a tired looking barbecue area out the front that seemed occupied by even more tired looking boozers whenever I walked past it.

A 'Business' room, she called it. But it wasn't available, despite the 'Priority Check-in\u2122 ensuring your room and key are ready upon your arrival' promise for PC members.

Hell, even Harry's cupboard was bigger. The bed has about 18\" of space around it. If you sit at the desk - which is mostly taken up by an old TV - you can't get round the bed. The room furniture was scruffy, with dents and scrapes on the walls and bits falling off the bedsides. Remember - this is a 'nice' - a *business* - room. I feel sorry for anyone in a standard room.

The hotel is described as being in Kingscross, but is a 10 minute walk or bus ride in to the centre of Kingscross, where you can either pick up the bus or tube in to the centre of London. There is a bus stop 200 yards from the hotel, which will take you down in to Kingscross. Taking the bus is much cheaper, if you get a day card, you will be able to travel all day on any bus, one tip, if you do take the bus you will be able to see a lot of the main sights on the way in to the centre of London. The hotel we thought was lovely, our room was very clean, and very well decorated, the bed was very comfortable, and the room had all the usual amenities. Breakfast was very plentiful, with a wide choice to suit everybody, we found the staff to be very friendly, and helpful. The car park is not very big if you\u2019re taking your car, and was very full the entire time we were there. Our only criticism was the walk in price of the hotel, we found the hotel very good value for money, for what we paid, being on an organised trip, but I don't think the hotel is worth the walk in price being advertised, I know hotels in London are pricey but this hotel is on the outskirts, catching the tube was not cheap, but the buses are far more reasonable once you get the hang of them. The hotel provides meals in the evening at an extra price, the food offered is Indian, and looked lovely, although we never tried it, but if you don\u2019t like Indian food, there is not much choice for an evening meal in the area.

My room was clean enough, and not too small compared to other central London hotels I've stayed in. The bathroom was a bit pokey, but well equiped with a shower with great water pressure. One bad point about the bathroom was this oddly positioned vent that was just above the toilet and near the shower - surely this should be higher up the wall???

Service: Breakfast was delivered about 15mins early, but not a problem. However, a cleaner was very keen to get into my room twice whilst I was eating my breakfast. The first time (just after 8am) she used her master key to just walk into my room. After a mumbled apology, I encountered a knock at the door again about 20mins later........ it was the same cleaner desperate to get into my room.

They are usually pretty consisitent in what you get, which is, in the main, why people use them. In this particular case we chose the holiday inn because our friend Tracy, managed to get some amazing rates for the weekend. We live in Nottingham, Tim and Tracy live in Reading, so we left the car in Reading and got the train into town. Now the train wasn't cheap, and Tracy doesnt do buses, so we got a taxi to the hotel from the station, all in all at a cost of about \u00a330 per couple, plus the aggravation of carting cases around etc. On arrival at the hotel I noticed there was an underground NCP carpark right next door, that did a weekend rate of \u00a315. So, if we were going to do it again, I'd drive right in (no congestion charge at the weekend either), and it would have been cheaper and more convenient. So, the hotel was typical holiday inn standard, ie higher middle business class. Some us older types remember when a lot of these Holiday Inns were Trusthouse Forte, who charged half as much, but Holiday Inn bought them, painted them a different colour, and doubled the price. Anyway, the first thing I noticed was the amazing array of exotic accents amongst the staff there. I don't think I heard a single \"cockney\" accent anywhere in the hotel - not making any kind of political comment here, its just an observation - but the upside of it is that you kind of feel like you've travelled abroad, which all adds to the excitement. Breakfast was nice, but busy. A little bit of queuing but we werent in a hurry. Food was nice, we obviously went for the full fatboy, and the girls ordered poached eggs which were cooked to order. OK so I can't say too much about what the hotel is like during the day because we headed off into town to be tourists. What I would say is that you've got Russell Square on your doorstep and the British museum, which is just a totally fab place, soho and theatre land just down the way, and of course you are minutes from central london by tube. We had a cracking time wandering around London. If you are a Brit and you haven't been for a few years, go check it out one weekend, it really is a superb city to visit now. I always poo-poo-ed it in favour of Paris or Rome but I am willing to admit I was overlooking a jewell on my own doorstep. Both evenings we didn't eat in the hotel, we went out, and had a great time. On Saturday night we returned to the vicinity after our meal, and rather than drink in the hotel bar (which like many hotel bars, despite what they try, does lack ambience) we headed for a local pub. It was about 10.45 I guess, and it took a while to get sorted out, and the guy behind the bar talked me into buying a bottle of red for the girls instead of two glasses because it was better value, then on the dot of 11, he rang the bell for drinking up time! Once again, I think back to all the hoo-har about 24 hour drinking in the UK, why is it whenever I go to a pub (with the exception of my own local), we are still back in the 70's calling time at 11 on a saturday night. There was no negotiation, so we headed back to the hotel bar for a nightcap, unfinished bottle in hand! Even in the hotel, after midnight, it was night porter service, which always makes me feel like a bit of desperate alky! Hey ho. Anyway, long and short is that if you want to do the touristy thing in london at the weekend, shop around to see whether you can get a discount voucher for this hotel, check first about the carpark, but unless its changed, I'd drive my car here (its dead easy to find) and park in the NCP, and if want to have a late nightcap with your mates, buy a bottle of wine and a 4 pack of stella in Sainsburys before you leave home, pack them in your suitcase, and have your nightcap with your friends in your room (whilst being considerate about noise of course!).

The room was a modest size, and in London nothing's exactly cheap, but we enjoyed the easy going atmosphere and pleasant public areas. Another plus point was that there is a car park directly under the hotel. It cost me \u00a320.00 for 24 hours, but believe me it was worth it for the peace of mind obtained through parking in a secure area that was manned 24/7. The restaurant offered a good range of food, very much to my taste. I prefer simple dishes well cooked to the irritatingly small and fussy portions of 'cheffy nonsense' that some hotels seem to think will impress. Service was superb!

We didn't realise at the time just what a gem it was. Including travel by coach from Yorkshire, and a two night stay with breakfast, the cost was \u00a3258.00 - not the cheapest of weekends, but well worth the money to re-aquaint ourselves with London, its hotels, and hotel locations. Especially this Holiday Inn. This was, apart from the more expensive 4 and 5 star hotels, the one that if given the chance, we'd opt for every time - if the price and allocated bedroom was right. To get it out of the way, the downsides were: 1 - A bedroom that overlooked nothing but other hotel rooms, and what I presume were the outlets for the air-conditioning workings and machinations. So no view, but none was needed. We were in London after all. 2 - The need for guests to be more vigilant with their personal possessions. One lady, (from a different coach tour), was unfortunate to have her handbag taken. Please take note that wherever you stay in London, you need to look after your valuables, and this was not the fault of the hotel, who looked to be trying as best as they could to alleviate the lady's distress. And that's it, apart from some very minor things like having a (very large) fridge, but nothing in it? But that proved to be a bonus- as we stored milk and our own drinks in it - and no explanation of how the swipe cards worked the lifts - so very minor negatives. This is a hotel with a quick change about, so it's not 'cosy' but it's not inhospitable either. The receptionists and booking in staff were excellent, considering it was a very busy weekend. The positives were: 1 - An ideal location in a relatively quiet square. 2 - An ideal location in a relatively quiet square that (apart from the room allocation perhaps) did not make coach visitors feel like second-class citizens, which is how we'd viewed these tour hotels in the past.. 3 - A hearty breakfast that we'd gladly have paid more for. If you need freshly cooked eggs for example, it' was only a short wait. The serving staff were efficient, fast, and a credit to the hotel. Whoever you were - thank you. Your hospitality was much appreciated. 4 - The proximity to the tube station and all the London attractions. 5 - Despite the missing handbag, the feeling that we were in a safe area. It was a hotel that I'd choose if I was staying alone. 6 - Clean rooms, clean bed linen, and clean towels, and ample toiletries provided for a weekend. The same for the hospitality tray but if you like an extra coffee sachet without disturbing the staff, take a small amount in a quick-lock container :-) I could go on and on, but this is a lovely Holiday Inn, albeit a very busy one with airline staff booking in at all times of the day and night - another positive in my humble opinion - coach parties too - but in an area where you can easily walk to a take-away, a shopping centre, a chemist, and there's an Irish bar attached, and the pub opposite was lively but friendly and well policed. At no point did I feel afraid when I wandered away from the hotel. Tips: If you do as we did and buy tickets for the Original Bus Tours, there's a stop that's very near to the hotel and cuts out the need to travel on the tubes (but make a note of the running times and stops. I think the one that took us back to near the hotel was between 5 and 6 PM, but very handy for us nevertheless. We had to be back out an hour later. ) If you need to travel further afield, then do buy an Oyster card. I can't rate those highly enough, but this hotel is so central, that you'd need to add very little money to them. If you're on a budget, buy any necessities at the local Tesco - including snacks, bottled water etc, which is were the empty fridge came in handy. The same fr toiletries: the Boots pharmacist is just across the road. If you're booking this hotel, I think I can safely say (from our short visit) that the housekeeping staff are a credit, as are the waiting staff at breakfast time. It's being added to my favourite hotels in London folder :-) Would we go again? Too right we would! :) Thank you to all that helped to make our stay such a pleasant one.

This hotel is in a wonderful location. It is \u00bd block from Russell Square tube station, and close to the British Museum. Unlike many of the hotels in Bloomsbury, it\u2019s not on a busy street, but on a small quiet street. We were so tired that we decided to eat dinner in our room. Across the street from the hotel is a Waitrose market. We got salad from the salad bar, fruit, nuts, tea and bottled water. Dinner revived me and we took a short walk around the neighborhood passing Russell Square and the British Museum. May 5 \u2013 It was a short walk to the Euston train station to get 7 day Travelcards with the railway logo on them. We wanted to take the Hop On Off Bus and stay on for the entire time. They recommended going on their free walking tour to see the Guards. So we did. We had a hysterically funny guide. He told us he was taking us to a place where we\u2019d get an unobstructed view of the Guards, instead of standing with the huge crowd at Buckingham Palace. We went to St James Palace; and it was amazing to have unobstructed views. They played When The Saints Go Marching In while in formation, before they left the palace. I got such good pictures. Then we walked along the road where the Guards were marching towards Buckingham Palace. We went to St. Martins in The Field for lunch at their Caf\u00e9 in the Crypt. The tuna sandwiches were good. I did a brass rubbing there and enjoyed doing it. Then we got back on the bus, went to Tower Hill and took their free cruise back to Westminster. It was cold and windy on top of the bus and on the cruise; but I got some good pictures. We were still jet lagged and went back to the hotel. We stopped at Waitrose for salad. They have a bakery there with really good baklava. May 6 \u2013 My husband is a soccer (football) fan and we had booked a tour of Wembley Stadium. It lasts 90 minutes and if you are a soccer fan, we highly recommend it. On our way there, we got to St Pancras Station early. If you or someone in your family is a Harry Potter fan, you\u2019ll want to take a picture of platform 9 \u00be. It\u2019s in the old train station, King\u2019s Cross, which is across the street from St Pancras. When they tell you where to go, you\u2019ll pass right by it. It\u2019s actually in an alcove that\u2019s by 2 sets of bike racks. After the tour, we took the tube to Marble Arch and had lunch at Ranousch Juice. It was good. We then walked along Oxford Street. We popped into Selfridge. It\u2019s a department store that covers an entire city block. We went to Gray\u2019s Antiques and Gray\u2019s Antique Mall \u2013 disappointed. As an avid photographer, I had to see the Photographer\u2019s Gallery \u2013 another disappointment. These were the only 2 disappointments on the trip. On the way to dinner at Tas Restaurant, we went into the British Museum for a short time. Dinner was good. We looked forward to spending more time at the museum. May 7 \u2013 We got to the Tower of London when it opened at 9AM and stayed until 1:30. We used our 2 for 1 coupon. We saw the Crown Jewels and then went on the Warder tour. You have to do this tour. They have a Henry the VIII exhibit that is just wonderful. It was cold and with our snack, all we wanted was a hot drink. Visiting the Tower is a must do. Lunch was at Wagamama\u2019s right near the Tower. Our plan was to next go to the Tower Bridge Exhibiton. As we walked toward the bridge, we saw that the entrance was midway along the bridge. It was cold and windy and we just didn\u2019t want to go into a windier place. So, it was off to Covent Gardens. They had a street performer that did a Charlie Chaplin show with magic. That was fun. That was it for the day. We decided to eat in again. We got salads at Waitrose, cooked chicken, a baguette and dessert. It was so good. May 8 \u2013 It was raining when we left the hotel for the British Library. I was in awe of the Treasures Room. Imagine, the Magna Carta, Gutenberg Bible, Da Vinci notebooks, letters from literary giants like Jane Austen and even handwritten songs from the Beatles are all in one room! It had stooped raining when we left the library. What do you do all day with wet umbrellas? Glad Bags has 2 \u00bd gallon zip lock bags. Both our umbrellas fit in one. We popped it into the day pack. It was time for the British Museum. This is another must do. It\u2019s quite a collection. We walked back to the hotel for a long break \u2013 got to watch the British version of The Biggest Loser. We also read. Then we went to Rock and Sole in Covent Garden for our first British Fish and Chips. They have a dining room downstairs that\u2019s painted in an ocean motif. It was good. As big Agatha Christie fans, we just had to see The Mousetrap. It has been playing for 57 years. Can you imagine that? It was absolutely delightful. May 9 \u2013 It was Saturday morning and we took the tube to Hyde Park Corner for a walk in the park. It\u2019s a wonderful park. We saw people doing a sport we\u2019d never seen before and asked one of them about it. It\u2019s called roller ski. It\u2019s for cross county ski training. We walked along the Serpentine. It was such an enjoyable walk. Then it was time for the Victoria and Albert Museum. We took an introductory tour that I highly recommend. We had lunch in their caf\u00e9. I just loved this museum. The cast room is really impressive. We had planned on going to the science museum afterwards; but we couldn\u2019t do another museum the same day. We walked to Harrod\u2019s and it was packed. We didn\u2019t spend much time there. We went back to the hotel for another really long break. Dinner was at Masala Zone in Covent Gardens. We loved the food. Then we went to a candlelight concert at St Martins in the Field. It included music from Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi. The acoustics were really good; and the sounds were so rich that they enveloped you. It was a very special event. May 10 \u2013 For the first time on our trip, the sky was blue and we wore our sunglasses. We had breakfast at Pret a Manger. I\u2019m a tea drinker. My husband says their coffee is better than Starbucks. We recommend their chocolate croissants and their sandwiches. We went with London Walks to Greenwich. It was such a lovely day. Between what we saw on the tour and on our own, we went to the Painted Hall, the Queen\u2019s House, Maritime Museum, Greenwich Market and the Observatory. Lunch was at Pizza Express. The views from the observatory are spectacular. Taking your picture on Prime Meridian is another must do. We took some good pictures. It was a really good choice for the day. The DLR wasn\u2019t running, so we took the Thames Clipper express back to Westminster Pier. We used our 2 for 1 coupon. There was a TALF pub meet in South Kensington at Queens Arms. It was fun to actually meet some of the people who post regularly on this site. We had fish and chips there. My 11 \u2013 Our last full day in London. We had breakfast at Pret a Manger and then it was off to Westminster Abbey. We took the Verger Tour. It\u2019s a magnificent building. I was especially anxious to see the Coronation Chair, Poet\u2019s Corner and Darwin\u2019s grave. This was the day when there were people at a Sri Lanka rally. The amount of police and police vehicles was impressive. They take security a lot more seriously than we do in the U.S. There are CCTVs all over the city. You see a lot of police officers doing foot patrols. We had lunch at Pret a Manger. Then it was time for Churchill Museum and War Cabinet Rooms. This is very well put together; and we enjoyed it. Off to the London Eye. It was fun. Then we started to walk along the Thames, but it was so windy, we decided to go to the National Gallery. Since we were close to Covent Gardens, we walked there for dinner. We weren\u2019t sure where we would have dinner. We walked down Floral Street and there was Masala Zone; and we had our farewell dinner there. May 12 \u2013 fly home Someone asked me about the weather. It was about 50 degrees when we left in the morning and got to about 62-63 during the day. It was good.

Having used the program quite a few times mainly for the London area means that I have been allocated the same hotels on several occasions but it sometimes gives the opportunity to try something new. Each novelty brings some element of apprehension, especially if the booking is for several nights. Holiday Inn, Bloomsbury was quite unfamiliar to me \u2013 and I reckon to know London pretty well. It is a little off the beaten track only in the sense of being in a small, not unpleasant, square nestled close by a relatively recent block of apartments (Brunswick Estate). In fact it is also a mere three or four minute walk from Russell Square Tube (London Underground rail) station which is on the Piccadilly Line and therefore a direct, no-change route from Heathrow Airport. An important thing to note if travelling by tube with luggage is that to get from the platform to fresh-air involves climbing about 20 steps from the platform, then waiting for a lift (elevator) which is generally very congested. What kind of mentality calls for the elevator to be a floor above the platform? OK It was all built a hundred years ago I suppose. Additional useful note \u2013 Russell Square serves quite a few hotels and there is often congestion at the ticket machine especially by young travelers who haven't got London Underground's most useful item \u2013 An Oyster Card. Go to Transport for London's website for full details of this essential item. Buy one at any tube station but get one if you are to be in London for more than a day or two. The hotel incorporates a pub (Callaghan's) which also does food but I didn't have the chance to use it this trip as they stop serving at 9pm or two hours before the pub closes. There is a small pedestrian zone within the nearby Brunswick flats development which incorporates a supermarket, Starbucks, several restaurants and on my visit today an enterprising genuine German-sausage stand \u2013 Mmmm delicious! Similarly in adjacent streets there are Chinese and Indian restaurants and several other places next to the tube station. Plenty choice for folks who do not wish to eat in the hotel. First positive thing to say is that Holiday Inn has excellent, attentive and pleasant staff. The Italian lady who checked me in did a great job as did her male colleague who was patiently answering a barrage of questions from a wheelchair bound lady about rooms for the disabled. Rooms. I was allocated a room on the 5th floor at check-in and it was small. Small to the degree of having to make my way round the bed to get to the TV and lamp-standard. In fairness again to Holiday Inn my complaint that the room was too small for a 4 night stay and not consistent with a 4 star rating was dealt with instantly and pleasantly by an offer to move me. Due to other commitments that first evening I delayed a move till the following day and then took over a 6th floor business room which was much more reasonably sized. I'm not going to comment much further on the first room other than to say it just does not meet 4* standards. As in the 6th floor room the refrigerator bears a printed sign saying that a\u201d replacement system is being investigated and it is unsuitable for storing food or drinks\u201d! Wait a minute! Even small motels in the USA usually have working refrigerators What kind of system are they investigating? Go out and order a bunch of small refrigerators folks! In this day and age it is unreasonable not to provide one in a 4 star establishment. I suspect the \u201csystem\u201d being investigated is an unwanted mini-bar, another method of extracting every last penny from the client. It's 2009 and few clients are going to be allowed to schmooz mini-bar charges on expenses. The room lacks those 4 star touches. The chairs in my room were worn out and uncomfortable - management please look at Marriott 4 Star hotels in London for some ideas. It's a shame the hotel is let down by those items and it does bring the star rating into question. The hotel is clean, well furnished and pleasant.

The room, while small, was comfortable and lacked for nothing. Towels, pillows, and shower were all excellent. As I was attending the theatre, the location could not be beat and staff were most helpful in providing directions to the theatre and the location of the nearest Tube station to the theatre. The cost of wifi (internet access) seemed expensive in comparison to other places where I have stayed but not knowing what other London hotels charge, I can't provide a comparison. However, when I returned from the theatre and enquired at the front desk if there was a computer where I could do on-line check-in, Gary immediately said that it could be done there and with a few key-clicks had me on the airline site and we even managed to move me to a seat which was more to my liking. Gary then printed off the boarding pass, put it in an envelope and asked if I required assistance the next morning with bags and if I needed a care to the airport. Staff in the bar were friendly and knowledgable about the wines they were serving. Prices were reasonable and I enjoyed a glass of white wine while watching the late night news on the flat screen television.

The hotel foyer is minimalist, modern and very clean with efficient staff. We booked an executive room on the top floor, floor six which had a number of \"suites\" located on it. The room was a reasonable size, dressing table with a tv on it, a lounge chair and double bed (not two singles as you get in many European hotels). The room view was the back of the hotel so there was absolutely nothing to see, which was not a problem for me. The bathroom was clean and modern with toiletries provided and there was plenty of clothes storage space with a wardrobe with a trouser press. However, the facilities provided in an executive room were not quite as good as those I have received in standard rooms in similar chain hotels in London for an equivalent price. For example, the shower looked fantastic but turned out to be fed via the bath taps and the pressure was extremely low, some of the lights in the room didn't work and the walls are thin so we could hear the couple next door's conversation in the morning. There was also only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers and although there was a mini bar, it was empty and not in use which seemed odd for an executive room, either use it or lose it. There were tea and coffee making facilities. One problem during the stay was that some guests on our floor were \"socialising\" until the early hours of Sunday morning waking us at 3am with people moving between rooms, shouting, giggling and chatting in the corridor as if it was the middle of the day and allowing the doors to slam repeatedly. I was surprised as this hotel did not give the impression as being a type of hotel which would attract clubbers. The Sunday night was much better and the hotel much more sedate as the weekend corridor socialisers had probably checked out. I didn't use the pub attached (it looked a bit artificial - for those seeking a genuine London pub there are lots on the same street as the hotel). I didn't eat in the hotel. The stay was ok but a few minor tweaks in the rooms would deliver a true executive experience.

We were in London and needed to find a place for that night so we booked a deal through lastminute.com where you don't actually know the name of the hotel and so get a cheaper price. It's a three star hotel and the deal said it would be a four star hotel but other than that we were happy with the price we paid for our stay. The closest tube station to the hotel is Russell Square which is always closed so you often have to walk a fair distance to the next nearest tube which is really irritating. That aside, the location is actually really good, you're right next to a large shopping mall with Waitrose Bloomsbury and other places to get tea and supplies. The internet and breakfasts are ludicrous prices, and after complaining and getting a room service breakfast for free (nice of them I admit) we wouldn't recommend the breakfasts anyway - revolting! Almost inedible. The only major issue we had (which was what we complained about) was that each and every day we had our 'do not disturb' sign up as we had many valuables in our room (including two laptop computers which didn't fit in the supplied safe) and were repacking our luggage for the flight home after months abroad and had stuff EVERYWHERE, so we really didn't want anybody in our room. Every single day the sign was ignored and our room was made up and the windows opened (something we hate anyway), we even left a note which was ignored and rang reception. By the third or fourth day we were really frustrated, and when it continued until the day we left, we cracked it (hence the free breakfast on our final morning). The reception staff are also really unhelpful (a whole other story). However our room was quite nice and large with plenty of space for our two very large suitcases and four hand luggage bags, we'd come from a much smaller room so the space was nice. Over all I wouldn't stay here again due to the invasive policy of ignoring 'do not disturb' signs (not sure why they're provided at all, they said it was only there so reception don't ring - but it's a door sign!), however if that doesn't worry you, I think it'd be a decent stay. Don't expect too much from reception and house keeping though, they seem to go out of their way to be unhelpful.

I spent a long time explaining to the young man in reservations my requirements and the neccessity of having a room with toilet access on the right hand side of the toilet, when facing it from the entrance. I was assured that all was understood and confimed. Upon arriving at the hotel at 530 p.m. on Saturday 30 August, none of the hotel staff helped my and husband and me with our luggage. My husband had to help me with my wheelchair as well as running back and forth to our motor car in order to bring our luggage into the hotel. The young woman at the reception desk handed my husband the cards to the door. I had to go up in the lift alone. My husband was made to follow with the luggage in another lift. The concierge did not raise a finger to help us. Upon entering the room, we found it to be the incorrect room (due to the toilet being on the wrong side, with a left-hand space and the right hand being too close to the wall). In addition, the toilet seat was broken and unusable. Upon telephoning the reception desk, the young woman (whose English was minimal!) told us that there was nothing that she could do. We then went downstairs to the reception desk (with our luggage) and asked for the manager. He could not help us. In addition, we were to go to the Shafstsbury theatre and asked the concierge or the young woman to hail us a taxi, as we did not want to drive to the theatre due to traffic and parking issues. Both the young woman and the concierge did not want to find us a taxi and gave us faulty explanations. I virtually had to force the concierge to hail a taxi, which he reluctantly did after much persuasion from me. Suddenly the manager found us an alternative 'accessible' room; an exectuive suite. We were in a hurry to get to the theatre by now. Our luggage had to be left in the foyer and the concierge did eventually take it to the executive suite, which we promised to look at after the theatre. Upon returning to the hotel there was different staff and a very decent and helpful manager called Henry. He accompanied us to the executive suite which proved, once again, to be INACCESSIBLe (I could not use the bath and the toilet was much too low for my use, as well as being faulty once again). We told Henry that it would be best for us to return to our home in Bedfordshire. As it was so late Henry was reluctant to let us travel home without eating something first (we had not eaten since breakfast!) He telephoned room service and was told that there was very little to choose from. We ordered a tuna sandwich, a cheese sandwich and some coffee. This took almost an hour to arrive! After this ridiculous sojourn, my husband and I journeyed home. Henry was most helpful and the concierge also helped us with our luggage. It is a sad state of affairs when a hotel such as the Holiday Inn, Bloomsbury, cannot provide what it advertises and that the afternoon staff was so lazy and belligerent.

The room was quite small but i didnt mind. It was clean, mini bar didnt work, just as well really, trouser press, desk, tv with some channels. Bathroom small as well , but shower was powerful if a little \"tired\" . We didnt stay much in the hotel and like many have said the location is brilliant. The irish bar was closed on the Monday evening so i cant comment on that. At the back of the hotel is Russell Square Tube Station. If you don't like lifts then be aware as its 159 steps down to the tube and back up as i found out. Covent Garden has 195 steps, no escalators but lifts!! Great after just doing 10k and being obese!! Covent Garden was only 2 stops on the tube, leicester square and piccadilly gardens 3 or 4 stops. The brunswick centre across the road to the right has plenty off shops, namely, boots, superdrug, nando's, waitrose, New Look and a Renoir Cinema and a starbucks and a carluccios cafe. There is an oriental restaurant opposite the cinema that we tried to get in on a monday night at 7.30pm. It was packed with 10 people waiting to get in! Must have been good. We ended up going to the gourmet burger company within the centre. A massive burger for about \u00a37. Hit the spot!

Don`t touch the mini bar as they have sensors on them and if you pick up one of the bottles in the mini bar it sends a signal to reception.

Breakfast: Was excellent... help yourself, as much as you can eat English or continental, or as i did a mixture of both. The hotel has it`s own Irish bar on site showing Sky Sports and serving food also. The Irish bar was quite reasonably priced where as the hotel bar was expensive. (ie. Double Bacardi and Coke, Pint of Caffereys and 2 packets of crisps \u00a315.20). I always feel that the best way to advise others on whether or not to come here is to ask yourself.... Would i come here again.? The answer would be yes. It`s idealy located by Russell Square where we had a coffee while chilling in the sun. The underground station of Russell Square is very close too. There is an entrance walkway just to the left of the hotel and to our surprise we found it to be a very modern but small shopping complex. The complex mainly comprises of restaurants. There is a pub opposite the hotel and next door to that a mini-mart which we thought was great for getting the Sunday Paper etc. We did get a black-cab taxi from Trafalger Square back to the hotel as walking had now taken it`s tole.

There was a large 'empty' space in the middle of the room which is obviously there for when the sofa bed is laid out but makes the room feel quite empty, could really have done with a proper space to open a suitcase as the only option was the floor! This was annoyining as there was so much space they could easily have fitted in some appropriate furniture to accomodate a case - or even one of the folding case rests. The acres of space also made the incredibly tiny TV difficult to see from the beds and meant that you needed the volume quite high - I really would have expected a flat screen TV rather than the old fashioned 18\" in situ, seems very outdated in an 'executive room'. Bathroom was good size, well stocked with toiletries and towels and clean. Some marks on the grout and around the shower head but just age rather than dirt. Shower quite difficult to control and very forceful - have a bath if you want to relax! Mini bar, robe, slippers etc as was exec room but nothing special. Quite disappointed with the stocking of tea and coffee as never enough milk or water and we had to ask for extra glasses as only one tumbler and one wine glass???

There was no more than 2 foot of space at the bottom of the bed to the wall and the decor was very tired. The minibar was out of service although this was not a problem. The bathroom again was clean, which is the main thing, but very tired and tiny. On the plus side, the bed was extremely comfortable, there were plenty of tv channels to choose from and there was a good selection of tea/coffee/hot choc in the room. The curtains were also nice and thick so we weren't woken up early by any light pouring through but the hustle and bustle of London was still audible through the windows. The restaurant was completely at the other end of the spectrum and was modern and looked as though it had been recently refurbished. Breakfast is served for a good few hours (7-11) and there is an amazing choice of bread/pastry, fruit, cooked breakfast etc and as it is buffet style you can choose what and how much you like. I noticed it said \u00a314.95 on a board outside so I would recommend getting a deal which includes the breakfast as that price seems a bit steep per person. Free Sunday papers were available in the reception area as well. Overall, I would say the hotel is well located but I have stayed in better for the same price nearby and I probably wouldn't return to this one.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey", "Title": "\u201cOverpaid and under refunded\u201d", "Author": "Lopsi_7", "ReviewID": "UR10287039", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel while I was overnighting in London in September.

We had no views from our window and instead looked out onto a concrete courtyard facing other rooms. But on the plus side, it was clean and had all the basics you need like a hairdryer, television, etc. They also offer basics toothpaste, ear buds, etc. for free if you've forgotten something. While the rooms could do with a bit of an update, the general lobby area is nice looking, bright and modern. My only real complaint would be that we stayed in a room next to the cleaner's room. In the mornings at 8am, the cleaners would come and begin slamming their door and talking loudly. It wasn't a problem every morning of our stay, but one morning I counted that the door must have slammed 15 times in one minute.

It's handy for tube access, there's a tesco nearby, a Starbucks less than 5 minutes away and other shops & cafes.

A word of warning-shut your windows before you go to bed- the area seems to be quite noisy at night, primarily police/ ambulance sirens The standard of the food here is very poor. On my first stay I had dinner in the soulless hotel restaurant which charges restaurant prices for cafe standard food. I had steak with all the trimmings and I feel that most of it had recently seen the inside of a freezer and the steak was very poor.

The hotel is not located in the newer more \"trendy\" parts of London. There's NOTHING going on around this hotel, we paid over $350 a night to stay there in December. My favorite hotel, The Howard, Swiss Hotel was a bit more pricey at $460 a night - I wish I'd spent the extra money as we probably spent around 250 pounds ($460) in cabs in addition to our hotel stay as everywhere we wanted to go was quite a ways off. Granted, we don't know the city all that well, and we should have done better research, but we are tourists but we've never had this problem when we've stayed elsewhere in London. The attitude of the check in clerk upon our arrival was absolutely terrible. We'd been in transit from the west coast of the USA for 20 hours, and her immediate comment when she brought up our information and noticed there were three people going to be staying in our room was: \"Ok, you owe us an extra 50 pounds for the extra member of your group\".

The room was large and always full of people, but the hotel managed to keep the food coming. Each morning our rooms were serviced and cleaned. We stayed on level 4 of 6 and in a twin room. The hotel is one street away from russell square tube and is easily accessed via the hop-on-hop-off bus companies. I strongly recommend these buses if your a tourist as they let you see the sites in a guided tour. The hotel has an irish pub downstairs and it serves a small variety of food throughout the day, the restaurant has a selection of healthy meals for dinner and of course there is room service! We had plenty of room for our bags and could hang our jackets in the cupboard. There is a laundry service, hair dryer and all the usuall amenities you would find in a hotel. I would not advise anyone to catch a cab from the airport (heathrow) to the hotel as it set us back 70pound! We caught the Hotel Link Bus. Very cheap and helpful.

The location can't be beat, the rooms although small (this is London, not Detroit) are furnished well, the beds are comfortable, the bathroom spotless, and the a/c works fine. I have never had a problem at check-in or with the bill. The staff from desk clerks to housekeepers have always been pleasant and helpful. I am amazed by some of the poor reviews.

The rooms also have coffee and tea makers. No room delivery of the newspaper? Instead of harassing a poor housekeeper (no wonder your room wasn't serviced properly), get off your butt and go down to the lobby where three different London dailies are available for free. Finally, there seem to be a number of bad reviews of the hotel that stem from problems with the hotel restaurant (food,service, or both). You stay at a Holiday Inn to sleep and perhaps take a late afternoon nap. The fact that anyone would go to London and eat dinner at a Holiday Inn boggles the mind. Are people really that lazy that they would go to London and not research places to go out for a good, reasonably priced meal in lieu of a meal at a Holiday Inn. If you don't want to spend a fortune and have a good meal for a lot cheaper than the hotel restaurant, go to an Indian restaurant, or Pizza Express (NOT Pizza Hut), or Ask Italian restaurant, or Mr. Kong's in China Town, or get dim sum at the Royal China on Queensway.

As for Callaghan's, I've been to more genuine \"Irish\" pubs in Sydney! However, the beer is good, and the bar food is OK too. There are quite a few eating and drinking options nearby, so explore beyond the hotel. My room was on the 1st floor, and I found it quiet and comfortable. The rooms have wooden panel doors which you can close so you don't get the morning light and it also reduces street noise. My only complaint would be that I ordered a taxi for a Monday morning at 0400 - to get to Victoria Station to get the Gatwick Express for a short visit to Poland. My taxi arrived late, and the night staff didn't seem too bothered about it - even though I'd ordered it the night before, and I ended up missing the 0430 Gatwick Express and had to wait until 0500 for the next train.

It was basically about 15 minutes or so on the tube for locations on other parts of the tube, but the trains came quickly, so the ride could be less time on them. As far as the hotel itself: The people at the reception desk was very helpful with the exception to one or two of them that did not know what they were doing. If I needed anything I would go to the lady Joann who helped me or if it was during the night, a man named Henry. Breakfast at this hotel is 15 pounds and I was okay with that for about 2 days. The breakfast was fresh and very tasty. Dinner at Callahans, a pub in the hotel was fantastic with juicy and well cooked hamburgers, great tasting bangers and mash and also their pasta dishes were good. You can even take your drink up to your room or away from the hotel to the outside picnic area with no questions as to what you are doing with the drink away from the bar. Stay away from the NACHOS, they were not good. There is a grocery store nearby (TESCO), if you would prefer to eat great tasting cold sandwiches and the store is 24 hours. The location is across the street from the RUSSELL station and a short walking distance to the hotel. If you are looking for a good housekeeper who changes your linen every single day and fluff your pillows, dust and vacuum, not to mention keep your bathroom stocked with towels and clean each day, make sure you get a floor with Olive (female) as the housekeeper. The other ones were truly lazy and you would have to beg them to change your sheet or hide the current so that they would not have a choice but to put a new one on. One more thing, if you need an ironing board or something from the restaurant the employees are happy to bring it to you and very quickly. The staff is helpful in getting you where you need to be and recommend things to you. After 10:00pm, the elevators shut down so that you have to use your access badge to get it and that made me feel very safe. You will enjoy this hotel. I will be staying there again in March of 2006.
