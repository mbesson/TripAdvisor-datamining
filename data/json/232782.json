To be fair, the Hotel is well located being a 5 minute walk to either La Ramblas and Pl Catalunya where the excellent Aero Bus Service runs to and from the Airport. My family and I arrived at the Hotel approximately 2pm in the afternoon and met at the entrance by one of the male Receptionists who almost tried to send us away as our Rooms would not be ready but then quickly interrupted by another receptionist who seemed more accomodating and allocated a room on the third floor situated at the rear overlooking what I can only describe as a 'quaint' looking appartment block. The room was meant to sleep three with two single beds and one Camp Bed affair folded down from inside a cupboard so that the sleeper's head was in an alcove and not terribly comfortable, did had an LG Flat Screen TV on the wall and AC. We were a bit annoyed to find that the Maids didn't clean the Room till after 4pm each day which was a nuisance if one wished to retire for a Siesta before Dinner. We found noise levels with slamming of doors, noisy plumbing and Guests a little disturbing at times. The Hotel boasts a rooftop Swimming Pool and Sunbathing area. I would describe this as just a small Pool, far too shallow or big enough to swim in but the Sunbathing Terrace was pleasant with a number of Sunbeds, Vending machine and a W.C. The Breakfast Room/Caffeteria was a large a pleasant room on the first floor with a good variety of Hot and Cold etc. On the whole, the staff were pleasant enough except for perhaps our experience of one Receptionist on arrival.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, but surly staff\u201d", "Author": "connieblue16", "ReviewID": "UR127188178", "Content": "Stayed with a group of friends and had a bit of a complicated booking due to me checking in and out at different times but staying with my friends in the same room.

The only areas for improvement are: - insufficient sunbeds beside the pool... but then again, I wouldn't want it to be overcrowded, so perhaps not. (It was just frustrating to arrive at the pool at the end of both days, to find that all the sunbeds - no more than a dozen - were already occupied.) - empty minibar in the room. Would have been nice to at least have had the option of water in there. - Bizarre shower screen which was too big for the bath, so you had to do some interesting manoeuvering to stand in the bath and fold out the screen. Would be impossible for a large person! The shower-massage-jets also seemed like a good idea, but in practice were disappointingly ineffective. - Although the rooms come with a safe, there was no information to advise that you have to ask Reception for a special 'toggle' to insert into the back of the safe door and pay 10euro deposit, plus 2euros (I think) per day. - No tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms.

The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff are friendly and helpful. Bedrooms are a reasonable size, and have a small balcony overlooking a busy main road. However, traffic noise is not a problem when the door is closed. Breakfast is the usual continental fare; fruit, youghhurt, cereals, croissants, cheese and meats, toast, bacon sausage, scrambled egg. Quite adequate to set you up for the day. We arrived at 11am and were given our room immediately, although check-in is not until 2.00.pm. On check-out day, our luggage was stored until we were ready to leave for the airport.

The only small gripes we had for room 601 was that we did ask for a double but they stuck two king singles together instead. However, both single beds were electrically adjustable, like beds you would find in a hospital!!! The mattress as a result was a bit soft for our liking but that was the only issue we had. The rest of the room contained a large LG flatscreen TV and plenty of wardrobe space. There was also a balcony but you couldn't see much as the hotel sign was right in front blocking any views, but this wasn't a problem as we were staying during winter anyway and wouldn't utilise it.

We loved the location of Hotel Lleo --just a couple of easy walking blocks from Las Ramblas (lots of shopping) and Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya (where you can pick up buses for tourist routes). If you really need some American food 'fix' then between the hotel and Cataluyna there is a Burger King, Mcdonalds, Starbucks, Subway and a Hard Rock Cafe. There is also an ATM right next door and a video arcade a few doors down (my 17 year old son would have loved it!) When you walk into the lobby of the hotel it is bright and looks new, so we were a little disappointed to find the rooms a bit tired and in need of updating. We had a room facing the street so it was definitely noisy until very late....I would suggest ear plugs if you want to get to sleep before 2 am (on a weekend night). We were also surprised that our room would not be cleaned until 3ish in the afternoon -- not a real problem, but a bit surprising. There is free internet access in the lounge area behind the elevators. We did not eat at the hotel. We took the Bus Turistic to get an overview of the city and found their ticketing / boarding process a bit disorganized. They had a bus parked in front of the Hard Rock Cafe where we waited in quite a long line only to find out this was simply to buy tickets (22 euro for 2 days). We then had to go down the street to pick up the bus (located in front of El Corte Ingles -- a HUGE department store and groceries too). Here we also waited in a very long line because most people want to sit on the top of the double decker bus so it takes quite some time for the line to move along. WE also found that you could buy tickets from this line as well (so our previous wait in front of Hard Rock cafe was a waste of time). ON our second day we got to El Corte Ingles about 9:15 and found many less people....so I would definitely suggest getting an early start to avoid the longer lines that pick up later in the morning.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "grangemouth", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "GrangemouthBeamer", "ReviewID": "UR8749066", "Content": "Cracking location at top end of Las Ramblas, 2 minutes walk from the square.

The only downside is the noise - not so much the traffic, although our room was at the back, but other guests. The walls must be paper thin. You could just about hear a conversation through the wall without even trying! Take earplugs and problems are solved however. All staff were very helpful and our cleaning lady was always smiling.

The pool on the roof terrace is small but it has jets and seats at the side which is relaxing after a day in the city.You can see alot from the roof terrace. The location of the hotel couldn't be any better. Just off La Ramba and catalonia square. Very safe to walk about at night just avoid the street cleaners at midnight washing down the paths! A gt tapas bar is celler de tapa.ask at reception for a voucher as you can get a free glass of wine. A must to do is the turistic bus - hop on hop off. two day pass is approx 22 euros.gt way to see the city.red and blue routes.We spent a day at the beach on the blue route. this can be caught just around the corner from the hotel. Reception at the hotel are really friendly and helpful. NOTE - all bars close at 11pm on sundays even the hotel bar. We did the barcelona footy stadium (on the red route) very poor but worth a visit - in your ticket price for the bus you get discount vouchers so remember to use them! Another must is the castle reached by cable car(on the blue route) approx 7 euros for cable car. fantastic views from there. we also did the art museum again fab views from outside. The olympic stadium is worth a visit too -free! you can walk to this from the art museum. *** Last point to make is beware of thiefs- one of our party had a bag pinched from beneath our noses in an ice cream palour on the last day so had his passport in -luckily easy jet let him board! take a photocopy of your passport as you never know.After checking out on your last day ask to put passports in hotel safe!!
