{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nightmare! We had a horrendous time here. The rudest manager we'd ever encountered enywhere. I shall find a copy of my letter to the german tourist office whom did indeed pursue a MAJOR investigation. I do not reccommend this place to anybody. The abuse we experienced was unparallelled and it was not just towards us... One moring, whilst at breakfast (over-boiled eggs, etc) we found the manager lady shouting at a guest who'd accidentally spilled coffee on the carpet, .. telling him that he'd have to face a bill for the cleaning... A real nightmare, Believe me. we are educated, polite generous people who don't go out looking for trouble. the abuse we had here was totally uncalled for and, unforgiveable.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR125868111", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "yoyoman"}, {"Content": "Clean and convenient - but a couple of problems My partner and I stayed at this hotel over the May bank holiday weekend (UK). I came across the Hotel Pension Merkur on the internet and contacted the hotel directly through their website. Initially, making a reservation was difficult as the hotel staff do not speak english (communication was an issue throughout our whole stay as none of the hotel staff spoke English and we speak very little German). I ended up asking a german friend of mine to make a booking over the phone for us as I wasnt convinced that my booking was confirmed. As it turns out, when we arrived at the hotel, my booking was confirmed but an unlucky couple who arrived after us found that they did not have a reservation (and the hotel was now fully booked!), despite having emailed and phoned for confirmation. Our room was large and clean although we discovered that we shared a WC with 5 other rooms - we had been told that our room would include shower and WC. Our room was facing onto a busy road and we had a street light right outside our window - making the room rather noisy and unbearably bright all night long. On check-out we were hoping to leave our bags at the hotel until the evening as we didnt fly out until 9pm that night. We were told that we werent able to leave them past 2pm, which was a great inconveience to us. Most hotels we've stayed at are able to accomodate this. But onto more positive points! The nightly tariff included breakfast which was delicious - much better than other european breakfasts i've experienced. Despite a few problems, the hotel staff were friendly. The hotel was located close to a train station and was within easy walk of Alexanderplatz (central train station) and the famous TV tower in the former east Berlin.", "Date": "May 31, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR740258134", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AndieC"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234942-r5921456-Hotel_Pension_Merkur-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "234942", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
