Anyway: Pros: Great location not too far from downtown Champaign (many good independent dining choices and bars) and close to mall and grocery stores. Decorating and finishing done with care (it is a newer property, too). Breakfast in pleasant, open dining area with eggs and sausage the day I was there, both were good. 24 hour business center and convenience store with snacks, drinks, etc. Keycard required after hours to gain any entrance at all. Pool/sauna area pleasant if small. Rooms laid out thoughtfully - sleeping area, desk/lounging area/bathroom, all distinct. Spacious room with nice amenities. Electronic thermostat functions well and HVAC is quiet. Great flatscreens with 50-60 channel choices.

The room was beautifully decorated, very clean, and everything was in working order. I personally liked that there was a digital thermostat in the room - and when the air/heat came on, it was not noticeable. My only negative thing that I would have to say is that the room is slightly cramped. The desk chair always seemed to be in the way (we ended up moving it out from under the desk and up against a wall). The bathroom, while lovely, was also small. I am about 5 foot 8, and when I was changing in the bathroom, my fingers hit the ceiling. I believe the website mentions that there are curved shower rods in the shower. Yes, this is true, but it doesn't seem to add space because the show rods are mounted only 30 inches from the wall - so at the widest point it only seems like a regularly sized shower (hopefully that makes sense). The bathroom counter/sink is taller than your standard counter height, which I really liked. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Included with the price of the stay was breakfast. Nothing fancy (bagel, english muffins, toast, cereals, instant oatmeal, a waffle maker, yogurt, fruit, muffins, assorted juices, coffee, tea and some scrambled eggs) - but I really was happy to have it. We traveled wtih 2 small girls, so it was convenient having food right in the hotel, and it was also very nice that it was \"free\" since our girls can be picky eaters sometimes. They love cereal, but who wants to go to an actual restaurant and pay 3.99 for a bowl of cereal? Not me. The woman in the breakfast area on the weekend was very helpful and friendly.
