Upon arriving at the hotel the amount of vagrants hanging out in front should have been an indicator of how highly rated the hotel was. The gentlemen at the check in counter was very pleasant and allowed me to park my car there so that we could spend the day at Universal Studios and take the train over. The location of the hotel was perfect. Just a short walk to Hollywood/Highland were we were able to catch a train for $1.50 for adults and $.25 cents for seniors. Can't beat that deal. By the time we got back to the hotel we were exhausted and checked in pretty quickly. The guy at the front desk again was very pleasant. The room was nothing to write home about. The TV reception was not great, there were rings in the sink and bathtub and it was a bare bones hotel, but we knew this going in. We just needed a place to rest our heads and get some sleep. This is where it got bad. Turns out that we were placed right between a couple of rooms that decided it would be great to stay up and fight all night. Between the yelling and slamming of doors it was almost impossible to sleep. A call to the front desk was of no help. Obviously the two gentlemen that I had encountered earlier in the day had gone home and been replaced by someone who just didn't seem to care. He gave me an obligatory, \"I'll see what I can do.\" He obviously couldn't do much because for at least another two hours the same cycle went on. This was exactly the same with our second night, only this night we got an added in guitar playing drunk who couldn't carry a tune for the life of him. Calls to the front desk again did no good. I guess it stands to reason we will not be staying here again. Maybe this is for you, but it wasn't my idea of a good night's sleep.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansing, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "RyanL10", "ReviewID": "UR129184287", "Content": "We stayed just after it had been recently renovated.

We went to Hollywood to get some costume wigs and outfits on Hollywood Blvd. I found this hotel after reading a suggestion by another trip advisor. This location is 170 steps from Hollywood Blvd! This is a no frills, super self service hotel. We arrived about 7 pm. The hotel is situated in a residential area and its a reasonably safe area. There was a few people outside smoking, as they have no smoking rooms at this location. When I walked in I was 3 rd in line. Got checked in quickly. We had to pay $10.00 for parking and that was not mentioned anywhere that I saw when I booked our reservations for 4 nights. Our room for Wednesday and Thursday was less than $70.00 each night. We had to park our car in the underground parking garage. Its a super tight fit. So if your in an SUV, forget it! We were told it was VALET, not so. Unless my understanding of VALET is wrong. Anyway we found a spot in the corner to park. *(See photos). We then got the luggage cart from the parking attendant who is not actually a VALET guy...loaded our stuff and took it to the elevator., We were assigned a room on the 4th floor. There is one elevator to service the 5 floor hotel and the garage. Plus a set of stairs. We were assigned room 425. It was the second to the last room on the floor. I was ok with this cuz then we did not get so much walk by noise. We opened the door and it is what it is. A very basic, clean room, no frills. We had asked for 2 queens but were given a king. I could deal with this. Not a huge issue. The bathroom is very basic. The water pressure in the shower and sink was really good. No matter what time of day we used them. Hot water came quickly. Linens are super white, clean and fresh in the bath. There is a basic set up but also a fridge which was nice as we brought water and used it for leftovers. Our window faced an apartment building. decent view, There was no liner or sheers, so if you opened the curtains, they were open to the view of the neighbors. The bedding is pretty basic, again no frills. There was an ironing board and iron in room. I had to go to the front desk for the blow drier and for shampoo. No conditioner is provided. The Ice Machine, Vending Machines, and Laundry are all located on the main floor only. That was good excercise for me as I am an Ice fanatic and have to have a lot of it , frequently. I was going up and down constantly for ice. But hey it beats having to buy bags of it. The TV had poor reception, but we were not here to watch TV. So again, another thing I could over look. So once we got settled, I took a nap, It was about 10 or so when we got up and out to Hollywood Blvd. It is seriously so close to the Blvd that it was the perfect place for us to stay. Also , since we were shopping at the best wig shop on the Blvd, we could walk to it too. There are several bars, clubs and places to eat in such close proximity. If you are a group of people or just a couple, this is a great location. I have to say this was so good for us as I sleep a lot, and anytime I needed a nap it was easy to go back to the room. This is such a convenient location. But if you are a pampered traveler, do not expect Ceasers treatment here. It is a basic room with a bed and shower. thats what you are getting here. Bring a candle or plug in air freshner with you if damp smell bothers you. And pack your sleeping mask if your sensitive to the light. A thermos that holds lots of ice is a good idea so your not running up and down all the time getting ice. Drive a small car or use a shuttle. * Currently doing remodeling on 5th floor, so you share the elevator with the workers, construction people as well as hotel staff.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cthe best location of hotel in Hollywood Blvd.\u201d", "Author": "shishirsukant", "ReviewID": "UR120198759", "Content": "If you are travelling to LA this is just the place u r looking for . it is an absolute value for money. me and my wife found that whatever was worth seeing in Hollywood was at a 5 minute walk from this hotel.

We were given a room on the first floor and after looking out the window only to find the back alley staring back at us, it didn't feel so safe especially given the fact that our window wouldn't close all the way. The walls and doors are also paper thin; I could hear the cleaning lady rolling her cart down the hallway as though my door was open. People dropping or thumping on their floor above us could also be heard clearly. The beds were comfortable enough to sleep in though they were rather squeaky when one sat down on it. If you're sleeping alone, it's fine but when you're sharing a bed and you move, the squeaky sound does get rather tiring.

Other times it was fine. I would recomend this Hotel for anyone on a budget and wants to see Hollywood and its attractions. Even Universal studios is only 1 metro train stop away with the metro station being only 5 minutes walk from the hotel at Hollywood and Highland center.

Its not ceasers palace in Vegas but I know this will be my same spot anytime I visit LA. If you have had a bad review, I cannot see why. truly, I think most bad reviews comes from being upset at the hotel for something so people find thing to report negative ( I realize I have done that on a south beach hotel in Miami) i personally didnt like the room set up but is was modern and new like the shower comes right down over your head and my hair gets wet, that bad review to me) I, So, give this location a try. very clean rooms and bathroom is a plus for me. nice clean lobby, flat screens in room and iron but No hair dryer. parking is $10 dollars a day and you pay daily by noon. They also have a small garage but have a valet( cool) that is free. So, I loved that. no deposit for the room ( can you believe that!!!!!!!!!!!!) but, if you smoke, and they will ask you, and then its a $250.00 hold on your card( heads up)!! but if not, you sign a small agreement that you will not smoke, that's all... I don't smoke so that was good for me. who has money to be held up on a card anyways. I have a tip also, hertz rental cars has special offers where if you live in Arizona and rent a car and drive it back to LA,Vegas and a few other states, the car is a wopping $5.00 per day.

There is no cupboard for clothes, nor anyway to lock valuables away. (Not that I had anything go missing though).

They are clearly getting commission from Starline tours so push their services hard, but Starline leave a lot to be desired! Look on the internet for tours, or get a pamphlet from the reception area and call yourself. The motel will make you pay a deposit too - it takes away your options to change your mind about something. They don't change currency, so make sure you have enough. The motel tends to be noisy so ask for a room at the end of the passage where there's less traffic. There is some kind of casual bar type thing at the back of the motel, which gets very noisy to very late at night. You'll need a sleeping pill to sleep through it.

To me, that means that you have a spot for EVERY room in your hotel. I was instructed to park in a garage a block away. This was very scary as Hollywood Boulevard was a very seedy area with many scary people lurking about. What made it worse was that we had to leave at 4 a.m. to drive back to San Diego to fly home which meant that I had to walk in the pitch black to go get the car. I was scared to death as I walked by people sitting outside at that time at the seedy hotel next door and homeless people on the street. I feel very lucky to be alive and with all of my money. As far as the room, it wasn't the cleanest but passable. the most basic room I have ever seen, though. Not one thing hung on the walls and like others have said, NO CLOCK. This made me very uncomfortable to rely on a wake up call for our 4 a.m. wake up. We set our cell phones but had never done that before so I was scared to rely on that also.

I booked this place for two nights in late March, I was going to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl and the proximity of this place was excellent for that. I'm a single female, so after looking at a lot of reviews I was glad that a friend of mine decided to stay here too. His room was on a different floor than mine, but he was fine with his accommodations too. I'd say first and foremost, if you're expecting this to be more than a budget motel then you probably need to adjust your expectations and/or consider paying top dollar for a room at a 3 or 4 star hotel. It's located in a residential neighborhood just off of Hollywood Blvd, yes there's no breakfast buffet, but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. Mel's Drive-In is on Highland and Hollywood and they've got a $3.99 breakfast that runs from 6am-10am. I didn't bother to try the coffee downstairs because they don't have creamer, and I like creamer. I didn't bother to use the vending machines downstairs because there's a little 24/7 market on the corner of Whitley and Hollywood and there's a refrigerator in the room. In the lobby there's a tv running, news was on it whenever I walked by. There's a computer lab with 3 PCs within it, and there is wireless access in the rooms but you'll need to ask the front desk for the WEP key to get online. I did, and the signal on the 3rd floor was great (looks like they've got access points on each floor). The tv worked, but the remote was buggy. The beds were clean, I'd reserved a room with double queens because I kind of wanted the option of using extra pillows and blankets, no bedbugs or varmints in the sheets. The bathroom was clean, I knew that they didn't stock shampoo's or conditioner so make sure you keep that in mind (but who in the world travels without their own shampoo and conditioner??!). There were people partying in a room down the hall, close to the elevator area, but once I walked a few doors down from theirs I didn't hear them at all. Yes the elevator is slow, so I only used it to get my stuff up to my room and back down ... and when I felt lazy (I was walking around a lot before and after I checked in), it was always faster to walk down the stairs so I always used the stairs to come down. I didn't park in the garage under the building, it was full and there's only a few spaces down there. I parked around the block on Cheyenne in a really nice multilevel parking structure for the same price that I would have parked downstairs for (i.e. $10/day). Parked it on a Monday night and didn't bother to pick it back up until Wednesday, that garage doesn't accept credit cards or debit cards, it's a \"cash only\" situation so be warned to have cash onhand when you're picking up your vehicle. The proximity to Hollywood Blvd is fantastic, hopped on a tourbus at the corner of Whitley and Hollywood and spent a couple of hours being entertained by the driver (she was a hoot). Ultimately this was a really good bargain for my needs, I knew I wasn't going to be in the room very much and really just needed a shower, a bed and a place to store my stuff. Was able to book it for $55/night through Orbitz and if that's not a great deal then I don't know what is. If I had to pay more than that then I'm not sure if I would have gone for it (had a reservation for the Comfort Inn on Highland that was $35 more per night and I canceled it to give this place a go, and I do not regret having done that.

Nothing like a huge ironing board being handed to you over the [---] check-in counter! No drawers to place your clothes, not even a complimentary pen with a pad of paper sitting beside that filthy telephone (which I also sprayed down with Lysol!)

It's on Whitley, which is less than a half-block from Hollywood Boulevard. This is a famous street -- the Hollywood Walk of Fame is here, in addition to Kodak Theater and Mann's Chinese Theater. There is a lot of foot traffic on Hollywood Boulevard, locals as well as tourists, so it's great for people-watching. You can walk to restaurants and bars as well as stores like American Apparel, American Eagle Outfitters, two vintage clothing stores and souvenir shops. Mel's Drive In is literally right around the corner. I actually just got back from my stay. I went with my sister and her son. Getting past the location, which was excellent, the motel itself wasn't exactly wonderful. It looks good from the outside -- it's in a pretty nice area of Hollywood -- but it's a Motel 6. There are stains on the carpet in the hall and the elevator takes forever to arrive. But, the room was clean and adequate for our needs. For $10 a day you can park underground, and the attendant (wearing a white button-down shirt and vest) will bring you a wheeled luggage carrier. Best of all, they allow pets, which was my No. 1 priority. AND it's inexpensive. With the one night of lodging, pet fee ($10) and parking fee, it was $90. And you should know that's a steal in this area. If you're looking for a place to rest your head for a night or a weekend, I recommend Motel 6 Hollywood.
