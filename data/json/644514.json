I loved the experience so much, I wanted to make sure those searching Trip Advisor also saw it! We stayed four days in April 2012 and hated to leave. The only thing more inviting than the lovingly and beautifully designed hotel was the superb staff; Quick with a smile, a dinner reccomendation/reservation, or offer of a hotel umbrella when it rained. This hotel is all about the details - the room feels like you are staying not at Anna Fendi's hotel, but as a guest in her own home. The room was gorgeous - full of amenities and personal touches (great for couples!). It's surrounded by a lush, tucked away garden that feels far from the hustle of Rome while still being right in the thick of it (One Metro stop from the Vatican). The area is more upscale, safe and quiet with a great neighborhood feel; you're just steps away from some great reastaurants and shopping that feel more local than overcrowded with tourists. Breakfast in the main Villa every morning was delicious. The beds were the only comfortable ones we had our entire trip throughout Italy. This was by far the best hotel experience on our trip (of ANY trip) - we will not think of staying anywhere else in Rome and will sing the VIlla's praises to anyone who will listen.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsingoer, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cStylish with atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Svegaard", "ReviewID": "UR119708435", "Content": "This hotel is stylish and is placed away from the street.

The only person on staff we've met is Miguel, who is very very nice and helpful, but it's as if whoever owns this place woken up one day and said, \"I think i'll run a hotel today.\" The property is under construction, which we were told in an email upon booking, but it said it \"might\" affect the \"entrance\" but would not affect our rooms. Well, the entrance is indeed trashed, but the grounds are also affected (the garden is not set up and chairs are stacked in corners). The room is big enough for us (we were told we HAD to book the suite for 3), but the floor is covered in construction dust. My feet are black if I walk barefoot. Not affected? I also can smell the dust and we can feel it when we breath in. IT's everywhere, not just contained to the entrance, which is 30 meters away. I said something to Miguel, again he is so nice, but he became defensive and said, \"We told you there was construction.\" Well, that's true so I guess we are wrong to complain. The shower, as someone indicated below, is ridiculous. So small you can't bend over, or escape the water to shampoo your hair. No shelf in the sower means you have to step out to get shampoo and soap, and when you do, the water gets everywhere because the shower is literally, no exaggeration, 2 x 2 feet. We were shown the breakfast room when we arrived and assuming we could go there in the morning (breakfast time), we showed up at 9 to a darkened room, only to be told we had to let them know we wanted breakfast. Would have been nice to know that upon arrival. Internet service is slow slow slow. Took me 5 minutes to open this page. My husband can't even log onto the network and had to go ask if he would use their hard wire to download a contract he needs to sign. We are three people in our room, but only received 2 towels. All and all, it's not a place to enjoy a relaxing holiday. For the prince (290 euros a night) we could have found a place closer to the center, with staff who have run a hotel before. The location is quiet and pretty, but not anywhere you can grab a taxi or metro There are also no other guests in the hotel. I guess they were smarter than us upon booking. Lesson learned.

It is a bit tricky to find, but once my husband and I got all checked in, we were extremely pleased with our room. They were kind enough to upgrade us from a superior room to a senior suite (the Round room), and we could not have been happier with our suite. It was absolutely gorgeous - a home away from home. After settling into our room, we awoke the next morning to begin sightseeing. It's about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the nearest metro station. Once you get on the metro it's a fairly quick ride to anywhere you want to go. Now, at first glance, this may not seem like much of an inconvenience, and for some, it may not be. But we found that we were much less likely to take those much needed small breaks in the afternoon at the hotel because of its distance from most of the major sites. Instead, we found ourselves feeling that once we were out and about, we were out to stay, which meant that by the time we headed back to the hotel, we were exhausted, and what seemed like a short walk in the morning seemed very long after a long day of sightseeing. That being said, the neighborhood is adorable, and the accommodations are fantastic, so you have to choose for yourself as to how important it is to have easy access to the main attractions, but it's definitely something to take into consideration, and we found it to be the only drawback of the hotel. The staff is extremely helpful. Ava's dinner recommendations were perfect. We never would have found the places she suggested, but after eating there, we wouldn't have chosen to eat anywhere else. All in all, this was a fabulous experience. One final word, we came back to Villa Laetitia for one night before we flew back home, and we stayed in the Hoffman Room.

The friendly clerk at the counter directed us to our room. It was cozy but nicely designed. We learned that each of the rooms had been designed differently. The Villa Laetitia did not look like your normal hotel. It is hidden behind an old-fashioned villa. But the uniqueness provides much of the charm. We liked the location. The hotel is located on an street that winds alongside the Tiber River. You can't actually see the river because of shrubbery where the hotel is situated.

The hotel is not traditional in the sense that it doesn't really provide any meals (it is possible to have breakfast provided, but at 20euros for tea and croissant, and 30euros for tea, croissant and ham/cheese/etc. it's better to do breakfast yourself), but the rooms are extremely comfortable and beautifully furnished.

The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful; they booked a private transfer from the station to the hotel on our arrival (they also arrange these from the airport) and for the return (bit more expensive than a taxi but nice to have someone waiting for you when you arrive on the overnight train from Paris!).

Upon arrival, we were unsure how to get inside the huge gates that protect the property; luckily, one of the staff was outside accepting a delivery, and he warmly ushered us inside. For the rest of your stay, you are given a password that operates the gates. Hands down, the best thing about this place was the staff. Francesco and Federica were wonderful, friendly, and spoke English very, very well. Francesco was especially helpful in recommending restaurants (Cacio e Pepe just around the corner was a delightfully inexpensive place to have a meal the first night we arrived). He also pointed out a small cafe/bar that served freshly baked croissants in the mornings; it was also just around the corner and we might have overlooked it had we not known it was there! (Please note that Villa Laetitia, as it is more residence-style hotel, does not include breakfast in the morning as many hotels in Italy do. Therefore, those inexpensive and delicious croissants were welcome!). Our room, the Loden, was very dark and small. The bed takes up much of the room. The bathroom, as well, was very tiny. There is also a miniscule kitchen for use. However, quite truthfully, we do not spend much time in our rooms when traveling, so the accomodations were all we needed and more than adequate. The room's cooling system was great (and we needed it, given the heat!), the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom, though small, was clean and well-appointed. We really had everything we needed, and it was nice to have a fridge and stove for use (and they will clean your dishes/stove if you use them), given that a grocery store was also just around the corner! In addition, the room was very stylish! A good deal for the price in an expensive city. The grounds were very interesting; I felt like I was encapsulated in an overgrown fairy-tale. Very nice to sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. The Villa is a bit far from most of the sights. For us, a mile walk is never a problem and we welcome the exercise. Those who prefer not to walk so far have the choice of using the Metro - a stop was conveniently located very close-by. We enjoyed staying away from the hustle of the city center and felt that the neighborhood was very nice and safe, right by the Tevere. Leaving for the airport was not a problem, even though we had a 6:30am flight. Federica arranged a taxi for us, which was a much cheaper alternative than a private car. He arrived just on time without any trouble. All in all, we were happy to have chosen this unique place to stay, and would consider returning!", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cFirst impressions\u201d", "Author": "kmmaas", "ReviewID": "UR7722628", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Villa Laetitia. We saw the funny side of our first impressions which initially threw us. As travellers from the US our dollar limited our choices of accomodation. Laetitia however was luxurious and great value for money in an otherwise expensive city. We booked a standard room to keep within our budget. Our friends from the UK paid more to book a larger apartment. The location of Villa Laetitia is excellent for the sites of Rome. It is quiet, secluded behind secure gates and an oasis from the madness of the traffic and crowds closer in the heart of Rome. We were happy to walk (most sites about a mile away) but also took advantage of the efficient taxi service. Laetitia is tucked behind a large building located at the hotel's address. We were not the only guests to walk through the doorways of this prominent building which opened into a cavenous reception area which unfortunately was in the process of being furnished/ plastered/rewired you name it! We thought we had arrived to our worse holiday nightmare that booking a hotel on line could provide!! A sign to direct guests to the back of the premises would be strongly recommended to avoid heart racing disappointment for new arrivals who just might turn around and 'escape' before even finding the intended destination - a warmer, more sophisticated reception in a separate building at the back of the estate. First impressions of our room were disappointing. The door from the hotel patio opened straight into our bedroom which was square, compact, dark-ish and with no obvious windows (they did exist but were small, shuttered and had vines growing outside. Sounds awful but really, we got value for our money. The room was beautifully decorated and provided for. Room service excellent. Features modern and in good condition. We could not complain but would have hoped for a more open vista on arrival. Our friends room was wide open, spacious. We made good use of their space to enjoy wine out on their private patio which created a unique experience of Rome (buying groceries at the local supermarket nearby also added to the whole experience of Roma. Front desk staff were friendly, helpful and respectful. They made great efforts to help us make plans for a rainy day which apparently spells disaster for tourists as all cabs/guides/museums are booked solid. Our perspective on our accommodation may have been different had we not been able to share our friend's larger apartment.
