However, we had some problems with the reservation, because we booked in early Septembre with their Confirmation at Carrer Mallorca (near the center, on foot) and in October they gave us at Carrer de Torns (5 min to the Metro Station Badal and 15 min long to Catalunya stop). They justify that the rooms in Carrer Mallorca weren't in good conditions. True or false, the rooms were nice for the budget and staff there friendly, though. They have to be more organised with the Reservations and Confirmations, and responding to the e-mails clients asking for informations about the booking situation.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR944612840", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "PortoExplorer"}, {"Content": "excellent budget hotel We stayed here for 5 nights during the Sonar festival. We had taken the time to pick our room carefuly and ended up with a great room, plenty of space, tho the bathroom was small ( not a problem really). We'd chosen a balcony room and it was well worth the extra. Lots of light (but with shutters too)The street outside was noisy so earplugs are recommended, especially when trying to sleep off the night before!!Our friends had a room that was 'much' smaller with very little natural light.(305)The place was very clean, if you like fluffy towels take your own!!!!!!!!Free internet and air con was a bonus.All in all a good place if you get a good room. 306 was good and we also got a peek at 307 which was a triple room and quite good too.Enjoy Barcelona.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR227990707", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "marrakesh"}, {"Content": "Una estafa   showReview(18711193, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR813645355", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Gabatxo"}, {"Content": "Sauberes Hostal   showReview(18416735, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560913520", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Samsung001"}, {"Content": "Reserva, que ya ver\u8c29s por d\u8d38nde se la pasan...   showReview(16175467, 'full');", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR513288689", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "carlosfernandez"}, {"Content": "precios que cambian.   showReview(15273874, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR320488424", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "karukat"}, {"Content": "Non \u732b possibile presentare...   showReview(16728931, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR833151874", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El hostal es realmente fea su...   showReview(16728144, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR561635575", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "hostel MOLTO SCADENTE   showReview(10059570, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR191025127", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "iovagabondo"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d611147-r20480412-Hostal_Felipe_II-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "611147", "Price": "$105"}}
