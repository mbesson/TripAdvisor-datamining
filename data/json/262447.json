We had a good room that was at the back of the hotel, so there was little street noise. But I can see how street noise could be a problem if you had a front room, particular in summer if you needed the windows opened. The room was fairly small, but as we were out sightseeing all day, we were only there at night, and usually pretty tired. The bathroom had just been recently made over, and was quite clean. The room also was clean. The free WiFi was a bit ad hoc, but again, fine for our purposes. The breakfast was as big or small as you wanted it to be. And all the staff I had dealings with were very friendly and happy to assist where possible. I'd return again, particularly if I could have the same room again.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cjust ok\u201d", "Author": "gzo", "ReviewID": "UR116994674", "Content": "Positive: very close tube station, breakfast good, staff friendly, free wifi Negative: small and very basic room, noise from the street, free internet slow, cleanliness not outstanding Considering the hotel prices in London, this is place is just OK.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA FINE FRIENDLY SMALL HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "John M", "ReviewID": "UR111640606", "Content": "A fine small hotel in W.

We were welcomed with warmth and friendliness, and nothing was too much trouble for the manager and staff. The rooms were sparkling, and the treatment we received was marvellous. On being greeted we were taken to our rooms, and told that whatever we required, just to ring reception and it would be dealt with. We then met the member of staff that would be dealing with our room, and were told that anything required in the room for our comfort, to inform reception or the member of staff and it would be seen to. We were made to feel very welcome and it was with some sadness that we left at the end of our stay, having felt that we had made friends with the hotel staff and manager. We would certainly recommend this hotel to people wishing to visit London, as it was in friendliness like a 'home from home', One could leave the hotel during the day knowing that there was nothing to worry about in any way, shape or form. We met with nothing but kindness and helpfulness from the manager and staff, and as a result thoroughly enjoyed our stay in London.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "leamington spa", "Title": "\u201cNot Quite The Pearly Gates We Expected\u201d", "Author": "Figaro_7", "ReviewID": "UR7973515", "Content": "Needed a room in the locality so for that it was fine.However the room was tiny but at least the sheets and bed were clean.Which is more than could be said for the shower,black mould around the tray and the sliding door did not want to slide.Breakfast was very average,limited choice.If you need a room in Chiswick you might justify a visit ,otherwise give it a miss.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful and popular hotel\u201d", "Author": "daoud123", "ReviewID": "UR7955321", "Content": "this is a excellent hotel we are from france me and my wife and we find this hotel closed to the airport heathrow and the touwn center ,no expensive,good service, good for the price.if u decide do not stay longer in london this is the perfect place thank.... francois", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fareham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA bad experience\u201d", "Author": "StubbingtonBob", "ReviewID": "UR7706772", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel last weekend as I was looking for a hotel near to Chiswick. Big mistake.The pictures I found of it on the internet looked good and it just goes to show that all that glitters is not gold! The kettle, for that is thecoffee/tea maker, was so big that it was very difficult to actually get any water into it so I had to use a cup to fill it. Shower - fixed and the soap tray was at best disgusting and had clearly not been cleaned. Toilet - well yes there was an ensuite toilet with basin and shower - the trouble was to use the toilet you needed to be a contortionist. On entering the room we found a used bath towel hanging on the back of the door. The carpet had clearly had lip service paid to it by the vacuum thats working on the assumption that one was used. I know other TA users will say why did we stop? We got there late and there was no where else immediately available. Hindsight is a wonderful tool and I should have driven home. I could have actually got a taxi to London and back for what I paid which was 85 UK sterling. This place is not good value for money and I would certainly not return.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "St Peters Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d262447-Reviews-St_Peters_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$119*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">407 - 411 Goldhawk Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "262447", "ImgURL": ""}}
