Positive : Great location near the metro and quartier latin, friendly staff (they let us use their microwave even if there wasn't one in our room), control over the AC and heating in our room, new bathroom and new decoration in the room, all very clean. Also, if you want a quiet area, room 303 is in the back and you don't hear a single neighbor. We were very surprised to see a \"no vacancy\" sign on the second night, we hadn't hear a single guest ! Negative : Those are really just details, like no elevators, no breakfast, the rooms being pretty small....

We had a mini fridge, a desk, tv, wireless internet access worked in the rooms- the rooms were also a great size. Good location too just up the road from the gay village and across from little Italy. The only thing that annoyed me about this place was the staff. We are both young couples and when the lady at the desk explained that the rooms were non-smoking she spoke to us like a teacher scolding her students. That really p***** me off.

My suggestion is keep your money and walk across the road to the Hotel European where you get a better room (with its own bathroom) at the same price, plus a complimentary breakfast and even better, free wifi. Visitel not even worth the \"cheap\" rates. We were booked into a room with a PRIVATE en-suite and they checked us into a room with a share bathroom. We quickly went down to make this known and we were told that as we were paying such a low rate we were definitely not booked into any other room other than what we were given, furthermore if we wanted our own bathroom we needed to pay an additional fee per night. After we presented the printed confirmation (and a lot of debate) we were told we could have the room we thought we'd booked for one night and then we would have to move to another room with a share bathroom. The following morning we went down to discuss our disappointment and that we were not in the wrong, Vanessa was diligent and called through to both the manager and owner to inquire. Following a brief chat with the owner she passed me the phone. On the other end of the phone the owner was talking non stop not allowing me to say a word telling me it was not her problem and that we should speak to the agent we booked it through - we made the reservation online and paid the hotel directly upon check-in. The owner after yelling at me for 2 minutes advised that we had 2 options; leave or move rooms. I have never been spoken to in that manner by anyone, let alone a business operator.

We have stayed at many budget hostels in various countries and had not experienced such a terrible night as we did at Hotel Visitel. I rated the service as 'terrible' however one of the staff members was very nice and helpful. The reason I rated the service low was because we did not receive any compensation for our lousy experience. Apparently the owner was on the night shift and she did not really do anything about the situation-ie-apologize in the morning or leave a note for the morning shift. Here is what happened. Rooms were rented to a group (gang) of 20 something 'boys'. We could not figure out how many their were, but we had encountered them in the lobby earlier in the evening and there were approximately 7 individuals. Around 8 Pm they were already intimidating the front desk gentelman, leaning in and telling him how they did not like one of the other staff members, clearly he had been drinking. Upon returning from dinner around 11 PM. My husband and I decided to stay in and rest up for our next day and night in Montreal. We could hear every person that used the stairs behind our room, from conversations to foot stomping. So we were a bit apprehensive but figured that we were tired enough to sleep through it. The group/gang whatever you want to call it, continued to RUN up and down the stairs for the next 4 hours. The later it got, the louder and more beligerant they became. Talking on cell phones, yelling at eachother, bumping into walls. All the while, numbers of other 'goups' began to assemble outside our window that faced the street. So, now it was approximately 4 AM and my husband and I were in and out of consiousness and exhausted. He got up and looked out the window. There were now three 'groups' of individuals all over the street and infront of OUR hotel. There were also 3 police cars and police officers walking in and out of our hotel. Great. When the police finally got everything under control around 6 AM and it was quiet, someone was clearly locked out of their room and began kicking and pounding on the door next to us. Yelling 'Logan!\" over and over. Finally the idiot stomped off. To top off an already insane night, we had a wake up call to our room at 7 AM! Which we did not ask for! So my husband and I slept from 730 am to approx 9 am and were exhausted all day. We obviously checked out but totally lost our morning and our day was ruined because we were so tired from the lunacy of the night before. To make everything worse. When we went to talk to the front desk about what happened and he had no idea about anything. He said the owner, which is a woman, took the night shift and she did not leave any informatio. We made sure to politely explain what had happened and that it was not his fault. But still no discount or anything. So I guess their 24 hr front desk policy means nothing. If I were sitting at the front desk of an establishment that I owned, I would have had the police there a lot earlier. If I did not feel comfortable confronting a gang of 20 year old, wanna be thugs, who probably live in their parents' basement, then I would have called the police earlier or at least a male friend for some support. I also would have stayed or at least came back in the morning to offer some explanation to the other guests who clearly would have been affected.

Our room was on the second floor facing the back with a fire escape right outside the window so we were a little disappointed but at least no traffic noise bothered us. There was no mirror in the room apart from in the bathroom which was a bit inconvenient and the decor had seen better days.

The most notable complaints in those reviews were not present in our case - the air conditioner worked fine, the doorlock worked, the internet connection worked, and we were not bothered by street noise at night. Our room was on the second floor facing the street, so we did not have to hike up to the fourth floor. I did notice at least one room on the ground floor where the window faced the alley and had a window air conditioner, rather than the baseboard-type in our room,; this room may be less appealing. Note: given the choice of recommending this hotel or not to friend, I marked \"yes\" but I would do so only after reviewing the pros and cons of this hotel.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pmfeldman", "Title": "\u201cNightmare on Rue Saint Hubert\u201d", "Author": "pmfeldman", "ReviewID": "UR69981163", "Content": "I've stayed at hotels that failed to meet expectations, but this was my first experience of a hotel that flagrantly disregarded explicit, written promises. If any hotel deserves to be classified as a scam operation, this is it. The following is a partial list of problems that we encountered at this establishment: 1. When we arrived at the hotel, I was told that the credit card that had been used for making the reservation would not be honored: \"You can use the American Express card for making the reservation, but not for settling the bill\". (I'm not sure what would have happened if I had not had another credit card). 2. The confirmed rate was not honored, despite the fact that I had a printout showing this rate. The hotel clerk explained that I would be paying substantially more, and that the cause of the discrepancy was a simple language problem: \"The word 'total' does not mean the same thing in Canada and the U.S.\" 3. We learned that our room was on the 4th floor and that there was no elevator. Getting our suitcases up three steep, narrow flights of stairs was quite a challenge. 4. The deadbolt was not working, making it impossible to lock the door. When I complained about this, I was told that it had been disabled, but not to worry because only hotel staff would be able to enter the room during the night. I ended up blocking the door with a heavy chair. 5. The free WiFi was not usable. Despite the assistance of the hotel clerk, I was unable to load any web pages. 6. Air conditioning and a television were available in one room, but not in the other. 7. In the room that had the air conditioner, the unit was mounted in the window, making it impossible to fully close the window and block out the street noise. My son and I, who were in that room, were unable to sleep most of the night because of noise from vehicles passing in the street. When making the reservation, I had specifically asked for a quiet room. 8. In the early morning, I closed the curtain to block sunlight, but this also blocked the flow of air from the air conditioner. I've never seen a setup like this in any other hotel. 9. The \"breakfast\" was far and away the worst hotel breakfast that I've ever seen. There was no milk, no yogurt, and in fact, no dairy products of any kind. There was no cereal, no fruit (fresh or otherwise), no muffins, and no pastry. So, what was served? Stale bread and stale bagels! 10. There were a total of three chairs in the breakfast room, so that the four of us could not all sit at the same time. Dr. Phillip M.
