The hotel is not very central however there is a bus stop just a few steps away from the door and metro (Garbatella on the blue line) just a little further up the road, so getting to the Historical City centre isnt a hassle. Should you need a cab, it should cost you about 14euro, double for a return journey. Overall its not too bad but not great either. If yoiu're on a strict budget, stay here.

Our stay at this hotel was booked well in advance, thus affording us a reasonable rate for an extended stay in Rome, but I would imagine the hotel's location contributes heavily to this as it is a fair walk from the city centre. The room we stayed in was small and basic, but clean and reasonably comfortable at the same time. The bathroom could have done with a little redecoration and at first it seemed as though a funny smell was coming from the air conditioner, but we may have been suffering the effects of a long days travelling and after a night\u2019s sleep, we became more accustomed to our room, although it certainly would not have hurt to have at least one extra pillow in the room, but this all depends on personal preference. The walls are a bit thin too....I think the room next to us were jumping on the bed at 3am or something.... A MAJOR plus point for this room was that we were given a complimentary fridge and safe, which, when travelling on a student budget, certainly eases financial pressures. There is a large supermarket behind this hotel, where we were able to purchase fruit, sandwich fillings and other items which helped save on the often over priced food in central Rome. Our booking included breakfast, which was a cold buffet consisting of breads, cheese, sliced meat, cereals and fruit juices. A little disappointing was the fact that there was no variation in the breakfast menu on different days, but, for the money we paid, this was certainly sufficient. For a nice meal without the central Rome price tag, try the V. Hugo restaurant just a few doors down from this hotel. Definitely worth a try! As a side note, the internet in the hotel was extremely slow! As the title of this review would suggest, be prepared for a bit of a walk to reach anything as the local area leaves much to be desired for tourist attractions. We happen to enjoy walking, and even one day walked from the hotel to central Rome, taking about 45 minutes. The nearest metro station is \"Garbatella\", which is at least 10 minutes walk away. You can take a bus to the top of the street but these were not as frequent as I would have liked, so most of the time we walked to the metro station. However, once at Garbatella, you can be in central Rome in less than 5 minutes. Also, be aware that the metro trains do not run as late as in other major cities, so if you are planning to stay out until after 1am, be prepared to either walk (or stumble...depending on your choice of night out) or pay at least 20 Euros for a taxi. If you are less able to walk distances or travelling with someone who is unable to do so, you should perhaps consider a more central hotel. Some general tips that we think may be helpful to anyone visiting Rome on a budget: If you are staying for more than 3 days, consider a Week-long metro ticket. This can be used on metro trains and buses, though not the \"hop on hop off\" tour buses that operate in the city centre, and cost just 8 Euros each. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL OF BEGGARS/THIEVES etc etc: I actually caught one woman with her fingers in my pocket in Termini station and consider myself very lucky that she did not manage to steal anything. Learn some basic Italian. Whilst the hotel staff and some waiters in Rome were good at communicating in English, most other Romans are not as proficient as you may think, so learning some basic phrases or even just words will aid you greatly. Fountains! Rome is full of fountains, which provided us with relief from the 40 Degree temperatures. We always carried a bottle or two of water and refilled every hour or so. Not only does this stop dehydration in such temperatures, it will also save you a lot of cash as many shops sell a normal bottle of coke for as much as 3.50 Euros! If you are eating in central Rome on a budget, consider the side streets around many of the main attractions. Prices can be reduced as much as 50% and the quality if often just as good. Taxis in Rome charge by time spent in the vehicle, so consider public transport if you need to travel during peak times In all, we would certainly stay here again for an extended stay, but in all honesty, Rome is not a big city and the majority of sites can be seen in 4 days or less, so if you are not constrained by budget, a more central hotel may be better suited to you. If however, like us, you are trying to be cost effective and don't mind a bit of a walk, then this hotel would be perfect for your needs!", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guatemala", "Title": "\u201cbad experience\u201d", "Author": "Normita92", "ReviewID": "UR71196021", "Content": "the hotel is very bad located.

The air conditioner worked great, we were totally in 4 different rooms with 2 different couples and never had any issues. The hotel staff is the biggest minus to this hotel. They seem to know very little about the area immediately around the hotel.

There was a little restaurant just south of the Hotel towards the old Roman Sistern, it was very good. We ate there 4 out of the 5 nites we were there. Very nice people and after the second night we became regulars and they really took good care of us.The Breakfast was good at the hotel also.

A watch which was by that time a five day old christmas present went missing from the room...along with a few euros which had been left in a drawer... the evening was further spoiled by a rowdy bunch of 12 young Italians who despite several knocks on the wall and staff calls refused to behave appropriately and brought the tradition of 'Roman Orgies' so often quoted as being part of ancient Rome's colourful history back to life in the room next door to ours... this was not good when in the company of two children who could hear everything!! and we all needed to be up for an early flight the next day! Although there were many complaints through the night from us and other guests about the noise the party continued until silly o clock in the morning which was unacceptable and we were told at one point during the night to go and sort them out ourselves by the receptionist!! Hopefully the hotel will review their group bookings to ensure such issues are avoided in the future. I have given an overall rating of 3 because I am hopeful the incidents were isolated and I want to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt....but beware.

For 50 Euros per room a night you simply cant go wrong. Very easy to get to too. Take the slow train to Roma Ostiense and then bus 30/130/60 3 stops to the hotels door. Travelling to the city centre takes 14 minutes by bus (1 Euro) and they are every few minutes till midnight. If I had to make a negative comment i would say that being on the main road into Rome its possible to notice the odd \"girl\" standing by the roadside if you go back to the hotel after 11pm, but they are no problem whatsoever.
