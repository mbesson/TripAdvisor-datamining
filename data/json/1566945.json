The location is great, weather was mild and allowed us to walk quite a bit. Our room was very comfortable, had a city view and was generously sized. Housekeeping was great, bath toiletries were higher end and good quality. The room has an iPhone dock which was great to listen to music prior to dinner, etc. I would hands down stay here again when in Chicago. The hotel acknowledged my birthday by sending a bottle of wine and chocolates to our room, this was a very hospitable gesture and another reason why we love Kimpton hotels. We had room service for breakfast one morning and it was very good. We ordered French toast and eggs though so that is pretty hard to mess up... My only suggestion, don't bother with Sable Restaurant. We ate lunch here on our first afternoon and it was so-so. Chicago is a foodie city and this restaurant offered nothing special. Not to mention the decor was stark and tired, think the Delano hotel in 2002. Unoriginal food in an atmosphere better suited for sweltering Miami nights...not Chicago.

As it happened this coincided with the St Patricks Day celebrations. I figured I'd better make some restaurant bookings well in advance. I got into contact with Jessica Ebacher one of the hotel's amazing team of concierges. She was extremely helpful and more than happy to get everything organised, very prompt in replying to emails. In the past the lovely Mark Kraemer has helped the husband with his restaurant bookings, and on this occasion Mark re-confirmed the bookings and ensured that we got special tables and exceptional service. Check in (at around 6pm on a Thursday) looked at if it was mobbed - but it wasn't, in fact they have an evening wine sampling and guests were milling around clasping large glasses of vino - which I have to say I gazed at longingly. As we checked in, because we 'just' missed the wine tasting we were presented with two tickets entitling us to claim a complimentary glass of the evening's wine at the Sable bar (more on that in a moment). I'd also signed up as a Kimpton InTouch Member (it's free), this further entitled us to free wifi for the whole of our stay and a one off $10 'raid the mini bar'! We had been upgraded to a corner room 1604 and I was totally blown away by the size of the space...there was a large working desk and chair, a large flatscreen TV, a coffee table with a three seater sofa and easy chair and a gi-normous bed. Plenty of storage space. A couple of wacky dressing gowns and even a yoga mat (with a special TV channel that you could tune into to do various exercises). The bathroom was almost as large as our first flat. A Jacuzzi bath for 2, which after a long day of pounding the streets was fabulous. A walk in shower for 2 plus guests!! All the usual complimentary smellies and a whole host of things in the mini-bar if you had forgotten anything. The hotel is well situated for plenty of really good restaurants including Joes Seafood, just around the corner, and Smith & Wolenski on the river just down the road. In the mornings you can amble downstairs to grab tea or coffee, also available mid-afternoon, thereafter iced water and a selection of sweeties (I noticed some people taking handfuls). The Sable bar was buzzing every night, great atmosphere and the food looked pretty good too. The husband wasn't feeling so well on the Saturday evening so I asked Mark if he could work his magic and ensure that I had a seat at the bar so I could enjoy a drink on my own - sure enough he liaised with the bar manager and they reserved me a spot, much to my great appreciation. All in all this is an absolute gem of a hotel, all the staff are delightful from door men (one of these guys, wears a hat, has the most amazing whistle I think I've ever heard!) to room service. My special thanks however remain for Mark Kraemer, in him this hotel has the greatest gem of all.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA gem in an ideal location\u201d", "Author": "18hf18", "ReviewID": "UR126289910", "Content": "I should've known this would be one of those memorable hotel experiences after Michael at the front desk cheerfully arranged for the complicated delivery and storage of a package before our arrival.

Rooms are not huge, but enough space to get around. Bathrooms on the small side but very clean & modern. As we were celebrating an anniversary, we were given champagne & strawberries on arriving in the room - nice touch. The corridors of the hotel have some rather quirky artwork. Be warned though as some of them stick out in places and you might just catch your arm on them! The pool area and outside deck are gorgeous. In fact, I think they make the Palomar a real winner as many city boutique hotels don't have pools or outside sun decks. We went for a late night swim and it was fab! The hosted wine reception in the evening is a great place to chill for an hour and chat / relax. Great wine & great pizza! The lobby and lounge area are really nice with a gorgeous fireplace. We ate an evening meal at the restaurant and the quality was very good although this is reflected in the prices. All in all, this was a good stay for our short time in Chicago.

The doors to the street are a little bit weird, they are heavy to open (two of them) which is not very handy when you come \"home\" after a day of shopping with zillions of shopping bags.

No problem, the Palomar was willing to match the price. The location of the hotel is amazing, the staff is one of the friendliest I have ever encountered, and the wine reception is so relaxing. The suite spoke for itself. The room was huge. Two double doors separating the kids from our bedroom. The beautifully appointed bathroom was located between the two rooms and a wonderful sitting area by the window that the kids loved. It was nice to return from visiting all the museums and have the kids relax in their own room, with TV a pull-out queen size sofa bed, and wireless internet. BTW the wireless internet is free if you join Kimpton hotels online, which is also free. The service was promt and they really listened to you if you needed something, and was delivered to your room asap.

I can not say enough great things about this property (but I'll try to limit my review to the highlights): 1. The staff - I emailed the management a few weeks before our stay to request a room on a high floor. Not only did they accomodate us, but they also upgraded our room to a FANTASTIC suite and had the room ready for my 10am arrival. They also sent my fiance and I a bottle of sparkling wine on the evening of our anniversary. 2. The room - Out of control awesome...floor to ceiling windows, seperate sitting area with a couch and comfy chair, great bed, huge closets, and the best tub I've ever seen (seriously...it fit two comfortably and could probably have fit five somewhat awkwardly). I would also recommend becoming a Kimpton In-Touch member - the service is free and it provides you with ammenities like a newspaper in the morning, pillow menu, free Wi-Fi, and a $10 raid the mini bar credit. 3. The restaurant - Excellent food and a drink menu that could astound even the most seasoned drinker (which I am certainly not). I loved the half portion option. My fiance and I wanted to try a few things, so ordered five small plates which will all great. I highly recommend the Short Rib Sliders! 4. Location - 15 minute walk to Hancock Tower, 15 minute walk to Millenium Park, and an inexpensive cab ride to pretty much anywhere. Perfect. ...so in case you're still unsure about staying here...BOOK IT NOW, thank me later.

Unfortunately, we cannot recommend the Palomar Chicago. We wanted a one-bedroom suite with another room with two beds. Before reserving, I called and was told they don't have these room types that connect, but that the rooms would be within a few doors of each other. We also wanted to make sure the rooms were quiet, away from the elevators, service doors, etc., especially since the kids like to sleep in. We arrived a little early and were given the suite. When we came back later to check into the other room, the room number was quite a bit different from the suite. I asked to see the diagram for the floor, and after several minutes of fumbling around, they produced one that showed that not only was the other room not close to the suite, it was around the corner from the elevators, near the closet with the ice machine, and right next to the housekeeping service room. When I recounted what I was told by reservations, they indicated that was not the case and said they have heard of others being misled the same way we were. The only other choices were a room across the hall from this one or one in a quieter location but literally as far as you could get from the suite. They offered to give us rooms which were closer, but someone would end up on a rollaway or sofabed, do we took the quietest room a long walk from the other. Very disappointing. We also brought our dog. We completed all the paperwork, and it still took three calls and a visit to the front desk just to get a (temporary) bowl so he could have water. Finally, they delivered the bed and bowls while we were out. The bed was laughably small, not even close to being adequate even though we had told them his size (and they could see him) when we checked in. We didn't bother trying to get another. We brought swimming suits with the intention of using the pool. We ended up not doing so because the water was very cloudy and not warm. The pool is also quite small and very shallow (less than four feet). The price for rooms at the Palomar is good, but we just can't get past being misled combined with the poor service we received.

The room had a figi soaking tub that was plenty big enough for two. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed that I had ever slept in. So much so that I checked out the label on the mattress, it was a selle Postropedic. We had bath robes and plenty of towels. The mini bar had a great selection and even the shampoo/conditioner was great. We had planned to stay at this hotel because we wanted a relaxing weekend away. I met my bf there who is currently working in Dallas and we rarely see each other. We splurged on the fancy room only to find out that there was a wedding reception directly below us Saturday night. It was so loud the room, bed, lights, we shaking. We could hear what people were saying and Shazam the songs from our room. It was not relaxing one bit and a total bummer. Had we had known prior that this would be the case, we would have stayed elsewhere or requested the best room they had up farther from the event. But we really wanted that bathtub. So we called down to the front desk not so much to complain but to see when the reception would be over. It still had another 2 hours left and I was not relaxing at all. We didn't want to ruin anyone's time or be \"those people\". They did offer to move us up to the 8th floor but that would have been a standard room with a double bed and moving at 10pm did not sound appealing. The manager Gad called us back and was truly apologetic. He wanted to make things right and ended up comping our second night. He also gave us great restaurant recommendations and we ended up leaving for a few hours just to get some quiet. Gad also let us have extended check out until 4 pm the next day at no charge. This was perfect since my bf flew out at 9pm. The moral of this lengthy story is that although we were really bummed about the dance party in our room, the manager went out of his way to make it right. I was SO BUMMED when it came time to leave and I have already begun looking for future dates to stay there. The pool was beautiful and the room service food (from Sable) was wonderful as well.

We didn't personally partake, but liked the concept. The space itself was lovely with burgundy chairs accented with gold ottomans. Room: Loved the room. It was a pretty big room with a large entrance that lead into the bed. The sliding door that had a mirror built in was a clever design feature that also functioned as the bathroom door. For such a large entrance, the bathroom was a little on the small side. However, the furnishings were of high quality and a nice rich color. We weren't huge fans of the wood grain marks that were on the vanity, but that is minor. Door was heavy and made of good quality materials and the walls were decently insulated. We couldn't hear much of any outside noise, save for a little bit from our neighbor. Bed was really comfortable, though the comforter could have been a little heavier. That is personal preference. Fluffy pillows that weren't too soft, so we were able to sleep like babies! The view was awesome with floor to ceiling windows, but be careful, it's pretty close to other hotels, so people can see in! Overall, we had a wonderful time here. We would have liked to stay an extra night and tried Sable, but this place really delivers on its promise as a Kimpton Hotel brand. Service was awesome, with staff looking happy and staying professional and greeting each guest as you entered through the lobby. Valet was prompt, though be forewarned, it's $48 per night with in and out privileges. However, given its close proximity to everything, we were able to walk everywhere - that is convenience! :) I would definitely recommend this place, as the location and value are great.

Because I have had a previous outstanding Kimpton experience at the Palomar Philadelphia, I figured the experience at the Chicago Palomar would be just as great. It was! This hotel is in a good location, but not necessarily in the middle of everything. The staff is smart, efficient, and gets it right. I was promptly given my hotel key and got to my amazing hotel room. The outside of the room is beautiful as well as the interior. The outside of the rooms are designed to look like your own private hotel suite. The beds are quite large and comfortable, which was probably the best part of the entire room. The bathroom is very nice and elegant; you get the feel that you are in a high-brow hotel. I was immediately in love with the bedding, as it was ultra-comfortable, and luxurious. They have the kind of beds here that you just want to lay in for days and never move. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room is very nice and pleasant. I enjoyed the $10 in free mini bar that I usually do at all Kimpton properties, plus their amazing animal bathrobes (so cute!) One thing I like about the Kimpton properties is that they have a low fat section on their menus for those that are health conscious and I have always found a good value for my money with their room service. (This is pretty hard to find!) Most hotels will leave you feeling utterly ripped off with your room service bill, but here, I find that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so bad. I ordered a burger and I could tell the woman didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand me on the phone. Her English wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great and I repeated the order to her again and again. Up came a garden burger to my room, when I ordered a real burger. I contemplated sending it back, but the thing was so deliciously made and presented with goat cheese and fixings, I just ate it! Everything there was so good. We tried to head down to the main restaurant of the Palomar, but unfortunately, it was a Saturday night and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a reservation. Because it was merely a hotel restaurant, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was going to be slammed packed and hoppin, but apparently, it was the place to be on a Saturday night in Chicago. Because of the wait and the crowds, we left, but I would recommend if you want to eat here to book yourself a reservation. Personally, I think one of nicest perks of the Kimpton properties is that you can get in room spa services performed right in the privacy of your guest room, any time you want. I took advantage of my Kimpton Rewards and got a fabulous in room massage at $30 off. My masseuse was kind, warm, and gave me a wonderful massage. Definitely budget for this experience if you select this hotel property. This was one of the major highlights of my stay in Chicago. I would describe the Palomar as hip, trendy, eclectic, hot-spot, modern, sleek, sophisticated, young, sexy, and comfortable. This is the place for you for value, good service, and nice accommodations. This is not the place for you if you favor large, grand hotels. If it was between this hotel and the Sofitel for business, I would put pick the Sofitel. For a girls weekend, or a couples weekend, the Palomar will not disappoint. I would recommend this hotel to just about anyone and would definitely return to this property again because I know I can expect a good experience.

Location is dead-center in tourist land but still convenient to the rest of the city.

Fitness room is under-outfitted but better than most hotels, for sure, and there's an indoor pool on a high floor. There is a fussiness to the art and fixtures that tries only slightly too hard but the layout in the room was great (had a corner upgrade with these extra vertical floor-to-ceiling windows on either side of the bed wall). Often, hotels like the Standard think \"funkiness\" justifies cheap outfitting or the incongruous choices that come from retrofitting an old office building into a hotel. This place had its share of laminated surfaces but it was good wenge laminate on functional well-thought out surfaces. When I can afford The Peninsula, I'll stay there. When I can't, I still value quality choices well executed at a lower price-point, not overworked nonsense designed to camouflage a lower investment by hotel operators looking to maximize profits.

I stayed at the Palomar for 2 nights for a mini staycation. I booked a King Spa room, getting a discounted rate because of my Kimpton InTouch membership. Just prior to my stay, Ashley from the Palomar emailed me to ask if I had any special requests and if it was a special occasion. I informed her that I was celebrating my birthday, and also asked for a DVD player and early check-in. I was actually unable to check in much earlier, but only because the staff was trying very hard to get me a specific room and it wasn't ready when I got there. After I told them that I would take any room, as I had to be somewhere shortly, they quickly scrambled and checked me in to a different room. The DVD player was installed and the maintenance man helpfully explained how to run the machine. They also sent up a bottle of champagne for my birthday, which was a lovely touch. The room was very spacious. I gathered with four friends in the room before going out for dinner and there was plenty of space in the sitting area. Wonderfully comfortable bed, and the room was very quiet, too (a must for me). There were lots of kids and dogs in the hotel, and there is a lot of traffic outside, but I wasn't bothered by any of it (fyi, I was on the 10th floor, so this may have helped with the noise of the traffic). Also, I LOVED the blackout curtains - made it easier to sleep in in the morning. The deep soaking tub was awesome. The room also had a large, separate shower. The wine hour is very nice; I believe this is done at all of the Kimpton hotels. The workout room was very clean and well-equiped. There is also an indoor pool, but I didn't have time to try it out. The staff was very helpful. Housekeeping was unobtrusive and thorough. I mentioned to Ashley that I was thinking of trying Yolk for brunch; she told me to tell them that I was staying at the Palomar because the hotel had preferred seating there - totally worked, we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. I read other reviews about the front desk area being chaotic, but I checked out on a Monday and did not have any problems. I really liked the location of the hotel, too - close enough to lots of shopping (another must for me) but without being right in the middle of crazy Michigan Ave. Also, there are lots of dining and bar options nearby. Side note on parking: I didn't park at the hotel, but used SpotHero.com to reserve a spot at the garage kitty-corner from the hotel. I bought 48 hours of parking for less than the cost of one day at the hotel (It was my first time using this service so I wasn't sure what to expect, but everything went smoothly). My only teeny tiny quibble during the entire weekend was with the TV remote - it had no numbers and I could only scroll through the channels in one direction. But you're not supposed to waste your vacation watching TV, so it wasn't a big deal. I've also stayed at the Palomar in DC (which is what prompted me to check out this hotel) and had a great experience there, too. I've become a big fan of the Kimpton hotels.

Rooms felt more like a nice little apartment than a hotel. They also have a complimentary wine reception and although I didn't use the indoor pool and fitness center, they looked very clean and well maintained. It's not a place where you see a lot of families with little kids running around, it's more of an adult themed type of place (which I prefer). A nice touch is that the majority of lights in the room are on dimmers.

The minibar had no gin, but it did have Grand Marnier! No coffee/tea service in room required getting dressed to get coffee, and we did not get to enjoy the wine hour, though we will next time. Pool and terrace will be great in the summer. Twenty restaurants within three blocks (really!), and this time we enjoyed Shaw's Crabhouse, a three minute walk. You can't go wrong at this property.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cI don't understand the fuss...\u201d", "Author": "Ben B", "ReviewID": "UR122416701", "Content": "When booking my Christmas stay in Chicago, I read reviews online and was thinking of staying at the Radisson Blu, the Wit, the Public, and other hotels... but I've heard a lot about the Palomar and the Kimpton brand and wanted to experience it first hand. I must have been expecting a lot, as I was really underwhelmed. The quick and short review: door man didn't open door or say hello, front desk was good (Mark), called our mobile when our room was ready for an early check in and upgraded us to a huge room. Tub jets didn't work, no big deal, but even maintenance couldn't fix the issue. Lobby was nice, but not outstanding. We don't drink at all, so the wine hour wasn't a draw. I think what got me the most was the incredibly drab design - brown and beige walls with catalog art against 1980s style carpet with brown and beige circles along with brown furnishings and pillows just made everything feel so old when I knew it was so new. No bedside power outlets added to some frustration, crawling on the floor unplugging your lamp is never a fun thing, and only makes the room darker. A huge minus for me (usually takes a star away but I don't want to give them 2 stars) was that they still use little plastic bottles for their shampoo, soap, lotion, body wash, etc... this is so wasteful, and you cannot read what the bottles are, so you have to open them and guess. For every 100 rooms a hotel has, they throw out almost 150,000 plastic bottles a year, most are still almost full, which means a lot of chemicals leaching into the groundwater supply. Another ding was that the water isn't softened... and Chicago has probably the most over-chlorinated and worst tasting water in North America, which is odd because it's next to a giant lake. Having hard water that smells like a swimming pool just makes sleeping in a dry winter climate impossible... I think it took me 2+ hours of going crazy over my skin being so dried out before I could get to sleep. All in all, these are really general issues, the hotel is \"fine\", it's not a dump, it's not bad, it's just not fantastic or exciting or memorable. If you normally stay in a chain, you'll love the perks, but if you normally seek unique, interesting boutique hotels I think you'll be really disappointed and should actually try out some of the chains in Chicago - and that's something I never say to anyone!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay\u201d", "Author": "michfamily", "ReviewID": "UR122408224", "Content": "We were traveling with our teenage daughter and her freinds and we loved the location of this hotel, the cleanliness and the value.

For starters, the hotel is ideally located close to restaurants, Michigan Avenue and the El train. There's a good mix of fancy, well-known and affordable restaurants nearby, not to mention a 7-Eleven and supermarket right across the street. We never struggled to choose somewhere to eat; the only difficult part was getting a table! The hotel was a great home base for our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the place is small enough that we never waited for an elevator and rarely heard noise from the hallways or other rooms. Our room was clean and had a good amount of storage, especially in the bathroom. Heating was easy to maintain and quiet, bed was super comfortable, and the desk had plenty of outlets to charge all of our gadgets. The hotel has valet parking, but we parked at the Hilton Garden Inn across the street. It was only $8 cheaper a night, but we're not fans of valet and this allowed us easy access to the car without waiting or tipping. One recommendation would be to join the Kimpton Loyalty program. We signed up right before making the reservation and benefited from an email letting us know of a 30% off sale, and then enjoyed free wi-fi and newspapers delivered to our room as well as $10 of minibar items. The hotel also provides complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings, which is a great way to start the day. They serve wine from 5-6pm too, but we never made it. The only minor minor minor complaints are: the bathroom counter seemed high and even at 5'6\" I felt like I had to stand on my toes when brushing my teeth to not get my shirt wet; this might be an issue for kids.

The two wines available were very tasty and at one point flatbread pizza from neighboring restaurant Sable was brought out (and it was delicious). The wine hour is served in the hotel's lobby/living room infront of an inviting fire and it was wonderful. In the morning, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate was available as well. On Christmas morning, in recognition of the fact that everything nearby was closed, the hotel set out a complimentary breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, bagels, and pastries. This was an absolute lifesaver, and has earned my eternal loyalty (it saved my sanity, as well as my parents', to be fed). The rooms are very comfortable and fairly big for a large city hotel room. Only complaints (and I advised the hotel of this in a post-stay survey) are these: the water pressure is low in the shower. This is not uncommon lately given the fad of low flow showerheads, that invariably result in low water pressure. Also, the sheets and one of the towels in my room were torn.

And we are so glad we did! My parents are big fans of the Kimpton hotel group and suggested we try out the Hotel Palomar here, as they had heard it was cool without being overly trendy and came equipped with an excellent restaurant. We heeded their suggestion and were rewarded with a truly wonderful experience. Here is all that we enjoyed: From the moment we checked we felt the kindness and attention to detail that the hotel is known for in each interaction we had. The front desk attendants were sunny and professional, welcoming us warmly (and by name) each time we entered and wishing us well each time we left. The room itself was lovely--super roomy--and had an AMAZING fuji soaking tub in the spa bathroom. (I mean seriously...this tub was amazing. We actually can't stop talking about. Like...we're going to buy a house to renovate just so we can fit one of those bathtubs into our lives. It's that good.) When they \"Restored\" the room each evening as we were out at dinner and shows, they also drew the curtains, dimmed the lights, cued the soft Christmas tunes, turned down the bed and put chocolates on the pillow. So cute! As a Kimpton In-Touch member, I had filled out a section about room preference and had noted that we preferred corner rooms if available. I also mentioned in the comments section of the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary. Not only were we placed in a lovely corner unit, but the hotel had a bottle of champagne waiting for us on our arrival! We felt way more important that we actually are...! The restaurant is great--we had breakfast one morning, and a really wonderful dessert delivered to the room after we returned from an evening at Steppenwolf one night, and both experiences were quite delicious. While we didn't venture down for cocktails this time, we certainly will on our next visit. Waiting for the elevators one evening allowed us a moment to listen to the warm buzz of music and conversation that usually makes me want to jump into a cocktail dress and have a drink...but the bathtub was calling so gently... So, next time! The best thing I can say about the Hotel Palomar is that it took what could have been just another weekend in a city we're almost too familiar with and transformed it into one of the most wonderful, relaxing, and enjoyable vacations we've ever had. We are planning our wedding for September of next year here in Chicago and this trip has us really wanting to do a block of rooms here so our friends and family can experience it is well!

We upgraded to a King Spa Suite, which is a decent sized room with a sitting area, a jetted tub for two and a separate shower. No problems with the hotel in general. It is as advertised. There's a very helpful, considerate staff, upscale interior, and high end furnishings. The room is quiet, has good heat/AC, and great black out curtains. The bed is on the firm side (which is a preference) but you can tell the mattress is well maintained and has nice bedding. The only drawbacks we encountered had to do with the bathroom. Regarding what could be fixed, our jetted tub had a malfunctioning drain stop which would not allow water to drain with the turn of the designated nob. In order to get the water to drain, you had to get your fingers to pry up the drain. A screwdriver would have helped! We told the front desk and they said they would send an engineer, but when we got back to the room things had not changed. Regarding what can't be fixed, the vanity only has one sink, and it should have two. The shower is huge for a hotel. At least 4x4 or even larger. Only problem is it has a single shower head more appropriate to a cheap motel. There should be a rain shower or at least multiple shower heads. Although two people can comfortably fit in the shower, don't try it, one of you will freeze while the other one gets the less than generous stream from the old fashioned shower head. For one person the shower is fine, but not 4star quality.

Very good, actually. But overall, the Palomar has a \"corporate\" feel. Not bad, but not as great as some of the reviews here portray. It did feel a little \"Marriott-esque\" at times. To me that is the kiss o'death. Booked a suite, but the view was of a glass-curtained building next door. Ok, moved to a spa premiere king with a better view. The room was comfortable and clean, but again, no edge just kind of corporate. Mattress was not to my liking. The bathroom was huge with a gigantic tub, but oddly the large walk in shower had a single small shower head. You had to stay right underneath the head to stay warm during your shower, negating all that space. Nothing wrong with that approach, but why spec out such a huge shower if the design includes this type of shower head? Odd. The tub was fun for one splash, but really not that practical. The gym was better than average for an urban hotel. There is nothing wrong with the Palomar. It just lacks that urban edge and vibe that I seek when traveling. Other hotels do a better job in that respect in town (ahem, one begins with a J) and I'll be back there next year. BTW, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Sable mixes a mean cocktail.

I really enjoy the location a couple blocks off Michigan and would certainly stay again. This hotel is a good niche above, imo, the chains (Marriott, Hilton), but not at level of the 5 stars. The Good: A very nice room layout with everything new and clean. Spacious bathroom with modern features and quality materials. The staff is extremely friendly and they knew our names prior to check-in. I was also pleasantly surprised by the prices in the mini-bar, which were just reasonable enough I could justify using it, and thought the room service food from sable restaurant was very good as well. They also brought a goldfish to the room for our son as our \"special treat\" for saying the secret word. Things to know: Unfortunately, our room was not ready at 3:00 PM check-in. Normally not a big deal but with the little guy after a long day and wanting to get to a dinner slightly early, it was a fairly large inconvinience. They did give us a free drink at the bar while we waited, which was nice but it was an hour delay. In addition, the breakfast room service did make a couple small errors, sandwich included bacon and no syrup with pancakes. Mistakes do happen, and they did correct rather quickly. Also, the loading area at the Valet is extremely small on a busy road (State st.) and can make entering and leaving difficult as slightly hectic. I don't want to give the wrong impression, as this hotel deserves it's ranking, and I would visit again for this price, but if you generally stay at 5 star hotels, there are a few things to know going in. For the price difference, you would expect differences, but if you forget something, the staff isn't able to go out of their way to help as they have at Trump or Elysian in the past.

The person checking me in saw on my ID that it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday. She also gave my son a card for a free in-room movie, which was nice.

I've stayed at other Kimpton hotels before and I LOVE Hotel Monacco, and I do have to say that Hotel Palomar is not as \"chic/boutique-y\" as that one, but it was nice. My daughter and I were exiting the room to check out the view from the rooftop patio when a housekeeper came and said \"I was told to bring robes\" and he had a big pile of animal-print robes, as well as a fish in the cute little fish bowl. The view is nice from the deck, and the pool is small but sharp...I am sure it is awesome up there in the summer! We had fun at the parade and came back to the hotel, where they had warm cookies and hot cocoa in the lobby. I know they have a wine hour with flatbreads, but we missed that. We went up to our room and discovered that Bobby, the concierge, had left a bottle of wine, a card and a tray of treats for my birthday, which included chocolate-covered espresso beans, my very favorite. Nice! The beds were super-comfortable, lots of pillows and goose down. In the morning, they had good coffee and more hot cocoa and tea in the lobby. Though the hotel was packed, I can tell you that it is SILENT. Tons of kids, but I could not hear them. My own two enjoyed swimming with a view of the skyline. Hotel Palomar's staff is super-friendly and professional and I just like the small nice-nice things they do at Kimpton hotels, but I have to say I really like the \"meditation stations\" at Hotel Monocco, though the Palomar is just steps off Michigan Avenue. The whole operations strikes me as a place where there is a motivated staff that likes their jobs and wants to please their guests.

It is a funny hotel, being one of those converted apartment blocks that still has some existing tenants. We had city view room on the top floor which was nicely styled and looked very new, with comfortable beds, nice flat screen tv, neat but small bathroom (poor shower in bath though). We could smell cooking smells in our room which was a bit strange as restaurant too far below to be the cause - assume it was one of the apartments in the building that are alongside hotel rooms. The pool looks good but is 3' 6\" deep throughout so you can't really swim. Nice rooftop terrace adjoining the pool and the fitness room is good. Hardly any staff here and this area seems to be self service. The hotel lacks atmosphere which it might get from a good bar - the ground floor area is more of a lounge with no bar and the restaurant is tucked away at the back of the ground floor. Staff were helpful BUT when asked to recommend restaurants there was a really uncool emphasis on giving us a token for a pizza place that had our name on it and would give us a free bruschetta but for which we had to wait for the desk staff to add their name to the token - to get their kickback we assume. In fairness, it was one of the three main deep pan pizza places in the books but this coupled with their lack of knowledge of cool / new / interesting places put us off (one steak house next door being all they could think of in spite of an amazing Italian a block away - Osteria via Stato). The final annoyance was that the valet parking was not clearly priced and was a rip off - it said 24 hours for $49. What they don't mention is that if you arrive at 6pm and leave 2 days later at 4pm you get charged for three days. When we checked out at 12 they charged us for 2 days and only mentioned this extra charge when we came back for the car insisting that if it was after 2 we would have to pay another $20 minimum. Apparently it's standard practice in Chicago - valet guys said hotel governed prices, hotel said valet company did. We didn't care who set the prices but nobody made this clear to us at the start so it was a ripoff tactic. Either way, $112 for 48 hours parking is over the odds in Chicago. All in all, nice rooms but not a proper hotel and some very dodgy practices going on here - wonder if Kimpton support this kind of thing at their other hotels?", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFirst chicago trip\u201d", "Author": "yayatraveldiva", "ReviewID": "UR118569622", "Content": "I really enjoyed staying in this hotel.

In general it is a great hotel their accommodations are well appointed, the lobby/living room are really confortable and beautiful. The restaurant is fine and the fitness room has all the equipment that you might need to exercise. The staff in general is nice and helpful. But not everything is great at Palomar. It has some downsides. The first down side was that upon our arrival no body helped us with our luggage. My husband and I had to carry our bags from the cab to our room because nobody offered us any kind of help. In fact the person in charge of the valet parking was really rude to my husband, when he approach to him to ask him for help he just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to answer. One of the door mans (usually there were two of them) was helping other guests to put their luggage in a taxi and ones he finished he never offered to help us with ours. The check-in process was really quick. And the people in the reception were really nice. We are from Mexico and one of the guys at the front desk always spoke to us in Spanish. Our room was a King spa premier room. And I must say that I strongly recommend this room. We previously stayed in the Hotel Palomar at San Francisco and stayed in a King deluxe room which is a little small. But this room the spa premier has the perfect size. The sitting room is really confortable and spacious, and the bath is perfect. The other down side is that it is really crowded for a boutique hotel. And as a boutique hotel we expected to be a little more exclusive. One our first day we went up to see the pool and the terrace and there was a group of 8 guys that were having beers in the terrace as if they were spring breakers in a cheap hotel. The whole scene was tacky. And honestly that is not what you want to see when you are staying in a $300 dls night hotel. As for the restaurant we only had breakfast in both the restaurant facilities and in our room. It was fine and maybe I would had said it was great but unfortunately on our last day the room service toke more than 30 min and ones our order was delivered in our room I realized they had my order all wrong, and when I called the room service phone line the lady at the phone was really rude and nothing helpful, she told me that if I wanted my correct order I would have to wait for another 20 min. It was ridicules if you take into account that my order was only yogurt with berries. And it was their mistake. In general I will have to say that the Palomar is Ok, their location is great, and the room that we stayed on was really comfortable. The staff is almost always willing to help, but as I said they can work a little bit more in this area. And it has some amenities that gives the hotel some points for example the complementary wine hour from 5 to 6 pm.

The room service was FAR better than your average hotel - while the prices are just as outrageous as any room service at a high-end hotel, the food actually tastes worth it, which is a nice change. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite, which was quite spacious, with a fantastic bathroom with a separate shower and two-person deep jacuzzi tub, a living room and a separate bedroom in the back. Perfect. Not sure how it compares to a regular room, but the suite was absolutely great. Every time we hung the \"restore\" sign on our room and left for a while, the room had always been cleaned when we got back, even if we weren't gone very long.

It had a nice sized living room, connecting hallway (where the bathroom was) and a huge bedroom. The living room had a pull out couch where my daughter slept - she wasn't too thrilled with the mattress (you could feel the springs in the mattress). In hindsight, we should have requested a roll away bed (just a heads up to anyone utilizing the pull out couch). The bathroom was very large with a big walk-in shower and a jacuzzi. We were supplied with shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, as well as some animal print robes. The bathroom had plenty of counter space and the living room and bedroom had drawer space and there were closets in the living room and the hallway. There was plenty of room to store all your things so there was no need to be tripping over suitcases, etc. Everything was immaculately clean and in good condition. One very small picky complaint would be that they could have left more soap for the shower once they saw how thin it had gotten - however, my daughter tells me I always have that complaint so maybe it's just my pet peeve. Enough about the room - the staff was wonderful. Front desk always smiled and greeted you. Employees at the door were always there to hold the door and ask if you needed directions, a cab or advice on where to go - a great group of guys! Every evening at 5:00, there's a free cocktail hour in the \"Living Room\" where they serve wine, sangria and a sampling of their War of the Roses cocktail as well as flat bread pizza. In the morning, there's free coffe and tea (both hot and iced); and there was always a supply of lemon infused water in the afternoon (which was great since it was very hot while we were there). Gym and pool are on the 17th floor along with a terrace where you can just sit and be amazed at the buildings all around you - Chicago has some great architecture (take an architecture cruise to really appreciate it all - we did one at night and it was spectacular). We're from New York City and were still in awe of the buildings in Chicago. Location is perfect - there are restaurants and stores all over. We were 2 blocks from Michigan Avenue; around the corner from the free Navy Pier shuttle, a few blocks from the theater district and about a 10 minute walk to Millenium Park. The red line train station is on the corner and it was only 3 stops to the Willis Building where you can go to the observatory and stand on the glass enclosed ledges of the Sky Deck -- very cool! There's also a very good grocery store on the next block across the street. Good to buy some things to keep in the room - liquor, cold drinks, snacks - even bought fresh rolls and pastries in the morning for breakfast in the room. It's also very easy to get to and from the airport. Since this was our first time in Chicago, we were hesitant to take the train from the airport since we didn't know the area yet and didn't want the hassle of figuring it out. We took a taxi which cost $42 ($50 with tip for three of us). After getting familiar with the train during our stay, we decided to take it to the airport and it was no problem. You need to take the Blue Line but can transfer from the Red Line very easily ($2.25 per person so $6.75 vs. $50 - next time we'll take the train to the hotel also). Since we had an evening flight, we checked out and the hotel stored our bags until we left. Upon leaving, I noticed the concierge was checking a flight for someone and printed her boarding passes for the next day, so I asked for the same service and he happily obliged -- checked us in for our flight and printed our boarding passes -- loved that service -- saved us time at the airport.

The room was clean, modern and inviting with a GREAT bed. We opted a higher floor room. Ours was on the 16th floor below, we later learned, the fitness center.

We had a difficult time finding someone willing to wait on us. Once we got the attention of the server, however, he was quite attentive. When we visited later, the bar was full and energetic. A fun night spot. The nightly hosted wine reception was crowded, but service was fast and the wine tasty. Breakfast in the restaurant was great. We suggest joining the hotel loyalty program as it carries perk including a mini bar credit, newpaper and wifi. We have long been wedded to staying at the Sofitel when enjoying a weekend in Chicago.

The hotel opened in March 2010 and the staff is meticulous with the upkeep of the hotel. The cleanliness of the hotel is a non-issue. The most important things that need to be mentioned are: hotel location, parking, staff responsiveness, fresco deck, pool and room size. The hotel is located in downtown Chicago. However, Chicago is not the most walkable city. Although, the hotel is on State Street is not particularly close to Michigan Ave./Water Tower Place. If shopping is your top priority, stay at a hotel on Michigan Ave. The Hotel Palomar is conveniently located next to a free trolley to Navy Pier (a tourist trap) and many outstanding restaurants. The price of parking blew my socks off. It's $46 a day with unlimited in and out privileges. It's also MANDATORY. In Toronto, parking at a hotel of this caliber is $25-35 a day with in and out privileges. So I'm not just being cheap! Also, taking cabs in Chicago is much cheaper many other cities. The base rate is just $2.25. During our stay we never paid more than $11 for a cab. So it's worth not bringing your car. I would strongly recommend not taking the CTA. It's not safe. When we used it mid-day on a the blue line, they wouldn't stop at some stations due to \"police activity\". The staff was always friendly and polite. My only complaint is that it took forever to have something delivered to the room. I sometimes would wait 10 minutes. I hope the slow elevators had something to do with it. We loved using the fresco deck and pool during our stay. It's one of the reasons we picked this hotel. It's a great place to go sunbathing! It's heavenly to have room service deliver and eat breakfast there while viewing the city! It's a memory I'll never forget! When staying at this hotel definitely opt for a corner room. I had to book a deluxe queen, because we desperately needed two beds. Our corner room was a bit small, I was told that corner rooms are much bigger than the regular rooms. So requesting a corner room is a must! Over all we had a great stay. I definitely will be back. Just a bit annoyed an extra $200 was tacked on to the bill for parking.

As stated in previous reviews,hotel rooms are hotel rooms and even though some are much nicer than others if you vacation like us (walk and visit the sites all day and have a nice dinner and enjoy the nightlife of a city each evening) then what will really make the hotel experience stand out is its attention to service. Upon arrival we did valet (expensive) and checked in at front desk. Unfortunately the welcome was not the greatest. When we check in to any of our hotels we have a lot of excitement and come in with smiles and ready to engage with the staff. Our greeting was very cold. That being said the other staff seemed nice with their guests. As Kimpton reward members we mentioned the password for the month. Now, this is an extra perk and without it we still would stay at the Kimpton but it is nice. Our reward was milk and cookies which is a real shame since our kids get that from the front desk staff free regardless during most of our stays. We then proceeded to our room which was nice. We have come to expect comfortable and well appointed rooms with Kimptons and that is always met. We immediately began our vacation and looked forward to seeing waht Chicago had to offer. The location is perfect to do Michigan Ave and the shops. Chicago may be a walkable city according to some travel sites but prepare to walk a lot. Otherwise the water taxi, bus, cab or el train is available but can become costly time and money wise for a family of 4. Chicago has some great neighborhoods like Wrigleyville Licoln Park area or Andersonville but if you drive you risk traffic on Lakeshore which can be frustrating on vacation and even more ridiculous parking costs. A free trolley also exists for Navy Pier although every time we tried to catch it it seemed to be full and go past the stop so we just walked. The weather was spectacular during our stay so not a problem. When we would return rarely was there a doorman or valet to open the door. Again not a necessity maybe a luxury but service none the less especially when paying over $200 a night plus parking. We did attend the wine hour at night and you cannot go wrong with free wine but the mixed drink or sangria that was offered was not that good and if it reflects their restaurant it actually made us stay away at night when we would maybe go to the bar and order something to end the day on. The pizza appetizers brought around the room were great though. The following morning we went for the coffee offered and unfortunately none of the regular coffee was replenished. We waited for 10 minutes to see if anyone would come but noone did. The ice coffee area needed to be cleaned a little and also replenished. We just headed on our way and purchased our own coffee on Michigan Ave while we shopped. We then checked out by the same person who checked us in and headed to our next Kimpton, the Allegro. The trip to Chicago was prompted by the fact it had some Kimpton hotels available. Anyone can find something wrong with any experience and unfortunately we ultimately weigh our final review on how well we were treated by the staff and would we return. Before I have even left town I usually have a list of things I want to do when I return but the Kimpton didn't really do anything for me in wanting to come back. I would recommend that when staying in Chicago to take your chances with Priceline instead and you may get this hotel or another of 4 star status at a fraction of the cost. You then can use the savings on parking, transportation, or shopping. We have just a few Kimptons left that we want to try on the East Coast so our fingers are crossed that they will meet our expectations as the first ones did that started this craziness of staying at as many of them as possible.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cGreat view and excellent location!\u201d", "Author": "LizCincinnatiOH", "ReviewID": "UR117125208", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here on July 5th after the U2 concert with another couple.

And, that is unfortunate, because there are simple things that could be done to make things much more sustainable. I am not an extreme \"tree-hugger\" or something of the like, but I do feel that Kimpton is (knowingly or unknowingly) sending the message that it is exceptional in this arena, when really the hotel needs to do more: - When we arrived in our hotel room, the air conditioner was blasting! It was set at 68 degrees. - When we arrived home each night, 4 lights had been turned on by the nightstaff as part of the turndown. The room wasn't even dark with all the city lights coming in! - Our towels were replaced on day 2, despite our telling the staff that they were fine. - Leaving the hotel in the morning, the doorman offers plastic bottles of water. Why? Why not set up a large pitcher of filtered water as they do at other Kimpton properties? - Our travel size shampoo and conditioner were replaced each day whether or not they were empty.

The valet parking worked like a charm, which is more than we can say for some hotels we've stayed at. The staff at the hotel are marvellous.

From the check-in person to the wine service in the afternoon to the bell man outside, employees are trying to please. I have one suggestion for the hotel and to Kimpton properties in general. Instead of just coffee service, throw in some pastries or donuts in the morning. That way those people who can go light will have satisfactory breakfast and those who want heavier breakfast will head to the Sable restaurant, which I found perfectly adequate. I would rather have a coffee machine in the room than going downstairs just to pick up a cup of coffee. If I can picke up a pastry or two, it might be ok.

One distraction is that State St is under a lot of construction near the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t easy to walk right there and traffic can be bad, but the bell hop was always able to get us a taxi in less than 1 min. There is a 7-11 right next door and a starbucks in a hotel down the block. So easy to get your bottled water or morning coffee if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want room service.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cgreat location but just okay\u201d", "Author": "amybdetroit", "ReviewID": "UR105373776", "Content": "Great location! The Thai restaurant across the street (I believe it was called Star of Siam) is really great. Walking distance to shopping and House of Blues. The room wasn't very large but we didn't spend a lot of time in it anyway. We enjoyed the wine reception in the living room area; quite a nice touch. We even met some other guests who were from our area. The young man at the door, who always wore his own stylish hat, was so friendly and personable! Now here are the cons. My husband and I have stayed at the Conrad and never heard as many sirens and fire trucks as we heard at this hotel. So I'm wondering if it's just in a pathway emergency vehicles take often or if the windows aren't as sound proof. We were disappointed our room did not have a coffee maker. We had to go to the living room area to get our coffee if we wanted it. Service at this hotel was inconsistent. The desk was run by young 20somethings and most of the time when walking past you wouldn't get a greeting. There were typically 4 employees at the front desk so it wasn't that they were too busy. When checking in it seemed I was bothering them. Strange behavior for such a highly rated hotel. The hotel's restaurant bar was very understaffed. There was one bartender and when we walked in we were not greeting by either the hostess or the bartender. We sat at a table in the bar for 10 minutes before finally leaving. Again, nothing was said to us. I'm a very friendly customer so do not miscontrue this review as me being demanding and snooty. I wasn't too upset about all of this because if you aren't happy with a place there are dozens you can try. However, I know for the price I do expect a few things that were missing and I won't stay here again. As my husband put it, \"it's just missing something.\" Definitely warmth for one.

With all the traveling that we have done I can honestly say that there are only 2 hotels that have surpassed service expectations for me - one is in NYC - the other is the Palomar in Chicago. Before we even arrived the Palomar was at our service asking if we were celebrating anything in particular. I told them that we were in fact celebrating a couple of milestones and when we came back up from the first wine reception there was a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us. Since our flight arrived at 11:00 I had asked for an early check in if available. We had a beautiful one bedroom suite and it was ready for us when we got to the hotel at noon. Reservations at a popular restaurant were made for us on the spot at the front desk as well as directions on which line on the transit system to use to reach different destinations. The room was spotless - the soaking tub was awesome ! We met quite a few interesting fellow travelers at the wine reception every night. The location was perfect - I overheard another couple comment on the great location at the wine reception which opened up a line of communication between our tables and we ended up meeting some very interesting people. There was a huge Jewel OSCO outlet just up the street where you could buy groceries of all kinds and a great selection of wine. The subway was just steps away as well. The only thing - as another reviewer pointed out that came in very handy to me was .... bring your own shower cap - for some reason it is not included in their toiletries - perhaps if you requested one they would supply one. There are also a lot of great restaurants close by - The Weber Grill is just across the street and there is a Chili's just down the street - as well as the hotels own restaurant. The General Manager - Nabil - was a fantastic host and made everyone feel special and welcomed. There is no doubt that future stays in Chicago will be at the Palomar - why risk disappointment anywhere else?

So I did some heavy duty research online for hotels in Chicago prior to booking this and by the sounds of everything I read this was my best option. Well Hotel Palomar did not disappoint. This was truly my best travel experience thus far; and I have travelled quite a bit. First, I had called the night before to say that we were travelling for my sister and my cousin's 40th birthday and to see if we could possibly get an upgrade. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Colin whom helped us out of our cab; he was awesome, super friendly and helpful. Then at the front desk we met Jessica whom was equally as friendly. Although an upgrade wasn't available we were welcomed in our room with a birtdhay note and a bottle of wine for the girls to celebrate. This was an upexpected touch that made a huge difference. The room itself was small but comfortable and very, very clean. We had an amazing view being that we were in a corner room and the corner was floor to ceiling window. The wine reception daily was amazing. The pizza was the best I have ever had which gave me cravings for pizza the entire weekend. Our last day there we decided that we wanted to do something special like go to the hockey game and so we were introduced to Charles, the hotel concierge. He was amazing and was able to get us 4 seats together for a Playoff hockey game at an amazing price. When we were leaving the next morning we had been give a personalized note from Colin that was very sweet. There isn't a single thing that I could complain about, the hotel was amazing and I will now look for Kimpton's no matter where I am travelling too. I just hope that they can live up to the standard that Hotel Palomar set.

Several of us dined at Sable Kitchen for dinner, breakfast and for cocktails in the bar one evening. I didn't think the breakfast menu was anything special - my colleague's oatmeal was watery and my omelet run of the mill. You can probably do better at the Weber Grill or EATT just a block or two away. However, the bar service (Katie) was excellent with a wide variety of interesting cocktails. In the morning, there's a very large room set up in the main lobby area with free coffee and lots of newspapers, bigger than many other Kimpton reception areas. It was painless to get taxis even with some minor street constructions and a town car option was indeed the same price as a taxi when offered up - with far better service.

Official check in was at 3 pm, but we arrived a little before then (2:30) thanks to missing traffic into town. State Street is undergoing reservations so due to some road construction the hotel's entrance is slightly obstructed, but from the moment we pulled in we had a fabulous stay. The bellmen were all super friendly and cracking jokes with us while they unloaded the multitude of luggage that 5 girls can pack. We were escorted to the desk and upon check in were told that we had been upgraded to a Luxury One Bedroom Suite instead of the traditional one bedroom suite that we had booked. We were in our room within 15 minutes of pulling into the entrance. We required a rollaway bed, and that was brought up about a half hour after getting into our room. Our room was super swanky and the bathtub had us all drooling (alas, due to the nature of the trip no one got to enjoy it.) We had requested a bottle of champagne as this was a Bachlorette getaway weekend and that arrived shortly after the rollaway. Upon check out we learned that the hotel had \"treated\" us to that as well, as it was not listed on our bill! We missed the wine hour as we were busy getting ready to go out. We spoke to both of the concierge's and they were both friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants and bars not only in the neighborhood, but in different neighborhoods in the city. Upon our 4 am arrival with two gigantic bags of McDonald's and 5 rather silly girls, we weren't met with disdain but rather a look of \"glad you ladies are having fun!\" They were booked to capacity on Friday so were not able to accomdate our request for an extra blanket, but the next day it was in our room after it had been cleaned, as were extra towels that we had forgotten to request. We did not make the coffee bar on Saturday morning as we had slept through it, but the bellman was able to point us to two Starbucks within a two block radius. He even was quick to point out that one was \"fast\" while the other had a better \"quality\" product! Which as an avid Starbucks drinker, I appreciate. Saturday afternoon we did make the wine and appetizer hour which was delightful, if not a wee bit crowded. But there was a wedding in the hotel that day, and of course it was a Saturday. Again the concierge was beyond helpful in new suggestions for the evening's activities. Upon departure for our night in Wrigleyville we decided we wanted the SUV cab instead of a normal cab as there were 5 of us. And the same bellhop from our Friday check in literally spent 10 minutes in the street trying to wave down a SUV cab that was not on a run already. It may seem small, but that gesture meant a lot to us! Upon our arrival back at the hotel in the wee hours of the morning, we came across a waiter who had just finished working at Sable. Sable was closed, but he recommended a couple of places down the block that were just the ticket at that time in the morning. Sunday's departure was painless and fast....from the time I gave the bellman our parking ticket to when the car showed up was a grand total of MAYBE 10 minutes.

Plus, I'm not sure when turn-down service comes around, but I only managed to receive it ONCE during my stay, at 8:55pm. I had a comfortable corner room on the 7th floor. Unfortunately, I found that being on the 7th floor is too close to the street level, so I was constantly awakened by emergency vehicle sirens (I guess there is a fire station close by). Next time, I will request a higher floor. The beds are very comfortable, and the rooms are well-appointed with free wifi and large, flat-screen TVs. The fitness center is also very well-equipped for a hotel fitness center, with dumbbells, cable weights and several cardio machines. There was even a bowl of apples in the fitness center! I noticed that there were free bottles of water and towels placed near the front entrance to the hotel. The free coffee/tea in the morning and wine in the evening were nice touches. Upon the recommendation of a friend of mine, I dined at Sable, the restaurant attached to the hotel. Unfortunately, there was a group event at the restaurant's bar, which made my dining experience rather unpleasant (the noise that reached the dining room from the bar was unbearable). The food was good, but took a long time between dishes - it was definitely one of the slowest solo dining experiences I've ever had. The wait staff was VERY pleasant and attentive, though. I did encounter one problem during my stay, which was not resolved to my satisfaction - the guest account folio on my TV was not showing the room charges and taxes correctly (the dollar amounts were not showing up, only the cents). When I reported the issue to the front desk, they sent an engineer to look at it while I was at dinner. When I returned, the engineer had left a note in my room, explaining that I should wait about 10 seconds for the folio to load. He didn't even notice that the amounts were completely wrong. So, I took a photo of the screen and brought it back down to the front desk to show them the problem. She offered to send another engineer up, but since it was already 11pm, I declined. Overall, though, I still recommend this hotel. It's much newer than the Allegro, and the rooms are nicer. But the staff could use a little more training in customer service. In my previous stays at the Allegro, I was ALWAYS greeted by the doorman with a cheery \"welcome back!\"", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cEverything we needed\u201d", "Author": "PerryM", "ReviewID": "UR101103867", "Content": "Just spent five days at this great hotel.

You can't ask for anything better when you're carrying your luggage. Even though we arrived at about noon, they had a room ready and let us go ahead and check in. I think that's a really nice touch.

It was fine for just the two of us, but you may want to upgrade if you have more than two people in your room. We asked for directions many times, and we were always given great service and accurate information. The hotel's central location made it easy for us to walk to the Navy Pier, Hancock Tower, shops on Michigan Avenue and State Street. And with the El stop being right outside and the weather being rather cold, we took it a few times just to get out of the elements. No problems at all! The complementary wine in the evenings was really good. It did get quite crowded. One night we had our wine in the lobby, and the next night we just took it to our room.

During our three day stay he was a wealth of knowledge about directions and restraunts in the area. Front desk personnel very helpful and knowledgeable with recommendations for restraunts and even a small chocolate company we had heard of. . Room: Extreamly clean and comfortable. All the amentites you would expect. Price was very reasonable considering what you get. . Hotel personnel: Extremely helpful and pleasent. Even when you are in the elevator going to your room if a staff member is on it they ask if you were enjoying your stay and if you needed anything. . Lounge: Personnel very friendly. Small and cozy. They serve wine and snacks each night. The wine was above average. The pizze was average. Papers and coffee every morning. Each morning they had bottled water iced down at the door for the runners. . Restraunt and bar: Very friendly and fast. We had breakfast and dinner their and service was great. We tried to have dinner there a second night but they were full. The receptionist and even the head cook tried to figure a way to fit us in but when they couldn't they recommended a restraunt for us. The prices were very reasonable. Breakfast was $11.00 for eggs, potatos, bacon, toast. Dinner menu is a little different than you would expect. They have a large selection of entries you can order from (meats, fruit, cheese, etc.) You pick which ones you want as you go along. . In the area: As stated it is only two blocks from Michigan avenue. Lots of good restraunts. Hotel recommeded Bennys Chop House and Shaws Crab House. Both were excellent. There is a 7 Eleven next door were you can get snacks, coffee, etc and an excellent restraunt one block down called \"Eatt\". We had breakfast there on morning. The area appears to be very safe. Lots of people walking around at night. There is some construction on State Street in front of the hotel but it didn't bother us or our ability to get a taxi. . Parking: $46.00 per night.

Especially the pool, which is heated yet surrounded by glass windows so it brings the outdoors into it. It's a great lap-pool\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot big enough to lounge in, which is perfect in winter since no one else thought of swimming! 4) Great restaurant.

Bathroom was a little small, but nicely appointed.

We rushed back after having drinks and then jumped into our suits. It was about 10:15 and someone was cleaning it and told us they close the pool at 10. This seemed a little early to us. Our biggest issue with the hotel was on our last day. Since we had taken the train into the city and it didn't leave until 4 PM, we checked our bags with the bellhop. We each had a black carry-on size bag and some shopping bags. We returned to pick up our bags and the bellhop (not the one who checked in our bags) said he could only find one bag and our shopping bags. He asked us to come back into the room to see if we could find it. We noticed the bags were all over in a haphazard manner and not really neatly put together. After frantically checking around (we had a train to catch), we had to leave. Of course, the bag that came up missing was my bag-which contained a slew of new clothes, riding boots, new shoes, makeup, jewelry and other expensive items. Although the guest services manager has been assisting me with attempting to locate it and has followed up with an insurance claim, the actual hotel manager has never contacted me to apologize for this mess up.

We called the Palomar from the train to let them know we were coming back for our keys and inquired if there was any way at all that someone from the hotel could meet us at the train so that we could make the 10-minute window. The staff at the Palomar didn't hesitate! When we arrived back in Chicago, their head of guest services was waiting for us on the platform, with keys in hand and the information we needed to catch our train back. Thanks to their outstanding service, even our most unfortunate error turned into a positive, and as a family we will be able to laugh at ourselves and remember even the end of this trip fondly for years to come. We can't thank the Hotel Palomar enough!!", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cMemorable Winter Getaway in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "UWSider", "ReviewID": "UR89881543", "Content": "The beauty and service of this hotel set the high level of satisfaction.

Per my request, the portable crib was already set up and waiting in our room upon check-in. They'd included a little blanket with the crib, too, which was handy since I hadn't brought one. Had no trouble checking in a few hours early, which was much appreciated before our excursions around town. As a member of the Kimpton In Touch program, we enjoyed a few perks such as a loaner bag of yoga paraphernalia (mat, blocks, complimentary water bottles), free internet access, my preferred paper (NYTimes) in the a.m., and complimentary mini bar snacks up to $10. These were admittedly little things, but they go a long way towards making one feel welcome. We swam in the pool (not very big or deep, but sufficiently large to get some exercise in) and I liked that the room didn't reek of chlorine and wasn't overly steamy. The pool is located on the top floor (17th) with fantastic views of the surrounding cityscape. We partook in the 'wine hour' and thought it a nice touch that they served mulled apple cider as a non-alcoholic/kiddy offering. Staff was very young and energetic. One of the front-door guys was exuberant and welcoming each time we arrived while another guy we saw towards the end of our stay was more reticent and stoic. Late one night, I called up the front desk to ask if I could purchase a bottle of contact lens solution since ours had leaked in our travel case and was depleted; not only did they have one on hand, they even found someone to run it right up to our room (and he left as quickly as he'd arrived, before I could hand him a tip). Late one night, we sat in the small lobby area in front of the gas fireplace, catching up on the day's papers, and enjoyed listening to the driving, techno beats over the sound system (which wasn't playing overly loud, mind you). That's one indication of the hotel's hip, modern vibe - no Muzak here. One morning we asked the front desk for brunch recommendations and they told us about Eggsperience nearby - a terrific place we'd love to visit the next time we're in town. The only confounding thing we encountered during our stay was that the closet door in our room was sort of stuck or a bit harder to open. So much so that I initially thought it was locked or was a connecting door of some sort. My husband and I did think it strange, then, when we believed there wasn't a closet in the room, but we put it down to the quirks of a boutique hotel. Needless to say, when we were finally clued in that that door was, indeed, the closet (complete with animal print robes, ironing board, iron) we thought it hilarious and were relieved. Overall, we had a wonderful stay. It was our first time at a Kimpton hotel but it definitely won't be our last. Will probably now seek them out as a preferred place to stay (given the right price, of course).

The staff we met were professional and friendly. We arrived at about 1pm and were able to get a room right away, which was nice because we'd come in via public transit - inexpensive and super-convenient (we exited Grand station on the Red line just steps from the hotel entrance) but about a 40 min trip which wore the kids out a bit (suggestion: bring something to do on the train!) We were greeted at reception with complimentary loot bags and vouchers for cookies and milk for the kids - the kids loved the little toys and the bedtime snack! And as a Kimpton member we also received a complimentary 'raid the mini-bar' voucher for up to 2 items and limit of $10, which the kids also enjoyed - orange juice and gummy bears! The room was on one of the conference floor levels (5) but it was quiet with only the odd ambulance siren at night (which didn't bother us much and which the kids slept through). We found it be a good-sized room, very new and clean, with 2 comfy queen beds. Our view wasn't great, looked out onto Illinois St, but we didn't care - view wasn't a top priority for us. The hotel was a great location for us, one bus and a few minutes to Navy Pier, a few blocks to North Michigan Avenue for the Christmas parade, and a straightforward trip to the museums. Special thanks to the hotel for accepting an item I had purchased online and had delivered there a day before we arrived. I had notified them in advance and it was a stress-free experience. My hubby loved the hard-to-find-in-Canada gift. We didn't attend the complimentary wine tastings but did enjoy the hot chocolate and apple cider in the lobby, complete with marshmallows, chocolate chips and cinnamon sticks - delicious!

I've stayed at this hotel for business twice. The other time was last year in 2009. The hotel is still brand new. It is right next to the American Medical Association (State and Grand). I had a meeting there, and the AMA booked our rooms. There were at least 7 rooms booked for those that came from out of town for the meeting, but for some reason my reservation did not have \"an account\" to charge the room to. I had the issue both checking in and figured they would fix this upon check out. That was not the case. They said they would call and find out when I checked out. I left them my cell number, and within the hour I called the front desk to give them a contact name who reserved the rooms for us. It seemed all would be settled, but upon checking online I found they indeed charged my credit card. I guess they didn't follow through to get this resolved properly. That is the impression I got, at least. You can take the train from O'Hare ($2.25) by taking the blue line and transferring at the loop (Jackson stop) to the red line. Get off at Grand and you can see the hotel (1-2 min walk). It takes nearly an hour to take the train though. A cab from the hotel to the airport will run almost $40 without tip. The room offers L'Occitane shampoo, conditioner & body lotion (no body wash), but of course they have soap bars. They also stock cotton balls and qtips. The bathroom is immaculate, but that is also due to the hotel still being pretty new. The door is a slide door which is a full length mirror itself. They have an umbrella in the closet that you can borrow if needed as well as robes you can wear. My room looked out to the main street so the sirens from a police car or ambulance can be heard. If you sign up on their website for some loyalty program, you can get free internet access which is really nice. They also have a complimentary wine hour in the lobby (did not partake in).

Unfortunately, the trip did not live up to expectations. A few days before the trip, I received an email from the concierge asking us whether we were celebrating anything special and if we needed any services (e.g. restaurant reservations, etc.) I responded that I was with my best friend celebrating our mutual 40th birthdays and that we would like reservations at a particular restaurant. I did not hear back before my arrival but assumed that something would be communicated when checking in. At check in, we were told that we could have a corner room on the 5th floor (with the benefits of windows on both sides of the room) or a room higher up. We chose the room with more windows and were disappointed when we arrived on the 5th floor to see that it was the same floor as the conference center where an event had taken place earlier in the day - something that we were not informed of. The floor was not clean, with linens, empty glasses, etc. strewn about.. We then called down to the front desk to ask about our reservations to the requested resaurant to learn that there was nothing on record regarding our request. Why send such an email if it will just be ignored? The room was indeed on the corner, but not with enough windows to make up for the fact that we shared it with a conference floor, and there were cigarette butts and a dirty rag on the ledge outside our room door. To make matters worse, there was not an actual bathroom door, but a sliding door to the bathroom, which did not shut all the way. OK because we were best friends, but would have been most uncomforable if I had been with a significant other. We visited the bar downstairs (Sable) for a drink, and had a very unpleasant bartender - a rude bald man with a beard who basically ignored us. Luckily, a nice female bartender took pity on us and took our order.

For metro users is right on Grand and Red \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In summer there is a free trolley bus that passes the side of the hotel down to the Navy Pier for all its attractions. On arriving, its not apparent that the car Valet is on State Street as you can see the hotel approaching down Illinois and that you drive under the porch- not just sit on the road. Us English people may not be used to it! For those bits and bobs there is a huge supermarket on the next block open till 11 every night- including Sunday. The room was great, large king bed, flat screen TV, desk, free internet if you become a friend of Kimpton before you go and once there you can put all your devices on like your i phone and laptop.

The staff are friendly, special mention to David on valet who was chatty and knowledgeable about the city- good with advice and directions as was the stunningly handsome Patrick, always there with a smile to greet you and knowledge of the local facilities. There are the usual Kimpton things, wine at 5 hosted by staff , coffee at breakfast- although I have to say the coffee was grainy and not too nice! The hotel holds weddings and events and the only negative really was the at weekend when the hotel was really busy and getting the car out of valet took 30 minutes standing about despite phoning down 10 mins ahead- the message hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got through to the guys at the valet- not enough staff!

Last point on how to save on WiFi: Wifi is free if you sign up for a Kimpton In-Touch account before coming. Then use the email address you used when logging in for the first time.

We also tried the bar/restaurant attached to the hotel--very good food and drinks in a fun environment, with many locals there for the bar. Maybe the only criticism I have is that the pool is sort of small and in a funny steamy room; when we tried to go it was taken up by one large rambunctious famly, and we felt there wasn't room for us.

We didn't get to sample the wine unfortunately, but both morning took advantage of the coffee. It is really a nice touch. They even had iced coffee, as well as Mighty Leaf Tea (read: great tea). In between the coffee and wine, they served homemade lemonade and iced tea - fabulous! I also have to give the hotel's restaurant, Sable, massive kudos. We ate there our second night. By the end we wished we had eaten there the first. The cocktails are absolutely out of this world, and the food was amazing. Service was also fantastic, and the prices are completely reasonable. My only gripe is that the dining area was as cold as a refrigerator, so we sat in the (equally nice) bar area instead. I'll end with this: I've stayed in several Chicago hotels at similar price points. No other hotel comes remotely close to the Hotel Palomar.

I had asked by email if we could get a roll-out bed for my 20 year old daughter so that we can all share the same room. I was told that the room would probably be a bit cramped, so when offered a junior suite upgrade for $100 extra per night I thought I would go for it and get something really special for myself, wife and daughter for their first trip to Chicago. The suite was 'OK', the safe gave me problems from start to finish. They sent an engineer 3 times, who supposedly had fixed the safe each time, but no it was still not working. Finally the guy today fixed it after offering me a replacement safe - on our last day of the stay. Too late my man. Room service.. I checked in advance that the hotel does have 24 hour room service. We often are out late and want a good pot of tea and biscuits when we get back. Sorry sir, we don't have any English breakfast, or cookies, or cheese plate. The after 10PM menu is a bit of a joke, unless you want to top up your carbs for the the rest of the day (!!!). Maybe I was expecting too much? I didnt think so from what was supposed to be rated one of the top hotels in Chicago from Trip Advisor reviews. When I signed up for the internet the online questions asked me if I would like a particular paper delivered to my room the next day. Sure I would - excellent idea. Come morning, we go to look. The room across the corridor had a paper, but I'm afraid not us. We are in a Suite remember? Is it possible to expect exemplary service when not only in a 'great' hotel, but also when you are paying an extra $100 a night for the suite? Maybe I am just off base here? The other thing was, we had booked into a 'city view' room. Which I thought meant a view of this wonderful city of Chicago (a really spectacular city for those of you who have not yet visited). The view we had was of a construction site on the road. We would later the next day go on the spectacular river cruise Architectural tour, and would see indeed what we were missing - I could have booked the Westin or the W for the same price, and had a much much better, indeed spectacular view. So, we head out for our first day, after pointing out the safe issues, the lack of tea facilities (there are none in the room, and no tea worth drinking from room service after 10pm), the 'wonderful' view and the lack of a newspaper to the front desk. We get back at 3PM and find our room has not been cleaned yet. Good god. So I call down and they explain that the cleaning staff are working their way around. How about you get to the suites (aka people who are spending the most money in your hotel) first? So we potter around for a bit, shower and get a knock on the door around 4:30PM from the cleaning staff - we asked if they could come back in 30 minutes. We head out. Get back around 10PM. Still no room cleaning!! Wow. They finally came to clean the room at noon the next day. after we had been out for breakfast and were just heading out for our sightseeing. There was no way I was going to stop them from coming into the room at that time... We needed clean sheets and towels. Or maybe this is expecting too much? I could go on about several other items, but most are really just regarding the 'nothing special' level of quality and service in the hotel. Seriously, if you are expecting special, go elsewhere. My main bitterness is that I was so sure that the Trip Advisor rating would not let me down, but please please - buyer beware.

I also really love that they had a Pride package rate this summer (which we were never able to work with our summer schedule). Making the reservation was time-consuming because the website said rooms were available, but I kept getting error messages when trying to book the room. Then I called the number on their website and they told me they were \"fully committed\" for the night we were trying to book. So then I got on a discount travel website and booked the hotel room for that night in two seconds. Too bad I wasted all that time on the Hotel Website! Frustrating!!! Now, on to the hotel itself. The swimming pool is very small and was full of kids when we were there. The pool also does not get deeper than 3-feet-7-inches, so it's very shallow. I do like the roof top deck a lot. Nice view, comfy chairs. Valet parking was VERY expensive ($46), but our car's contents were safe so I'd say it was worth the money. We were moving across the country so our car was FILLED with stuff and everything was kept safe and the valets were super speedy and our car arrived in no time after we checked out. Friendly valets.

Nabil, the manager, quickly responded and promised to check into the availability for us.

Perfect, as who wants to pack up and move to another hotel for one night. Nabil was awesome in making our trip perfect and so memorable. There were some personal reasons for us needing to getaway, and one night Nabil had champagne delivered to our room! How thoughtful is that? At other hotels you are a number and they don't care what might be going on in your life. We arrived early last Sunday and were immediately greeted by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153D\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Darren).

Our meals were delicious and they gave us so much food, we could not eat it all. Prices were reasonable too. Nabil told us that Transformers 3 was filming just down the street so we headed down to Wacker Drive and it was so cool to watch the action! When our room was ready Cullen brought up our luggage and showed us around the room. We asked if we could get a mini fridge and, without exaggeration, within 5 minutes we had a mini fridge in our room - at no charge. Cullen again came to our rescue during our last night. While dining at a nearby restaurant red wine was spilled onto my husband. We headed back to the hotel to change and Cullen met us at the door. We told him our story. We went up to our room to change and less than 5 min. later, there was a knock at our door and Cullen had arranged for club soda to be delivered to our room. I am so sorry I forgot the gentleman's name who brought up the club soda, but he felt so bad when he heard what happened that he even offered to bring a bottle of wine to our room - not kidding! We needed more club soda and more was delivered immediately. The rooftop patio was very nice and the pool looked nice also, although we never went in it. Never went to the hotel bar at night, but if other reviews loved it then believe it! Some people complained about the elevators, but we stayed there for 5 nights and never had any issues with a long wait or crowded elevator. Our king room with the Figi tub was awesome! The tub was so relaxing after a day of walking and not irritating like other Jacuzzi tubs. The shower was huge. Some other reviewers complained about the sliding bathroom door not completely closing, but it wasn't a problem with us being a couple. We understand the hotel is in the process of repairing this issue. The turn down service was a very nice touch. We were on the 15th floor and heard some sirens during the day, but they did not keep us up at night. Very quiet hotel, didn't hear any other room doors closing, etc. The housekeeping service was excellent. The hairdryer and iron were great quality and it was a nice touch that the hotel supplied cotton balls and qtips. Also, there was a list of other items you could get for free or for purchase, at a minimal cost, if you forgot something. We also liked the tiger and zebra robes! A prior review complained about the number of tv channels, but there were lots for us. All the major networks, speciality channels (ie Discovery) plus plenty of high definition channels. To be honest, you don't go to Chicago to watch tv, but after a full day out touring there is enough on tv to just chill if you want to. This is the best hotel we have stayed in. Would highly recommend it to anyone, and hope to return next year! Bravo to Nabil and all his staff!!! Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.

They are across the street from the stop where the free trolley goes to the Navy Pier, and they are half a block from the red subway line. The blue subway line comes into town from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare, free transfer to the northbound red line at Jackson, get off at the Grand station for the Palomar. Takes an hour, saves a ton of cab fare, and costs $2.25pp, exact bills/change at the ticket machines. Get on the subway at Terminal 1. Great location, 10-15 minute walk to the riverwalk along Wacker, or the nonstop action along the Magnificent Mile (No. Michigan Ave). Millennium park is about a 20 minute walk. Two blocks from the famous Brazzaz, a Brazilian steakhouse where carvers rotate around the tables with over a dozen styles of grilled meat, filets, ribs, tenderloin, shrimp, sirloin, lamb leg or chops etc on swords, and they carve you off what you want as often as you want, also nice salad bar. There is a Big Bowl 2 blocks away, and tons of pizza joints and other fast food. The high end shopping is on the Mag Mile. Discount shopping at a Target near the Monroe stop on the red line south. The concierge has free tickets to comedy shows, and he will book it for you. But the show will turn down his request if they are selling well, it works best on off-nights.

It was priced the same as the Courtyard and such so I thought I'd trying something new. What a nice stay!! Staff: Overly helpful staff, doorman addressed me by name, front desk couldn't do enough to help. They even have pre-printed directions to get you to all the popular Chicago sites. Amenities: Lots of little extras in the room like cotton balls, q-tips, special charging station for your electronics, umbrella, robes,etc... and a whole list of out of the ordinary free things you can request such as curling irons and heating pads. Bed/ Room: Really nice sheets, good, large mattress. Quiet room. VERY VERY quiet at night. Very modern. The room reminded me of the new look that the Courtyards are putting in all their renovated locations. Lobby/ lounge: Small but sufficient. Coffee/tea in the morning, tea/ lemonaid in the afternoon, and wine/ sangria (and sometimes hors d'oeuvres) in the evenings. All are complimentary. Morning and afternoon drinks are served with nice extras such as honey, vanilla flavoring, and wide variety of milks and sugars. Location: Right next to the red line which will take you with in a 10-15 min walk or bus ride of the museums (Field, Art Institute, Planetarium, Aquarium), Millennium park, and the Sears tower. Right next to Nordstroms...you can walk through Nordstroms and the accompanying mall and end up on Michigan Ave. Fantastic location! Also close to Benny's Chop House which was really good. FYI: Dogs are allowed, but you can request a pet-free room. They should advertise this more, as I almost didn't book because I'm allergic to dogs. FYI: Yes, the sliding bathroom door does have a 2-3 inch gap close to the entrance to the room and it might be uncomfortable for some. Yes, you can easily peer into the bathroom as you enter the room when the bathroom door is closed, but who's looking. Room Service: Room service was a little aggressive. The woman emptied my shopping bag from Walgreen's and thew out my receipt and the opened packaging for the products I purchased. She left the products on the dresser. Sweet of her, except I was planning to return the merchandise. She was able to reproduce my stuff from the garbage...sigh...oh well. Needless to say, our room was sparkling every day. (The hotel is very environmentally conscious so if you want fresh soaps everyday, you need to hide the old ones or notify housekeeping because we never got a new bar of soap our whole stay.) Customer feedback is welcomed: I noticed in other reviews that people didn't like using the bedroom slipper-socks, because it somehow seemed less sanitary than using a hotel towel. I see that the hotel now puts a fresh, tagged pair in each room and charges you for the socks if you open the packaging. I thought this was a nice way of listening to customer feeback and coming up with a solution. Overall...great hotel....would love to stay again.

Led here by reviews at TripAdvisor, and having stayed in Kimpton properties before, I felt Palomar would be a solid choice and meet my design expectations. I'm happy to report, I was right on both counts. Who can resist a hotel with leopard and zebra bathrobes? The hotel is in a great location, two blocks from Michigan Avenue. Being so new, several taxi drivers were unfamiliar with it, so be sure to keep the address on hand when you visit. The lobby is small but inviting. The reception area features a lovely tufted leather counter with lighted resin countertop, both in a warm gold, very fun and touchable. Gold and black marble floors add drama, along with white patent leather chairs. The color scheme carries into the wine reception room where the over-scale mod floral carpeting keeps the tone whimsical. I really enjoy the mix of materials in the public areas of the hotel. At check-in, which was handled quickly and smoothly, the Kimpton word-of-the-month resulted in a lovely bottle of wine at no charge. The front desk staff also gifted my son with a bag of toys (the beach ball was a huge hit). Membership in the Kimpton InTouch Club also lands you free wi-fi and a $10 voucher for the minibar. We booked into 1127, described as a \"luxury one bedroom suite\". At 750 square feet, it is certainly a lot of real estate for the price. The living room features seating for six, along with a desk area and plenty of accessible outlets. The bathroom is enormous, with a jetted tub that can easily accommodate four people, if you were so inclined (those same four people could also shower at once)! The king bedroom boasts Frette linens and an assortment of pillows. Palomar gets 5 stars for thinking of everything. Every amenity is available, from a magnifying makeup mirror to toiletries you might have forgotten. The trademark Kimpton bathrobes make me smile! Hmmm, so why am I not singing the praises of the d\u00c3\u00a9cor? Well, as I've said before, I think hotel designers have an opportunity to take chances with d\u00c3\u00a9cor, to really create an interesting and original atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, my suite is very nice and quite pretty. But as Elle D\u00c3\u00a9cor's Margaret Russell has said: \"pretty rooms are rarely memorable\". The most exciting aspect of the room is actually the carpeting! The mod floral, downsized from the lobby, is rhythmic and unexpected in the guest room. Subdued in beige and chocolate brown, it leads the color scheme throughout the suite. The textured wallpaper is beige, the furniture mixed dark brown and pale, both with a limed look. The sofa and chairs are light blue and fairly generic. Perfectly nice, but it doesn't have a luxury vibe. The furniture looks like it could live in any average hotel. The bathroom is neutral and very well appointed. I love that the quartz countertop is extra high, and the 12x24 inch marble tiles suit the spacious serenity. Toiletries are L'Occitane - yummy. Overall, I'm a fan of the Palomar, and would definitely recommend to others and stay here again myself. And the restaurant Sable - that story is still playing out - stay tuned for an update.

Yes, that \"gap\" exists on the bathroom door, but one would have to go out of one's way to \"peek\", and if you are accustomed to spending time with a partner, then it's a marginal design error. What was so nice was the that the shower was large and the tub was jacuzzi. What a treat. Any other hotel in downtown offer that amenity for no extra charge? The service is amazing. Doors are opened, bell/desk staff are insistently kind, but not overbearing. My shuttle to the airport happened to be late as I departed and the bellman courteously went back to the desk to have them call to see why. And how about coffee in the morning, tea in the afternoon and wine at 5, not to mention water at front door (and puppy treats if you happen to bring your dog along) and your choice of a morning newspaper, delivered? After having been nickled and dimed at the Swisshotel, these favors were very much appreciated. Location is prime. Restaurants dot State and Hubbard and it is just three short blocks from the Magnificent Mile. The walk to the Art Institute was bracing, about 30 minutes, but taking in all the activity on Michigan Avenue made it seem shorter. With sight-seeing stops between the Hancock Building and the Art Institute, I never had the need to use a cab. I think that the Palomar's attention to detail is what makes it stand out. It does not have the view that other hotels might offer, but for the money (about 225 a night), it is a bargain as it compares with other upscale venues. Internet comes with the room, as does fitness center/pool privileges. Cable does not have a wide variety of choice, but at least all local channels are available, some in HD. Oh, yes, ice on every floor. If there is one drawback, it would be the elevators. There are only two, and at busy times, stops are frequent. But this is a minor annoyance.

I don't usually note service at hotels, but in this case it really made an impression on me. Staff universally showed self-initiative, excellent responsiveness, and were very pro-active in addressing needs and questions. The concierge offered terrific assistance in arranging a swimming outing at another hotel that really impressed my daughter. I was also struck by how the front desk staff remembered previous conversations with me, and the bell staff were extremely resourceful, enthusiastic, and friendly. I am guessing that Kimpton has a philosophy of all employees using independent judgment and initiative. The results are awesome! I am looking forward to another visit to the hotel.

Though you could still hear street noise on the 12th floor. Not sure why they didn't put thicker windows on a brand new building.

The concierge was nice enough, but we found that people behind the front desk were more helpful in restaurant recommendations and other suggestions.

Next, I was a little dense and couldn't figure out how to get the power on the back side of the room to work and they apologized profusely and had somebody up there in literally 2 minutes.

Given that I am a traveler that tends to have things go wrong in my travels (the cab dropped me at the wrong address and one of my flights got canceled on this same business trip), this hotel makes sure that I have a pleasant stay, no matter what obstacles I might throw at them. Complimentary wine (I missed it) in the evening and tasty organic teas /coffee in the morning. The gym was much better than I had expected with a lot of equipment, clean and well-stocked with eco-friendly water bottles and apples.

My package included 2 glasses of alcohol but since we don't drink the manager assured me we would get 2 diet cokes. Now here is where things turned unpleasant: 1. We turned on the brand new flat screen TV and no channels worked (no signal). We called downstairs and they said it's a hotel-wide issue. After a while a few channels started working and eventually all. 2. We were on the 16th floor of a 17-floor hotel. We decided to go downstairs and walk to Michigan ave.. We pushed the evelator button and waited, and waited. After close to 10 minutes I called downstairs and they told me both elevators were not functioning so we were asked to take stairs from 16th floor to 6th floor and then take elevator to first floor, which we did. I was happy we were not downstairs with our luggage trying to come up to 16th floor via the stairs. 3. Late into the night (close to midnight) the room felt cold it was set at 68 degrees. I change the tempurate up to 75 and the heating unit started to make a very (very) loud noise. I turned the heater off and the noise stopped. I tried again around 2am and then 6am but got same results. We didn't want anyone to come to out room in the middle of the night. 3. In the morning we called downstairs and they sent a very well-manned and friendly engineer to our room. He couldn't tell why the issue was happening and couldn't replicate it. But he told us if they can't fix it they will move us to a different room. We told him we will be going out (11am) and will return after 5 hours so hopefully by then they can fix issue or move us to another room. Needless to say 5 1/2 hours later we returned and waited 40 minutes for another room (20 in lobby and 20 in old room). I am now in a new room which seems fine so far.
