We predicted that after a couple of days in Mexico City we would be fed up with the traffic, and that was indeed the case. At the Villa Arqueologica we knew that we could walk to the site in a few minutes, and be there long before the crowds from Mexico City.The VA is now operated by Club Med, but is unlike any other Club Med where I have stayed in that it appears to be the opposite of fully inclusive. Even at breakfast you order and pay for specific items. Fortunately the prices are very reasonable. The food at both breakfast and dinner is simple but very good.The rooms are not large, and are simple, but are perfectly adequate. The hotel is recently decorated in bright colours, especially blues and greens.In early December the hotel was almost deserted, and we were amused to see the waiters fill in their spare time by redecorating the Christmas tree several times.The staff are very friendly, but speak virtually no English. With mutual goodwill, communication was achieved.The VA is good value for money and is undoubtedly the best place to stay if you want to maximise your time in Teotihuacan (as you should) and miss out on two sets of Mexico City traffic in one day.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR982387747", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Caravanserai"}, {"Content": "My best hotel experience ever in M\u8305xico! I have visited M\u8305xico 25-30 times, and I have stayed in hotels throughout the country. This was my best experience ever. My wife and I stayed at this hotel August 9th-13th, 2007. The purpose of our visit was to attend the quincea\u5e3dera (fifteenth birthday) party for my niece, who along with her family lives in the United States, as we do. Because my wife and I had stayed at this hotel before, we had suggested to my sister and brother-in-law, the quincea\u5e3dera's parents, that they have the party there. We knew guests from the United States would be attending, and we thought this hotel provided reasonable room rates, safety, beautiful facilities, a superb restaurant/bar, and easy access to the pyramids of Teotihuac\u8c29n. They agreed. Well, the U.S. guests loved the hotel, and the Mexican ones did too! The hotel manager, Victoria Ben\u94c6tez, is wonderful. Her husband, Federico Mendoza, operates the hotel's (for a fee) transportation service. All of the U.S. guests used the service to get to and from the airport, and to travel throughout Mexico City. For example, my wife, three friends from the U.S., and I, used the service to daytrip to the Basilica of the Virgen de Guadalupe, Coyoac\u8c29n, and downtown. The rates were fair, and the door-to-door service was nice. This hotel is part of the Club Med chain, but it has a traditional Mexican decor and architecture. The rooms are bright and cheerful, with one or two beds, tiled showers, and in-room safes. There is a pool, and a garden with play equipment for children. This is a family hotel. The atmosphere is serene and relaxed, yet comfortable. The staff can arrange for massages (for a fee), and my wife had one. And there is a tennis court.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR282475292", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AMB&JAS"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d672242-r20543637-Villas_Arqueologicas_Teotihuacan-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "672242", "Price": "$91"}}
