We called our AAA travel agent who hooked us up with the room at Hooters. Since we were last minute travelers, and Vegas was booked, I can safely say we overpaid for this room. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere casual (it is a Hooters afterall). We were in an Ocean Tower room...don't get excited. The Ocean Tower overlooks the pool area, and the airport. If you like to watch airplanes land this is the view for you. The pool area appeared to be small, but it had a nice waterfall area, and jacuzzi. There is even a sand box. The room is nothing more than a basic hotel room and it is in need of a remodel. It was clean and the bed comfy. The bare basics in the room for shampoo and body lotion and the towels were really rough. All I am saying this room is worth about $100.00 a night, and it probably suits well the younger crowd. It is walking distance to the Tropicana and MGM. The location is great. We had fun in their casino...the table limits were very reasonable. That is a bonus for those that want to gamble on a smaller budget. It was a fun trip and this served our purpose for our last minute road trip.

There is nothing luxurious about the place, but we went for the pool view bungalow rooms and could walk right out our sliding door and be at the pool area in 10 steps. The bungalows are definitely the way to go if you want to be as close to the pools/spas as possible. They had both spas open and one of the three pools was heated (I judge to about 80 degrees). Since we were there in January, it was warm enough that I jumped in it after some minutes warming up in one of the spas. An added bonus to the bungalow building is that coffee was available 24/7 in the Bait Shop right next to the pool (since they don't have in-room coffee makers). The staff were all friendly, much more so than some other places I've stayed in Vegas. The safe in our room quit working and we had to spend 45 minutes while they repaired it. I would most likely not stay here in the summer when everybody has their pools and spas going, but it's amazing to me that in the middle of winter your only options seem to be Hooters or the Golden Nugget if you want to soak in a spa, let alone jump in the pool!

We wanted an inexpensive room so we could spend our money on the other things Vegas has to offer. I was not happy however when it finally told us we were going to be staying at Hooters. Everything I read said it was dirty and I was unhappy about the fact that it was off the strip when it said on Expedia that it was on the strip. But they are pretty stuck to their no refunds policy so Hooters it was. The room looks like most hotel rooms...bathroom, bed, tv window. Nothing special but nothing bad. I think some people mistake older for dirty. Nothing in our room was dirty however some things were a bit worn. The bed was actually pretty comfortable. The walls were thin but it really wasn't a problem. We didn't even hear people talking. There was a convenience store downstairs along with a Hooters (of course) and the Mad Onion restaurant. We only ate once at MadOnion for breakfast and it was just fine. The 25 cent wings from 12 am-6am were a nice perk too. Just keep in mind they are 50 cents if you are going to take them up to your room. Still a good bargain. I saw a couple of reviews that talked about the type of people that were in the casino and they were afraid to be there. Seriously? Its not the yuppie crowd but it's hardly a group of derelicts. Everyone we met was very friendly. As for being off the strip, I am still a bit unhappy with Expedia but really you are walking everywhere in Vegas anyway and the walk across to MGM isn't any further than between most other hotels. I wish we had a coffee maker in the room because I'm not a nice person til I have had my coffee and having to go downstairs for gas station coffee or walking over to MGM for Starbucks kind of sucked. The casino was mostly older machines which I kind of like but it's small and we were starting to get tired of playing there by the third night. Once again though it was nice to have a casino in the hotel. Here's the bottom line...I paid $45 a night in Vegas over a weekend. I had a clean, comfortable room with most of the amenities of any other room. I wanted to spend my money on nice restaurants and slot machines and the fact that I paid less for three nights and could have done four for less money than ONE night at MGM made it totally worthwhile.

I'm sorry that so many of the previous reviews had a bad time here, I certainly am not. I'd dropped by the $3 blackjack table on my last two trips to Vegas and had a good time. I decided to try taking advantage of their winter deal when I knew I'd be back here. When I read some of the reviews below, i was nervous but went forward with it. I'm so glad I did. Check in was quick, I received my deal benefits easily. I love how small the place is. I don't have to walk two miles to get from my room to the front desk, a restaurant, and casino games. Everyone that I have encountered on staff has been very helpful and gracious. It's a bit cold for the pool, but it looks like it's fun in the summer. One of my favorite things to do in Vegas is spend a couple hours in the morning playing $3 blackjack at Hooters. if I came in before noon, I've never had a problem finding a seat and normally am up a few bucks when I walk away. The game staff has been great, helpful, and kind (this morning Bill and Fangsu were great.. the floor manager Joe was also a treat). Last time I stayed in Vegas, I was at the Mirage. Fancy place, but I felt that my room and bathroom were way smaller than the one I'm in right now. Compared to RESORTS, this hotel is probably a three star, but according to Yelp, four stars is \"Yay! I'm a fan!\" which is definitely true and five means it's as good as it gets. For this price, it is as good as it gets and all of the staff that I have encountered has been great. I'll be back and suggest it to friends. It's a good hotel to hang out, play a little, and check out Vegas.

The room was clean as well and a lot larger than expected. Importantly, there was no bad smell like I've encountered at other budget hotels. I thought the heater/air-conditioner was a little loud, but I think that at most hotels I stay at. The bed was comfortable, though the comforter was a tad lumpy. I loved the location: next to the Tropicana and across from the MGM Grand. As far as the bars and restaurants go: Always had good service at the bars. I'm not a fan of domestic beer, but the $1.50 Bud Light Limes were too hard to pass up. The Hooters restaurant is pretty standard Hooters as far as selection and quality. The Mad Onion wasn't that great. Breakfast was average, but dinner wasn't too good in my opinion. It's now Cattleman's Ranch (or something like that), though I'm not sure if it is anything more than a name change. The one thing that was strange was the motion-controlled heater/air-conditioner. It wasn't a problem for me since I was there in November, but I wondered if it would get warm if the air conditioner turned off at night while you were sleeping. Overall it was great.

A couple of tips: get a taxi from the airport as it works out alot cheaper than getting the shuttle. You can see the hotel from the air-strip (don't worry about the noise, you don't hear it!!!). As you come out of the hotel, turn left and there's a great little 24hr diner which serves the most delicious food with great service. Right next door to the diner is a 24hr liquor store which is handy if you want to avoid hefty bar prices! The hotel's casino is small (compared to the larger hotels) but is very friendly and covers all disciplines (slot machines, tables for Black Jack, Poker etc.) and the bar is the cheapest on The Strip (currently USD 1.50 for a bottle of Bud!). The rooms are large and comfortable although both my rooms didn't have a great view. I say BOTH my rooms because on the second night, the people in the room next door to me decided to have a party and, the following morning, I asked to be moved. I expected to be questioned as to why I wanted to move but I was simply given a new key so I suppose this happens quite frequently. I was quickly allocated a room in a quiet area of the hotel and didn't have any problems again so maybe it's worth requesting a \"quiet room\" when you check in. The room is big and comfy, the bed is huge and soft and the sheet and towels were clean. The bathroom was large but basic with a very powerful shower. If you don't look too closely at the carpet and the marks and scratches on the doors/walls, you'll be quite happy here. You have to overlook these things for the sake of such a great room rate - brilliant if you're on a budget!! A kettle and drinks facility would be nice but they serve drinks in takeaway cups at the bar so it's not so bad. When I was reading past reviews, I was quite nervous about the fact that smoking is permitted in casino's. I'm a non-smoker and that really bothered me. Don't worry! the larger casinos have this covered and actually smell beautiful - probably due to automated smoke diffusers! Hooters isn't so sophisticated in this respect but it still didn't make your clothes smell by hanging around in the bar/casino so I guess their air-con must be pretty effective.

We had an amazing view of the strip and the location of the hotel was not bad, about a 10 minute walk to the strip. The Hooters restaurant was not that great, but Hooters is always kind of hit or miss so that was not a train smash. All in all, a great experience at the Hooters Hotel.

We stayed in the Ocean Tower, room 1534. The room was really cool, without the table and chairs as seen in pictures though. We had asked for a king bed, but upon check-in, around 1:00 P.M., the king wasn't ready and we were offered a two-queen room immediately, which we took. I have to say the check-in staff were friendly and very helpful. The view of the was nice and the windows opened slightly for fresh air. The casino is small and easy to navaigate. The cocktail service was non-existant. My wife played a slot machine for about an hour without one offer of a drink. However, the bar by the front entrance had excellent service and Bud Light Beer for $1.50. Easy to buy others a round at that price. The dealers at the tables were friendly, except the craps table. Although, craps tables dealers tend to be crabby. We saw Raack-n-Roll. Wow! Totally horrible, we actually walked out due to the show and lack of cocktail service. We then went to Tropicana to see Eye Candy, a burlesque show, and I was totally amazed with the show. The best dancing I have seen at a burlesque show in Vegas. We ate a the Mad Onion restaurant, the complimentary steak dinner. The steak was okay and the price was right. Service their was actually pretty good. Checking my play at the end of the trip was pleasant. The staff at the players club were nice and informed me that I had enough play for a coffee mug - meh. Asked If could have a t-shirt instead, and she told me that I qualified for the t-shirt, hat, and mug! Side note, made a bet at the sports book - the dude was really rude, won my bet and did not tip.

(No, just because it's \"Hooters\" doesn't mean it's THAT kind of strip - I mean of the lights along the main drag) and for less than 20 bucks we also got 2 steak dinners, a \"Hooters\" plastic coffee mug (You can't expect \"real\" ceramic mugs at Hooters can you? lol) some comp slot play that I lost in 10 minutes, and... oh, a Hooters pen and \"No Knockers\" door sign... What? I wasn't supposed to take those? The pool/jacuzzi area is the only one we saw in town open 24/7 in the middle of the winter - a definite plus for us, as that's what we like. And the water in the jacuzzi (actually two of them) was pristine - not all scummy-foam like we find all too often.

The location is great, it's less than a 5 minute walk to the Tropicana or MGM. In fact, Hooters itself is set as far back from the strip as MGM's hotel is. The casino is small with only 20-30 tables and a bunch of slots. When we were there the limits were reasonable - there was some $3 blackjack and $2.50 roulette. Bud Light was always $1.50 at the bar. The waitresses in the casino seemed to bring drinks quickly. The rooms were what you would expect from a typical chain hotel elsewhere - clean and basic. Sure, there was the odd stain on the carpet, etc. but my thoughts are that's to be expected in a hotel of this star rating and age. Even Planet Hollywood has it's cosmetic issues. We had a non-smoking room and didn't notice any sort of smoking odors. Our room overlooked the pool, and from what we saw it looked quiet and fairly nice (for the price of the hotel). Again, it's not an over-the-top Vegas pool, but when you're paying $20/weekday night it's a very good pool. There was a nice water feature, a lot of chairs, and very few people there (and it was 30 degrees Celsius). It's set at the back of the hotel and near the elevators so you aren't walking through the entire casino just to get there. The service at check-in/check-out was average. No issues at all and nothing that was above-and-beyond expectations. Overall, my thoughts are that if you get a room with the expectations of a 3* property then you'll be fine.

I've seen many bad reviews, and have this to say: you can't pay for sirloin and be disappointed when you don't get filet. For starters the location is great. You are caddy-corner to MGM and the 2nd hotel off the strip. Being close to Excalibur gets you free train access down to Mandalay Bay as well. As for the rooms, our room was clean and smelled fine. Everything worked. It was definitely a 3 star hotel that could use a renovation at some point, but I paid $60 per night including the weekend (would have been $50, but I wanted the refundable rate just in case). The hall smelled odd every now and then, but never inside the room. I had to try several floors before finding a soda machine that took bills, but a minor inconvenience at worst. The pool area was small but peaceful. It had 2 hot tubs, but one was roped off. This is not a typical vegas hotel pool...think the size/atmosphere of a days inn or la quinta. But it was relaxing to sit out there. The bud light drafts were always $1.50, which was a great deal while sitting at the pool waiting for my wife to get her makeup on. We even tried the mad onion restaurant the last night for quick eats...the food was surprisingly good, and was cheap. Much better than an actual hooters restaurant. The casino was small and not as smoky as some of the others. The service and staff were all acceptable...I didn't need them much, and had no problems. Our bags were stored for free, and we had an early check-in at no charge. In summary, if you're looking for Vegas on a budget, this is a great place to stay for the price.

You'd think this place would be the flagship of the chain, nope, more like the garbage scow. The room I was booked into was on the wrong side of the 'resort' - the Bay View tower side. I don't smoke, I was not there to gamble or drink. My room was not a king but a smoking room twin. I got moved the next day to the Ocean view side and the room was nicer. A king with no smoking.

It's a 2 minute walk, turn right out of the Casino and down E Tropicana. Location wise, it's pretty good given its proximity to the strip. It's a 5 minute walk to get to the strip and you have MGM, NY NY, Excalibur and Tropicana at the junction of Tropicana & Las Vegas Boulevard. The monorail is close by at MGM, so pretty handy for getting from one end of the strip to the other without getting a cab or the Deuce bus.

The trip was great, outside the hotel. We originally booked the hotel through Hotwire.com over 2 months before the trip, so didn't know which hotel we were committing to, but it showed as 3 star hotel, on the strip, with 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor, so we booked it. Was going on a golf trip with 2 other guys, so Hooters was fine when we found out. Problem started at checkin. They didn't have our reservation, and said Hotwire didn't fax it. The girl at the front desk said, nothing they could do, \"next time book directly through us\". Seriously? I ask if they can call Hotwire for me - 'can't do that'. I was surprised at the attitude and inhospitality. I asked to speak with the manager - she wasn't available to talk to us. I ask if they can at least get us in a room, I'll give them my credit card number - I have confirmation number, reservation number, everything Hotwire sent me to confirm I went through and paid for this room already. While at the desk, I called Hotwire, where I was on hold for over 20 minutes. When someone finally came on, they transferred me and refaxed (they said their records showed originally faxed in June). They couldn't stay on the line with me, so waited (all the while, I'm waiting at the registration desk). I waited for another 10 minutes, it never came through, so had to call Hotwire again (again Hooters tells me, nothing they can do, I need to call them, and ask them to fax it again). They said they didn't even have Hotwire's phone number. While on hold, ask to speak to the manager again, this time she was available, this is where things started to really fall apart. She essentially said \"that's what I get for booking through a 3rd party\", I didn't even know how to respond to that. She said nothing they could do. When I finally got Hotwire on again, they again refaxed (I can't believe they're doing all this via fax). This time the Hotwire person stays on the line with me. Another 10 minutes later, Hooters finally gets it. Just to upset us more (it seemed), the counter person checks in the next group in line instead of us. All in all, I get into the hotel room over 2 hours after we got to the Hooters. No apologies, just a bad attitude. I would have been fine if they were polite about the whole matter, I understand things go wrong with technology. But to blame me for making reservations not directly through them, to be rude (not just from staff, but from the manager), unbelievable.

We stayed in the \"Bay View\" tower. We didn't have a view of the strip but our room on the 10th floor had a wonderful view of the pool and amazing view of the mountains. It also had a small balcony so we were able to stand outside. Our room was very clean. Im a stickler for clean hotel rooms and this room met my expectations. The air works really good we did have a little trouble getting the room to a comfortable temp it was either too warm or freezing cold. They have no Wi-Fi but you're in Vegas you didn't come to sit on your lap top all day(You can go to Dennys up the street they have free wi-fi). Oh the bed is very very comfy and the pillows are too. I left the housekeeper a note for extra towels and soap and she left it with no problem, When I was there one day when she cleaned the room she was very courteous and asked my permission before touching things in the room.I really don't have any complaints about the room or hotel. I've read many reviews about this hotel being far from the strip. The people who wrote that must be lazy. I'm pretty chunky and out of shape and I had no problem getting to and from the strip. It's like half a block away from the strip. I walked the whole strip from the hotel and the location was right across from the MGM Grand. It's also near New York New York, Tropicana, and Mandalay Bay. I will say that at night the homeless people are out. I was alone at night and never felt scared of any of them. They actually didn't bother me at night it was the ones that were out in the day that were little pest. Now lets talk about this damn Mad Onion resturant. We go there at around 1am there were two staff members at the front counter area. The guy stated if we wanted the 25 cent wings we needed to sign up for the rewards card. No big deal we signed up. After we signed up he told us to sit in the waiting area to be seated, we waited for about 20 mins. The resturant wasn't full and there were plenty of seats available. We first were seated at a booth. My friend requested to be moved as the booths are funky shaped and uncomfortable. The wings are 25 cents but you have to buy a drink which we were going to do anyway so that was no issue. What I do have a problem with is if you want ranch or bleu cheese it is $1, if you want a take out box its $1 and they add $0.50 per wing. Thats BS considering you already paid for the wings. As far as the casino it was nothing to get excited about. The tables stayed pretty crowded. The slot machines were pretty tight. The $200 in promotional play is a real joke. They put you on a $5 slot. They do offer $1.50 Bud beers if you drink beer. All in all this is a good hotel if you don't need any extra frills and want to save some money.

Liked the vanity mirror in the bathroom. The check in line was quick, the day shift people were nice, the night shift people ignored me, never got one free drink for 2 hours at video poker machine so when I hit a hand pay jackpot I only tipped the slot person since I never had one waitress ask me if I wanted a drink and I played for 2 hours before I hit.

It also has two pools. One that is a normal temperature and one that is beyond freezing! This is the one with the waterfall. It also has a hot tub in between the two, with ample party music in the background. The casino was not too bad, and if you get a members reward card you can choose several perks but they have a designated area of slots that you can sit down and they give you $200 (can't cash out, have to play and win something) to mess around with which one might as well do because it is free. They have a decent amount of tables as well as two $3 minimum blackjack tables which always seemed to be full especially in the evening. There are two restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and The Onion. Hooters is, well, Hooters. They have ok food, but are best known for there wings. They do however seem to nickel and dime you for everything ( extra money to add celery to your wings order?) The Onion does boast a $9.95 prime rib dinner, but it reminded me of a cheap buffet. It is nice they are open 24/7 along with anytime breakfast but the price really is not worth it and the food is not great at all. The service is also very very horrible. Only good thing was it was convenient. As far as location, casino, and value I rank it among the best. Obviously it is not a superb luxurious hotel but for $22 a night (plus a dumb $8 a day tax which every hotel has) it was fantastic and I will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cIts OK\u201d", "Author": "bbihler", "ReviewID": "UR115533469", "Content": "Decided to give Hooters a try since they were offering such a great special.

Hooters Hotel & Casino, if not already is refining how the new young and hip are opting for hotels like this. It's a great place for fun & play at great rate. Any guest would feel very welcome but, most importantly guest will feel wonderful staying in there large spacious rooms that are clean and the casino is fun to play in and even give you a $200 Free play when you sigh up for the Owl Rewards Club. The restaurant serves a $9.99 prime rib served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob that rival other Las Vegas\u2019 upscale restaurant or hotels. The pool is remarkable, fun, and lively. Hooters Hotel & Casino despite being marketed to men it fulfills the formula of family and couples alike. It may not be glitzy, behemoth, Vegas casino-style hotel, but it sure manages to make guests feel that the hotel & casino is yet unique and intimate at the same time. The latter is due in part to the hotel\u2019s verticality, which spreads the public areas over the first floor instead of several. Bars and gaming are concentrated on the ground floor; and rooms start at the second to the 10th floors, which make it quiet and family or business friendly. The Hotel is situated right in front of the MGM and to the right of the Strip. Which really make it easy to get to the Airport Freeway or back on to the Strip. I had a great fun time and stay at this wonderful gem of a hotel and the service was top notch. I am and I would highly recommend to my friends, family, and anyone coming to Las Vegas.

The room we got had plenty of room, a view of MGM Grand, and was very clean. The beds were comfortable and I slept well. The style was dated, though, and the bathroom -- again, while clean -- was in dire need of upgrading.

This hotel had great rates and wings and a beer certainly didn't sound bad. To my surprise, I really enjoyed this place. Look, I have stayed at the fancy Las Vegas hotels and some not so fancy. If your interested in a glitzy Las Vegas experience, by all means, stay elsewhere. But for the money, this is a very down to earth friendly hotel. I will certainly stay here again. For the criticism I read- some of it is fair. My room was clean, but yes, it is dated, But my bed was comfortable and I had no issues with my bathroom which was a decent size. And for the money I spent on this hotel room- honestly- what are you expecting. It was light years better than it should have been for the money. I'd loved the fact that after I arrived I could go down and sit at a Hooters bar, order dinner with wings and an ice cold Drifter Pale Ale. I just wish they would have served this in a glass and not a plastic cup- but I'm sure there is a reason for this. The casino itself is small compared to any other Vegas Hotel. But this has its advantages too, as everyone is very friendly and they got to know me over the two days I spent here. If you are a serious gambler, you probably will want to play elsewhere. The blackjack rules were a little too favorable to the house, but hey, where else does a Hooters girl deal you blackjack? But the great part about this hotel is it sits directly across the street from the MGM Grand, making the strip and other casinos easily available for gambling. I enjoyed gambling at NYNY, drank a bit much, and couldn't wait to walk back to my hotel to have a serving of wings and another drifter before bed.

I was totally expecting to arrive there and be bombarded with... well, Hooters.. but I was very surprised.. other than a few of the table dealers, the odd waitress and in the Hooters Restaurant itself, it was very mild... My husband and I stayed at the Hooters hotel and we had a great time!! The hotel is an excellent place to stay if you are looking for an excellent value.. don't go to Hooters is you are expecting The Bellagio.... The hotel lobby is very nice and clean. The casino part is much smaller than the regular larger casinos.... Beds are super comfortable but a bit small.... bathrooms are nice and roomy and clean.. a friendly reminder to tip the maids on a daily basis or your room won't get much attention... I usually left $1 / day and the one day I forgot, we got back to the room and the only thing that was done was the bed... carpet was not vacuumed and they \"forgot\" to leave the towels... the pool area is very nice and if you are up for getting a tattoo, there's a tattoo shop by the pool deck and they are very good at what they do.. the price is right too!!! The Mad Onion Restaurant is AWESOME and the prices are very reasonable.. especially the breakfasts!! The Hooters Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment... we went in one evening for muchies and beer and the place was sooooo loud you could not even hear yourself think and the waitresses were not very pleasant!!! When you stay on or close to the Strip, don't except to eat for cheap... cheap meals are few and far apart... be prepared to dish out at least $40-$50 per meal.... (if you are lucky) try to find buffets or spots off the strip, still within walking distance (side streets) to find good deals.... The Stratosphere and Freemont Street have great deals on buffets!!! High speed internet was a bit confusing... they have high speed but it's not WIFI... When I plugged the laptop in, it took me to the Hooters homepage and I had to choose what option I wanted to buy.. I bought the 24 hours for $12.95.. The front desk clerk informed me that it would be charged to the room so I fully expected to see it on my bill upon check out but there was no sign of it anywhere.. so not sure if it's included in your $8 / day hotel fee but it would seem like it was... in my case anyway and I did not bother asking when I checked out... When getting around on the strip... your best value for traveling if you are not in to walking the entire strip day after day.... buy a bus pass for the Deuce bus (double decker bus) they have ticket booths set up on the strip every so many feet to buy the passes... you buy a pass and it gives you access to the Deuce bus as well as the Express bus... (pick up a bus route guide to check which bus goes where you want to go)... fyi, the Express bus is much better than the Deuce with less stops... the Deuce stops at basically every larger hotel / casino on the strip where the Express only stops at a select few... must quicker to get from one end to the other of the strip!! If you are NOT in to getting roped in to Time Share or Vacation package seminars.... do not stop to talk to people on the strip who walk out in front of you offering you free stuff.. trust me.. they are everywhere.... if you don't mind spending 2-3 hours listening to their presentations, you will walk away with free stuff... I will admit, we did 2 of these vacation package seminars and ended up with tickets to a show at the Stratosphere, 2 free buffet tickets, free passes to the Top observation deck at the Strat, tickets to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, 4 course Italian meal at Venetian and tickets for a gondola ride... so yeah, they may be annoying but you do get loads of good free stuff.... We only had a couple issues with the hotel which in my opinion were very minor...the first room they put us in had a safe that did not work and after 1.5 hrs of the maintenance dude trying to fix it, they moved us to another room... we had requested a room with a king size bed but when we arrived, they had none available in non smoking so we settled with the regular 2 double bed room.. Other than those 2 minor issues, the hotel itself is GREAT... Close walking distance to The Strip... maybe 5 min walk... So, if you are up for a nice, clean, very good deal in Vegas.. the Hooters Casino & Hotel is a perfect option...

Our rooms were cleaned beds made and toiletries replaced whenever we hung out our make up our room sign. It was quiet overall and relatively smoke free in the casino considering this is Vegas. I actually enjoyed being off the strip a bit as it was a bit less crowded and less frantic than at other big places on the strip. We particularly liked the down home atmosphere and friendly attendants at the casino and the service at the Mad Onion, the restaurant attached to the casino. We ate a lot of our meals there as the food is good and the portions are huge. We shared a lot of our meals and the servers were always very friendly and did not mind a bit! The cost of the meals is very reasonable and the prime rib dinner was very good! The quieter atmosphere there was appreciated. We stayed Sun-Thurs so it was not super busy.

It wasn't enough to make us want to change rooms ( probably no different ) but it was \"grimy\" enough to make me wish I had brought my house slippers to wear in the room. We are NOT picky people, nor are we used to \"5 star\" accommodations but I do expect good general cleaning practices to be met. The carpets are in desperate need of a DEEP cleaning, if not a total replacement, even INSIDE the rooms ( the halls are worse ) and I basically used a towel, soap, and water and cleaned the bathroom floor myself once I was trying to get settled in. It had been \"cleaned\" since the last guest because it was stocked appropriately, but the bathroom floor was visibly dirty and so were the other surfaces in the room. The room had a stale smell. The bed linens \"looked\" clean and fresh, but I just had to assume they were and go with it. Basically, we were not very confident in the housekeeping practices of the place. The elevators were filthy, the tables and stools in the Hooters restaurant were sticky and quite banged-up. The cleanest areas were the pool and the front entrance where we saw people actually \"cleaning\" areas. We still enjoyed the friendly and easy check-in and the low limit tables and the cocktail service. The two husbands in our group used the hot tubs outside and we did sit by one of the \"working\" fire-pits while we were there, but it was definitely NOT worth the 7.50/day resort fee that is charged for these \"amenities\". There was kind of a \"feel\" about the place that it's getting a bit run-down and they are not willing to put the money into keeping it up. Like most other people say on this site, if you want an inexpensive place to stay Hooters might work for you. I feel that if they are going to continue to draw in business with their low prices and convenient location, they better concentrate on up-keep and housekeeping ( aren't there 1000's of people looking for work in LV ?) or they will not see people returning to stay at Hooters.

No getting lost trying to find your buddies like the mega casinos. The low table minimums are great! The cocktail waitresses never let a drink get empty, and we're not big spenders or high rollers. One night we stayed up until 6:00am at one of the bars drinking for free because the bartender (who was a beautiful Hooters girl) wanted some company to move the night along.

The room rate back then was $63 a night and we thought...it's a new hotel and we like the Hooters brand so how bad could it be? Well, it was really great to be honest! The casino was fun and lively, staff was nice and it had a Hooter's restaurant on-site, which was appropriate. The rooms were as cute as could be, mimicking the \"Hooter's\" restaurant decor. Beds were comfy. They had neat little ammenities in the bathroom. Good stuff. Welllll, we went back for a week in March 2011 and....things changed. The prices were still comparable to 2006, which we were excited about but the rooms weren't as nice. The beds seemed harder and the comforters weren't those nice plush ones anymore. Some of the touches in the room like the high-top table with the tin beer bucket for your ice were gone. We didn't even have a chair at the desk. The bathroom goodies were downgraded to the point they had that lousy shampoo & conditioner-in-one crap, so I had to go buy shampoo and conditioner separately (a girl thing). The thing that irked us the most was the fact that at 11 pm, we decided to have dinner and we came all the way back to the hotel from down the strip, specifically to have their Prime Rib that they advertise on the side of their building to be served 24/7. Well, this night they were cleaning their kitchen equipment so no Prime Rib. We could have eaten Prime Rib at several other places down the strip but toted our happy butts back to Hooters to eat at our hotel and go to bed. My husband threw up quite a fuss about it with the Chef at the restaurant and with the front desk supervisor because a hungry man with his mind set on Prime Rib is no lauging matter! Their sense of customer service was just lacking about the whole deal. Could have been easily solved by comping us another meal, but their offer was to comp us a Prime Rib dinner the next night, which my husband explained we wouldn't be there the following night. You'd think in the customer service industry you'd say, \"What can we do to make this up to you?\" But it was like, \"Oh, well, you won't be here tomorrow night. We're sorry.\" It was just irritating at 11 pm when you're starving and there's no place close to eat.

Arrived on a Saturday night. When I approached the registration desk, I waited for nearly 15 minutes as there was only one clerk on hand. The remaining clerks were inside some other room mingling and chatting. Not a good start to a four night getaway. After receiving my room key, I went up to my room which had a strip view. When I walked in, the aura and smell of the room was tropical and pleasing. However, that would be the only positive experience I would have while at Hooters. I quickly realized that the T.V. was not picking up a strong signal and resulted in static display. \"High speed Internet\" was non-existence due to a wiring issue. Maintenance did arrive to my room and he was very nice and polite while trying to assist the problems that was found. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do to fix the issues. I called the front desk and they advised me to come back down to registration to put me in another room. Due to weekend occupancy, I was downgraded from a strip view to a pool side view which was disappointing to say the least. Now, Keep in mind, I've been on property for almost two hours and I had yet to unpack my luggage, put on some comfortable clothing, or take a nice hot shower. When I arrived to my second room, I noticed that the bathroom area (particularly the toilet) was not up to par with regards to maintenance. There was a crack on the side of the toilet and the shower head needed replacement. After three hours since arriving on property, I managed to settle down. I'm not the type to complain over the little things, but I do expect a decent room. After thinking over my horrid experience with Hooters Las Vegas, I decided to check out the following morning and stay at another hotel. I spoke to the manager and was issued a partial refund which cover room and Internet service plus another courtesy credit. Overall, the property is run down and needs major renovation. The staff did their part in trying to make my stay a positive one, but the poor maintenance issues really puts this hotel/casino miles behind compare to the other properties on the strip. You may find a cheaper room at Hooters, but believe me, it's better to stay somewhere else. Hooters Las Vegas just completed their five year anniversary.

We didn't want to risk Bally's giving us a room with only one bed so we booked at Hooters and each couple got a bed and our single friend brought a twin sized air mattress. Hooters is an easy walk across the street from MGM Grand. So even though it isn't Exactly on the strip, it isn't a big deal. Rooms are old but clean. Our bathroom did have a few small ants though.

If you plan to remain sober or if your visiting the area for honeymoon do not stay here. For the rest its fine. The hotel is conveniently located close to airport and interstate as well as is in walking distance from the south part of the strip (close to MGM, NY NY etc). The $1.50 beer, the hooters girls, the low minimum bets and the wooden walls and floors give a nice atmosphere inside the casino . The rooms are huge and I personally liked the decor and design, particularly the plenty use of wood in the room. On the negative side, yes both casino and rooms are old and need renovation. The bathroom was in not so good condition and its floor looked dirty. Room furniture had scratches, the towels, bed sheets and pillow covers had weird stains. The shampoo and soap provided by the hotel (a hooters brand) had a disgusting smell. In addition, the Hotel is close to the airport and whenever a plane takes off you can hear the noise. I find it very annoying that the $8.40 resort fee does not cover internet. To Hooters managers: this is unacceptable in year 2011! In summary, I agree that the hotel is not perfect. Keep in mind that this hotel is losing money every year and currently is considered number 1 for bankruptcy among all the strip casinos. However, the very low room rates and low gambling minimums, the location and the nice atmosphere inside the casino influenced me positively about this hotel.

Let me start at the lobby. As is typical at some Las Vegas casino hotels you walk in the door and you're in the casino. No problem except that the Pergo type floor is cracked and chipped. The rest of the lobby and all the rooms are decorated in \"early cheap\" with walls and mouldings decorated in knotty pine. Once in our room while taking a shower the hot water knob fell off then while closing the drapes the rod came off in my hand. We left the handle in the tub and the rod on the DIRTY carpet in front of the drape. We hoped that the maid would contact maintenance and have the problems corrected. For the next 2 days the rod remained on the carpet and the knob kept reappearing on the faucet and then falling off while we showered. The first day we went to the unheated pool we were provided towels (more like rags) the size of face towels for our usage. What we really needed was something much much larger to cover the filthy cushions. The next day at the pool there were NO towels available. It seems the security guard was in charge of pool towels and he hadn't ordered them from Mission supply. He did eventually find us a couple of room towels for use. (My wife made the mistake of entering the hot tub and has since developed a rash over large parts of her body.) After going to our room on day 3 we found there was no hot water. I called Housekeeping/Engineering and let ring - no answer. I then called the operator and asked for the manager, the phone rang and again there was no answer. I then called the front desk and was shunted to some low level manager (this on a holiday weekend). He offered to move us and gave us a $25 credit. At this point we had had it with Hooters and moved to a different hotel. At checkout, this manager charged us $8.40 per day resort fee. When asked what was included in this so called resort fee, we were told the fee was for the pool and its amenities (unheated, contaminated hot tub, no towels and filthy cushions), the toll free LOCAL calls, and the two 8oz bottles of Hooters brand water. We paid this \"extortion under protest. My advice stay far far away from this place. There are many other hotels in the area at the same or better pricing.

Arriving late we were cheerfully greeted by the manager who chatted us up while she gave us our rooms. It took maybe 10 minutes to check us in. They have limited space for check in so if a big group comes it could take awhile. The rooms are large, and I have to admit are kept very clean by the staff. They do a good job at that, and keeping the towels / toiletries / water supplied. The carpet, paint and bathroom are very tired and need to be refreshed. I kind of liked the style of the furnishings, but I am a glass half full kind of guy. The attitude of the staff was incredibly good. That was in contrast to other mega resorts I typically stay here in LV where there can be a coolness factor attitude by the staff. From the barmen to the staff in the casino everyone was friendly and willing to help. The gym is a hidden gem. It is small, but I don't think that many people come to LV to work out. I LOVED it and the pool area was inviting. However it is January so no chance to use it and generally was closed. I noticed they kept the hot tub going in the cold which I thought was decent of them. If you are a business traveller a couple of issues that I had. 1. The \"desk\" working area is not really comfortable for cranking that late night spreasheet. 2. The internet was a disaster. Came and went, and they charge $14.00 per day. Really? Also service came and went, and it seems the service provider had capacity issues, I was always getting bumped out and having to log back in which was bad. Some good things for business travellers. 1. You are close to MGM and its restaurants and stuff. 2. You are close to the monorail if you need to go the convention center. 3. The taxi line is not that long, and that is during an incredibly large convention. 4. This is a real active casino soooo its noisy and smoky. 5. Restaurant service is SLOWWWW in the early am to get seated. They evidently do not bring in the service staff until 9am. So before that you can wait 30 minutes for a table. In speaking with alot of people there, this seems to be a common complaint. You should try to negotiate free internet and get the coffee mug included which entitles you to free coffee all the time you are here. While it seems a small thing, if you come from a different time zone its nice to wake up at 4am and be able to get fresh hot coffee, and usually a smile from the attendant. In sum for business travellers there is good and not so good, but overall I would do it again since we are very budget concious.

I'm not one to write a review to complain about little things that weren't perfect, we had no intentions of perfection when we booked this trip, but what we had was miserable by the end of the trip. From the 1st day the TV remote did not work and the shower did not drain, we left a note for the maid the next morning and a tip. They had no problem taking the tip but nothing was fixed. The heat was a MAJOR issue - you have to understand this was what we were told one of the COLDEST winters they have seen in Vegas - the 1st 2 days it was super hot in the room, it was hot or cold, no ability to regulate but we could live with that. By day 3 the heat completely stopped working, none, in fact cold air was coming into the room through the unit (again coldest Vegas winter). So I asked the front desk to take care of the heat, shower, and tv. Come back later at night, nothing. No note, message, etc saying it could not be fixed and nothing was fixed. I again asked the front desk to take care of it the next day and again we were ignored. So all said and done we spent 3 nights in the room w/ no heat during one of the coldest spells in Vegas ever and I end up taking pneumonia home as a souvenir. Thus it really ruined the trip. Yes I supposed I could have gone down and complained, yelled, etc and what? then get a response and maybe get moved to another room that from what I read on other reviews probably will have similar issues but the point is I shouldn\u2019t have to raise a stink to get something looked at with the room....Especially heat when it's cold out!!!! I don\u2019t care if I ask the maid, front desk, doorman, etc, I don\u2019t care who I ask to get something with the room fixed nor how big or small the issue is... they should take it to the proper person and get it resolved or advise you they can not fix it and move you....Especially at NYE rate prices!!!! Obviously that is not how Hooters operates this establishment and once they get your money they really don't care if you have an issue because mine went completely unacknowledged. The sad part is I really did like the location, the casino, restaurants and the bar/wait staff were excellent. The entertainment offerings were decent and they had some good players club promos.

For the first 20 mins, all I could hear was probably about 6 men (the construction workers) yapping in Spanish before they actually got to work and began ripping up the carpets, moving beds... basically making a TON of noise. The walls were incredibly thin, so it sounded like they were right in my room! I called the front desk, where a lady said she would look into what was going on and call me back. After enduring 20 mins of more noise, she never called me back. I called her back and asked WTF is the noise about? She said they were renovating the room and HUNG UP on me! I was pretty PO'd at how she spoke to me, so I went downstairs to speak to her supervisor. Her supervisor apologized and moved me into a suite away from the construction...... this is where things really get brutal..... I move to the suite upstairs, unpack all my stuff (remember, this is at about 8am...) and lay down on my bed.... and I feel a DRIP OF WATER hit me! I look up and realize that water is dripping thru the ceiling!!! I moved the bed and put a bucket under the drip and tried to get some sleep.... woke up a few hrs later, went out for the day/night.... returned to the room in the evening and was blown away to see WATER POURING thru the ceiling now! I had to change rooms AGAIN! My 3rd night in my 3rd room was (thankfully) rather uneventful... The third room I was in had old food left in the fridge, but I managed to just keep it closed and ignore it. I was so fed up at this point.

The valet sign is very prominent, but you'll have to slow down to see the signs for self-park. Once you know to turn the corner for self park, you'll find another sign that tells you to turn into a drive way... a very dark and secluded driveway at night. It almost looks like a delivery entrance. You'll pass the Hooters bungalows before you make a turn again towards the garage. It seems like an insecure area as there was a homeless person hanging out between some parked cars. Once you reach the parking structure, it gets better. We park on level 3, and head towards the elevators. When you press the down button on any of the two elevators, the lights do not light up. After waiting a minute or so, you begin to think that maybe the elevators are out. Wrong, the down buttons to the Casino are BROKEN! You need to press the up button, and either ride up with someone or be fortunate to go down after the elevator comes. There is only one elevator shaft working when I got there as the other one was in repair. This means one elevator is serving 8 floors of parking! 2. Once you reach the casino floor, you have to maneuver around the Owl Rewards Club service area with all your luggage as there isn't much space for the service line, and you all passing through. 3. The check-in was smooth and emotion-less, so I have no opinions here. The only thing interesting was that the check-in person told me the rooms were renovated 4-6 months ago. Either she was mistaken, or just plainly lied. 4. The room... oh boy the room. The heater is so old and loud and turns on and off so often that it wakes you up from sleeping. This should be the ultimate reason not to stay here if you think you'll get some sleep (I just turned it off in the middle of the night and slept close to my wife. Baby had a thick blanket that we brought). The rooms are not renovated because there are snags in the carpet, the furniture are worn, and the bed is super soft. If you like to sleep warm, don't expect a warm comforter, and you'll need to ask for an extra blanket rather than finding a blanket in the closet. IF YOU HAVE A BABY, and ask for a crib, it's a pack n' play that doesn't come deployed, you need to do it yourself. The pad was disgusting with stains, and we got extra sheets to cover the pad. The bathroom sink and shower drains very slow, and the shower is such a water miser, that you might prefer to take a bath. Last but not least... old school TVs. Long story short, I think if I was really budget minded, and had a car, I would stay at TripAdvisors #2 Vegas hotel: The affordable Staybridge Suites. There are pros and cons to this hotel. To summarize: Pros: - Relatively close to the Strip for budget minded visitors. - Hooters wings - Doesn't smell - complementary bottled water in rooms Cons: - Self parking not convenient - Hotel rooms needs major refurbishment - Carpets and bathrooms floors need to be cleaned better - Dust coated fake plants in room (Beware if you have allergies) - Pay internet", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cIf the shoe fits\u201d", "Author": "Rakosh", "ReviewID": "UR89648264", "Content": "This place is like an old pair of shoes: worn out and scuffed,smelly, used to be comfortable.

But this last visit we made on Nov.28-Nov.30,2010 was so terribly disappointing for a number of reasons. 1) I paid the extra money for what I thought was an Upgrade room, which it wasn't,the floor we were on was the Ocean View Room1743 which had construction going on in the parking lot directly below us and we could hear all the work going on early in the morning 2) Then if that wasn't enough, there was a baby in one of the rooms near us. With the baby crying and crying first thing early morning! WOW what a way to wake up after going to bed late. 3)Our Ocean View room was not to clean, I mean the maid did what she could, but the room was just so worn,old and beat up looking. The tolit only flushed by holding down the handle contiueous and the shower was stained. Like I said, the maid was doing all she could. 4)I was hoping to get 2 for 1 tickets to the \"Purple Reign\" show for Sunday night. I spoke to the Host Joe. He informed me that I couldn't get 2 for 1 tickets, but that I could have $5 off each ticket and he could give us Comp. tickets for the Todd Paul show at 8pm. So we agreed, hoping to just enjoy a nice meal at the Hooter's Restrurant and then make it to the Todd Paul show and then the Purple Reign show. Well we go up to the 8pm show and other people where coming down saying that there was no Todd Paul show, he was cancelling it. Meanwhile, there where other people also waiting for the elevator to up to the show...but right at 8:04pm the show was cancelled. I feel that the show was cancelled way to soon, before people could get up to sit down. Then they told us, we could trade these cancelled tickets for another show, including the Purple Reign show, but I had already purchased the tickets. So there was nothing they could do, I couldn't get 2 for 1 tix, but they could exchange comp tickets for it...I don't get it??? why not just make the customer happy to begin with! why this whole dog and pony show? 5)Finally it was time for us to check out and I go to the front desk. I find out at check out that the \"NOT Upgrade room\" is being charged to me at an extra $10 per nite plus tax and was told the room was not an upgrade, but that the extra $10 per nite was to gurantee me a room reservation for the nights I requested, What!!! I didn't see that Hooters was sold out for those days, correct me if I'm wrong. Well anyways, I'm not writing this review just to be nitpicky, but to sincerely let your organization know what is going on at your place of business. I realize how competitive Las Vegas is for business. So as a past customer, I just wanted to let you know how terrible my visit was and I know for a fact that some of those other people that where there the night of the 8pm show cancellation were not happy and infact turned in their Club cards.

We requested a non smoking room away from the elevators and got 1147 which was an awesome room in the Ocean Tower with a great view of the strip. The room was clean.

I had signed up for their email offers because friends had recommended this hotel. So I recieved a one time deal of 50% off which worked for the weekend since weekend rates are always higher. The person at the desk wasn't at all pleasant and in fact I would say she hates her job. I asked her why she was swiping my card when the room was already paid for. She replied that it was for security reasons. As she turned her back to me I could hear her talking to the other person saying that I thought she was going to charge me again and laughed. She then took our key and slid it across the counter with no welcome or directions to the room. We wandered through the casino to ask for directions from a friendly slot attendant. When we got to the room, I swiped the card and opened the door. In the reflection of the mirror I saw a naked man laying on the bed in our room for all his bits to see! I turned to my partner to tell him and just as I did, a women from the room wrapped in the towel came to ask if we needed help. I was embarrassed and apologized. We headed back to the desk. On the way the slot attendant who helped us originally came to see if things were ok. We were directed to security. Security told me they would phone the room and I suggested that the people were interupted already so we contacted the Manager. We were told then to head back to the desk to meet him. Derek apologized and told us he would waive our resort fees and get us into another room. A larger more comfortable room. So, we then went to the room. Lots of orange, wood, King size bed and looked decent enough. Everything that we needed. The next morning, the rugs looked tired and there was hair in the walk in shower. Kind of gross. We stayed there three nights and towels were not changed by the maid. But, the rugs had been vaccuumed. The two bottles of complimentary water (resort fees) were used up and never replaced. The room adjacent to us with a locked door had two different guests stay. All of which we could hear the conversations. Our view consisted of the parking lot. I think it would be a great place for a boys get away or somewhere you needed just to sleep providing you don't have noisy neighbors. We enjoyed our Prime Rib meal at Mad Onion for $9.99, the beer for $1.49 and the Purple Reign Show was fabulous. The swimming pool looked like it needed a good cleaning after the night before. The $100 free slot play consisted of a promotional play area and the attendant putting your $100 into the $5 a pull slot machine. If you want to get to the strip I would suggest walking across the street and through the back of MGM otherwise you walk through a street filled with garbage and broken bottles not to mention a bit sketchy looking.

This was not advertised anywhere. We had a budget of $150 a day and now told had to hand over $250!!!! Was told if put it on Debit card it would be refunded backk THE DAY WE LEFT. As this money was the only money we had when we got back to UK we went with that after checking with the girl 3 TIMES tht it would be refunded. Went up to room. VERY LOUD AC but try to leave it on in day with your curtains shut and you shouldnt need to have it on through the night. Cleanliness was average the hotel very worn. Gaffer tape over floor in casino... holes in chairs and stains on betting tables. Toilets did not flush well and sometimes had to go back for 2nd try. Staff... RUDE!!! Ugly people get put on reception and bar - and have attitude because they know thats the reason!!! Slightly less ugly people work in HOOTERS Restaurant (Wings MING!!!! couldnt finish them) One 'HOOTERS girl was a old as my gran and another was walking around 8 months pregnant!!! Drinks girlsthat come around when your bet make you feel as if its an effort to serve you and find a $1 tip offensive!! Bars are under staffed and staff are more interested in drinking table customers drinks and chatting to each other! Didnt find it very proffesional when a lady, who was quite drunk ,was losing at Blackjack while sitting at the Sports Book and staff continuly took the micky out of her with each other. Pool: Pointless... had a sewage smell.. Drinks double in price and Water dirty and very cold compared to other hotels. Situated in wrong place so 2 hrs sun a day. This then made me annoyed as i paid $84 resort fee - Pool, Gym, Water in Room (2 small bottles that were never replaced) and Internet (im on holiday dont need internet) so felt robbed by resort fees.NB: Ceasars Palace is open to the Public and amazing!!! Head there!! At Check out I asked if the 'deposit' was put back on my card - was told 'it will be ma'am in 5-7 working days'... Pardon? Yes 5-7 WORKING DAYS!!! so had to borrow money when returned from holiday until it was refunded. NOT HAPPY considering what we were told on Check in. So, Unless your staying in Vegas for 1 night i wouldnt recommend HOOTERS. If i had known now i would have had to hand out an extra $250 i could have stayed at Monte Carlo which was on the Strip and a really nice hotel with friendly staff.

However, that's not to say it's a bad hotel. If you have ever been to Hooters, then you know what to expect. The hotel IS the restaurant with a place to sleep. Check-in was quick and the customer service was great. The two issues I encountered were easily remedied. First Issue: We were originally given one of the ground floor bungalow rooms. The patio door did not lock, which was a safety issue considering it opened right out to the parking lot. One phone call to the front desk and we were quickly moved to a larger room in the Bayside Tower. Room was basic but clean. Second Issue: Internet in the room did not work, but I was able to take my laptop to the Bait Shoppe, (24 hour onsite convenience store), and plug in right there for FREE, avoiding the $12 internet fee altogether. Yes, the carpets in the HALLWAYS ONLY were a bit worst-for-wear, but the carpet in the room was clean, no stains, but really carpet? There are lots of pluses to this hotel. Location: 10 minutes from the airport, walking distance from 24 hour liquor store, across the street from the monorail and the MGM Grand, walking distance from the strip. Pricing: Drinks are literally 50% cheaper than if you bought them at another hotel. Plus you can buy a bottle of your favorite spirit right at the Bait Shoppe, (little bit of a markup), but given that you can walk with your drink throughout Vegas it's a good way to drink on a budget. Table games had pretty low minimums, which made for more gambling with less risk. 24 Hour Amenities: The 24 hour pool is an awesome amenity; there was always someone out there. $3 meal after midnight at the Mad Onion was awesome after staggering back from the club at 5am and the Bait Shoppe access was great too. Gym was nice too! As a gym rat that is important. By Vegas standards Hooters is certainly a no frills hotel. If you are in Vegas to spend the bulk of your time on the casino floor and take advantage of the Hotel amenities then you should book elsewhere. However if you are looking for a decent place at a good price that you can use as your home-base while you explore the strip, Hooters is spot on.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kearns, Utah", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth It!\u201d", "Author": "aminard_7", "ReviewID": "UR78477958", "Content": "I was disappointed after how much money this hotel cost, that it was not a lot nicer.

As we walked to our room which was out by the pool we were hit with a foul smell (think of the worst port-o-potty you have ever been in) And also the smell of used grease from the restaurant. Still our hopes were high until we were hit with another cover up smell in the room and then the list of things wrong started to pile up. First the safe was locked so we had to call security to open it. While we waited for security to show up my wife went out the back patio door fo a smoke and the sliding glass door fell off the tracks, so then we had to wait for a maintenance guy to show up well 20 minutes later I finally fixed the door myself. Then it wouldn't lock so when security finally did show up we got it to lock with some team work of pushing and pulling. So we finally decide to shower and wouldn't you guess it the shower didn't work! Which was followed but a hair drier that didn't work. Finally after three hair driers later we were out the door. You would think after all the complaints and misfortunes we had that they would try to make us happy by an upgrade when all of this was brought to their attention but they just moved us rooms.

We stayed here mainly due to the deal we got on a package through Sam's Club and the proximity to the strip. We read pages upon pages of reviews - and still decided to try it out! One of the first things I learned about Vegas - your room is just for quick naps and you're hardly ever in it. With that said, at $15 per night....do you need 5 stars? We had a king-bed room on the 9th floor with a view overlooking the strip - Tropicana, Luxor, MGM, NY/NY, Excalibur. I thought it was pretty awesome! The room cleanliness was 3.5/5 - \"wing sauce\" stain on the floor and missing complimentary toiletries (namely shampoo and conditioner). Bed had a down comforter and was pretty comfortable. A/C unit worked well and the blinds made the room extra dark (especially when we went to bed at 9am)! We swam one night at about midnight - the pool area was pretty much ours. Two OK hot tubs and two decent pools. The one with the waterfall was to cold for me and I'm used to swimming in 70 degree Lake Erie! You don't have to bring a towel, they are provided in the \"resort fee\" at 24/hr gift shop. The towels are very small - you might want to grab two! If you're going here to see \"world class\" Hooters girls...don't. I counted three pregnant one's in the 30 minutes it took us to eat dinner! The Hooters restaurant on site is average - there are much better food choices in Vegas than this! My wife and I really enjoyed the casino as inexperienced gamblers. The drink always seemed to flow very freely on slots and at tables. We played roulette for the first time here - the table attendant was not friendly, but the couple sitting next to us helped us out a lot. We purchased a package that included 2 tickets for 10 free wings (they wouldn't let us use it at the same meal- so we gave one away!!!), 2 free drinks at the pool bar (waited 15 minutes for service), 2 free tickets to a show (we chose the Dirty Jokes show - worth it for \"free!\"), $100 in slot play (laughable!)...and I think 2 more free drinks. Although near the strip...sometimes it felt like it wasn't easily accessible. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS VEGAS STREETS AT ANYWHERE BUT A CROSS WALK/BRIDGE. We bought a 3 day monorail pass instead of using taxis. The monorail station was at the MGM and directly across the street from Hooters. However, you had to walk a block or two up to get to a crosswalk and then the same to get back down to the station. I guess I am just used to \"J\" walking whenever I need to cross a street! OVERALL - I would \"probably\" go back...my wife wants to stay on the strip. However, we both had FUN! We gambled there a lot and have not gotten any comps/offers in the mail. I spent a lot less at other casinos and have all ready received comparable rates to the package we bought. If you're in your 20's or early 30's or are just a cheapskate, then this hotel maybe for you. It reminded me a lot of my fraternity house in my college days - spilled drinks and sticky floors in the elevator, puke in the hallways, scantly clad women walking around, random stains in the carpet, mis-matched paint on the walls, etc...but an over all good time!

The rooms were enormous, the largest of any budget hotel I've ever been in. Let's face it - if you're in Las Vegas, it's not like you're going to be spending much time in your room. Therefore, why spend silly money on the strip? If you want to do Vegas on a budget, Hooters is a great choice. One small thing - there's a misconception that Hooters is a hotel for guys only, with girls in tiny shorts floating about everywhere. This isn't true - I saw lots of couples and families at the hotel. In fact, I got talking to my neighbour on the 5th floor who was a lady from Minnesota who was sharing a room with her elderly mother who was seriously ill and wanted to do Vegas while she had the chance.

Come back at 2:30 (when we were told the room would be ready) and had to wait until 4:15 to get keys. if it was going to be 4:15 why didn't they say 4:15 and not 2:30? room was clean, no complaints at this point. number of towels is a little light for 2 people and they are very cheap and thin - that coupled with the heavy detergent used on then = room for improvement. this is a typical 20's patron hotel and when you get up in the morning and go get coffee, it is a complete crap shoot as to what will be found in the hallways and elevators. no exception this sunday morning - a big pile of pool sand or sugar int he hallway, plam tree leaves and almost completed chicken wing bones lay in wait from the room door to the elevator. nice stuff. So we leave the room/hotel sunday morning at 9:00am and get back at 6:00pm to find the room uncleaned. call house keeping - no answer, call front desk and get a girl who basically tells me \"this is not my problem and you will need to talk to house keeping about that\" and hung up on me!!!! seriously?????? call house keeping back and after 15 rings get someone that answers the phone. tell them what my room number is and that the room has not been cleaned and she sys she'll get it taken care of. we leave for dinner and come back expecting the room to be dirty - but the towels were swapped out and the bed was made, nothing else. so after complaining i got less than the INDUSTRY STANDARD for hotel stays.

The hotel delivered on the first two criteria but massively failed me on the third, although failure was in fact part of my expectation for the brand. I'm not a fan of Hooters Restaurants (I find them misogynistic and crude) but I was quite happy to go with the flow if their was tangible enthusiasm on their side. In spite of my theoretical contempt for their misogyny, I'm not above a little flirtation and titillation, and especially at the end of a long tiring flight. Well, what a disappointment. I expected a buxom cute Front Desk staffer; instead, I got a sullen, bored, going-through-the-motions staffer not even dressed in the Hooters Girls uniform. She couldn't have been less interested in me or my stay, and seemed extremely irritated by the bother of having to check me in. And at a $32 room rate, I guess I could understand that - but no excuse. My online booking was supposed to come with $x of free slots chips and two free beers at the bar, but when I asked for them I was flatly denied, and after a long trans-continental flight and no real passion for gambling anyway, I didn't bother to press the point. Walking through the casino to the elevators was an exercise in sociological depression, looking at all the sad, marginalized, white trash patrons trying to convince themselves they were living some down-market version of the Vegas dream. And nowhere was there any evidence of the Hooters brand I was looking for: only 2 Hooters Girls waitresses did I see (neither of them buxom!) and none of the irrepressible, irreverent attitude that's supposed to make this place fun in spite of all the political incorrectness against which they rail. In a way, it was precisely what I was expecting: sad, sleazy, depressing, and dirt cheap: I slept for 5 years (the room was comfortable enough but felt like it was at the end of a shuttle to Mars it felt so far away and isolated), and then got the hell out. On my way out, the same girl who checked me in was still on shift when I checked out, and her attitude had not improved (nor her memory as she apparently had zero recollection of me checking in 6 hours earlier). In summary: to expand your horizons (downwards) for a cheap-as-chips alternative to sleeping on an airport bench, Hooters will give you a clean-enough bed close to the airport ($32, you can't go wrong for mere shelter); for anything, anything else in Vegas - you can do better.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno", "Title": "\u201cSee for yourself\u201d", "Author": "bkdyer", "ReviewID": "UR58802743", "Content": "We have stayed there often but the room we received needed repairs.

Was concerned that these needs not being met would be an issue as reservations on room types is not garanteed any where in Vegas. Found that Hooters was the only hotel / casino to list their casino hosts on their web page. So we took advantage of this information and contacted not only the hotel manager but also casino host Faye Able. Faye responded almost immedicately (other hotel / casinos took weeks to reply) and promised to make everything happen for us. A quick note to her the day before our trip served as the reminder she asked for. Room was comfortable and accommodating with rustic tropical wood decor. Beds were soft yet firm. Pillows allowed for comfort while sleeping and for propping oneself up to watch TV. Our strip view was fantastic! Had views from Mandalay Bay to New York New York. Daily maid service made sure we remained comfortable our entire stay. We even extended our stay by one night. Concierge was very successful in ordering us a second scooter from Las Vegas Scooters which enabled me to keep up with my hubby. Our request was called in to concierge at 7:30 AM or so and we received the scooter at 10 AM. Mad Onion restaurant for breakfast buffet was decent. A bit simple compared to others at larger locations, but included good quality basics. Eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, biscuits and sausage gravy, fruits and pastries. We came back for dinner one night and actually ordered from breakfast menu. Good filling food. We never went away hungry or disappointed. Hubby never did get a seat at BJ table, but there were plenty of slot machines for him to occupy his time in the evenings. Todd Paul show was good. Room was cold, but entertainment was good. He offered a meet and greet with photo ops as guests left the lounge. Don't know if we would have paid to see his show if it had not been included with our stay as we've never heard of him before. (Sheltered lives...maybe) Decent location just a bit east of the strip near the south end of the \"main strip\" area. Very close to airport runways, but noise was never an issue in our room. Did hear them a few times while watching take offs while waiting for elevators. But nothing that would be a deal breaker.

Spent 2 nights at the Trump Tower in a 1 bedroom suite for 150/night and wanted to stay one night at Hooters just for the fun of it, since we like the Casino there and love the wings. What a mistake. Upon checking in, we were told by the front desk staff that the room we were booked in was 'old and run down' and they suggested that we upgrade. We had prepaid 40.00 for a regular bungalow room. I asked what the cost would be to upgrade and was quoted that a nicer room in the tower would be 75.00. I specifically asked if the total cost of the room would be 75.00, or if that was the cost in addition to what we had already paid. I was told that 75.00 was the total cost for the room, which was a suite. I agreed to the upgrade and we went up to the room. Please know that I understand that this is a 3 star hotel and that the theme of the hotel is 'Delightfully tacky yet unrefined'. We were ready for some intentionally bad decor. What we were not ready for was the poor state of repair that the room was in, tacky decor aside, the hideously outdated bathrooms with linoleum peeling up from the floors and the complete lack of service or regard from the staff. When we arrived in our room, I immediately called housekeeping to ask for extra blankets. I was advised that there were no clean blankets available for delivery and that they were all currently being washed. I told the rather unfriendly housekeeping representative that anything would do, a blanket or a comforter or even some extra sheets, and she still insisted that there was nothing clean in the entire hotel that she could bring me. Really? Three hours later, there was a banging on the door and when I opened it, there lying on the floor outside of the door was a rolled up comforter. I should also note that as a part of our reservation package, we were supposed to get free breakfast coupons. We didn't get the coupons and when I asked about them I was advised that the promotion was no longer going on, even though I booked this room last week. Upon check out, I was shocked to be presented with a bill for almost 100.00. I asked what the charges were for and was advised that the upgrade fee was 75.00. I explained that I had been told that the entire cost of the room was 75.00 and the 40.00 I had already paid would be applied to that. The girl just shook her head at me and stared past me as if I wasn't even there and said 'No, the upgrade was 75.00 on top of what you already paid.\" I asked to speak to a manager and was advised that there was no one available. I imagine they must have been washing blankets or something. In summary, I would never ever in my life stay at this hotel again. Ultimately, I shelled out 115.00 to stay in a 'suite' at a 3 star hotel with bad dirty carpet, hideously old and decrepit bathrooms and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Shocking, considering I had just spent 2 nights in a one bedroom suite at the Trump for 150.00 per night with an enormous marble bathroom, stunning decor, a full kitchen and was treated like royalty. There is nothing delightfully tacky about this piece of crap hotel. Come for the wings and the casino, and then leave. *Business travelers beware: You are charged a resort fee at this hotel, but it does not include internet service.

Like others have mentioned, they sell out of the bungalow rooms fast so you'll be offered a free \"upgrade\" upon check in. I would imagine all the rooms are the same except for the presidential and international suites. The rooms in the towers are attached to the casino/lobby. The bungalow rooms surround the pool but are not connected to the casino. The pool area looked clean and professional. We did not test the water but I have no reason to believe it was anything less than acceptable. The staff was friendly at check-in (~15 min) and throughout our stay. The hooters restaurant was one of the best I've been to recently. The waitresses did not have bad attitudes or seem unhappy like some hooters around the country. Dan Marino's is a little weak as far as upscale dining. We chose to eat at Smith and Wolensky, The Palm, Spago for fine dining. We ordered room service one morning. The service was quick and the food was hot. Probably a better deal than Marino's breakfast buffett too. The room was clean, bed was nice, bathroom was acceptable, hallways and elevator areas were clean and well lit. I did not see any reason to complain especially for the price. The casino has a generous amount of slots and other computer games. The table games are sparce. 2 roulette tables, 4 bj, 2 craps, and a couple different poker tables. They do offer a daily poker tournament with reasonable buy in. I did not feel uncomfortable with the patrons in the casino. Plenty of security presence. The location is ok if you don't mind walking or taking cabs. It's approx. $10 to cab to mid strip (ceasar's, ph, paris, etc...) Walking to the strip depends on your pace but a brisk pace put us in front of MGM on the strip in approx 10 minutes. We did not check out the enterainment or nightlife at hooter's but you can receive free tickets to the magic show by signing up for the owl club rewards card. This was my 3rd trip to vegas in '09. I probably will not stay here again due to location. We enjoy being on the strip moreso than off. If you are looking for a clean, safe, cheap room close to the strip this is your place.

Pros: Small casino - easy to get to/from your room. Didn't do much gambling, but made out pretty good on what I did, and the cocktail waitresses were quick to bring comped drinks, even when I was just playing penny slots. Very friendly staff - upgraded my room for free, bartenders were cool and made good drinks. Nice eye candy from most of the Hooters girls. Decent location - technically off the strip, but you can be on Las Vegas Blvd. within minutes. If you cross Tropicana to the MGM's back entrance, it is a quick walk to get to the monorail. If you're planning to go downtown, you can head a block south and get the route 109, which is cheaper, less crowded, and much faster than the Deuce. Room service food was good overall - got to my room in about 15 minutes and the quality of the food actually wasn't that bad. Good deals on food if you're not too picky - the Dan Marino's tries to be classy but basically it's a glorified Hooters. The 25 cent wings after midnight did hit the spot after a long day of drinking though. Beds were clean and comfortable. It was actually pretty quiet in the hallways and I didn't hear any noise from my neighbors - overall I got some good sleep in the room. Cons: Elevators look and sound like they're about to collapse. They're almost as bad as the notorious ones at the Imperial Palace. Hallways and rooms are in serious need of rehab. New paint job and carpets are in order - lots of stains, cigarette burns, etc. A room service tray I placed outside of my room to be picked up was left there for over 24 hours. Ice and soda machines on the floor did not work. A/C unit was extremely loud. TV seemed like it was about to go on the fritz - sound kept going in and out. Ordered a movie one night and it kept going back to the PPV menu. Overall, if you're a guy looking for a cheap room to basically sleep and shower in, and aren't picky about your accomodations, this might fit the bill. Overall, if you're looking for cheap digs, I would prefer getting something closer to midstrip like Imperial Palace or Bill's, but if you get a good deal, Hooters may be worth your while. FYI - do not take a shuttle from the airport to get here. I figured that since Hooters was so close to the airport, it would be a quick trip - no such luck.

The pool area had security guards which was good as there were a few that had had a bit too much to drink - they took care of any unsavoury characters quickly and discreetly. The only complaint I have about the pool is that there were no pool attendants to clear away used towels, empty drink containers, debris etc. Great value and a fun place to stay.

The casino area is small, and the bar near the entrance of the hotel is tiny, but we only really use it as a meeting point, or for a quick drink before heading out elsewhere. There is a restaurant called Dan Marino's, I have eaten there a few times for breakfast, and it does good food and is handy late at night when you've got the munchies. There is a 24 hour shop next door to Hooters too, so you can get drink and snacks to have in your room from there, as well as toiletries etc, so that's handy. The gambling area is very small, and the only negative about Hooters is I don't view it as a hotel you'd go to for a night out, as it is small and doesn't have a proper bar. I just like it because it is cheap, good value for money, and the rooms serve their purpose.

If you're looking for the same and you can get a really low rate then Hooters is fine for a quick night. It's on Tropicana Blvd across from the MGM hotel(and monorail station), about a five minute or less walk to the strip. Check-in The Attached parkade didn't appear to have an elavator but there is parking out front. My wife and I checked in and they were out of the bungalow rooms we had booked so they \"upgraded\" us to a tower room for the same rate. Check-in was quick and friendly but be aware they charge you $5 each night for a resort fee. It's not a resort.....The casino area is all right, basically a hooters restaurant with slot machines and tables. Rooms When Hooters bought the hotel they threw down some new carpet, painted the walls and nailed up some surfboards in the halls. Be warned the halls are dim and and the dark paint doesn't help much. The rooms aren't anything to write home about; the beds and sheets were clean and comfortable, the linoleum was old and peeling in the bathroom, the fixtures were old and stained, the walls were thin and the sliding window to the false deck didn't lock. A typical budget motel room. Public areas The casino was fun with a party atmosphere, lots of good games, and access to cheap drinks if your not gambling. The free form pool was built when they bought the hotel and is the highlight of the property with a bar, a few hot tubs, a waterfall and sandy areas for lounging. Dan Marinos is a 24 hour restaurant with a late night wing special and a breakfast buffet. (get the 2-1 coupon for signing up for the Owl Club players card.) They also have a Hooters restaurant, comedy theatre, Dixies country bar and another casual bar. Overall, Hooters is O.K for a night for the under 40 crowd, I would recommend it to a friend for a cheap place to stay close to the airport, it would be great for a bachelor party but I wouldn't recommend it to a single women because of the dark halls and laxed security.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cWorth a look for those on a budget.\u201d", "Author": "007DAWG", "ReviewID": "UR33468925", "Content": "The casino is fun, the pool is decent and the price is right.

I had read the reviews and was prepared for a mediocre place, thinking we'd be spending most of our time outside the hotel anyway, so the hotel itself didn't matter much. But I was pleasantly surprised - the room was fine, plenty of pillows, no waits at the registration counters, no extra charges, a great view of the mountains, extremely polite housecleaning staff. Great value if you ask me! Here's the rundown: Casino: Very loud sports-bar-ish, nothing upscale or elegant about it. But considering it's Hooters, what do you expect? One drawback... the elevators to our room were at the far end of the casino, so you had to walk the entire casino every time you wanted to go to your room. Luckily it wasn't a huge casino like some others, but would have been nice to have the elevators a bit more convenient. Restaurants/Bars: Ate at the Hooters restaurant the first night. Felt like a Hooters. Went to the Dixie's Dam Bar the first night also. Somewhat strange experience. Lots of blaring hip-hop music with a few gorgeous dancers clearly employed by the bar, surrounded by a bunch of middle aged men just standing and staring. We didn't stay long. Location: Was fine... had hoped for an easier trip from the airport, given that it's IMMEDIATELY next to it, but the cab ride from the airport is still $13, and the airport shuttle bus (at $6.50 per person) drops off at Hooters last, making it a long trip. But walking to the strip wasn't hard... Just go through the Tropicana parking lot and you're on the strip, with elevated walkways taking you to New York New York and MGM Grand. Pool: Looked nice and seemed fairly popular during the day... only one of the two hot tubs worked, but it was pleasant enough the one night we used it. Parking: Had a small parking lot right in front, and we never had any problem finding a spot. It was easily the most convenient parking of any hotel we visited. Cleanliness: A little mildew around the tub, and the window was little dirty making the view not quite as nice as it could have been, but otherwise no complaints... and certainly clean enough given the low price! Service: We had no bad service experiences... I was actually blown away by the friendliness of the maid in the morning. When we accidentally locked ourselves out of the room bathroom they sent up someone to unlock it within about 10 minutes. Loudness: There were a couple times when people from the pool were pretty loud (even from our room on the 17th floor), but it didn't bother us. We were in Vegas for a good time, with no kids, so a little bit of drunk singing wasn't an issue. It didn't go on too long or too late, and the other rooms around us were perfectly quiet. Overall: Giving this hotel a 4-star rating based on the value of what you get for the money... if it were more expensive, the rating would probably be a three.

Ok, if I took my wife to Vegas she'd want to go to somewhere a bit more 'swanky' but I was well impressed with Hooters for the price. We paid for the cheapest of rooms (bungalow) and then tipped the reception guy well for an upgrade and ended up with a tower room with Strip view. A couple of small marks on the carpet is the only fault I could find with the room and otherwise it was ideal for us. A 5 night stay cost us under \u00a3200 and so less than \u00a340 a night, \u00a320 per person. That's value in my book. The casino is only small by Vegas standards but one advantage was the waitresses on the casino floor soon get to recognise you and know you're a resident, in which case they're well free and easy with the drinks. You don't even have to be actually playing a table or a machine and they'll bring you whatever you ask for. Dan Morhino's Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment frankly - nothing more than average. However, it was my first introduction to the Hooters Restaurant and their variety of hot chicken wings, fries with chilli con carne and cheese etc. Delicious! I'd definitely go back here and all the staff were perfectly helpful, albeit we didn't have any specific problems. Great location too - right end of the Strip for all the action and directly opposite the main entrance to MGM Grand, which is where our Boxing match was. I give Hooters 9/10 overall, provided you always know it's pretty damn cheap and you're not expecting to be treated like royalty for that price!", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cSo-so room, rude personnel\u201d", "Author": "Daylove", "ReviewID": "UR29726738", "Content": "Booked the Hotel online and we selected the Tower rooms, room was spacious and acceptable for the price.

I did some serious research and found out that the Hooters Hotel is next to the MGM Grand Hotel, right across from each other. I was sick of paying for taxi cabs in Vegas. I decided to walk from Hooters to anywhere in the strip which was fun because you walk through hotel to hotel which isn't bad at all. The price is super cheap, the rooms are comfortable. The rooms are always clean, you can ask for queen beds which they give you two of them. There is 25 cent wings from 12 midnight to 5 a.m. at Dan Marino's. The wings are big and breaded which is a plus and taste awesome. So why pick Hooters, if your a person that is all about not being complicated by your hotel and walking a lot you should come to Hooters. In Vegas your goal is not to spend a lot of time in your hotel but to go to clubs or check out the nice hotels and use the money you saved on the clubs you want to go to. The poker room is amazing being a $1-2 table. The sports room is small but you can place sporting bets which is nice meaning they have that. The girls that work there look great, they really stand out. Hooters is a great headquarters to where you can eat and sleep there but then go out and party in the big hotels and clubs and come back to a relaxing quiet hotel. You will not find any hotels on the strip that come close to price and hospitality as to the Hooters Hotel. Just remember the hotel is small but that make you their primary focus. They have fun card games, they offer comps if you earn them. Hooters Rewards have a coupon sheet given to new Owl Rewards members which is awesome. You can hang out and talk to the pretty girls dealing cards at the hotel, build up your coinfidence and meet other nice ladies throughout the city, its a win win situation. There are plenty of free drinks if you gamble so you have nothing to lose. All these reasons make the Hooters Hotel # 1. Be realistic, stay within your budget, your not going to spend a lot of time in a 4 or 5 star hotel and spend 250 to 300 dollars a night, realize that your playing for what check in at 4 at most 4 or 5 star hotels to leave at 11 or 12 am, thats 20 hours by 300 dollars means your losing 15 dollars a hour or go to Hooters and pay 40 to 80 dollars a night and that works out to 2 to 4 dollars a hour so do the math. I rate Hooters a 3.8 out of 5 stars. Hooters is a hotel that constantly rewards its customers with coupons, comps, and inexpensive food and inexpensive room rates.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cNice beddings\u201d", "Author": "alhambramd", "ReviewID": "UR28799465", "Content": "A little bit off the strip, I once went to this casino to walk around and thought it was overrated.

On the other hand, if you are looking for an inexpensive room in a fun hotel/casino that you are not likely to get lost in, this is your place. It is a small, fun hotel and casino with brightly colored lights, fun music and a party atmosphere all around. The whole hotel is a bit reminiscent of a beachy/surfer atmosphere down to the surfboards hanging on the walls and the \"sandy footprints\" in the hallways. My trip was a 5 day stay from Wednesday through Monday during Spring Break/March Madness so the city was hopping. I went with three college friends and even with being four 20-something girls staying at Hooters, we had a blast and really enjoyed the hotel. We also felt extremely safe, as we had difficulty with an obnoxious drunk guy harassing one of our friends one night. The security, casino, and hotel staff were wonderful and took care of it immediately. The room cost us $39 (Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights) to $99 per night (Friday and Saturday nights). The rooms were nothing terribly special, similar to a Holiday Inn or any other basic hotel chain you might stay at (also similar to your average room at Excalibur, Tropicana, etc) but the room was clean, the beds were comfortable, in-room safe was provided, and our view was of the south end of the strip - NYNY, Exalibur, Mandalay Bay, the Luxor, the MGM, and the Tropicana and was stunning at night. Some people say this hotel is off-strip and technically it is, but it is basically like being on the strip. It is next door to the Tropicana and across the street from the MGM grand - it is about the same walking distance to the strip as from either of those places once you account for the fact that both of those casinos are much larger and it takes a long time to get to your room once inside. We had friends staying at Excalibur and the Tropicana, and it didn't take us any longer to get back to our room from an activity than it did for them. The pool was warm - a bit small, but fun and PACKED when we were there. It was definitely a party atmosphere in the pool area, lots of people in our age range and high-energy music playing. The pool bar (nippers) served great frozen drinks and there was towel service. In the casino, all of the dealers (a mix of Hooters girls and regular dealers) were friendly and helpful. The casino is small, but laidback and fun and a good place to wind down the evening. Everything is decorated in bright lights and light pine and the music is always jamming. The only real complaint we had was about the restaurant (not the Hooters one) - we went for brunch our second day and the service was slow and the food overpriced.

The furniture mimics the Hooters resturant, with the orange lamps and official Hooters magazine on the desk with suggestively posed Hooters girls throughout it. Although advertised as Floridan style, the fake palm tree and bedspread were probably the nicest attractions in the rooms. The artwork is guy related with Hooters bar paintings and boats. Stains litter the hallway and bedroom rugs. One of my plug outlets didn't work, and although Hooters website says coffee makers are included in the room you have to request it. I requested mine 5 times over the course of 2 days, 4 times by phone and 1 time at the main desk. You can hear everyone's conversations as you walk by their rooms. The ultimate kicker was that the website states the tower rooms have a view of the strip. Well mine.. was the view of the airport landing strip. The plus is that Dan Marino's resturant is excellent and if you want some \"Coyete Ugly\" dancing and drinking try out Dixie's which you will be sure to get a free admission card from the guys advertising the bar outfront in the lobby.

The Standard room was okay. It was large and the bed was comfortable but lights didn't work, the bathroom tile was chipped, and you had to call housekeeping to request whatever was missing from the room such as ice container and coffee maker. I was on the 10th floor in the Bay View tower which over looked the airport and the Extended Stay America and Motel Six and I kid you not every day there were four cop cars over there busting people. It was good entertainment but was a little worriesome. The SASS spa was great. The people there were very friendly. The hooters girls were also really nice. Actually the all of the staff were great.

I didnt expect anything from this place at all, maybe it was unfair to jugde before I got there.

The doorways had some paint chipping and general scuffs here and there in the rooms, but nothing bad where we stayed. The prices have gone up some for food and drinks, since the San Remo days, but so has every place in Vegas. Hooters is still a VERY economical and convenient place to stay. It doesn't take you an hour to get to and from your room, or to make your rounds through the casino to find your friends. The drinks were very good, actually WITH alcohol in them ( unlike some \"big\" casinos serve) and the pool area was nice and cozy with a hot tub and a fire pit with benches around it.

This was a pure mental health trip as we both needed a break from work and kids and\u2026you name it! Las Vegas has a good way of balancing things out for us. This trip however, presented a new challenge for us\u2026Vegas on a budget! Cash was a little tight for this trip, so we split gas with some friends and found a killer deal on a hotel. Hooters Hotel and casino presented the perfect opportunity. As travel professionals, we managed to get the room at half the usual weekend rate. That brought the price down to $100.00 for the weekend, can\u2019t argue with that. The d\u00e9cor at the hotel can most readily be described as a type of \u201cSpring Break\u201d atmosphere. Amidst the gambling tables and machines is a very welcoming beach atmosphere complete with decorative surfboards, grass skirt style paneling on the walls, palm trees and a beach concert style stage with dance floor. Not particularly incredible to look at, as compared to neighboring hotels, but not bad at all. For the money we paid as well as the money they asked for, I\u2019d say it was well worth it. Of course there were the \u201cHooters girls\u201d walking around in their tank tops and short shorts, but all done very tastefully, nothing scandalous. That surprised me a bit, I though Hooters in Las Vegas would be way over the top on the T & A scale, but it was very low key and subtle. There\u2019s still plenty of flesh to feast your eyes on if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after! The rooms were really interesting. The presentation itself follows the rest on the hotel in that Spring Break feel. They\u2019re very warm and basic, giving the feel of a beach house with bamboo trim on the walls and a hardened wicker cabinet for the TV. The bathroom was standard size, nothing special, however they do provide perhaps the best hotel soap I\u2019ve ever used. It didn\u2019t leave your skin felling strange at all, very soft. Everything else about the room was great. No bad smells, everything was clean as a whistle, plenty of toiletry items and not a bad view of the pool area. The elevators may be a little scary for you claustrophobics out there. They were very tight and a little shaky, no big deal though. My girl got a little worried, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fall are we?\u201d She\u2019s a crack up\u2026 The restaurants were pretty good. Nothing fancy, just what you might expect from a building with the Hooters logo all over it, nice bar and grill atmosphere. The food was really good and moderately priced. The thing that sticks out most in my mind was the fact that their restaurant was open all night. This was perfect after it was too late to venture out and things were closing up. It would have been a long walk from where Hooters is to get to our favorite eateries. Having a 24 hour spot at the hotel that didn\u2019t cost and arm and a leg came in handy more than once. This may have been the perfect place to have a low budget Vegas trip without sacrificing the action of being on the strip. Hooters still boasted an on-strip location making things accessible. We had a lovely time without breaking the bank and we didn\u2019t have to stay in a dump either. I\u2019d certainly recommend Hooters for anyone looking to do Vegas on a modest budget and still be close enough to the action to not have to drive everywhere.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego Ca", "Title": "\u201cMy last time staying here\u201d", "Author": "sd101", "ReviewID": "UR22496250", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel over Thanksgiving and I took advantage of some of the freebies they had offered, ie free breakfast buffet for 2 and $ 200.00 free slot play. Me and my wife ate at the buffet the first morning using the free coupon, it was ok but we could not see going back the next day and spending $9.99 a person on that buffet. It was a combination of ready to serve quick heat food and dry danishes. I have stayed at a Marrott hotel and the \"free\" breakfast there was much better. The elevators going to the garages were filthy. We didnt even try to eat in the Hooters Restaurant there becouse the last time we were there earlier this summer the service was extremely poor. The second morning we were there the maids were out in the hall in the early morning cleaning the rooms. We left and got back around 4pm and discovered our room wasnt even cleaned. I had to go to the desk, wait in line 20 mins and complain about it. An hour later 2 maids showed up to clean the room. Bottom line,,,,,,,,this is a dated hotel that the Hooters Corp has bought, threw some surfboards in the hall and decorated in wood. Ive been here twice and the service has been poor. My advice is take your money and for about the same price,,,,,usually less,, stay down the road in the Orleans.

I thought all a long this deal is too good to be true, and Hooters is going to be a let down. I read some pretty poor reviews, and expectations where certainly not high. But all I wanted was a roof over my head, a clean room, and some reasonable food and service. Firstly the location. I knew it was near to the MGM grand, which is huge, but right on the strip. You are literally 5 minutes walk away from the main strip and have good access to New York New York, MGM, Excalibur and many more hotels. It cost us just $12 from the Airport to the Hotel, and you can see it as you land. Secondly, the staff. 99% of the time great. Everyone was very friendly, and more so with it being Thanks Giving. I find some of the reviews people left saying the staff where moody and bad is probably a reflection on the reviewers personality. The staff where great with me and my friends, always a good morning, and always offering assistance. There was the odd one who was a bit moody, but you get that everywhere. Also on the staff, the Hooters girls got progressively better as the week went on. The girls in Dixies where just phenomenal to look at, and again, very friendly. Food and Drink was very well placed, like it was in most of Vegas. $4 for American beers, and $1 draught at night in Dixies is great value. Even with the weak pound to dollar. We ate in the Hooters restaurant one night, and again, service was great, and the food very good. The room was much more than I expected. We had clean towels every day, a reasonable selection of TV, and it was clean and tidy. Some people must have got a dodgey room, because mine was spot on the mark. If I had one complaint is that you get a 50/50 of what your view is. One side is the strip, one side is Motel 6 and the Airfield. Shame that, but did you come to Vegas to look out your window?! No, the real reason we went to Vegas was to gamble. And while you want to big it up in the big casino's, Hooters is a great place to start and end the night. And as said earlier, the location is spot on near the strip, and near the monorail stations into the middle of the strip also. Overall, did I expect a lot? No. Did it go beyond the expectations? Yes. I would have no problem recommending Hooters to friends, and I would have no problem staying myself their again. The only reason I wouldn't is so that I could see the rest of the fine hotels in Vegas, but when I return if I don't stay at Hooters, I will certainly pay a visit.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cCheezy as expected - but worth the $29 to be less thank a block from the Strip\u201d", "Author": "mandlintx", "ReviewID": "UR22283670", "Content": "Check-in staff were not friendly and neither were the lady bartenders (maybe because I'm a girl).

The walls are so thin, unbelievable.Breakfast another bad experience $9.99, but watch out, juices, toast etc extra. The basic breakfast was a poor selection, but then again it was $9.99! Service was poor, being held waiting for seating when the place was nearly empty was a joke.Waiting staff, bar one lady, was dreadfull, no tips there.The whole place was well below par in every respect. To add insult on check out, we were OK, but our friends were handed a bill for drinks they never had. Someone had charged a large round of 9 Buds & prawn cocktails to their room No. Obviously bar staff did not care to check validty of the order. They did not pay that & await the outcome.When you look at the deals now on in Vegas, in hindsight we should have just turned up & got in the MGM of Venetian as my friends wife wished, plenty of room. Sadly we stuck it out from Monday to departing on Saturday morning,our fault there!! So any one reading this, please, please do not go to Hooters, it is certainly not a Hoot, quite dreadfull.

The maintenance in the rooms were nil. Our bathroom had multiple mold and rust stains, missing shower curtain rings, toothpaste on the front of the sink, dirt in the crevices of the bathroom floor.

There is a small balconey too which is nice. I watched planes land at McCarran for awhile while enjoying a drink. Oh, the sheets and towels were stained with what looked like coffee.

I think it is the same one that runs Sam's Town as they use the same toiletries. They also run Saddle West in Pahrump, NV, which I have stayed at several times. Also, the walls are very thin. I was woken at 1am by the couple next door having an argument. I would usually enjoy hearing a couple fight but not at that time of day(night). Hooters restaurant serves good grub at OK prices. It's nothing fancy but the portions are large and tasty, and they bring you drink refills without you even having to ask. The casino was fun. I didn't make money but hit enough good bonus rounds to play for a few hours and drink the free Michelobs. Drink service is very good here.

The room was scary, from worn bedspreads and filth, too the poor workmanship of the wood that was added to the ceiling and every place else that it was put. We won't even talk about how bad the carpet needed cleaned and in someplaces needed replaced. It looked like they took the old San Remos nice clean rooms and tried to give them a cheap facelift. A GOOD CLEANING WOULD HAVE GONE A LOT FURTHER. The extremely loud music and extra gaming tables they squeezed in to the \"casino\" area made it hard to get around. There were a lot of \"seedy\" looking people lurking around, that made me feel uncomfortable. We thought we were stuck there for 8 Days. Thankfully, my husband, after discussing our misfortune, while setting up a players card at Sam's Town Hotel & Casino, was offered the same price $40.00 per night. We jumped at the chance to put Hooters behind us and actually have a great vacation. Also, they did not require $750.00 or even $500.00 in case we damaged anything. They were more than happy to have us.

Don't think of this hotel and casino as part of the strip. Because its not. Don't think of this hotel and casino as luxury, or high end, because its not. However, its not all bad. The hotel has very friendly service. The casino games were easier to win at oppose to others on the strip, and the hotel rooms were spacious and clean. Not to mention, the beds were phenominal ! The location and price can't be beat either. The pool was great, the entertainment was good, and the hooter girls are dressed just as approriately as most of the other casinos. The hotel is showing its age, and is in need of another renovation. In summary, If you are the traveller who doesn't mind staying at a motel 6 or the type who won't be spending any time at the hotel....Hooters is perfect for you. If you are the traveller who has high expectations, wants to be impressed, and/or pampered, don't be fooled by Hooters marketing, its not for you.

Those that don't spend much time in their room or have relatively low expectations will LOVE this steal of a hotel. Hotel snobs should look elsewhere. Also, skip the breakfast buffet which was sub-par. You can get much better food elsewhere for the same cost. Play the 25 cent video poker/blackjack at the bar at the back of the casino.

The smell which was fresh paint, covering smoke stained walls and topped off with cheap air freshener was sickening - I literally became ill from the stench!

We stood in line and a very cranky man signed us up. We then stood in another line where 12 or so machines are roped off and pre-set to pay out on what I'd venture to say is a specific schedule. Many of the casinos offer $10 of slot play in the machine of your choice.

My visit was the weekend of 19-20 June, 2008. I traveled alone, for a reunion and retirement ceremonies for my military unit. The price was $109 per night for the two weekend nights. For the location, this was a very good price. Hooters is about 200 yards from the busiest intersection in Las Vegas, where the Strip intersects Tropicana Blvd. Walking was easy from one property to another; there are pedestrian walkways above the street, for all four possible street crossings. I did not use the $20 bill trick, because the room did not matter. *Remember, when you do tip the desk clerk at check-in, be ready to ask for what you want! \"Pool View\", \"Quiet Room\", \"Strip View\" or \"Upgrade\" are the common requests, here. My room was in the taller, Ocean Tower, 16th floor. The window faced the Strip-Tropicana intersection. This made for a fabulous view! I left the drapes open all night, so that I could see the Strip at any time. The view was clear enough to read the signs and watch the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York, New York Hotel. The room was fine. It was a major upgrade from similar rooms when the hotel was the San Remo. It had a tropical (Florida?) motif, and solid wood accents were throughout the room. The AC was fine, the bed was king-sized, and the bathroom was fine. The small casino was always active, and there were always plenty of orange shorts around. The table games are tighter than you can get elsewhere. WARNING: think twice before accepting the \"Free $100 in Slot Play\". You may have to stand in a long line to play a specific machine. The people in line looked like they were suffering, and those at the machines seemed to be just \"getting it over with\". There were constant elevator problems. Only one lift was available for the entire Ocean Tower. When this is the case, the hotel should open the stairs doors, so the more fit patrons can move quickly! Don't lose your precious Vegas time waiting for a lift! The parking garage is nice, and Valet was quick(only used once). I was confused about breakfast options; it wasn't until I got home that I found out that Marino's had a breakfast buffet. I'm sure I missed it somewhere in the Services booklet, but it needs to be posted prominently. Marino's is a steakhouse; a guest will not immediately assume that there is breakfast there. I always left in the mornings. There is a naughty-girl vibe about the Hooters. Surprisingly, a large percentage of the clientele is young females, who seem to enjoy the \"I am allowed to dress like this, here\" idea. This is not for me. To me, it is about table games. Personally, I prefer the downtown hotels. They are all adjacent, and the canopy protects walkers from the heat. The 4Q is larger and cleaner, at about 1/3 of the price. I invite readers to read my reviews of Golden Gate and ElCortez, which are two of my favorites. I wouldn't mind returning to the Hooters, but there are other choices.

We checked in about 3am with no problems whatsoever. The elevator/hall ways were clean and had a very clean smell about them, I was dreading getting a terrible room as this would have just put the icing on the cake for us after an horrific journey but the room was way above our expectations. A huge room with 2 queen beds two tables separate dressing table with well lit mirror. very large closet and tv. The bathroom was a very good size too. Everywhere appeared spotlessly clean. The best part was actually getting into the most comfiest bed I have slept in! We were on the second floor of the Ocean Tower which had a pool view, this was blocked partially as we were on a low floor but that didn't matter one bit as we were hardly in the room during the day anyway. We had no problems with hearing noise from adjoining rooms. Once we had caught up on a couple of hours sleep we ventured downstairs for a look around, there was a small but cozy pool area with a pool bar, A 'Bait' shop selling souvenirs, drinks and snacks etc, there was two bars in the casino and three restaurants (obviously one was a Hooters!), we tried out the Dan Marino's Restaurant for breakfast which was delicious, good selection for a good price, especially the buffet for just under $10, unfortunately I never got to go to Hooters as the queue was always so long! All of the staff were EXTREMELY helpful and friendly, we wanted to spend a day shopping and enquired about buses and taxis to various places, after chatting with two of the bell hops (I didn't get there names unfortunately) we ended up hiring a car for the day which prob saved us a fortune in fares and a lot of time so meant we could do more shopping!! We were picked up right outside the front entrance by the car hire company and taken to their depot where our 'economy car' was waiting for us. I was expecting a very small car but it was a huge Chrysler Sebring so I guess we were upgraded. We also booked tickets to see 'an evening at Le Cage' a show at the riviera, we were able to do this throught the hotel and again the guy (an oldish gentleman) was very helpful and advised us of timings and stuff to make sure we got the best seats. The location of hooters is perfect, it's literally a 5 min walk from the strip, it's right opposite the MGM which also has a monorail stop so handy for that as well. The only fault I could find was that the ice machine wasn't working on our floor so we had to use the one upstairs but I would hardly say that's a problem or inconvenience. People have complained on here about not getting towels or bedding changed, there are little cards in the room explaining about helping save the environment and only having the bed changed if you really needed it, if you did all you had to do was place the card on the bed and they would do this, as quite a 'green' person myself I was quite happy with this. The pool area got very very busy with the younger crowd on a weekend with a live DJ playing very live music so not ideal if you are wanting a relaxing sunbathe. This was my fifth visit to vegas and i've stayed in different places each time, this is definitely one of the best values for money. Some friends were staying at the bellagio and we went to see there room and to be honest it wasn't all that it's cracked up to be (for what they paid I would have expected a lot more) and there was a really bad smell in the corridors! I would definitely stay at Hooters again, it's not a huge hotel and only has a small casino, but this makes it a lot more enjoyable and friendly.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Price for such a Good Location.\u201d", "Author": "RobeFrost", "ReviewID": "UR16954479", "Content": "I believe this is one of the best properties for the price and location in las vegas it is directly accross from The MGM Grand...Although it is not directly on the strip it might as well be you can be at the MGM grand in less than a 7 minute walk.

I am a long time Vegas resident and I have been staying in Las Vegas casinos since the mid-1980s. Since it was Memorial Day and the prices were high, my aunt had three free nights at Hooter's Saturday through Tuesday and I accepted. Oh my God! Stick to the food (and girls in orange shorts) business Hooters !!! You know nothing about casino and hotel management. This place is so poorly laid out it looks like slot machines were dropped from the sky into a barn. The main floor is small, crowded, unorganized, ugly, dirty and there is no place to walk. Hooters is a place for people who have lost the will to live or have NEVER EVER been to Las Vegas before and think it's the happening place. The hotel was crowded due to the holiday. Yes they have young girls in tight orange shorts selling chicken, but as we all know not every girl is a beauty queen! (OK, I am not Denzel Washington or Brad Pitt either). Anyway, my aunt checks me in Saturday night and we get into the rickety elevator defaced by graffiti. (HInt: If there is no security guard checking your room key card before you get on the elevator, you are in the wrong Vegas hotel). Once we got off the Bayview elevator (as distinguished from their Oceanview? section), we immediately noticed the filthy, horribly stained and frayed carpet as trays of food set out for the roaches to commit suicide on. Plus this hotel stinks too. I cannot understand how this hotel allows its carpet to stay so dirty on a daily basis. We walked into the room and it was barebones of course with more filthy carpet and yes there were cigarette burns on the carpet. I did not want to touch anything in this room and all I could think about was the room was FREE!? I told myself to just try to make it through one night and then I would find another room. The rest of my family was staying at the Palazzo/Venetian and I spent most of the first night with them. I stayed out drinking there until 6:30am and drove back to this dump of dumps. I slept til 3pm and got the ultimate wake up call: a guy from the room next door came through the connecting door. I jumped up and he ran out as he apologized. Had I been a woman instead of a 6 foot, 240 pound guy, who knows how crazy and dangerous this situation could have been. I got packed up immediately and got the heck out of there.

It was as old as dirt and when we turned in on it made this horrible grinding noise. We laughed at everything wrong with the hotel though because we knew it was going to be tacky. The A/C was really a pain though trying to sleep. When we slept we just turned on the vent because it didn't make that noise until you hit the COOL button. Lo and behold in the middle of the night somehow the COOL came on (no one touched it) and the grinding noise wouldn't stop and we literally could not get the unit to go off. We pushed the OFF button several times and nothing. It just stayed on, even when we left for check out it was still on. The staff here acts like they go out of their way for you but they don't.

When the wings arrived they had a pale, sickly look to them. They were drenched in grease and had minimal breading on them. On top of this, they were almost cold. As a guy who can devour almost anything no matter what it tastes like, I figured it didn't really matter what they would taste like as long as they filled me up. Well, after my first bite I almost vomited in my mouth. Keep in mind that I have NEVER turned down a meal before and I am NOT a picky eater. The taste of the wings was indescribable...something along the lines of 2 week old dead roadkill (perhaps a possum) drenched in greasy raw sewage. Disgusting. The crazy thing is that I was actually able to eat 3 of them in the half-hour we were there. We were placing bets on me eating all 20, but those would have to be the worst odds in Vegas. Everyone at my table had an identical experience. In total, we ordered 80 wings and only ate 6 of them. Not wanting to start anything, we just paid our bill and got the heck out of there.

This was our 13th trip to LV and we'll definately stay here again. We both travel a ton, so if you're looking for THE Hotel or Bellagio Lite, this isn't for you. However, if you want a mix of the islands + LV - this is the place. Our first room was too near the dumpster which was emptied at about 5am - what a wake up call - haha - so we asked for a room change and received one without too much hassle, though it wasn't ready until later in the day, the desk staff when I did change rooms was fantastic and really funny. The entire staff was friendly, fun, and unlike other places actually seemed to be enjoying what they were doing and making a sincere effort to make the guests feel welcome -- Sorry, Harrah's - you're \"scripting\" of employees falls short, we'd rather get at \"HEY! You're Back!\" at the end of a fun day than some fake scripted \"Hello Mrs. Decker, how was your day, Mrs. Decker, can I assist you, Mrs. Decker\" any day. (We both have backgrounds in hospitality and I worked in Casino gaming for 9 years...) Two musts: One - find Manny -- he's one of the few male bartenders - and worth a visit in his own right. If you're tired of LV bartenders who don't know how to actually tend bar (i.e. scan their bar, remember your drink, and make you feel like you're a regular at some local watering hole) - he's your guy! While I'm sure he could do the dog and pony show of tossing bottles and flaming drinks, he's more interested in making sure you feel welcome and swapping a good story or two. So go say hey to Manny, leave him a nice tip, and chill out for a bit between gambling rounds. Second Must: Hang with the day time dice crew - some of these folks have been with the property for over a decade. They are real dealers who not only know the game, but have all the funny lingo down, and run a perfect pace at the table. You won't feel hurried or feel like a nap between rolls. Also unlike other houses that sweat the money - the crew and the box congratulated winners, with real enthusiasm and cheers and also gave newer players good betting information and were overly gracious when they were tipped or were put on the line with odds (don't cheap out folks, if you're going to put the crew on the line, play the odds for them) They regularly engaged players in fun conversation, talk of March Madness, and inquired whether people were having fun. Huh. They seem to \"get it\", don't they??? We had a blackjack dealer that \"couldn't lose\" - but his personality and repeated yelling to the floor \"get me out of here\" was hilarious. You know the place is running well when the floor came over and started yelling \"Bust, come on dealer, bust\". Too funny. Overall the service was fantastic, the beverage service is probably the best in Vegas - it was very personal, speedy, and tips were received with real gratitude. Note, too that each bartender we encountered made a great bloody mary - which is a big deal for us! If you're a rated player somewhere else and tired of feeling like a number or that your play isn't appreciated, call Faye, one of the hosts, and consider giving Hooters your business. As a woman, I can honestly attest to the fact that the \"Rack Pack\" is brilliant marketing - and funny - and while they ladies are, I'm sure, lovely to look at, they also have great attitudes and treat all players - regardless of gender or tipping level like kings and queens. And yes, they do have $5 tables and all the games. Their \"light up\" roulette tables are very cool, and all the dealers on that game we encoutered were teriffic. I think overall the best thing about Hooters was that people were having fun and there was great energy in the casino just about all the time. There were people in their 80's sitting next to college kids and everyone was having fun. Even though it was \"spring break\" season we didn't feel as though it was a \"frat\" atmosphere, and the extremely personable and interactive Security Staff - especially by the pool - made a huge effort to interact with everyone and develop a relationship so that if one of the guests did go a little \"over the line\" he or she was humored and teased back into good behavior. So, in summary, give it a try. If you're looking for a fun place that doesn't take itself too seriously and understands that it's the overall experience as much as the win/lose statement this may be what you've been looking for!", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "OK", "Title": "\u201cGreat for \"Okies\" and most others\u201d", "Author": "CofOK", "ReviewID": "UR14696981", "Content": "Just got back from Hooters yesterday and had a great time. As for the review a couple days ago, this Okie had the beautiful Kari (mentioned here often because she is great) compliment his smile right away (no need to stereotype people from Oklahoma :) If you see her, tell her hi from the Oklahoma guy with \"nice teeth\". The Casino is small but BY FAR the most fun. I've been to Vegas 7 times and stayed up and down the strip and this place is alive most of the day. The Hooters dealers were awesome (David and Lito at the craps table) and the girls were great too. 80% of the ritzy casinos have dealers that seem to try to kill the mood and force you to unhappily lose your money. Not Hooters, we threw dice for 5 hours on Friday and Saturday, and it was a blast. Also nice is the fact that they will help you out if you aren't too experienced or get too drunk :) Sports Book - Really fun and really easy to get a drink for free.. just play some video poker here and there. It is small and closes early, so remember that if you have an early flight. You may not get to cash your ticket. The rooms are OK, compare them to a Hampton Inn type place. I was in my room for about 5 hours a night, so that isn't why I went. They smelled fine, had a good pool view (Bay Tower) and were kept clean. Pool area was alway happening and the bar (and scenery behind the bar) was great. I probably would've gone 5 Stars on this had the food been better and more available. Hooters restaurant is Always packed. I don't know if people don't eat at their local Hooters, but they all had to eat at this one. The only other choice was Dan Marino's and it was decent for breakfast, but for a $50 dinner you'll be disappointed (unless you love unlimited baby back ribs, then you're in luck for $16.95). Once again, if you need Bellagio or Venetian glitz, stay there. If you want to have a good time with down-to-earth people, Hooters is great. PLUS, they will still actually comp you a meal or something for playing 4-5 hours in their casinos. I hear it will be changing ownership and themes soon, so pay attention to that. Hope this helps...

Hooter's met my needs perfectly and then some !! I was traveling alone with various friends coming in for the games. I had buddies staying at the Luxor, MGM, and NY NY so we were all close by. I have stayed at each of the other 3 plus the Rio and Bally's on past Vegas excursions. I can honestly say that the stay at Hooter's was probably my most pleasant stay in Las Vegas. Since I was by myself, my needs were minimal but they were surpassed. I probably wouldn't have stayed here if traveling with my wife, but after this experience I would. The location is great - 5 minute walk and you're at the Tropicana/Las Vegas BLVD intersection. You are 5 minutes from the MGM monorail station. The price I paid was insane to be so close to all of this action. As for the property itself, again I was presently surprised. The check in process was a snap and extremely friendly staff. I had a 5th floor room in the Bay View tower that had a good view of MGM/Monte Carlo - a little balcony that you could stand on and let in some fresh air - something that is rare in Vegas. Past complaints of old bathrooms are accurate - if you want a posh bathroom - look elsewhere and be willing to double your price. If you are using the bathroom to shower, dispose of waste and brush your teeth - this place will suffice. The room was comfortable and the bed was very nice. The place was clean and maid service was prompt and thorough. As for the rest of the place, I didn't spend a lot of time in the casino. I like craps and they had only one table going and makes it hard to get hot. I spent most of my time in the MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling but that is what my plan was coming in. I thought the dealers were friendly when I did gamble and it was pretty lively. The pool area was pleasant and there were quite a few spring breakers partying in that area, but everybody seemed to be getting along and having a good time. I ate lunch at Hooters twice and dinner at Marino's twice and had no issues at either place. The filet I had at Marino's rivaled those at Austin's, The Palm and other places that would cost twice as much. Bottom line - my experience was great. I'd definitely recommend it to those of you that know what you're getting in to. It is not Ceasar's, Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio. However, it is as nice and cheaper than plenty of the other older properties on the Strip.

We got a rate of $65/night average and booked knowing that we would be spending very little time in our room. With that in mind I'll try to include little tips and tricks we found while there. Our room was fantastically hideous with the orange and greens. The beds were advertised as queen (I was told this never confirmed it) and they were at best full size. We used the beds for probably 6 hours the entire trip so again not a big deal to us but if you enjoy soft, big, comfortable beds this place is not for you. We had a view of the pools which would have been great if they were in use. The hot tubs were going strong 24/7. The casino itself is small in comparison to those nearby. However during our stay we always found it easy to find a table to jump on, and the minimums varied from $5-10 for BJ, Roulette, and Craps. The dealers were very friendly and attractive. We all agreed that the casino topped all of the ones we went to in terms of attractive, nice, flirtatious dealers. They definitely made the experience more enjoyable. If you go make sure to sit down if Kari or Kellie are dealing, they are extremely fun to play the game with. We only ate at the hotel once, and we chose Dan Marino's for breakfast. The buffet was only $8.95, and did the trick of getting a decent meal in us. The buffet includes eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, fruits, and cereal. No biscuits and gravy which was disappointing. We did attempt an extremely late night/early morning visit back to DM but was told there was a wait (funny b/c there was noone in the place). Overall the hotel met our needs, and we did gamble quite a bit in the casino. Most of us found the slots to be pretty loose and more than half came out ahead while in the casino. One last note I had been to Vegas a couple years ago and used the \"Tickets 4 Tonite\" service. Basically it just offered show tickets for half price the day of showing. What I found this time was that dinner and golf greens fees are now also available. If you plan to play golf definitely check this place out! We didn't bring our clubs and we were sorely disappointed as we could've gotten a fantastic rate. Also note that we did a Treasures package that included dinner. What it entailed was for $3 each (yes $3) we got a complimentary limo, no cover charge, and half priced dinner. We were told there was no catch, and there wasn't. The dinner was below average, go somewhere else for a good steak dinner. Look for the Fat Tuesdays around the strip. There are 5 locations (one in Planet Hollywood, one in MGM) and they offer several different sizes and flavored frozen drinks (margaritas, etc) for reasonable prices. For example I chose the 46 oz. margarita and paid $11 for one, then refilled it for $8 the rest of the time. Compare that to one drink at $7-9 unless you're gambling of course, and that paid for itself easily. Slots - played quite a few and found the wheel of fortunes in the round with the gigantic wheel in the center to be by far the loosest. We played in NYNY, PH, Monte Carlo, Flamingo, and Palms and every time hit for at least $50. It is well worth it (note find the machines that have the max. bet set at 15 credits not 80). Played Wizard of Oz and Top Gun and was extremely disappointed in the pay out. Lasted 5 minutes max on each. Hooters Hotel/Casino is what we thought it would be, and if you book knowing what you're going to get how can you be disappointed. Close to the strip (5 min. walk through MGM or to the tram), good casino environment, and cheap prices. Can't beat it for a guys trip or budget stay.

The 2nd room was even worse. The first thing I wanted to do in the 2nd room I was given was turn the fan on. Not only was the lid that you flip up to adjusted the temp. cracked but it fell off in my hand. In the bathroom the sink drained a bit better, though it still backed up, but when I took my shower the next morning I ended up in standing water that came to within 2 - 3 inches from the top of the tub. I called the maintenance people and asked that they fix the drainage problem in the tub. The \"fix\" was done while I was out that day and when I took my next shower, the standing water was \"only\" up to my ankles not half way up my shin. There was also a lightbulb out in the bathroom the entire time and a plastic tag that was on the floor by the door that was never vacuumed up. I am not a picky person about my hotel rooms but with the water drainage problem and over-all ick feel from the room, I would never recommend this hotel.

We have stayed at Mirage/Treasure Island/Ceasars/Flamingo/Harrahs/Excalibur/Luxor/Hilton/Bally's. We have gambled in a lot more. Although none of our group did very well gambling this last trip, we all agreed on one thing, Hooters was the friendliest, most fun casino we have ever been in, hands down. This opinion was shared by my wife. This could be because Hooters does a good job hiring, or (more likely), because their dealers get to keep their own tips. Unlike most other casinos that \"pool\" their tips, each dealer gets to keep whatever tips he/she receives. In other casinos, one good dealer is typically followed up by 3 or 4 bad or very bad ones. Unfriendly or distant is how many dealers at other casinos always come across, but NOT at Hooters. The worst dealer at Hooters was more fun that 80% of the dealers at most other places. We have always liked Harrahs becuase they seemed to have a little higher number of happy, friendly dealers. Hooters even blew them away. I guess if your \"style\" of play is to treat the dealer as an \"adversary\", and don't care about socializing with them, then you might not care for the casino. If however, you like to \"play\" when you play, Hooters casino is for you. 2. Hooters is not right on the strip, but it shares a parking lot (basically) with Tropicana, and is directly across the street from MGM. It is very easy to get anywhere you want. The taxi line was never very long, and you were right across the street from the monorail. Hooters is a small casino, so if you like the huge casinos (we get lost!), then Hooters is not for you. If you like small and comfortable (and friendly, see #1), then you'll like Hooters. Plus you are right next to the largest casino in Vegas (MGM) if you want to change things up. 3. Hooters is generally much less expensive than the bigger strip casinos. You will not get a $400 a night Venetian Suite at Hooters (for $79 or whatever), but you will get a nice, clean room with a comfortable bed. Hooters upgraded us when we checked in just because they had a nicer room available. Others in our group had standard (tower) rooms that were clean and comfortable, not terribly fancy. There is some signs of wear, some interior doors did not close properly, and there were some other signs of depreciation, but really, you had to be looking for problems. The room views are generally nice of the strip or the mountains, one of our rooms looked out over the pool, which isn't so nice in February but probably is pretty awesome when the pool is actually in use. Because it sits back from the strip, the views are generally not obstructed by the monsters on the strip (one of the worst views we EVER had was in an upgraded Ceasars suite). We would complain, however, about the manner in which Hooters placed the spotlights on the hotel facing toward the strip (our room), once the lights came on, it was a little like a police helicopter with a million watt spotlight was hovering outside the window. I think they could reposition the lights to be more indirectly shining into the guest rooms. However, this is not big enough of a problem to lessen our overall enthusiasm for the property. 3. Service was generally friendly and prompt. We had a problem with our room safe on day one, and they were in the room in 15-20 minutes after our call. We have had problems at other Vegas properties that took days to take care of. Overall we were very satisfied with the service at Hooters. 4. We ate at both main Restaurants, Hooters and Marinos. We had a good steak at Marinos, but felt that they may have lowered the quality (and prices?) to appeal to a broader array of customers. It was not quite the quality dining experience we hoped for. Hooters on the other hand was a Hooters. We are not \"Hooters regulars\", I have probably been in a Hooters 4-5 times in my life, and my wife has been in one only one other time. It seemed pretty standard compared to the others I've been in. Decent food, decent price, decent service. 5. Our group had people age from 23 - 48, including men and women. Everyone agreed that the hotel and casino met or exceeded all of our expectations, and offered outstanding value. If this casino existed when I was younger, I cannot imagine that I would have gone anywhere else. The dealers are not all \"Hooters Girls\", and included men and women in button down shirts. HOWEVER, the Hooters Girls that were dealing were in many cases \"model beautiful\". Top that off with their friendliness, and any heterosexual single man (and probably too many married ones), were really in seventh heaven. This is not a place to be a drunken slob and disrespect the employees (plenty of security ready to help you out to the street), but if you were there for fun, and can behave, you'll have a blast. All of the Hooters employees, including the \"hottest\" Hooters girls, seemed to go out of their way to make my wife feel comfortable. She really had a good time. However, she did feel uncomfortable getting in a cab by herself at Ceasars and telling the driver to take her to Hooters (I was working and she was shopping). That uncomfort was probably exascerbated by the jerk responding \"whoo-hoo!\". Only you know what kind of couple you are, and if the \"Hooters\" name is too much for you or not! In conclusion, if you are looking for a fun, convenient, smaller, clean buy not necessarily luxurious place to stay in Vegas, I think you'd have a hard time finding a better choice and value. Being a Vegas \"veteran\", half the battle is determining a good \"match\" for your groups \"personality\". Hooters was a very pleasant surprise for us.

We were given double beds instead of a king, but we didn't mind much. The hallways were definitely gross, the carpets were stained and they were dim and dank. The elevators were fine. We didn't eat at the hotel, but found the little gift shops to be ridiculously overpriced, go up the block to stock up on bottled water, gatorade, etc. The location is GREAT. Whoever is saying its a 10-15 minute walk to the strip is ridiculously slow. We clocked it at 4 minutes. The casino is fun.

They called our room on three separate occasions and left somewhat harassing messages. This isn't necessarily something Hooters can help, but they do allow Tahiti Village to have a spot within their hotel and market to (i.e., harass) their customers.

The bed was as comfortable as anything you'll find in more upscale hotels. The carpeting was stained in a few places, but otherwise, the room was clean with no offensive odors. The dressing mirror and counter was a nice touch, but there weren't any electrical outlets there. On the nearby desk, however, there was a powerstrip and computer connection. The bathroom was nice and again kept clean. We stayed three nights and the housekeepers did a nice job maintaining the room.

We were seated and the hostess put breakfast menus in front of us. We ordered two of the English Muffin breakfasts. The waitress said we couldn't have that because breakfast didn't start until 6:00. As we walked out, she apologized and asked if we could just wait five minutes. My question to her was, \"if you don't serve breakfast until 6, why give someone a breakfast menu?\" It's not like this is an inexpensive place. Their breakfast menu started at $8.95 and went up.

I had a few hours to find a place to stay for that same night and the next one. Cost and location were both factors, so we ended up with the Hooters hotel because it was the cheapest we could find the closest to the strip. For those two factors, this hotel was great. We booked directly with the hotel and paid only $79 for the Friday and $99 for the Saturday. Also, the location wasn\u2019t much different from the time we stayed at the MGM Grand. The other nice thing was that after walking through all the huge monstrosity places, it was nice to come back to a place where it was easy to find everything and you could get to your room without a three-mile hike. For most everything else, though, my reaction is, \u201ceh.\u201d Though this has nothing to do with the hotel itself, I have to say that if anyone ever tells you they go to Hooters for the wings, it is a lie, lie, lie. I know that\u2019s kind of a joke to begin with, but I found out it really is true--their wings are terrible! Greasy and flavorless--both at the Dam Restaurant and the actual Hooters. (If you want wings, stick with Buffalo Wild Wings.) I know it's convenient, but don't bother eating at the hotel. (I have to say, though, we didn't try the Dan Marino's steakhouse place, so I can't comment on that.) Anyhow, back to the hotel. The outside and public areas seem to have been dressed up since it was the San Remo Hotel, and I think the rooms are a tad nicer, but the hallways and elevators are like something from the Bates Motel. I\u2019d read other reviews that mentioned how depressing the hallways were and thought, \u201cWho gives a crap about the hallways?\u201d Well, as it turns out, I do. They were that gross. The carpet is threadbare and stained badly. When I woke up early desperate for non-alcoholic liquid (too much salt from all those margaritas, I guess!), I walked down the hall to the soda machine with my two bucks. The machine\u2019s dollar reader was broken. So I took the elevator down to the next floor. That soda machine would only take exact change. Finally I went down another floor and got my drink. Then when I went to go back up, the elevator wouldn\u2019t work correctly. The door would start to shut and then would open again\u2026only to start to shut and then stop and open again. This started to make me nervous, so I hopped out and tried to find stairs. I couldn\u2019t find a way to get from one floor to another. So I went back to the elevators and prayed that this time, a different one would come (which it did). We were later in the same elevator and another couple said it was acting really screwy every time they used it, too. I know it\u2019s an old building, but elevators that don\u2019t work right make me nervous. Something else that I wasn\u2019t impressed with was the fact that there were hairs in the shower. Not just one\u2014that I can understand, it happens. But numerous hairs that appear to be from different parts of the body? Yuck. Also, the in-room safe was broken (we didn\u2019t bother to ask anyone to fix it, though). Something that is part good/part bad is the fact that upon checkout, we were billed for a meal we didn\u2019t eat. (I am SO GLAD I checked every item on the printout!) It turns out that while we were eating breakfast at the Luxor, someone else was eating breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants and charging it to our room. The good part was that the guy at the front desk immediately credited us back for it and was very nice. I know this review has a lot of complaints. I\u2019m not normally a very picky person when it comes to hotels (I swear). What bothered me here is that it seems like they just tried to slap a coat of paint on everything and present it as way nicer than it was. A lot of the problems I saw would be easily remedied with just some time and attention: maintain the pop machines and safes, make sure the rooms are cleaned well, wash the windows every once and awhile, etc. Overall, I understand that I got what I paid for, and that\u2019s o.k. We had a good location and a bed to crash in for cheap.

(with an air of aprehension) Well, I should have known better. My wife and I are fun, outgoing people and we had a terrible time at this property. First the pool area which is made out to be lavish is really a snooze fest (this may have been due to it being a weekday) but the worst part was they stop cocktail service almost as soon as the sun disappears around 4 pm. We like to go out for late afternoon swims, and as such if we wanted to enjoy a beverage we had to walk inside the Hooters restaurant to get a drink (where the service was incredibly slow, although the girls were very friendly, albeit not as attractive as we expected) The casino itself is small, with limited table game options, and lacking of the energy/atmosphere of most of the strip properties. We found the two pit bosses and non Hooters girl dealers we came in contact with to be cold, thus we didn't spend much time at the tables here. (the Hooters Dealers were much friendlier, and easier on the eyes) The rooms themselves (we upgraded to a suite) were ok, there was a 42 plasma in the living room, with a small bar area with a fridge (which kept drinks very cold). The beds were actually quite comfortable. That is where the good parts of the room ended. The windows looked as though they hadn't been cleaned since the San Remo days, they were like that scene from My Cousin Vinny (very, very dirty for those who can't recall), the carpets and couch were stained extensively, the soundproofing was non-existent. However all of these items could have potentially been overlooked if not for the showers. The room had two showers (which may have been nice) however there is something seriously wrong with their water tank/pressure system. In the course of a 10 minute shower, my wife and I would be routinely scalded and frozen in numerous intervals (we took 3 showers and this occured every time, to both of us) All in all, I guess given the price if we need a place to sleep, and they fixed the showers we may stay there again. The \"off strip\" location is no problem, you spend very little time getting out of the hotel as it is so small, and MGM and the monorail is right across the street.

I feel very strongly that people need to know my version of the truth about this hotel. First of all, I would like to say that I have no complaints about the staff. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. They were also very eager to compensate for our dissatisfaction. Upon arrival at the hotel, everything seemed fine. The reservations were correct (thank you Vegas.com). The room availability at the time of check in was either two queen beds or one king bed in the bungalows. A bungalow, overlooking the pool, sounds fun, huh?! We give our bags to the bellhop and head up to our room. The room was located outside of the hotel/casino structure. Walking through the pool area was a must to get to it. We opened the door to get in the building and immediately were taken aback by the smell in the hallway. It smelled just like a deep fryer, as my husband liked to say. I think it smelled more like someone had died! Being optimistic, we continue on to the room. We open the door. It is quite dingy and dark in the room. We stayed there for about an hour and a half until our luggage showed up at the room (we did have to call for it). Then we headed out to eat dinner (our first meal since breakfast)--over dinner we decide that we can't stay in the room. It was just too dirty for our standards. We go talk to the receptionist and she was very accommodating. She said in about an hour she would have a room for us with a king size bed in the ocean view rooms. We were excited about this! She comes and gets me in an hour and my husband and I gather our things from the old room and move them into the new room. We immediately attempt to turn on the air conditioning, and what luck would have it, it wasn't working! (las Vegas with no a/c--not going to happen!) Then I realize the sink in the room does not drain! We call for someone to come fix it. After 2 phone calls and 30 minutes later, the mechanic arrives. He fixes the a/c (thank God) and attempts to fix the sink. He used this contraption that forced air through the pipes to remove any clogs there might be. This device managed to spray dirty (leftover) sink water onto the mirror and counter space. The man doing the work used the room towels to haphazardly wipe up the mirror and sink. I do have to say, for the quick fix it did work for about 24 hours....then the sink went back to overflowing if the water was running too long. (we did not want to take the effort or our time to have someone come fix it) The following day (after being at the pool all day) we come back inside to shower and get ready for the evening. My husband showers first and then I hop in....while I'm in the shower the lights int he bathroom turn off!!! (not any other outlet or light in the entire room)--so I am condemned to taking a shower in the dark. With all of this aside the rooms (both of them) were filthy.

We had a view of the pool with a tiny balcony (one person size) and the two beds we requested. When we left the room we waited 5 minutes for the elevator to come get us before trying the stairs. The signage was very poor and while we were able to figure out a passage to the outside (by the parking garage) we couldn't get to the lobby level/casino. So, we had to go back up the stairs to wait for the elevator again. That night, after a long evening of drinking, we came up to bed. I woke up many times throughout the night due to the incredibly uncomfortable beds. All-in-all a pretty restless night of sleep. Then, at 12 PM (I know, it is noon, but it is Vegas), we were awakened to blaring music! A band had started playing at the pool and there was no chance of sleep after that b/c everything could be heard. The rest of the time was no better. The hotel became more and more trashed as the weekend went on and never seemed to be cleaned up. They did the individual rooms but the hallways remained disgusting.

Decor in the casino and the room was typical of a Hooters restaurant with lots of orange vinyl and natural wood. A little jarring to look at compared to other luxurious hotels in Vegas, but it grows on you. If you are driving, the parking ramp is immediately adjacent to the hotel and access is very convenient. Driving in and out on Tropicana is a snap. Although technically off the strip, it is a 5 minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd from your hotel room. I have stayed at Bally's, Luxor, Harrahs, and other strip properties where it took longer just to get the elevator down. My room was in the \"Oceanview\" tower (used to be the silver tower when it was San Remo) and it was large, comfortable, clean, and exactly what I requested. The hallways and elevators are a little beaten and dreary, but the room itself was great. I arrived 2 hours early for Sunday check-in and they were able to give me the King/no-smoking room I requested. In contrast to older reviews I read here, all the staff I met seemed quite friendly and knowledgeable. Pool area was very lively and had a live reggae-type band playing on Sunday. I didn't see much cocktail service walking around, but service was fast at the pool bar. I thing large drafts were $5 and frozen drinks were $8 - $10. There were a lot of lounge chairs and benches surrounding the pools, and it seemed some were always open. The hooters restaurant has a porched area overlooking the pool where you can get food. Crowd was mostly couples in their late 20's - early 40's and not the drunken bachelor party group I was expecting, but it was a Sunday. Casino is a little small, but they have all the table games and a good variety of slots. I found 9/6 JOB video poker and decent pay tables on Dueces Wild. BJ was mainly $10 minimum . . . I never saw lower. There were a lot of 6/5 tables and the placards stating that are small, so look carefully before you sit down. Cocktail service was speedy wherever I was sitting. To summarize: This is a 3-star place with a really fun atmosphere and decent rooms, food, and gaming. It is a great place for the price, close enough to be considered on the Strip, and I plan on returning with my wife for our next vacation.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ewa Beach, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cHappy Birthday at Hooters!\u201d", "Author": "BethUhhKnee", "ReviewID": "UR8096613", "Content": "My friends and I had a great time at the Hooters Hotel.

It possesses the \"Dan Marino Steakhouse\" which targets those who want a higher end feed as well as a generous buffet and snacks at the bar. A convenience store/souvenir shop is located at one end of the casino floor and another souvenir shop is located at the other end of the casino floor as well. Check in was quick and efficient and friendly. The rooms are what you'd expect from a mid range hotel Vegas hotel. Neat, tidy two double beds and a more than adequate bathroom. Our room overlooked the pool area which was a good location. We had no problems with noise either in the hallways or from outside. A very well appointed gymnasium is located off the pool and was cheap by Vegas standards at only $10USD per day. Overall I was more than happy with my stay at Hooters. One word of warning though.

We found the location to be really good for us, especially for hanging out at New York New York, MGM, Aladdin Dessert Passage shopping centre, the Bellagio etc. If you want to be near Wynns, TI's or The Venetian, Hooters is up the wrong end for you and you'd be better off staying closer to the middle of the strip.

This was a superise trip for my husband as I told him at the airport we were going to Vegas.

My husband was delighted to find we were staying at Hooters as any husband would. We rented a car and parked in the Parking Garage reluctlantly. There are some cameras in the garage try to park your car in a view of the camera that is what we did and never had a problem. There is no Valet here and the only other option is to park in the lot in between here and tropicana. Okay Beware of the Parking Garage Elevators one of them creaks and makes the most horrid noises it sounds as thought the box you are in is just going to pop. However we never got stuck and instead had a few laughs about it. Check in was a Breeze, the girl was friendly enough and I told her we were celebrating a special occasion and asked if there were any upgrades? She went and talked to her manager and offered me a Presidential Suite for $50 per night Upgrade or a International Suite for Free, We took the freebee. What a great room. We were in the Bayview tower which I think is the most accessable tower. Room 901 it was literrally right next door to the elevator which was a hoot, but seriously we never heard the elevator once or noise in the hallways which are very cute with surfboards and other cute decor. We entered the room to a huge entry way with a full bathroom, then a Bar with sink and fridge, palm trees Orange and Brown Decor, A huge plazma flat screen tv, little table to have cocktails at, a full size couch L shaped, the Bedroom was seperate and was very tropical themed I thought very cute. there was another TV, Desk, closet, and another Full Bathroom. We paid $50 a night what a deal. We went downstairs and sat at the 13 martini bar and enjoyed the live band that played yor requests, they rocked and we had a great time. We ate at the Damn Restrant a couple of times and the service was excellent and the food was too at a great price. Cute Diner.. Also ate at Pete and shortys, had some wings and slider burgers they were good too. The people at the club orange werevery friendly and helpful. Sportbook guy was nice too. Cocktail service is Non existant here I once ordered a drink and never saw her again. We hung out by the pool at night they had nice fires in pits that you could sit or stand around. Really enjoyed how easy the property was to get around. Yes it is small but we enjoyed that. Spent a lot money in the Bait Shoppe on goodies to bring home and was diappointed I didnt get a chance to try the hidden sushi bar in the back. We enjoyed our stay and safely walked from Hooters into the tropicana where we won some $ fast. also walked the four corners, went to Coyote Ugly was kinda fun, checked out the ceterfuge bar at MGM. All in all it was a great time. We are heading back to Hooters in March and I am hoping the second time will be as awesome as the first.

We frequent the Vegas strip and stayed at the Mandalay, Imperial Palace, Rio, Bally's,Harrah's, Paris, Bellagio....to name a few,but since we were only there for 1 (one) night and this was the Superbowl weekend, the prices of any hotels on the strip were astrinomical. Out of all the cheaper hotels we could have stayed at, my reason for choosing Hooter's was that it's new and the location -(I knew their grand opening was just about a year ago and that it was very near the South Strip (next to Tropicana and accross from MGM)). Booked reservation through tripres.com for about ($126) and was quoted a \"Bungalow\" style room. We ended up on the 2nd floor on the Bay View tower next to the elevator. (I asked why I was given a regular tower room and front desk said I need to pay $30 to reserve your request). Check in(arrived at 2p.m.) was quick and easy and rooms were ready and clean and a little bigger than what was pictured on the website. Cosmetic wise, the room was comfortable,new, and inviting (furniture, sheets, bedding-comfy!!!,towels,etc.-all new and plush) The building structure needs repair- shower needs temp. control-streams of hot water would jet out while showering,walls are a bit thin, you could hear the neigbors opening closet doors and murmuring but we were surprised we didn't hear the elevators); and the elevators-very tempermental, so please know your fire escape. Staff wise, everyone was average, they don't go out of the way to please you but just there to do their job and to answer questions. They might need to staff more cocktail waitresses cause it was very rare to have a comp. drink while playing the slots. If you ladies are worried about the taboo, only the cocktail waitresses are dressed the same as the girls at your local hooter's not the dealer's, the front desk, the Dam restauant workers etc. - there's no girls gone wild here!!!! Other than the 4a.m. fire/emergency drill and a short direct t.v. cable outtage at 3a.m., all was great! I would go back to the Hooter's hotel if the only purpose was just to rest (your in a city where there is something to do 24/7!!!). It's better than the IP, Harrah's, the downtown Vegas hotels or any other OLDER hotels on the strip. But if you are looking for the Las Vegas experience, pay more and stay at the bigger hotels with more amenities. Other tips from other ta's: get the club orange card for store discounts (20% off), the Dam restaurant is like a old-school Diner and prices are reasonable - had the prime rib for $6.95 and the burger - big- w/ seasoned fries for $10-24/7. Casino has $10 blackjack and $5 war. Walk next to the Tropicana for $5 blackjack and go to the MGM for Sports Booking. Location is great-just bring comfortable shoes.

There is a small sports bar, an old-school diner, a regular Hooter's restaurant, and Dan marino's (finer dining) on site. We opted for the Hooter's restaurant for lunch and the service was quick and friendly. The waitresses all wear the standard t-shirt and orange shorts (both regular and cocktail waitresses on the casino floor). The only real negatives were one minor and one major complaint. The minor complaint is that the average patron was a little bit on the lower-class side. This is to be expected at one of the chaper hotels near the strip. If they were high-rollers that could afoord $800/night at Bellagio, they wouldn't be at Hooter's. This was of no consequence to us, but for those of you who feel uneasy around lower socio-economic people you might consider spending more money elsewhere. We were stared down by two imposing ex-con looking guys near the diner (for no apparent reason) but we just laughed it off. The major complaint is that my friend's truck that was parked overnight in the Hooter's parking garage was broken into and several items were taken (resulting in a $500 deductible). I would not recommend parking here. Other than that, it is a decent value for the $$. I can highly recommend Tao restaurant (at Venetian) for dinner and Pure nightclub (in Caesar's) for clubbing, if you have the $$.

Between the pool table and living area is a dining table for six. The master bedroom had another TV (not HD or flat screen), and a jacuzzi tub, with an ajoining marble bath with a shower and double bowl sink. Hooters overall is a LITTLE casino. Not many choices in table games, only 3 craps tables, only 1 of which was running during our stay. Slots are from penny up to a dollar or more. Drink service is hit or miss, mostly miss. Table players get better service than slot players, unless Alana is working the slot area. A BIG TY to Alana for awesome service while playing penny slots.

The heating unit was loud, but fortunately it drowned out some of the noise from the room next door. The casino is small and cramped. The blackjack tables are all single deck 6:5 games, or tables with side bets. Not a place for serious players. The sports book is tiny and along the back wall of a restaurant. The Hooter's girls were attractive, but most cocktail waitresses in Vegas casino's are attractive. I dined in Marino's, The Dam, and ordered room service. The food quality and service was quite well for each. I also needed a fresh towel brought to my room, and housekeeping brought it in a matter of minutes. All of the staff I dealt with were very polite and customer oriented. Personally, I won't stay at Hooter's again.

When I saw they were opening a casino @ the old San Remo in Las Vegas I couldn't wait until it opened. A business trip right before New Year's weekend took my fiance & myself there for 2 nights. It was fun, clean & a very pleasant surprise. Their uniforms in comparison to the other casino's waitress is pretty tame. Also, the girls and guys on staff were all very friendly. Across from the enormous MGM this place was refreshingly intimate but big enough to serve our needs. I had been to the San Remo twice before, it used to have a great steakhouse, and in its ending days it was clear the place needed to be redone. Keeping the orginal setup for Hooters- the palm trees, white on orange decor is cool, bright & hip. The Dam Diner was a good value with good food & friendly service. The Hooters was a run of the mill place but nice. The nicer Dan Marino's was empty but nice--- elegant, dark & sleek. The martini bar with the TKO house band performing cover songs was nice too. The waitress was attentive and the drinks generous. The band is nice & willing to play whatever the audience wanted to keep the dance floor packed. It was fun. The rooms were just redone... not much, just update furnishings & painting but nice nonetheless. I loved having the Hooters bar table & stools in my room.... it made our nights festive for a drink of our own! Even the fake palm tree in the room with its kitcshy-ness made for a nice visit.

I needed something within walking distance of the strip at a reasonable price because I needed three rooms. It was actually a friend who spotted this bargain on-line after she heard about our plans and decided to join us. Our price was $179.00/night and even at that price I don't think they were full by New Year's eve. Check-in was a breeze and despite one room not being immediately ready, it was 45 minutes later. They put our 21 yr old (and her boyfriend) next to us and my other daughter directly across the hall. Very convenient for our meeting during our three nights there. Rooms were comfortable, linens upgraded, bathrooms only average to less than average. There is no desk. Walls were thin but we never had any real problems with that. We dined in the Dam Restaurant a number of times; for lunch, breakfast and a late night snack. Service there was great, a rarity in Las Vegas. I ate in Hooters on two different occassions, in each instance service was excellent. This despite the second time it being five of us and being during the lunch hour on Sunday, in the middle of NFL football. Lines were 30 people long but we were in within ten minutes The staff was well trained consistent with all of their locations I was told. But I save my biggest compliments for \"13 Martini\", the lounge where my daughter had her first official drink. The waitress, Brittany, took note of the occassion, asked her what she wanted for her first drink and delivered that drink on the house at the witching hour of midnight. In a crowded bar with a rock n' roll band playing in the background she didn't have to pay that much attention. She did, the band acknowledged the event,...it was all good. In summary, we could have stayed next door at the Tropicana for twice the price, but didn't. We could have searched for good food with good service and more price at the MGM across the street, but wouldnt. We could have been considered just another cow following the herd but Hooters couldn't. They cut us from the pack on a couple of occasions and made us feel special. I will be back in Las Vegas in three weeks for a convention and I will be staying at Caesars. It will be nice and I will like it.

After telling the young man at the registration desk that we had specifically reserved a non-smoking room with a king size bed several weeks ago, he told us that Hooters doesn't accept reservations, only requests for rooms, and none of the rooms that we requested were available. This wouldn't have been that big of a deal if we hadn't traveled across the country and my credit card hadn't already been billed for our 6-night stay.

Since we didn't have any other options, we decided to accept his offer. I asked for a discount for the inconvenience, but was given four free drink coupons instead. Our first room was on the second floor. The view out of our open, unlocked, broken sliding glass door was of some electrical equipment. The bed comforters smelled strongly of smoke, the water took over a minute to get hot, and it tasted moldy. The next day, we had to wait until 2:00 PM for our \"expected\" room to become available. The water in this room still tasted moldy, but the water didn't take long to heat up since hot water was constantly leaking from the shower. This was more of a feature than a problem for us. This room also overlooked the pool area, which was a bonus, but it didn't change our impression of the hotel. Perhaps if we got this room from the start, we'd be happier with the hotel. The maids were the nicest people in the hotel. The staff at the registration desk were mixed. Some were very nice, some weren't.

Most people said there wern't that much hooter girls around but I saw plenty from working in the resaurant or dealing at a table in the casino there was no shortage of the eye candy.

We took another couple who had never experienced Las Vegas and they liked the smaller casino. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the service was great. I went to one of the shops to purchase some t-shirts and the girl that rang it up, recommened that I go and get a club orange card in order to save 20%. I appreciated that she had told me this, it ended up saving me some money on that purchase and others over the weekend. The Dam Restaurant was great - anything on the menu 24/7 - nothing like a good burger and fries for breakfast or prime rib at 5am before going to bed. I went there one afternoon with a friend to get some nachos and asked the waiter if I could get a beer and I guess they don't actually serve it in that restaurant, but he went the bar and got me one - what a nice guy. We ordered nachos AND fries and he told us that they nachos were enough for 4 or more people but we still ordered the fries anyway - he was not kidding! That was the biggest plate of nachos I had ever seen. After a few phone calls to friends we ended up with 10 people around a table orginally meant for two and this guy was great - just kept taking orders as our friends were throwing them out there.

If you\u2019re in Vegas to pay $25 dollars for a martini while everyone compares how much money they make, this it not the hotel for you. Go to the Wynn.

High speed internet access is available for a fee. The food was quite good. Dan Marino\u2019s steakhouse served wonderful steak and they had a good wine list.

We walked down the strip to the other casinos, like the Venetian, Ballys, etc. It turned into a long walk all the way down the strip, so we took a taxi back, which was about $8. We had a huge burger from the Dam resturaunt that was delicious. We also ate at the Hooters resturaunt and the crab legs were great! Dan Marino's resturaunt is attached to the casino; we didn't eat there but it looked like a nice place. The time share company we used gave everything they promised: three night hotel stay, comedy tickets, $200 casino credit and $200 travel reimbursement. The tour wasn't bad and the salesperson wasn't pushy. So, if you\u2019re thinking about attending a timeshare, I would recommend them.

Musty smelling, old school slots (no tickets, they still spit out coins), and a pool that transports you to Caba Wabo, baby.

We went to their coffee shop, The Dam Restaurant, to try the bacon. OMG, the bacon. It's peppered and brown sugared and it's heavan. In fact all the food is good there. We went back to eat a few meals there. We also went to the steak house, Dan Marinos (kinda funny), and it was also very good. And really nicely designed.

I really like going to Hooters so I was excited about staying here, but what a let down. They have essentially taken what was obviously an old run down hotel casino, slapped some orange paint and pine paneling on it and reopened it. Ceilings are low, rooms are small, d\u00e9cor is predictably tacky. There are no pleasant surprises that are the hallmark of a quality experience. The pool deck is pathetic, imagine a pool from a 70\u2019s era Holiday Inn then put some orange paint and place some Tiki shacks around it; No wonder the recent Hooters swimsuit competition was NOT held here. The staff is new and it shows, they definitely need a lot of training, they are simply not up to Vegas standards. Hooters girls - don't plan on seeing many of them, Although they are in the Hooters Bar inside the hotel, you\u2019ll only see one or two anywhere on the gaming floor or on the pool deck. We reserved a non-smoking King room and upon arrival were told a two double bed room is all that is available (which we later learned was a lie). The front desk girl (like most staff here not a Hooter\u2019s girl, but a conservatively dressed typical employee) explained that a reservation isn\u2019t really a reservation it\u2019s a \u201crequest\u201d. At that point had I not prepaid the entire trip through an online travel service I would have quickly jumped ship and found someplace else to stay, but that wasn\u2019t an option. Once in the room we found we couldn\u2019t make local phone calls or use dial-up internet service from our room. Also the room had obviously been a smoking room previously. When we complained to the front desk and got no response we took it up with management the next morning who graciously upgraded us to a suite free of charge. Due to some sort of supposed computer screw up the phone wouldn\u2019t work in the suite either. This took numerous calls and finally was fixed on day 3 of our stay. In spite of other disappointing aspects of the hotel, the dining is excellent. The \u201cDam Restaurant\u201d diner has both great meals and service. They offer a very innovative menu and big servings making for a great value. For classier eating \u201cDan Marino\u2019s\u201d restaurant offers a great menu, d\u00e9cor and service and yet is surprisingly reasonably priced. Although I won\u2019t be staying at Hooters next time I\u2018m in Vegas I will definitely go back to these restaurants. Overall probably this would probably be a great place in Panama City Beach, FL in the eighties, but it certainly isn\u2019t up to standards you expect of today\u2019s Las Vegas.

I saw it there several hours later and realized it was a permanent print on the very old carpet. The casino is nice and quirky and the ratio of men to women is very apparent. There are more men than women. Since it seems ok for guys to ogle the Hooter girls, I think they also think its ok to ogle the women patrons. I felt creepy eyes on me that made me feel uncomfortable but my husband put a squash to that quickly. The Hooters restaurant has very good wings. I was impressed since I like buffalo wings. My husband did not like his hamburger though. He said it tasted like those frozen burgers. All in all, the hotel room is like a motel with the added bonus of having a casino.

As we are always up for an adventure, we decided to give Hooters a try. A short walk over to the MGM Grand and so forth coupled with inexpensive rooms made us willing to give it a shot. For the dates we were looking, about the only cheaper rooms were way over in Primm. Being that Hooters took over the San Remo and started some remodeling, this place was in pretty good shape. There was still the faint smell of fresh wood from the paneling. The A/C in our room was older, and therefore a little louder than usual, but not so much that it interrupted my sleep. (Besides, you're in Vegas, you should only be in your room when you're about to pass out from exhaustion). It was a very basic room: Bed, table w/ 3 stools, tv/ent center w/ a few drawers, closet w/ safe (which was locked - you have to have security unlock it, apparently), fake potted plants, and a small desk w/ chair. Instead of end tables, they have a shelves. The King sized bed was actually comfortable. Bathroom had a shower/tub, hair dryer, and individual cup coffee maker. The Casino was on the small side, but lively and colorful. The dealers were friendly, and there were alot of places to grab a drink or a bite to eat. The official Hooters restaurant closes around 11'ish, but the all-nite cafe next door has some of the Hooters menu items. Our server, Audrey, was very fun and friendly. The pool had a posted sign about people being under 21 not allowed. All-in-all, it was a great value for the money. I hate spending copious amounts of money on rooms in Vegas, considering the small amount of time I spend in them. If you're looking to spend alot of time in your room and expect luxurious accomodations - Hooters is not for you. Try the Bellagio or Venetian. If you want a cheap, clean place to sleep and stow your stuff - Hooters might be the place for you.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cWorst Service I have Ever Had\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5410975", "Content": "I stayed at Hooters Casino just last week, and the service there was terrible. I have never been treated as bad as I was by the front desk people at any other hotel. I checked in and found that my room was a single bed instead of the double. It took almost three hours to rectify the situation, all the while screwing up the begining of my vacation. Once they had there so called fix, it put me in one of the towers, 14 floors away from the pool I wanted to stay next to in the first place. I come to find out later that there were other rooms available by the pool, but the front desk forgot to look at those rooms. After getting jacked around for three hours by a manager that was supposed to show up to fix the situation (she never showed up) I finally settled into my room. The next night I ordered a plate of Nachos from the Damn Restaurant down stairs, it took me almost an hour to get the plate and afterwards when I finally got it, they robbed me of the steak that was supposed to be on it, that cost me 3.95 and the cheese was not even melted, and it was cold. Finally when I checked out they tried to charge me for the room that was in the tower, not at the bungalow rates, a mistake that they themselves screwed up. The casino is not better that any other one I stayed at, Hooters hot wings are not the best in the world, and good looking girls in skimpy outfits are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas.

When I arrived at the room it had a king bed instead of 2 doubles. I called the front desk to get it changed, and to make a long story short 1 1/2 hours later and a headache I had the correct room and a meal comp for the trouble. The front desk staff, dealers, waitresses. security, and anyone I left out was very nice and helpfull. The room was nice, nothing special except for the beds. Itwas the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom was standard, toilet, sink, and shower. There are no dressers to put clothes in but there is a long closet to hang things up. If you need a hair dryer you will need to bring your own or call the front desk for one or anything else you might need. The rooms are not sound proof but I did not here anyone making noise either. I will tell you that this is a party hotel because I only saw 4 kids during my stay. The crowd seems to be in there 20's and 30's. Like I said earlier, my room was the bungalow room. This is a 2 story section not connected to the rest of the hotel. It is next to the pool. If you get a ground floor room you can walk out your sliding door to the pool 15 feet away. You will need to use your key to get in through the security gate. All my pool pictures were taken from my sliding door. There is seperate parking next to the rooms so you will not have to walk through the casino for anything. There are 2 pools and 2 hot tubs, with one being a 60 person hot tub. 1 pool also has a waterfall which was nice. The only bad thing is that the pool area has no shade unless you are at the bar. The sun does not go behind the hotel until about 6 PM. I ate in hooters restauant of course and it is just like anywhere else. Same menu same food. I also ate at the dam which is the 24 hour cafe. Very good. I had a burger which was huge. There are several bars throughout the property with nippers pool bar being the most fun. It is located poolside with live music on the weekends for the pool party. The casino is small with your average table games. If you want something other than blackjack or craps go to a bigger hotel.

Anyway, here are the high points: They have the best looking staff of any casino I have ever been in. The girls are great and friendly too. The casino is on the small side but they have everything you would want. A couple of good places to eat. They throw blow out pool parties on weekends and the pool area is pretty good even by Vegas standards. I have been told that Vegas hotels put no money into their pool areas because they want you at the slots, but the Hooters pool area is made up like a beach party with a cabana and those great women bring you the drinks. Super friendly staff. They also have a good martini bar with live music. The downside: spa sucks. Waste of time there. Here is the deal. If you like Hooters restraunts, you will L-O-V-E the casino.

First off, for you casino players- the player card readers in the slot machines rarely work. The club orange workers are slow and not attentive. It took us about 25 minutes to get a one hundred dollar pay out on a slot machine. We had casino workers tell us they would be right with us but never did. If I had won the money, that would have been fine. But, this is what I had put into the machine. Although there were drink waitresses, I rarely saw them. As for the hotel--- the set up is pretty freaky. One bank of elevators broke down three times in the short time I was there. It is very difficult to get in to the check in area from the parking garage. You have to go through a ton of people in a tighter than usual set up. Literally, from the check in counter, you are less than two feet away from about 10 slot machines. We had a very nice two bedroom suite; but one of the sinks did not work. The refrigerator was in the middle of the room still wrapped in plastic. Some of the electrical ports did not work. This was the same with some of the light switches. The noise from the parking garge carries to all the rooms on the side of the garage. So there were car alarms going off all night and drunken guys screaming at 4am that they could not find their keys (a bad situation no matter how you look at it). We met a few other guests who had bad experiences. I will chalk this one up to the hotel being new and NOT yet having it's groove. But with the way the staff was, it seemed like they had been there for years and many of them seemed disgruntled. Don't bother with room service during peak hours-- the food will be cold by the time you get it. Still, I would consider giving this place another shot- but I will wait at least a year before I do.
