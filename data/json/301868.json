Shuttle to the beach, a pub with Guiness and ale that has english premiership games on , they even arranged it so my team won ! ! what more do you want ? Nice pool area with enough sun. Hotel in general feels quiet and peaceful but certainly not dead. In fact lively area with superb supermarket next door for your papers , take away curry and more.

I could not have envisaged the warm welcome I received. Just what was needed after a very long flight. This friendly attitude was consistently displayed from reception staff, gym staff, to room attendants and the trainee porter. They didn't miss a beat. Especially Kieth on reception and Victoria in the Brasserie!! Food was great; rooms very clean with comfy beds and pillows. I was upgraded to an Executive suite, so can only comment on that room. I assume that other rooms would be of similar standard. The swimming pool area is well maintained with water at a delightful temperature. Taxis were plentiful and cheap by Aussie standards, so Dubai tourist spots easy to access. Hope the management places these positve comments on a staff notice board. Everybody needs to be appreciated. Life is tough for many of them and a pat on the back would make their day.. Con: Lobby internet charges are too dear, expecially if you want to use it for say 15 mins. $9.00 AU (approx) for up to 1 hour. How about 15 mins free, 30 mins $5. And put instructions for use near computer. Save trying to get help if reception is busy e.g. username = room number etc etc. Get rid of ugly flowers on small table near front window in Lobby snack area. Put some 4/5 star 'real' flowers or an upmarket/designer artificial arrangement on reception counter to brighten up the entrance.

Check in was very smooth, particularly by the 2 young indian staff, the best was Keith, spoke very well, new his job and really made you feel welcome. The rooms are ample for people who are looking for simple rooms and will be traveling most of the time in Dubai. There are better rooms, but for the price we had no complaints. We chose this hotel for the close proximity to the embassies/consulates in which i had to use. Even though we were in the heart of Bur Dubai the rooms were sound proof enough not to hear any traffic. We didn't use any dining option apart from the b/fast. The b/fast was superb. Great choices for the food and the star of the show was the restaurant manager, miss VIctoria, i think from Russia. She really drives the morning team with her bubbly friendly personality. The chefs were great also. The junior sous chef was continually checking the buffet and standing in to assist the busy egg station. It might of been nice if they had a bit of support from the waiters when the egg station got busy and taken some written orders. And with the lack of pork i found everything i needed on the morning spread. The lobby wifi was great and very fast for our needs. MIght be nice to give it free in the rooms. The housekeeping staff were great also, gave us extra bottles of water for the babies needs and brought the baby bed in minutes. There is a small pool we saw from the window but the days we were there were not to warm enough to use it. Would i go back to the 4 points in Bur Dubai.

It was a large room, with a double bed and nothing else. There were 2 sets of towels only, and two of everything else. We had to then call the front desk and ask them to arrange to make up the room. After about 10 minutes someone came upstairs and moved a big armchair and brought in a single bed. We requested that the chair be removed and we were told it was not possible. We called the duty manager who then agreed to remove the chair. By now it was more than an hour after we had arrived. We were tired and more than a bit angry. We requested extra cups, towels etc. which were brought to the room about 10 minutes later, No additional bottled water was brought up either. The next day, once the room had been made up we were back to 2 cups only and had to request additional cups again.

I will share my experience, too many positive things and few negative things that made me not giving it 5 out of 5: First of all the hotel's location is just great, it's in Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed Road, less than 2 minutes walk to a metro station, around 5 minutes walk to Burjuman Mall, around 10 - 15 minutes driving to Airport, Dubai Mall, and Deira City Centre, so location was very good for us however Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed road is always too busy which was maybe because of the high season we travelled at. The hotel offered us free parking for our rented car which was great as well. As the hotel is located in the center of the city, you can find a big supermarket and 2 pharmacies plus many small shops just downstairs, which was more than convenient for us. The hotel staff were perfect, very helpful and always had a smile, just had 1 strange incident with a receptionist that I was coming late at night with my wife and my friend's wife and the receptionist asked me if the ladies had already checked in with us or not! That was our 4th day so I have assumed that the staff had already recognized us, but anyway I just told him the rooms' numbers and that's it. But overall I was pleased to deal with the staff especially the Egyptian conceirage guy Ahmed and 2 Indian bellman guys and the guys of the room service, they were very helpful. Checking in and out took us only minutes, so that was seamless experience for us thanks to the staff. Going to the rooms, they were very spacious and comfortable, beds and pillows guranteed us a deep sleep after hectic shopping days, rooms were cleaned daily and always kept tidy, toilets were great and I enjoyed the rain shower. Also they offer tea & coffee complimentry facility, that was nice to me. Coming to the negative points, lighting in the rooms is extremely low; just a couple of spots and 2 low light bed lights, they need to have a strong lighting in the rooms. That really made my wife suffer each time she was dressing to go out. Another negative thing is the toileteers, they only include shampoo, conditioner and soad, they do not have shower gel so we had to get one from the supermarket downstairs, final thing they don't have bath robes in the rooms. For me if they just solved the lighting problem in the rooms I would definitely give them 5 out of 5. Overall I enjoyed my stay there and would recommend this hotel. I'm not very into Indian food so I haven't tried that restaurant in the hotel, so I can not judge the food there. My friend tried the gym once but he wasn't very satisfied from it, he said it was too small and only filled with trademills, but for me that didn't matter as I usually don't use the gyms in any vacations.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cEverything you need\u201d", "Author": "rosemaryCapeTown", "ReviewID": "UR122759202", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton hotel in November 2011 for 4 nights.

As a frequent visitor to Dubai, and having stayed at several (and patronized many) hotels in Dubai, I was very disappointed in this property. One would not expect five star service or amenities at a simple hotel, but surely they should have a strong focus on their target market and strive to succeed at what they do. Firstly, the course which I attended was very poorly managed by the hotel. Apparently they had booked too many functions for their capacity and ended up trying to squeeze a group of 16 into a tiny converted hotel room which they tried to pass off as a meeting room which would surely not be comfortable for a group of more than 8. They were shockingly unhelpful in this regard and seemed genuinely unprepared to handle such an eventuality. Eventually, our group was transferred to a room which was larger, but was on the ground floor, attached to the hotel bar, had no windows, and smelled very much like throngs of people had been smoking and drinking there all night... hardly an ideal venue for a course. Other than the bungling of the course management, the rooms are underwhelming, the location is a drag (as it takes 15+ minutes in a taxi just to get out of the dingy Bur Dubai neighborhood), and the hotel food offerings are frankly terrible. I will say however, the majority of the hotel staff were friendly and seemed to genuinely care. Still, a friendly staff does not a decent hotel make. Travelers to Dubai are blessed with abundant choice when it comes to hotel selection. There is ample selection for every budget and intention. My advice?

But first a little word of warning. I booked via hotels.com, no problem, there but when I arrived, I was immediately encouraged to upgrade for DHS 150/day to include breakfast, internet, better room and free bar drinks. The bar drinks turned out to be one token a day, the internet, I am pretty sure was already included and although the room was very nice, I am sure that a lower grade room would have been just as nice. Plus the comparison that was given for the daily charge for internet was not a true comparison, because it is lower per day if you there for several days.

They always had a smile on their faces - special mention to Mercy in the Promenade restaurant and also Persis on the reception desk. Both of whom were really great. I did have the BBQ on several nights again in the Promenade. Actually what was a pity was that it was very quiet. There is a chef there by the name of Debakar who really makes you feel welcome. This was not like the normal bland hotel buffet he really does care about the guests. I saw him happily greeting some and showing them round what was on offer on several occasions. There is also live music. The last night, I felt quite sorry for him. The food was really good, the BBQ was very very nice but there were not many people around.

Tip: If you get this hotel, tell the taxi that it is the Four Points Sheraton on Bank street rather than the real street Khalid Bin Al Waleed street. Will save you the time and money from the taxi to drive around. Overall, it was a simple hotel with perfect location for the type of city traveling we did.

We arrived at 8am and our room was ready early. Staff were extremely helpful. We stayed in a standard room and it was lovely. There was an enormous bed with lovely sheets. The bathroom had a window overlooking the room which we liked. (It has a blind that can be shut if you want privacy.) There was also a desk, chaise lounge and small table. The lighting was all mood lighting. There were plenty of mirrors. We used taxi's to get around mostly. But there is a metro about 10 minutes walk down the road and a new one is being built even closer. The metro is lovely and clean - but only two lines are open. The location of the hotel is great for the silk souk. (twenty minutes walk). From the silk souk you can catch an \"abra\" boat across Dubai Creek to the spice spice souk and gold souk. The abra ride was one of the highlights of our trip. The hotel is about a 15 minute taxi ride from Dubai Mall, which is worth visiting. The governement taxi's are very cheap, but they drive rather fast. We tried to British pub in the hotel, and did not enjoy the many patrons smoking. The food was OK, but not great. We used the free internet in the lobby, and paid on one day for internet in the room - a bit pricey.

To start off, I arrived at the hotel a bit before 8 pm. However, I did not find any member of the staff waiting outside to provide valet parking services if needed, to help carry the luggage, or to open the door. After reading some of the other reviews, it looks like they do not have any staff for this function in the evening, but only have them during the day. The lobby is somewhat dated, at least for Dubai's standards; however, I was greeted by two very friendly receptionists. Check-in was very fast, but I was asked if I wanted a non-smoking room, and when I replied in the affirmative, I was asked if a room with two single beds would be fine. I said that that would not be ideal, and so was then given a room with a king sized bed. The room was an executive room, and was very nice, yet somewhat impractical. To start off, the desk was very nice, while the chair and the couch there were very comfortable. There was also a plasma TV with around forty channels, with a relatively diversified channel selection. Internet was available for a fee that is written somewhere on their website, but is free in the lobby which I thought was a nice touch. The window was right behind the bed, and there was no significant view. The bed was also comfortable, but there was no choice of pillows, and they were all too soft for my liking. The main issue I had with the room was the soundproofing. As I was walking down the corridor to my room, I could hear what people were saying inside their rooms, and from inside my room, I could hear whenever someone closed their door. Also, at around midnight, the desert air, mixed with sand started blowing, and the sound was as if someone was taking a shower right next to me. Moreover, in terms of noise, the air conditioning was the main culprit, with sounds alternating from your regular clanking to a sound more similar to that of a helicopter. As I was trying to sleep around midnight, I did not call to complain since I did not think that the hotel could do anything about that, especially since I had to try and get as much sleep as I possibly could, and could not lose time on changing rooms or waiting for repairs to occur. There were further minor issues that I felt really harmed the overall quality of my stay at the hotel, and that could have easily been remedied with a bit more attention from the staff or the management. For instance, only one pen was supplied along with a very small notepad, while the pen turned out to be broken. No slippers were supplied, although I think that you have to ask for them, but just having them in the room would not hurt. The alarm clock next to the bed had the wrong time, and I could not understand how to adjust it, so I just unplugged it and requested a wake-up call from the staff who were more than happy to comply. The safety deposit box was placed in a location where one has to sit on the floor to be able to use it which is very impractical. Finally, only one 0.5 Liter water bottle was supplied, along with coffee/tea making facilities for two mugs. The water bottle barely sufficed, but what I felt was most ironic was that there was a tag on the bottle that said that \"of course it is free at the Four Points.\" If that bottle is not enough, you can always get an Evian from the minibar for around five dollars (of course that is not free, even at the Four Points). I think that it would have been better to just include two water bottles, especially since a bottle in Dubai barely costs a quarter of a dollar. However, one positive note is that an iron and ironing board were included in the room. The room service menu looked like it had been printed off a computer in black and white, and then photocopied. The food prices were very reasonable, the lasagna for example, cost around $13, but I did not get a chance to try the food. Now onto to the bathroom. The bathroom was very spacious, with a plethora of mirrors. There is a glass pane between the shower and the room that can be closed with a curtain. The portions of the amenities were very generous and I thought were of a good quality. The shower head was very nice, and can be seen in one of the attached photos, but the knob was not very good and came off from its place when I was trying to turn on the water. I also felt that the bath towels were too small, and should have been of a better quality. The hairdryer was not too great, and one has to hold the button to keep it going, in addition to not being very powerful. The breakfast was very good, the service there was great, and the selection of food was more than adequate. In addition to a buffet, there is a live station where a chef can make omelets for you. In my opinion, the best part about the breakfast was the orange juice. However, although they had pancakes and other cooked/baked options, I feel that it would have been better to also keep these at the live cooking station. Also, it would have been helpful to have labels for all the food just in case someone did not know what they were, although I am sure that the staff would have been more than happy to help if they had been asked. I did not use to the fitness center or the pool, but both were very small. Check-out was very quick. I was only asked if I had taken anything from the minibar, and did not have to wait for them to check as they do in other Dubai hotels. The concierge was also helpful, but he did not have any information as to which stores can be found in a certain mall. In conclusion, although the overall facilities at this hotel were not great, the rooms were very nice as were the staff. However, a few minor changes as well as a bit more care from the staff can easily push this hotel into the five star category, however, the hotel's rates seem to be somewhat affordable. I have attached some pictures of the hotel that I took, while the ones on the hotel website portray the rooms very well.

Stayed on a half board basis which was reasonable but most nights we were the only two eating. The food, although looked nice, was often cold and the choice of only steak or fish three nights of the week a bit boring, though I must say the fillet steak I had was excellent. They made an effort on NYE by providing party hats and poppers and decorating the bar and restaurant which was a nice touch. Breakfast was ok once you managed to get in. The restaurant is definitely too small for a full hotel. One morning we were told to sit in the coffee bar and we would be served from there. Unfortunately we had to fetch everything ourselves which meant carring hot drinks through the corrider from the restaurant to the coffee bar. We also found that they didnt seem to understand us very well. A number of times we asked questions and couldnt get any sort of proper answer.Just a blank look. The pool area on the 1st floor hardly saw any sun so we caught the free shuttle to the beach. It cost 5 dirhams each to enter the beach and then 45 dirhams to hire the sun bed and brolley.We also had a disagreement with the staff at the hotel as whether or not we could have towels for the beach. The front desk and concierge said we could fetch 2 pool towels but the pool attendant said no. We ended up taking towels from our room. Three days running we had to ring housekeeping for bath towels because the cleaner didnt leave us any and then for some reason the day before we left there was no toilet roll left either!!!!

It's this hotel's policy to provide every room with ONE 500 ml bottle of drinking water EACH DAY. Heaven forbid you ask for one more. You practically have to beg - or pay the always ludicrous mini-bar fee (5 bucks for a small bottle of Evian). Have never encountered this policy in any hotel I have ever stayed anywhere in the world.

Now, you might wonder \"why the fuss over a simple bottle of water?\" and that's exactly the attitude I would expect from a customer friendly hotel.

Taxis can be expensive if you use them for full day travel. Not all metro stations were open and not all attractions can be reached via metro. We combined the metro with taxis. Right outside the hotel (turn left as you exit) is a supermarket which also has a bakery and a small stall if you are interested in a small breakfast. There is also a street stand near the hotel that sells excellent chicken schwarma (turn right as you exit). We bought some and took them to our room to eat.

We had an executive room on the 7th floor which was kept impeccably clean for the whole tenure of our stay. We didn't hear any noise from the traffic nor hotel restaurants, either. The view wasn't anything to write home about but then again, you're not paying a premium for it either. There was a free wired Internet connection available at the room but not wireless, which would've been convenient for checking out email and weather with phone. The breakfast buffet was decent enough and never felt crowded. Perhaps a bit pricey, but it saves you from a headache to try and find a place to dine if you're an early riser. A supermarket can be found just a few steps to the left and it's open from 08 until Midnight, excluding Fridays when they close for three hours between 11-14. You might opt for getting your breakfast items from there, too. Room service meal portions were very generous, in our case two meals would've been enough for three. Whether the location is good, depends on your interests. Textile souk was close-by, as was the abra station to cross the Creek to Gold and Spice souks. Burjuman is the closest mall and it is situated next to the Khalid Bin Al Waleed metro station. You can use Metro to access Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates for even more extensive shopping. If you'd prefer to spend all days tanning and swimming, this might not be the perfect choice for a hotel. Having said that, you can use the hotel's free shuttle service to go to Jumeirah Beach Park. Admission to the beach is 5 dirhams and if you want to rent out sunbeds, umbrellas or towels they're available for 15, 10 and 5 AED, respectively. Of course, you can choose to stay at the hotel pool although it's quite small. They provide you with towels and there's a small gym as well. We had a late departure so we had a full day to us after check-out. Storing the luggage at the hotel and using their poolside showers and saunas was no trouble at all in the evening.

First, it's in a grungy area that is pretty dirty and grimy. The area is in a expatriate ghetto of some sort, so you have a lot of hard labor types milling around. Also, Dubai is shoehorning in a mass transportation system so a number of roads in the area, including the one in front are witnessing a lot of construction activity, so caveat-emptor. The hotel itself harks back to the 80s in terms of it's layout and furnishings but the room amenities are very good. The staff, while being helpful (accomodated a early check-in request) were less tactful when it came to settling the question of the free breakfast that came with my booking not once, but three times despite producing the booking which clearly mentioned it.

Positive: The staff was always very helpful. They did their best to help us with anything we needed. I liked the pool area a lot. It was nice and quiet, sometimes I had it to myself. It was sunny all day, and a very nice place to relax. There's also a jacuzzi. We chose this hotel because of the convenient location compared to the price. Anything more central was a lot more expensive. The food from the room service menu was good, both the breakfast and the all day menu. It was usually pretty easy to get a taxi from the hotel when we were going somewhere. Negative: The negative things are tiny and not important, but if I must say something negative, here they are: Some of the staff didn't speak English very well. We ordered steak with bernaise sauce from the room service menu, just like we had the day before, but this time they called us back after taking our order and said \"I'm sorry, we don't have lebanese sauce\". It took a couple of minutes to explain that we wanted bernaise sauce. Also a couple of other times they had problems with understanding us, but they were still very helpful. The shower seems old. It annoyed me that you couldn't use a handheld shower or adjust the height. The reception told us that the showers would be replaced within the summer, so hopefully that won't be a problem anymore then. Overall I really liked this hotel.

The room was equally run down as the first, at least the toilet worked this time. I was extremely disappointed to see how run down the rooms are, the walls and curtains could be cleaned. Stains on the pillows should be removed as this is very unsanitary, the lounge chairs require cleaning or reupholstering, so does the desk chair.

Both were fully satisfactory. This is a quite small hotel by modern Dubai standards and it is located on the edge of the old city. As such it is in the centre of more normal urban life \u2013 small shops, restaurants, hairdressers, tailors etc. which can be reached on foot - than the much larger hotels springing up elsewhere on locations which are essentially only accessible by taxi. The rooms I stayed in were very comfortable and spotlessly maintained and the staff was helpful and friendly in the extreme. The fruit platter provided on arrival was most welcome. There is a small but well-maintained swimming pool with comfortable sunbeds and shades. There is an ATM at the entrance \u2013 very convenient for newly arriving guests who lack local currency. Since there are so many other restaurants in the area I had breakfast only at the hotel \u2013 this is a buffet, adequate but not spectacular. There is a supermarket immediately adjacent (turn left out of the entrance). Across the road is the reasonably-priced Nefertiti Restaurant, which served a strange mixture of Lebanese and Russian cuisine and a hundred yards to the right from the entrance an equally acceptable Chinese restaurant. A little further, on the corner, is a budget-level shopping mall with a large number of electronics shops \u2013 a good place to come for computer equipment and accessories \u2013 bargaining is in order. A few minutes walk beyond this brings one into a warren of streets filled with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi-owned shops and businesses, including innumerable gold, electronics and clothing stores, internet caf\u00e9s and hairdressers. The atmosphere is friendly and very reminiscent of an Indian city and prices are very competitive \u2013 I had one of the best haircuts of my life for the equivalent of $5, which included a generous tip. I found this area \u2013 essentially \u201cOld Dubai\u201d - a far more attractive proposition than the prestigious but sterile vistas, boulevards and shopping malls of the new Dubai that is rising daily at an incredible rate. I was combining some sight-seeing with business but I suspect that most tourists who are interested in genuine local colour as opposed to a bland multi-star experience would share my view of this hotel\u2019s location as a highly enjoyable one. The one negative criticism which I have is one that applies to very many hotels these days. This is that the desk and chair provided are not comfortable for anybody using a computer for any length of time.
