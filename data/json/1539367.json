Location is perfect. Close to Kadikoy and its restaurants- 2 minutes walking distance...The downside is the room is very small and compared to the other hotel we stayed before in Istanbul, in terms of infra structure, this one lacked a little bit of everything: should be a little bit wider, a little bit cleaner, more light in the room would be nice and a lit bit more people friendly. Eg. the telephone in the room was cordless, but the phone lines connecting the phone base to the wall were everywhere... For the types of hotel you can find in Istanbul and the cost benefit of them, I would not go back to this one anymore- although the staff was super nice to us all the time!", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cA great visit\u201d", "Author": "Dogan34", "ReviewID": "UR120956796", "Content": "Hotels location is very good for all kind of purposes (visits museums shopping sight seeing ) The staff is very helpfull and kind , and also the hotel owner Mr Mustafa is like a walking guide, you may ask anything you want, he comes out with a solution(solution oriented guy).

Situated just a few minutes walk from the Bosphorus ferry terminals and Hyderapasha train station you can be in Istanbul's Sultanhamet district within half an hour. The hotel is a fairly recent addition to the local scene and boasts well appointed rooms with very good en-suite facilities an an in-house spa. Our experience of the renowned Turkish hospitality was enhanced at the Parkhouse with all members of staf particularly helpful and friendly. Istanbul's Kadikoy district has become, in recent times, a vibrant part of the city with good shopping (including a terrific fish market) and first rate restuarants serving traditional Turkish fare at a fraction of the price that you would find on the European side.

We found it to be a clean, moderate hotel with friendly staff who were more than willing to go out for their way to help . Yes it is in a back lane/alley and may prove difficult to find but the taxi driver did get us there by phoning them. Rooms are small but furnished with modern facilities, tea/coffee makers, TV , phone/alarm and an excellent shower! Lots of eateries nearby. In all could we couldn't fault it, it served our purpose.

Rooms were clean, and modern. There is a lbit of street noise, so recommend you sleep with the window closed, and adjust the radiator, as the room can get rather warm. Wifi is was very good quality / speed. Breakfast is fairly good - typical buffet style. The bar prices are the same as a typical hotel, so dont expect them to be proportionate to the cost of the hotel room. I didnt try the spa / massage, but a friend did and was very pleased with the service. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, though not all spoke good English - there was always one working who did. Kadikoy is a very good location for travelling, as it is very close to the port for ships / ferries to the European side of Istanbul, including one very close to the main airport. It has lots of small restaurants and cafe's from Burger King / MacDonalds to some very nice Fish and Turkish Restaurants such as Ciga. The hotel also offer a shuttle service to the airport on the European side for 85 Euro. Which is comparible to the normal taxis, but this can take 1-2 hours depending on traffic (which is getting worse), so I would recommend the high speed ferry / shuttle bus.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "laurengreat", "ReviewID": "UR79692332", "Content": "I just got back from the Parkhouse Hotel and had a great time. It's clean, friendly, modern, comfortable, very quiet and great value for money. The breakfast is lovely with a range of cereal, pastries, fruit, boiled eggs, cold meats etc. The spa is also great, it was very quiet when we went and we had the sauna (and freezing plunge pool) all to ourselves. We just told reception we were going down there and they prepared it all for us. The staff are very nice and the rooms are lovely and very modern but also quite small. Perfect for a couple though. They were clean, had a free safe and a minibar and were cleaned (with towels and bedding changed) every day. There was one small window which looked into a tiny, tiny courtyard (prob a metre squared) but that really didn't bother me. The room was very quiet and I slept really well. The hotel also has a flat screen TV in every room and free wifi which worked perfectly the whole time we were there. The hotel is on the Asian side. Although I probably wouldn't recommend this to families, it suited a young couple like ourselves. The ferry was very, very easy. Literally a 1 minute walk and very simple to use. Ferries are very regular (every 15 mins). Once you get to the European side (Eminonu) it's across the road (via underground walkway) from the tram line to Sultanahmet (the main tourist area). I really enjoyed the daily journey, though last ferry is at 9pm so may not suit party animals. I would say that the hotel is on a bit of a side street which could be a bit creepy at night to those of a sensitive nature. However, I would say I can be a bit jumpy and I thought it was fine and I felt very secure in the hotel. Although Kadikoy is largely residential we had no hassle and shop owners etc were very friendly to us (though many didn't speak English). Long story short... If you want to be in the heart of the action stay in Sultanahmet. Stay at the Parkhouse Hotel if you'd like to see another side to Istanbul. You get what you pay for but you won't find a more modern hotel for a better price!", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location, very friendly staff!\u201d", "Author": "couple1982", "ReviewID": "UR66449610", "Content": "I recently stayed a few nights at the Parkhouse Hotel and only have good things to say about it. The location is excellent! A minute walk from a major bus station with a direct bus to Sabiha Gocken Airport and many ferries taking you to all different places around the city. The Kadikoy area is very nice as well. If you are tired after a long day of sightseeing there is nothing better than come back to the hotel to relax and then pop out for a drink in a local bar with live music. I recommend walking to Kadikoy Moda, which has some great views and cafes by the sea. The rooms are very nice and look exactly like on the pictures, very new and clean, beds are comfortable and good size, shower in our room was big. The staff and the owner are very friendly and helpful and prepared to go the extra mile to satisfy their guests. Breakfast was also very nice with lots of things to choose from.

Don't take the breakfast, the pastries are not the latest freshness, the orange juice is a powder mixed with water (very disappointing when you see all the oranges evrywhere in the city) and the meat is a first price from hard discount supermarket. So you should wait and have your orange juice in the street ! The spa in january 2010 was unavailable, the paving was broken, it was smelly and freezing... weird for a turkish bath !
