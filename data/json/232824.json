The accommodations far exceeded our fondest dreams, and the chilled champagne and fresh fruit (\"for our special celebration\") were most welcome after our six hour drive from Bilbao.

Initially I wanted to stay in the Atlantica because of the reviews in TA but they did not answer two emails So further searches and we opted for the Orfila it was a little more at 210\u20ac than we wanted to pay for a 4 night stay in Madrid but with parking included and a Chateau Relais we decided to book it. After a vey hectic drive into Madrid including getting lost in the new underground road system with no GPS and no idea where to go We eventually got back into daylight and with the GPS working again and after 20 minutes of negotiating heavy traffic and crowded streets we arrived in a very quiet road in front of the Orfila. We were immediately met by a very smart manager who new our names, arranged the unloading and parking of our car. Our spirits lifted as we entered the peaceful graceful reception area, the hotel was all a Relais Chateau should be. Our room was perfect, huge bed large bathroom with Jacuzzi bath; the room faced the inner courtyard and was the quietest city hotel room we have ever had. The staff were fantastic nothing was too much trouble excellent directions and advice on where to go, they even booked and collected our train tickets to Toledo. The beds were turned at night with fresh towels and chocolates. On the second night we had a knock on the door and were presented with a bottle of sherry and two glasses with complements of the management. We did not eat in the restaurant or take the breakfast at 25\u20ac each we felt it was a little pricey but other residents we met said the breakfast was very good. There are plenty of restaurants nearby Enzos, Basilica, Bice. But be aware a lot of them do not open until after 20.30 Madrid is a fantastic city and we found the Orfila was well situated located in a very quiet area but within comfortable walking distance to most of the important places and very close to the excellent Madrid subway.

For example, we wanted to go to El Escorial and the front desk person told us the trains left every few minutes from Recoletos station. While it is true that trians left from there every few minutes, the train to El Ecorial left every hour, so we had to wait 50 minutes. Also, we arrived on a Monday and robes and slippers did not arrive in our suit until Wednesday, which is typical of service in Spain. We had started our vacation (with two separate stays in Madrid) at the Ritz. Frankly, combining the comfort of the Orfila with the service at he Ritz wouls result in a perfect hotel.

They were quick with suggestions, very helpful at every opportunity and always made me feel welcome. The service was one of the best parts of my stay and is the main reason I would go back. I liked that it was on a quiet side street in a residential area. This was part of the reason I chose to stay here. I was a 10 minute subway ride from where I was working. I was willing to give up a fantastic view for quiet. It's in a wealthy neighborhood with lots of embassies. It felt very, very safe. I walked to Chueca (and good food) in 10 minutes. The hotel does have a few drawbacks. There was no desk in my room , which meant I had to put my laptop on the dresser. They haven't quite worked out how to provide internet services either. They should just give away wifi rather than wasting so much time (mine and their staff's) trying to sell it. Other than these glitches, the hotel was very good. I give it a solid 4 stars.

There is no shortage of excellent tapas bars and restaurants in the Chueca area which is no more than 10 minutes's walk.
