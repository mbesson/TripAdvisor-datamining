However, the small details that one normally expects from a luxury hotel were missing on a recent stay. The first room offered reminded me of a new york city studio apartment with a poor layout and was far too small for a couple. The second room offered was much better but with twin beds that could only be brought together by rearranging the furniture. The hotel does not offer newspapers; the rooms lack full length mirrors and our room did not have a book of the services on offer at the hotel. Internet charges are 20 euros unless you sign up for the priority rewards program. Housekeeping forgot to leave shampoo or change the glasses in the bathroom. Small details make for a nice stay.

On arrival we were quickly checked-in and as a platinum Prioirty Club member I received a room upgrade which was greatly appreciated. We were given a room with a balcony, which was quiet as it faced the inner courtyard and enabled us to sit out in the evening as well as provide an additional source of breeze during the warm nights. The room was of a decent although not large size, with good facilities and clean. We never got the hang of the lighting system as we could have both bedside lights on, or both off, not one on and one off. The shower \"curtain\" (a piece of glass) had a design flaw which meant that the floor always got wet - a very basic error. Service was generally excellent throughout the hotel. The only let down was when I asked for the shaver point to be fixed on day 1, it still had not been by day 5 when we left. I have marked the hotel down by one star for continuing to charge for wifi which these days is a basic utility service. This is sheer greed and profiteering, rather like charging for electricty when it was first introduced. Additionally you had to be careful with the TV controls as there is a charge menu option for TV before you get to the free to air TV stations which were more than adequate. The hotel is a good mile from the tourist areas, and we were happy to walk to them. Some people will find they prefer to take a taxi, which are both plentiful and relatively cheap (compared to London) (and bluntly if you can afford to stay at the hotel you can afford a taxi).

Even the \u20ac160 is reasonable. The rooms are worth at least that. The Negative: The courtyard feels a little plain. It's not so bad if you don't look up. Looking up reveals an ultra plain box reaching up to the sky. Similar \"view\" from the balcony. Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the Balcony room but the walls look like they are from a jail house. Needs some vines or color to give it that \"this is the spot\" feel. This is the first all 5's I've given to a hotel pimarily based on the value boosting all the \"really goods\" to \"great.\" Would go back and reccomend to family.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cANOTHER FINE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "AUSSIETRAVELADVISER", "ReviewID": "UR132777196", "Content": "Great service, comfortable room, club lounge provides all the usual amenities including good breakfast service.

The hotel is plush in an old school way, complimented by the charming and always knowledgeable staff. Travelling as a solo woman for this trip, from the moment I was collected at the airport through to check in at the Intercontinental's Club lounge and beyond, I was made to feel special. The hotel I suspect is one of the busiest in Madrid and during my stay hosted an international conference of government ministers, a wedding and a communion as well as other events over my four night stay, so there was always something happening in the lobby and around. The rooms are large by European standards with big comfortable beds, a pillow menu, tea and coffee facilities and some like mine have a small balcony with chairs and a table. The bathroom is equally spacious with a proper bathtub and elemis amenities. A word about the bed and pillow - one word, sublime. I slept so well I almost missed an appointment one morning and as a habitual light sleeper, that's an achievement. The Club lounge is seriously great. The compact breakfast buffet includes the usual cheeses and cold cuts, juice and coffee as well as hot items which change daily, but a supplemental menu allows you to order eggs any way (try the spanish omelette), bacon and grilled tomatoes and the assortment of pastries, muffins and donuts tested my diet resolve daily. Snacks are available throughout the day as well as a selection of wine and afternoon tea sees cakes and other morsels brought out. The traditional evening drinks (wine, sherry, cava) come later than most (it is Madrid after all) with a selection of tapas and other items. The Club team from the desk staff through to the waiters were very helpful. Back to the services, I tried the spa, which I was told was in a temporary location until a new one is built.

The gym attached to the spa is small but functional and for business travellers, open 24 hours.

We stayed 7 nights and had breakfast in the lounge on 5 of mornings. The other 2 mornings, we went to the main restaurant for a buffet breakfast, slightly wider choice and also pretty good. We had dinner just once in the hotel restaurant towards the end of the stay, the paellas were excellent, as was the service, but \u20ac40 for two green salad starters is a bit steep. Rooms service food is a bit hit and miss - on the final evening we ordered whilst packing, my wife enjoyed the lamb tagine / cuscus dish, but my pizza appeared to be straight out of the freezer (I'd deliberately asked when ordering if they made the pizza fresh - I was assured it was :-/ ) ... \u20ac22 for a Dr Oetker style pizza is a bit steep. A room service coke was \u20ac9!!! Not that I bought one. The concierge guys were also very helpful, we got tour bus tickets and stamps from there, loaned umbrellas, had advice on which Metro and bus routes to use to the various attractions. The hotel is in a business area of Madrid, so not there's not much in the way of shops, restaurants or cafes nearby, just bank and insurance company offices. There's more to see on the Calle de Serrano which runs parallel to Paseo de la Castellana one block East. In summary, a good hotel if you take a Club room, excellent staff, but their restaurant / room service is overpriced.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daventry", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "E18MMA", "ReviewID": "UR127690678", "Content": "Booked the Intercontinental via Expedia on a last minute Easter break to Madrid.

I have never been in a 4star hotel before where newspapers weren't available to guests as standard in the breakfast area. 4) Staff at dinner were much better but its pretty expensive, A starter of truffled eggs (which turns out to be 2 fried eggs with some fried potato on the side) was about 20 euros. 5) Wifi is extremely expensive at 20 euros a day. 3 English channels (all news) On the positive side: Rooms are pretty generous.

It's an upmarket area in Madrid and you can easily walk to the city centre. Serrano, the famous shopping street, is only few minute walk away. It's also easy accessible to the airprot.

Concierge desk is mostly manned and the people are professional and have good local knowledge. Very friendly as well which is consistent in all Intercontinental hotels. Room: I was given my first room. It's decent room size with double sink. The room was comfortable, with a lot of information available. There is also a sunny balcony overlooking the restaurant in the courtyard. However at midnight we could hear the musick and feel the vibration from the wedding in the banqueting room.

I was impressed with the efficiency. The second room was on a high floor, with a small double bed, a single sink in the bathroom and no balcony. It's absolutely fine with me since I only needed a bed to sleep and the new room was as comfortable as the previous one.

I felt like I could have been Sandra Bullock's character in the \"Net\". If I disappeared from the hotel, no would remember seeing me there in the first place. Again, this hotel made me feel strange. What I noticed? The room was clean, and lobby was nice. Room service prices was insane. I was starving when I got there; ordered a burger; 40 USD (about 30 Euro. Because this was business trip I needed internet access, 27 EUR for two days (crazy). The location of the hotel was very good. Close to the metro and shopping. If I'm on a short business trip, I would stay here again. However, I wouldn't stay here while on vacation.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cMadrid spring trip\u201d", "Author": "tacph", "ReviewID": "UR109271500", "Content": "The negative side: I am a wheelchair user and had booked a room for handicapped with a connecting room for my assistance, however, rooms were connected but the door was blocked by a TV etc, My room was very small so I could not get around the beds with my wheelchair, the toilet was very low, so it was difficult to get up, the shower space was very narrow, and the beds very small, so I felt down from the bed one night.

On the second day I went to complain and was told the air conditioning is not turned on until the summer so I ask to have remove the heavy down comforter to be replace with a light blanket and to have the fan check to see why barely any air was coming out. No mention mention from the front desk to even change to a different room. We got back to the room after a full day trip and the room seemed to be a little cooler. During the night the room seemed to get very warm again and for the next few nights we had very sleepless nights because of the fan not functioning again. The next to the last day my wife went to complain this time about the room Now we were offered to changed rooms! Why did that not offer this after we complain the first time? We decline knowing we were leaving the next day and had someone come to the room to check the problem again. Well, the last night we seem to have a cool room again. Our problem should have been resolved the first time we complained but wasn't. The positive of our stay was Alfredo at the Concierge Desk. He was so helpful and informative in our stay .

I have deliberately opted out of the Interconti Ambassador program, because that is just a complete rip-off in my opinion. I do have Plat on Priority Club since quite a while now, and that usually gets me a friendly welcome, and even an upgrade at most hotels. Not at this establishment, I can tell you. The last three hotels I stayed in were Interconti Bucharest, Interconti Prague and now Interconti Madrid. Madrid was of course double the price of all the others, but not even half of the value. The staff are demur, unhelpful and generally depressing people to have to deal with. Don't beleive the marketing hype, this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. It's a 10 minute walk to the metro, (which is not the safest place to be after dark anyway) and after that an average of 20 minutes before you get to Sol, the start of the historical center of Madrid. THe standard (or superior as they call it) room was small, I received no upgrade, no club access, no internet and no breakfast for my 200EUR per night rate. Sadly there is nowhere near this hotel to eat breakfast. I would rather go without than pay this hotel a single penny more to be honest.. and it's not even my money! This also explains the queue of taxis waiting outside of this hotel day and night. FOrtunately I hired a car (having already had the experience of being ripped off by a Madrid taxi driver on a previous visit) but the parking in this hotel is extortion, simple and pure. I can only imagine how they expect to get repeat business. I think they are living in the past somewhat. I noticed 5 elderly staff on reception and three aged doormen all idle. Also, the hotel bars and restaurants are generally overpriced as a rule of thumb, but here they live that to the max. It was a mistake to choose this hotel, the management clearly has little repect for it's paying guests. Also, no pool, no sauna, expensive and slow internet, nowhere near anything interesting apart from the metro station.

Some parts of our stay were exceptional, but several issues occurred that made writing upon our return seem appropriate. We arrived early in the morning and were allowed to have an early check in as well as deciding to upgrade to a club room. We went to the club lounge and had breakfast (which was very good). We went to our room and found it to be great and tried to catch up on some sleep. The following morning, I checked my bank account and found that a hold had been placed on my debit card for $3070 us dollars for a 6 night pre-paid stay (we had pre-paid via priceline). I travel extensively for business and never recall a hold of almost 3x the cost of the entire stay being placed on a card. When enquiring at the front desk, I finally got someone to admit that the amount was high and that they would see what they could do. I would expect the hold to be in the $1000-$1500 range- but $3000??? The hold did not disappear until we returned home and significantly affected our ability to spend on the trip. The next day, during breakfast in the Club Lounge, I requested a Diet Coke as I do not drink coffee. Diet Cokes are free during lunch and dinner hours. I was rudely told that it was only for lunch and dinner hours, but he relented and brought one. I came back about an hour later and watched a family order 4 cokes and their request was granted without the nastiness that I encountered. The following day, I was enjoying breakfast, when I thought it would be nice to take my wife a cup of coffee, but was told \"you can't take anything out of the lounge\". Again the policy is understandable, but it is a cup of coffee, not two bottles of wine and a plate of food. I just fail to see why in light of the fact the hotel has $3000 on hold, why it should be a major issue to take a cup of coffee back to the room. I'm paying almost $100 per day for the privilege of the club lounge. On Saturday night, I went to the hotel bar for a cocktail. As per my usual, I ordered a double Makers Mark- which I drink at home. The cost for the drink was 32 euros, almost enough to purchase 2 bottles of Makers Mark. Jack Daniels (a comparable spirit) is 15 euros per bottle just a block down the street. The Mini-bar pricing and room service pricing was also the highest I have ever seen. That includes staying at Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Orient Express and almost every major high end property chain. At midnight on Saturday, a loud wedding reception with a band began in the ballroom below, treating us to 3 hours loud music. When calling the office, we were told there was nothing that could be done, but the music would end at 3 a..m. We went to the front desk the following morning, and were offered apologies and a comment that there would be no music that night, but nothing else. We were miserable for an entire day of touring due to the lost sleep. Later that night, the front desk sent up a bottle of wine and chocolate, a nice touch, but a 9 euro bottle of wine and a few chocolates do not make up for a miserable vacation day. On the second to last day, I requested to exchange some dollars for euros. The going exchange rate was in the low 1.30\u2019s and the hotel exchange rate was 1.59. The train station (which typically offers the worst rates in town) was lower than this. I stay in enough high end properties to know when I am being gouged, and this was clearly one of those times. I am not a frequent complainer, but enough happened during this stay that I felt the need to write. I am not sure what sort of satisfaction guarantee Intercontinental offers, but clearly the stay failed to satisfy us.

The television are dated and show it in their quality. Second, there are no light switches inside the bathroom, only 1 light switch on the outside of the bathroom. Thus, if you forget to hit the switch in the night, you must exit the bathroom and turn it on, and also, you cannot turn on light in say, just the toilet area which is usually closed off with a door. You have to light up the whole bathroom area and you must do it from outside the bathroom. Minor gripes though, and overall no issues this time.

It enabled us to upgarde to a Club room for \u20ac75 extra per nite while keeping the total cost of our stay within their normal charge for a standard room only. This was truly excellent value as it provides Club Lounge privildges which include free food and refreshements all day long from breakfast through to 9pm. Breakfast alone in the hotel costs \u20ac32 for two (i think) and drinks at the bar are outrageously expensive. Unlike the Hilton Executive lounges we've enjoyed in the past, beer and wine, including cava are available all day but sadly there are no spirits for those who like hard liqour! Also the range of food was not quite as extensive. We were astonished to discover that the limited hot food offerings which comprised only two dishes, fish and meat were exactly the same both nights and we were also a little disappointed with the hot breakfast items which were luke warm at best but tasty none-the-less. We really are splitting hairs here because despite these minor disappointments the club lounge was a superb vantage point to sit and relax, coccooned in comfort as people scurry past and cars whizz up and down the Paseo de la Castellana. The Hotel is two minutes walk from Gregorio Maranon metro station at the top of Paseo de la Castelllana which is a long broad tree-lined thorough-fare leading directly into the city centre, a very pleasant twenty minute stroll in the afternoon sun. Turn right at Banc de Espana to get to Puetra del Sol. A taxi from the airport cost \u20ac27 and the metro journey back to the airport took under one hour. The hotel entrance, lobby and bar are extremely elegant as are the spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. No wi-fi but there is a free high speed plug in connection. Drinks from the minin bar are extorionate. \u20ac5 for a coke, same for water and \u20ac6.50 for local beer (\u20ac7 for heineken) - very dear! Best of all was undoubtedly the supremely comfortable bed which was so luxurious that we actually over-splet and missed breakfast the first morning. Service was superb from reception to housekeeping and the highly professional Club Lounge staff with the exception of one guy who repeatedly took calls and messages on his moblie - again we're splitting hairs here. We had a wonderful relaxing stay in the Intercontinental. It is trully worthy of 5 stars but we'd only return if the price is right. We'd highly recommend it if price is not a issue for you!

The hotel is superbly located and we were upgraded without question from a club room to a nice junior suite. We took breakfast in the club lounge which was a lavish affair and had drinks and tapas there in the evening. The concierge and doormen were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this is probably where the positives end. Upon returning to our room on the second day we found our door key not to be working and upon enquiring with the receptionist it appeared our reservations had not been correctly linked (1 paid night, 1 Ambassador BOGOF voucher night and 1 night on points). We were asked if we were checking out as a result and the receptionist took some convincing and explaining to let us back into our room! On the third day we had a phone call again asking if we were checking out \u2013 these guys obviously still hadn\u2019t worked it out and this time the receptionist bluntly told us out of the blue that we would have to pay if we wished to use the club lounge for the final evening! We really felt as if we were being \u2018hounded out of the hotel\u2019. Despite asking several times the hotel did not appear to be able to deliver a complimentary newspaper. When one did arrive on the second day it was missing several key sections and was purely a photocopy. We had to ask for the Ambassador complimentary fruit basket and water and when it did arrive it consisted of just 3 pieces of fruit! Finally, although we had a nice room on the fifth floor it definitely lacked good quality double/triple glazing and was very noisy from the traffic outside. The TV was very dated and the complimentary tea & milk wasn\u2019t replenished after the first day. There was no soap in two out of the three dispensers in the toilets next to the lounge, the service in the lounge when we were allowed in was pretty poor and it was far too overcrowded with people at the weekend \u2013 probably as a result of the receptionist not really appearing to check who went in and out!

First the room was nice, and very comfortable. The only issue, which was minor was a building support pillar at the end of the bed. But you can live with this. But there was speakers though out the room in ceiling with volume control in each room, But there was no iPod dock or other music system. The TV in the setting room never worked. And the channel selection was very limited, and if you do not speak spanish, then your choice was CNN and BBC World News. But that was okay not there to watch TV, And we had complimentary WiFi for our stay. The cleaning staff was great and very friendly and very responsive. However, the other staff, except for the Manager and Front Desk Manager were very distant and cold at times. And if you did not speak spanish again, you had a hard time communicating, which I found a bit of an issue being in a major international hotel. The Club Lounge was very comfortable, however the buffet serviced breakfast which was fantastic, But then it was changed to snacks. And it did not change the rest of the day, We asked what time cocktails were serviced and we were first told 6 pm. When we showed up at 6 pm and then told it 6:30 pm, When we showed up at 6:30 pm then told 7:30 pm. And at 7:30 cocktails are not provided and had to be ordered from the lobby bar. And the buffet change for cocktails included a plate of cheese and a breaded meat on tooth picks. This represented a full change.

Other than the breakfast, was pretty much a waste of time. And I would recommend the hotel with reservations. The staff are a bit cold and unresponsive.

We arrived in Madrid on an early morning flight and were able to take the metro from the airport (recommended!) to the Nuevos Ministerios metro stop and walk the rest of the way to the hotel. The walk was safe and refreshing after spending too many hours sitting on the plane -- but be aware that the walk took close to 30 minutes. We arrived at the hotel around 9:00 a.m. and were thrilled to have a room available for us within an hour. The room itself was lovely, relatively large and clean. When we opened the curtains there was *no* view. None. The window was blocked by a large steel panel of sorts. Did it bug us? Not really. We were dead tired from the flight and didn't plan to spend much time in the room. Besides it rained the fews days we were visiting Madrid. The only major complaint to the room was that we flooded the bathroom when we took our showers. On a lesser note, the expensive breakfast truly isn't worth the money -- but no surprise on that. The hotel is not located in a convenient location for taking in the tourist sites, but like others have stated, the metro is within a five minute walk from the hotel. When the weather cleared, we walked to the Prado in about an hour's time. The Paseo de la Castellana made for a beautiful stroll. We returned to the Intercontinental a few days later for a single night before our departure flight home. The room was a little smaller, but it had a cute little balcony overlooking the Paseo de la Castellana (I think). Having used our hotel points in other Intercontinental hotels in Paris and Rome, I can say that using points for the hotel was a good, but not fantastic value.

Picking a hotel in Madrid was difficult because there are so many hotels in a wide geographic area that you could pick for different reasons. We ultimately chose the Intercontinental for a variety of reasons...Price, fimiliarity with the chain, and location. I'll address location first. We loved the location. It is off the beaten path but not so much that its a problem to get around. It is right on Castellana and 1 block to a metro station in either direction. It is maybe 2 km to the heart of the shopping (Serrano) district. The neighborhood is a high end quiet/charming residential mixed with a foreign embassy here and there. The streets are tree lined, pleasant and safe. Contrary to other reviews there are MANY dining options within walking distance. You really have to be willing to use the metro in a city like this to take advantage of convenience as well as an authentic experience. It is easy and cheap. We were bumped up to the Club level (room 635) and it was very nice. The room had a small sitting area that looked out over Castallana. The decor was very rich...Picture mid 80's trying to impress with gold colored fabric, blue accents, and dark hard wood. It was a bit dated for our tastes but none the less it was classic and clean. Well maintained. The linens were high thread count and exactly what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The only disappointments with the room were the TV (old and big) and the lack of a sound system for an ipod. The daily maid service was thorough and they do have turn down service as well. Service at the hotel was excellent. The concierge Alfredo Garcia was totally reliable and spoke perfect english. I would suggest that he actually made the hotel worth the trip. He reccomended several local dinning options that I would also reccomend (Wagaboo and Jose Luis as well as a pricier option IL Gusto). He also directed us to a place just outside of walking distance called IROCO that was quite exceptional (in fact its a must). We also arranged a tour of Toledo through the concierge. Also worth mentioning were the door men. There was one guy in the morning and one guy at night that were both very friendly and seemed interested in how your stay was. Very pleasant. Other services we used were the fitness center which was above average and the laundry service which was overpriced but totally convenient and did a good job. We had breakfast one morning and the prices were so outrageous that from that point on I ran across the street and 1 block north to Starbucks. We did not have any other meals at the hotel. I would definately stay here again, but before confirming I would explore two other places (Villa Magna and the Adler) that were closer and in our travels looked very nice.

There is a subway stop a few blocks away so it was easy to get to the various attractions but I would have rather stayed at a hotel closer to the Plaza Mayor and the old town. On the whole though, it was a very nice place and I would stay there again, especially if I could get a free room again.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Marie_Grazielle", "ReviewID": "UR32443355", "Content": "I celebrated my wedding at the Intercontinental Hotel and I must say that they have treated us absolutely wonderful from beginning to end.

Let me say that I was very pleased with my stay until the very end and would have given this hotel 5 stars across the board, were it not for the phone bill I received at the end of my stay. First off, the location is pretty good, as it is very close to a Metro stop and you can easily reach the rest of the city. It is right on the Paseo de la Castellana, so you are near the Prado and a few other sites. The rooms were nice, and I received a nice sized room. The decor is a little stuffy, but I liked it. The bathroom had a shower and seperate tub and 2 sinks, except the water pressure in the shower was terrible. I do not know if that was on purpose or if ours was not working correctly, as we never got around to asking. I used the shower head in the tub and it was fine. One thing that DID irritate me, was the desk calling every day at around 2 pm if we were still in the room with the \"clean later\" sign on the door, to ask what time they could come clean. I hate when hotels do that, and love hotels that leave you alone. Either tell me \"if your room does not get cleaned by X time you will not have it cleaned today\" or leave me alone until I leave, but quit bothering me every day. There were two nights where there was very loud music permeating the walls of the room coming from an unknown locale until about 2 am. I THINK it might have been a wedding or reception in one of the lounge rooms, but I could not be sure, as it was NOT coming from the street and not an adjoining room. The club lounge was very nice and provided a good breakfast if you have access to it. Very helpful and polite staff in the lounge. In fact, the hotel itself was filled with nothing but very polite and helpful staff. I did not encounter ANY rude people, as others have complained about. My main complaint was the outrageously overpriced use of the phone. I was charged 76 euros (about $111 at the rate at time of payment) for 12 minutes and 5 seconds worth of phone calls over 5 calls. 3 calls to the US for a total of a little over 5 minutes and the rest on 3 calls to a local spanish mobile phone. Seriously? I understand that I should have checked the posted rate they charge first, but I would never have expected in a high end, business hotel, that they basically would make it so you are afraid of touching the phone. It is not reasonable to expect that people in that type of hotel might need to make a call or two, and those prices are OUTRAGEOUS. The hotel is not paying anything even CLOSE to 4-6 euro a minute for those calls. That amounted to 10% of my total bill, for 12+ minutes of phone usage, more than half of which was 3 local calls. Needless to say, that pretty much ruined the stay for me, and lowers my rating to 4 from what otherwise would have definitely been 5 stars. I expect to be overcharged a certain rate for things in a hotel, but for phone calls that cost a maximum at the very most 10 euro total, to pay 76 is a outright thievery. I would return all things considered, but my sentiment towards the hotel is really ruined and I would certainly stay away from the phone at all costs and make sure I either get a cell phone or go to a pay phone on the street, because God forbid, I cannot use the phone in my room at an elegant 5 star hotel.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "tipperary", "Title": "\u201cThank God i was not paying for this myself.\u201d", "Author": "lollytipperary", "ReviewID": "UR30150289", "Content": "I unfortunately choose this hotel and stayed for 6 weeks as the location was near my workplace, Thank god i did not have to pay for this myself as i would have definitely not stayed.

The hotel is an excellent choice for a stay, although quite expensive and if you want clean, spacious rooms this is the place to go.

We found one restaurant and used it as our dinner place for a few evenings. However once you go out into the street the local people are not friendly if you do not speak Spanish and even if you attempt to use high school spanish they are not impressed.

Check-in was in the Executive Lounge! Our room was medium to large in gold and cream colors and was very luxurious. Our welcome amenities included Olive oil and water and a handwritten note from the Hotel manager. Our view was just fantastic over the famous Paseo de la Castellana. Our double bed constituted two single beds. One of us was happy and the other clearly wasn' t! Guess who? The TV choice was superb incl. CNN and all other channels! The minibar was fully stocked and the room was very well furnished. The Bathroom had separate shower and bathtub and two sinks for him like me and her like the other one! The bath amenities have been from Elemis! Just superb! The towels have been embroidered with the Intercontinental Club Logo! We have indeed two bought from the hotel after calling one stop button on the phone for service! The towels came packaged in nice gift wrapping and an Intercontinental Madrid bag! We still have the bag and ahhhhh the towels! What had you expected dear reader? The Executive Lounge was and is superb, really really good! We had organic cava and fruits, nuts, ham and olives skewers, nice drinks, and to our surprise Chuppa Chups Lollies and very fine gelee fruits to eat! Mmmmmhhhh! The breakfast at the next morning was also a hit affair incl. fresh bread, fine meat, fruit salad, eggs, yoghurt, coffee specialities served at your table! Really nice touch! We enjoyed also Internet access at the lounge for free! On our evening we had roomservice with a super large portion of Valencia Paella for her and for me a pizza with ham and cheese which was all nice plus our dessert which was a also large portion of apple pie, more pie than one portion! There was one small complaint however, as some other reviewers have written about! It is the awful hot chocolate, which was in our case drinkable chocolate pudding! This was definitely not a usual fine drinkable hot chocolate in the sense we all know and enjoy! So Intercontinental THIS HAS TO CHANGE! FAST! Please now serve good drinkable hot chocolate with marshmallows and leave the pudding for desert and not for a cup! The Hotel has also a Spa, time too short for us! The service and friendliness were all top notch! We had also a drink at the BAR 49 in the hotel which was nice!

All aspects of the hotel were designed to make our stay a delight, and the hotel staff were simply wonderful, attentive, and their attention to detail was impressive. We ate at the restaurant on our final night, and the food was delicious, the many staff on duty were prompt, and fully deserving of the tip we left. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who wants luxury, comfort and enjoyment. Taxis to the coty centre are about 10 euros and from the airport about 25 euros depending upon traffic. The hotel is well placed for shopping.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding hotel\u201d", "Author": "szabolcs17", "ReviewID": "UR5078328", "Content": "Everything about this hotel is very high-standard. I had booked a room for 3 nights straight (luxury weekend package) but had to interrupt my stay (2 + 1 nights) due to a rescheduled soccer game in Seville that I wanted to attend. When I called the Intercontinental reservation center, they told me this modification would not be possible to do, and I would have to pay penalties, along with higher rates. I later phoned the hotel directly and they modified my reservation immediately, with no extra charges. That was the first good sign about IC Castellana. Once at the hotel, everything went smoothly. Check-in was fast and efficient, the staff at the front desk was incredibly helpful and friendly. Contrary to some earlier reviews, I found no fault with the concierge either. The room (superior double) was spacious, facing Paseo de la Castellana. It had everything you would expect from a five-star hotel. Spotless, elegant, comfortable. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Breakfast was sumptous. Wide selection, including salmon, Iberian ham, and champagne. All requests (extra bathroom amentities, later checkout) were prompltly arranged. The location isn't bad either. Cabs cost around 5EUR to downtown Madrid, but there are two subway stations within walking distance too (Gregorio Maranon - 2 min. and Ruben Dario - about 5 min.). In about 40 minutes, you can walk all the way to Museo del Prado. All in all, a wonderful place to stay.", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cTreated like royalty\u201d", "Author": "CWinTX", "ReviewID": "UR5064275", "Content": "I can't say enough complimentary things about the Intercontinental Madrid Hotel. Every public area, from the lobby to the restaurant and bar to the fitness center and spa, was luxuriously appointed and immaculately clean. We reserved a room on the hotel's club floor. The package sold for 231 euros per night and included a one day Madrid card, which allowed for free access to Madrid's best museums. Our room was very large with a balcony overlooking the courtyard below. Our bathroom was huge with separate tub and shower and his and her sinks. The club area on the hotel's first floor (second floor to Americans) serves a full breakfast every morning until 11am. Wine, champagne and snacks are served throughout the day, with a number of great items available for tea from 5-7pm and hard liqour along with the snacks from 7-9pm. Every day you get one complimentary copy of a newspaper selected from a list of more than 300. I was able to read my hometown newspaper, The Washington Post, every morning over coffee, even though it was only 3 or 4am back in my hometown of D.C. - presumably just about when the newspaper came out. The service everywhere in the hotel, from the club lounge to the lobby and bar, was some of the best I've ever experienced. While most of the hotel seems to cater to high-end European businessmen and women, we were treated as equals, even though we were American tourists, speaking mostly English and not dressed in fine business suits each day.

We travelled with another family of four. We requested non-smoking adjoining rooms and our friends request was honored but our rooms were not adjoining. Our room and our children's room were very small, even for european standards with a view of the fire escape and dark internal courtyard. We had a king room which was about 2 feet wider then the king bed itself. It was dark and the beds were extremely firm and not comfortable. The bathroom was very small with only one sink but with good water pressure. Our room rate included breakfast which was excellent. The service was wonderful and the breakfast choices were very interesting and fresh. There was fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, omelets, pastries, lox etc. The concierge was erratic. One of them was helpful but the others spoke little english. The front desk was also of little help. When I asked to move rooms they would not change our room to a nicer room because our rate was too low for an upgrade. The location of the hotel was not too bad. It was a 15 minute walk to the museums or 5-6 euro cab ride. I must say after reading the great reviews on this website I was very dissapointed by the room size and quality. The lobby was grand and the breakfast 5 star but the rooms were way below expectations. Our friends adjoining rooms had a nicer view of the street in front of the hotel and they were a little larger. However they had two single beds and not a king as promised. I would recomend staying at a different place if I returned to Madrid. The Westin or Ritz would be a better choice. We stayed at this hotel because they had a half price special on the children's room and included breakfast but even with the discount I would probably look elsewhere.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "calvados13", "ReviewID": "UR4521307", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from a 5 night saty at the Interconinental.

The hotel itself is excellent - housekeeping/concierge/reception service was top notch, the room is spacious with an excellent bathroom and the fitness center is the best I've seen in Madrid (compared to the Villa Real, Crowne Plaza & other 5 stars). Best part was that at least from where I was staying you could pick up free (but faint) WiFi from somewhere downstairs and not have to pay the 20+ EUR/night fee. The quality of the food for room service I felt was lacking and was very expensive (but that's to be expected). The hotel is a very quick walk to the Metro stop which provides excellent access to the entire city by being on lines 8 & 10.

However,when compared to other Five-star hotels I found this property a little lacking. Firstly, food in the Dining Room was over-priced and quite frankly not that tasty. (After finding a sliver of glass in my soup after one meal we just could not dine there again!) Surprisingly, food from room-service was far better!!!Secondly, although housekeeping kept the room clean, each day we had to call to request some item/amenity they failed to replace. Lastly, and most frustating, was at check-out the Desk Clerk just did not seem to know how to process an American Express Travelers Cheque Card and we were overcharged 500EU. After THREE overseas phone calls back to the Hotel we are still waiting for a return-call,as we were promised,from someone on the Hotel Staff to resolve this problem. This Hotel is well above average and has many excellent qualities, but not quite Five -star in my opinion.
