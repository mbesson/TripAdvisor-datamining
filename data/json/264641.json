Hotel was lovely, the rooms were spacious, clean and nicely decorated, very italian looking just as you see on the website. There were plenty of hangers for clothes and the hotel came with all the little toiletries and a hair dryer. The only thing we didnt like was that there wasnt a safety deposit box to rent, you could pay 5 euros at the front desk, but it is only an envolope being put in a drawer. so i would recommend getting a travel money card before you go or taking a little lock and key for your suitcase just for peace of mind.Having said that the hotel is very safe and secure anyway and the staff are lovely. the location was perfect, a 2 min walk to the spanish steps, and 5 min walk to the trevi fountain, and theres a metro station at both so its really easy to get about. theres a lovely little restaurant we ate at twice which is opposite the american express bank near the spanish steps in the little square, the food there was the best we have ever tasted. When you get to the airport and you are at train station to take you to termini station there is a ticket station just as you walk in, we asked for train tickets there and he said for 15 euros each he will drive us to our hotel which worked out very well as its the same price as the train, and termini station is absolutely huge when we was returning we got the train and it was as if we were at a airport. Also make sure you have breakfast at the hotel, we found it very hard to find any restaurants that did breakfast, but the hotel has a nice selection of cakes and cereal. I am a travel agent myself and i will be recommending this hotel to all my customers.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torbay England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "nearingretirement", "ReviewID": "UR125217992", "Content": "This hotel is small, friendly, clean and set in a great location. our room was small and basic, very clean with a recently fitted new bathroom.

We were a little perturbed (very briefly) when on arriving at the hotel in the dark that the local police were standing outside holding what looked like a machine rifle, however it made us feel more secure. Once it was explained that they are always there we didnt give it another thought, in fact they were extremely polite and acknowledged us both morning and evening - giving us directions to the attractions which are right on the door step. In fact we noticed that the Caribinerri were present on almost every street and square we visited. We have never been to Rome before so this made us feel very safe all over the City. We booked through Citalia and found them to be very good, answering any question we posed. We decided not to go for the pre arranged transfer from Campino airport, that would have cost 85 Euro if selected, instead we decided to arrange ourselves.

Here you can get 1.5l of wine for 2 Euro's & 33cl cans of beer for 0.60euro, take them back to your hotel as we did. On our first night we had a Pizza for 8 Euro each but then had 4 pints of beer at 8 Euors each (total 48 Euros). The best experience was Zio Ciro o or Zi Cir (situated in Via di Propaganda (the next street from the hotel) where we had 2 fantastic freshly perpared spagetti dihes a litre of wine sweets and coffee for lest then 35 Euros - Great friendly, knowledgable cant do enough for you service, obviously proud of the food, well done and thanks. There aren't may public toilets around Rome, but the ones we found Spanish Steps, Colosseum, were nice and clean (despite some Rome reviews stating how bad the toilets in Rome were) and there is always Macdonalds - UGH! These were the worst we visited in the City - the MD's by the Pantheon - disgusting, the MD's by Plazza De La Repubblica was locked with message to obtain key from the Manager - if you can find him/her and then argue the toss obut not buying a sugar/salt filled burgar. Vatican Museum 14 euros each well worth it, but try although its difficult, not to get pushed along by the crowds. Monday is very busy so we decided on Friday and queued for 10 mins from 10.15 am after wailking from Hotel along the Via Cola di Rienzo, which took about an hour (no toilets until the Basilica mind) at a gentle pace. There are security checks such a Xray machines in the Museum and the Basilica which does delay your entry but hey! Enjoy. Must visit the Campo de Fiori, the market, fresh fruit & veg, see how we should do it, 90% of the stuff was home grown. If visiting on an empty stomach be carefeful as the restaraunti/cafes do tend to be over priced we found, and one in Piazza Farnese was extremely expensive & wouldnt serve drinks only. We noticed a few beggars 1 or 2 looked genuine, however when you see one chap in an eye patch praying and begging on the floor one minute and then on a decent mobile phone the next you tend to be a little doubtful as to their integrity. The guys selling flowers particularly around the Spanish Steps are a pain, particularly when eating - they offer a rose stem as a gift but then request a donation - they tend to be the same guys so they eventually get the message. Sellers also include the Asian looking guys selling bracelets, necklaces, sunglasses etc and the African guys (outside the Vatican) selling Dolce, Channel, & Dior handbags. Anyway to some Rome up - excellent, perfect location for the Hotel, dont drive (unless you are unstable) food & drink expensive (beer in particular) safe, beautiful and well worth another trip.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPrice not even close to what is stated here\u201d", "Author": "Malyshka", "ReviewID": "UR10558192", "Content": "I contacted the property directly through their website.

The hotel is nicely decorated, with antique furniture and a very quaint walnut lift: a refreshing change from the big chain hotels.

I'm not saying that I would necessarily wish to spend all day in the room, but it is perfect as a base for your Roman holiday.

We also ate in a couple of places and found the situation to be the same. was extremely surprised to be paying up to 4 euros for a can of coke?? and up to 8 for a beer and 6 for a coffee.
