The room was very clean and very well maintained. The lounge chairs on the balcony made us feel as if we were on the beach but without all the sand to wash out of the swimsuits! When we went to the outdoor pool we were treated like royalty! The female attendant immediately greeted us with plush towels that she laid out on our loungers and she had rolled up towels that were placed (just slightly rolled down) at the top of the loungers that made a nice pillow! The shops on the boardwalk level were great. The smell of good coffee greets you when you step out the elevator in the lobby. We only have two minor complaints: 1) the wi-fi was not so great (it went completely down during our stay for about 1 full day): 2) the lattice in between the balconies does not give you any privacy (perhaps this should be addressed at the next board meeting) oops i may have 2 1/2 minor complaints: 2 1/2) although we don't smoke, we didn't see any reason why guests can not smoke on the balcony..we saw some frustrated guests that could not figure that out..the balconies are outside All in all, it was very enjoyable! I recommend Phillips which is within one block. We had the buffet one night $28.99 per person and then the next night we had the carry-out 10 piece chicken that came with cole slaw, potato salad, rolls & butter ($18.99). We also highly suggest the crab cake sandwich (comes with delicious fries) $14.99. We could have feasted off the carry-out for 2 days at least! Hall's has an excellent breakfast buffet for about $10 per person (coupon in the flyers). Eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, yummy potatos, pancakes, waffles, biscuits w/sausage gravy, corned beef hash (or something very similar to it), fresh fruit, any kind of toast, bagels, cream cheese, cinnamon buns, and all the sweet stuff! Be sure to bring your bicycle or rent a surrey to pedal all of the boardwalk!

My husband and I had an oceanfront room on the 11th floor. All rooms have great views and next time I do not think we would pay the extra money for oceanfront. The hotel is clean which is VERY important to me. Maid service, check in/out, restaurant, parking, location was all good. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant 2 times and both times enjoyed it. Great service and food also, enjoyed the 24 hr. coffee shop and visited daily. Karaoke is in the bar Friday/Sunday nights which was entertaining. If you want to get a massage at the hotels spa you need to book ahead. We tried to make an appointment but, they were booked. I do think the $270 a night is a little high but would still recommend The Grand. Note: We were told this hotel is North of Ocean City when actually it is South. We walked one block to Phillips for dinner which was excellent. I had the broiled crab cakes and it was all crab, no filler. I highly recommend the restaurant. Another night we went to Fresco's Restaurant which is more expensive but had a table by the window, watched the sunset and listened to the piano player in the background. Once again, I recommend (you need reservations) Went to Fish Tales (walking distance) to see the sunset. It was nice to sit back, relax and have a cocktail but it wasn't my kind of place to eat. The hotel is about 15 minutes from Assateague Island. This is where wild horses roam the beach. Beautiful, peaceful beach with no crowds. Costs $15 per car for the week and was well worth it. Mosquitos are bad but, on the beach no problem. If your a beer drinker try Evolution (EVO) my husband bought a case while there to bring back. He also really enjoyed the Phillips brand beer.

As management of a hotel myself, I was completely flabbergasted. Not only does that put my security at risk, it shows a complete disregard for my anonymity. The noise started up again soon thereafter, at which point I called and spoke with Kara, the manager on duty. She informed me that the noise I was hearing was because of a wedding. She then said she would verify this because it could possibly be from a neighboring room, and follow up with me with a call to my room. It has now been 30 minutes and I have not heard anything and there is still noise.

All in all our experience was decent. Location is perfect if you like to be on the boardwalk, but away from the busier area. You literally walk out and onto the beach. Very nice. Check in was easy, plenty of parking and the room was as advertised. Staff is very friendly. We had a \"signature\" room on the 11th floor with a pretty full ocean view. Balcony was big, but only semi-private. Not all observe the no smoking rule, but can't blame the hotel for that. Room was generous in sizing. We had two queen beds and there is a small kitchenette area with a microwave and a refrigerator. As others have commented, the bathroom is very small. Two people cannot get ready at the same time and there is no exhaust fan. If a hairdryer is vital for you, I recommend bringing your own. My friend thought the one provided was too small. I was trying to figure out when this place was built because it does seem a little dated, but I think some of that has to do with the reality of being at the beach. I spent a lot of time at the Jersey shore growing up and I realize that house and hotels close to beach can take a beating with people dragging in sand and wet items. They are apparently trying to upgrade. Pools were typical of hotel pools - the Grand's was certainly clean and the pool staff was very nice. Like can be typical of hotels of this type, exercise room was present but not much to speak of, but just put on your running shoes and hit the boardwalk round trip and you have 4.5 miles. Had a minor issue with the AC - seemed to have a mind of it's own, but for the most part we were able to have the room temperature about were we desired. We reported it to the staff and they did try to address it. Can't say it changed much and we didn't say anything else about it. Twenty-four hour cafe in the lobby area is a nice addition. Never got a chance to use the spa - our bad - we didn't book early enough. Looked nice. Stay away from Phillips across the street. Take the bridge and go to Hooper's instead. And by Hooper's there is also a nice group of people running parasailing and jet skiing. My bottom line is that it is an average to slightly better than average beach front hotel. I do think that ALL of these places tend to charge what they can get from you - which can vary from expensive to really pricey. I'd probably stay here again, but I'd also maybe want to try somewhere else too. Oh - if I could have one wish for the hotel, it would've been a screen on the sliding door to the balcony so I could've heard the ocean as I went to sleep (I didn't want to get bitten by those tiny flies all night!) but these are probably hurricane doors which might preclude the screen.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Nanette J", "ReviewID": "UR138878307", "Content": "This was my husband's and I first time at the Grand celebrating our 1st year anniversary and we enjoyed every bit of it.

Having said all this, Sharon in the spa was fantastic and should be commended for her work. Next: Housekeeping was inconsistent. One day things were proper, the housekeeper even arranged the stuffed toys on the beds for the kids. That was sweet. But the next day, the washcloths were in a pile stacked with towels, not folded. We never got fresh water glasses. I used the lotion (nice light-lemony scent) but it wasn't replaced. This was supposed to be a Signature Service room. It sounds picky, but I fold my washcloths and get clean glasses everyday at home, and this wasn't a camping trip, it was a hotel trip. Next: there was a foot-washing station on the side entrance, but my kids needed a good hose-down, so we needed to go to the 2nd floor pool area for that. Too much fussing. Overall, it looks nice on the website, but really not so Grand. I personally didn't like the coffee at the coffee bar, luckily there was a Dunkin a few blocks over and it's always nice to walk in the morning. Looking at the other reviews, I am thankful we didn't have any Alarms, and we didn't have any problems with the balcony doors. The take-home message to management is this: you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. Our trip started off sour because we were not made to feel welcomed. We will not be returning and will be telling everyone of our experience here. The take-home to travelers is this: we stayed at Park Place on 9th St last year.

It is nice to sit out on the balcony at night, have a few drinks (and cigarettes) and watch the ocean and the boardwalk. In the morning....have a coffee and a smoke while watching the sun rise has always been a tradition. This year was different. I was sporting bed-head, sunglasses and a baseball cap, while sitting in a group of strangers (who also were unhappy). It was uncomfortable at best.

The Grand is a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location. We have been traveling to OC for over 12 years and have tried other hotels, but we have chosen to stay here for the past 6 years for good reason. Nothing beats the Grand. The room at the Grand is very large. The beds are comfortable and the floors are quiet (no door slams, loud neighbors). The views can't be beat. The \"premiere\" view and \"oceanfront\" rooms are obviously the best, but the design of the hotel lets you have at least an ocean view from any room. We have been requesting the same room for the past few years, and the staff at the Grand has been more than accommodating for us. We actually feel like \"important\" and \"valued guests\" at the Grand. Hotels are so commercialized these days, you feel like they just want you in and out so they can make another dollar. We never feel this way here. And, for a resort area, the prices are reasonable! The Grand is situated on the boardwalk just far enough away from the chaos and noise. It is about a 25-30 minute walk to the inlet. You can also easily pick up the boardwalk train from right outside the door. The beach in front of the hotel is crowded, but you can easily find a spot to relax. There are surf shops, a pizza place, and a coffee shop right downstairs. There are also restaurants, mini golf, shopping, and more within a reasonable walk on Baltimore Ave. and the Coastal Highway. The pools at the hotel are small and crowded, but nice. There is a pool bar and a small arcade, too. The only complaint I have with the Grand is trying to obtain a luggage cart on Saturdays/Sundays! You swear you were trying to get the last sale toy on black Friday!! People are vicious in that lobby! There probably are a good 15-20 carts available, but people are usually using them all. People stand around and wait for some to free up and grab them when they do. One year, people were actually walking to people's cars to ask them to use the carts when they were finished. It was a free-for-all. I'm not forward (and didn't want to be a pest) so I waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually, I gave up and we just lugged our belongings down in 2 trips without a cart. Maybe you can organize some kind of waiting list for carts? I think you had something like this last year, but people were still out there trying to snatch them before your staff could give them to the next patiently waiting guest. Although annoying, this is not a deal-breaker. Just thought you would like some constructive feedback and suggestions - hopefully you can make that process more organized.

That being said, the room was very roomy and it never felt crowded. The bathroom was small but I didn't mind too much. It was nice to have a refrigerator, sink and microwave in the room. Great for keeping drinks cold and re-heating leftovers. The views were the best! Definitely spring for ocean-front and not ocean view. My husband even saw a mama whale and baby in the water! It's on the boardwalk but away from the \"busy\" parts which I liked. It's about a 20-25 min, walk to reach the amusements at the end of the boardwalk and they have a tram car that runs the length for those who don't want to walk that far. The weather was not good while we were there (cloudy, cool and a little rain) until the morning we were due to leave(our bad luck), but the morning sun shining on the ocean looked fabulous! There is plenty to do within walking distance of the Grand; mini-golf, restaurants, the bay side of the island, and plenty of stores (liquor, candy, ice-cream - what more could you want?) We did not use the pools or eat in the hotel restaurant. We only grabbed coffee in the coffee shop (which is open 24 hrs) off the lobby area and had pizza in the shop on the boardwalk level which was good. Would definitely like to return and spend more time in Ocean City when the weather is better. Bring lots of money though, eating out is very expensive here ($61 for breakfast at a Pancake house?!) but that's like that at any beach town I guess. The beach itself was clean as was the boardwalk.

Our criteria for selecting an Ocean City property is oceanfront, a hotel (not a motel) and right on the boardwalk (street 15 or higher \u2013 anything lower than that is too hustle-bustle and high energy for us). As the title says, I\u2019d rate it a solid \u201cB\u201d overall. There\u2019s nothing bad about it but nothing extraordinary about it either. The best thing about the property is its location. Situated ocean front and right on the boardwalk, it\u2019s easy access to the beach, morning bike rentals (@ Eden Rock two doors down), restaurants, shops, the pier, rides, etc. You can really park once and not drive anywhere the rest of the trip. The rooms are fine \u2013 two queen beds, clean, and a small kitchenette area with mini fridge, microwave, sink and cupboard space. There\u2019s a fairly large balcony \u2013 all have an ocean view. We upgraded to the signature room (floor #10) and probably wouldn\u2019t do that again next time. Not enough extras to warrant the extra cost. There is an outdoor and indoor pool, which we like. The outdoor pool is nice with plenty of chairs and chaise loungers, and towels are offered for pool use. There are also large blue towels that are the length of the chaise loungers (this is new since the last time we were there). We like the indoor pool for drizzly days for our girls. A small fitness center is next to the pool area, and there are rest rooms with showers and a sauna in this area, too. We use the space to change in before our rooms are ready at check-in. Front desk staff was very nice. We arrived at 12:15 PM and our room was ready by 1:30. Staff is always out and about sweeping and mopping as guests track in sand and water. There\u2019s also a spa, but we didn\u2019t visit. Parking is easy and convenient with a small outside lot and large garage immediately next door. There\u2019s a restaurant, pizza shop, retail souvenir shops and a 24-hour shop (coffee, water, snacks, etc.) all on site. So, overall, a good place to stay. Note: My first choice is actually the Holiday Inn on 17th, but for nearly $499/night, it\u2019s just not in our budget.

The amount of dust that came off the lampshade when it was accidentally brushed into created a cloud of dust.

It was an amazing opportunity so we chose the Grand. It looked incredible online and I loved that the General Manager answered all reviews good and bad. This really impressed me. I chose the hotel based on its ammenities as well as the pride the General Manager seemed to take in his hotel. My boyfriend and I are looking to plan a wedding in the near future and thought the Grand might be the place to do it based on all of the reviews. When we arrived we were able to check in early at 2:00pm, our room was ready which was great! When we got up to the room, we were in Room 304 which I knew right away would be on a corner since I had done some research before I got there. So I was a little disappointed as our first adult getaway I would have loved a middle room with a view of the just the beach but our room did provide us with a view of the beach and the street which was fine. Opening up the door to our room I was a little disappointed as I had this amazing vision of what it would look like inside the room since this was my understanding that it was a luxury hotel but it looked like any other hotel room, with the old comforters and the red hotel rug and old furniture. The desk in the room looked like someone had sat on top of it it was warped and looked ready to fall apart. On the second floor I saw that tile floor was in some of the rooms and I had wished we could have gotten on of those rooms because they just looked cleaner. The bathroom was small but it was clean. We didn't experience any bed bugs thankfully and believe me it's the first thing we inspect for when we arrive. No need to have your dream vacation weekend turn into a nightmare. And on the first day we called down to get a lightbulb replaced over the kitchen area and it never was so we removed one from the bathroom and put it in the kitchen area since the bathroom had many lightbulbs available. I also had to call down for maid service since the maid went right past our door with the sign maid service please on it. Now for the great parts of our vacation. Absolutely a million things to do in this hotel, from the sauna to the spa to the game room to the indoor and outdoor pool. Absolutely close to everything!!! Also loved that off of the beach I could use the downstairs bathroom and go right to beach. Wonderful!!! Also on check out day you can stay parked in garage until 2 which is great because it was amazing to be able to relax one more time by the pool and have a drink before the long drive home. Knowing we were going back to four children this was the absolute best part of the trip!! You have this amazing service where the pool person comes over and sets up your lounge chair for you and the pool bar is great! The bartenders aren't very experienced or fast but you get a good drink eventually. The margaritas by the pool superb! The EPIC bar is great except it doens't get alot of customers too often at least we were the only ones in the bar on Saturday night after midnight and Friday night we went to karaoke there and the while entertaining, the karaoke person sat the entire night and his equipment was less than amazing. The sound was not very professional but we did have a good time there. The bartender never heard of a shaker before and then mixed my shots in a shaker. LOL I thought that was funny. All in all I thought that this hotel was great for its ammenities and had a lot to offer however I feel like if I wanted the room lap of luxury to go with it maybe I had to pay a little more a night to get it. I did pay almost 300.00 a night which to most people I guess isn't a lot of money but to a couple raising four children we just thought we would get more room for our money but honestly, it was a great trip and we really did enjoy our stay with the exception of the little instances I stated above.

A few years ago we stayed at the Park Place Hotel and the reviews of it were spot on just as they have always been. The only reason we didn't stay again was that we wanted to stay on the quieter end of the boardwalk. So, in choosing the Grand, my priority was quiet side of boardwalk, ocean view and clean. I originally wanted the Holiday Inn but it was not available. I was nervous because at the time I was looking, the Grand was at about 30 on the tripadvisor list. However the key elements I wanted were met and I really liked how the managers read and commented on many of the reviews - good and bad. The Grand is a great shaped hotel. It curves so that every room has a view. We stayed on the 11th floor on one of the side rooms. We had a fantastic view of the ocean, the city and the bay. At night the city was lit up and looked cool and, of course, during the day the ocean and bay looked beautiful! The deck is very large and is sparsely decorated with two little old white plastic chairs and little side table. We set up our beach chairs and turned it into a great deck! The bedroom was very big and looks just as it does in the picture on the website. The bathroom, however, is very small. Probably the smallest bathroom I've ever had in a hotel. But, it was very clean. Also, the towels seemed relatively new (although an old towel was mixed in once in a while when the cleaning crew changed them). Our room only had a small fridge with a microwave on top and a old coffee maker. I had glanced into other rooms on our floor and they had little kitchenettes in them which I would have liked better but not enough to ask to change our room. You may need to request it if you are counting on a kitchenette. The furniture is worn and outdated but, again, clean. The beds are not the most comfortable - a little too stiff. The linens and blanket were nice though. The pillows were very old and flat. I think the desk may have thought I was crazy because I asked for 5 extra pillows - but honestly, that didn't even help. The assortment of pillows that we ended up with were in all states of overuse. Note to management . . . buy new pillows! There is a t.v. in the room but it was old school and very dark. If you want a good wifi signal you need to go in the hallway or downstairs to the lobby. I know that many people like to say, well you're at the beach - so what if the t.v. is old or you can't get online - go outside and have fun! I get that argument. My answer is when you have spent all day at the beach and walked around for a couple hours, sometimes you just want that downtime to watch something on t.v. or research fun stuff to do or good places to eat on your computer or tablet. It's 2012 I think that a great hotel needs to keep up to date with technology no matter where it is located. My last thought on the room was that I wondered why there wasn't a little sofa or maybe two nice side chairs to sit on. The room is very large and could accommodate either very easily! The outdoor pool was a good size and clean with plenty of lounging chairs. The inside pool was significantly smaller but, good that they had that option. We ordered drinks at the poolside bar - that was a nice treat. We never ate at the restaurant. It's on the 6th floor and whenever I stopped to look it was either closed or hardly had anyone dining in it. That's all the warning I need to not try to eat at a restaurant. Plus I don't remember seeing it reviewed very nicely on TripAdvisor. Side-note, we did eat breakfast next door at the Sahara Cafe and it was tasty and inexpensive. Check-in was normal and pleasant as was checking out. The shops attached to the hotel were your typical boardwalk shops. Fun touristy stuff. Oh La La had really cute shoes. My kids had ice cream at the parlor and said it was yummy. I bought a t-shirt at another store that had very nice employees. Personally I didn't like the pizza at the pizza place and preferred Franco's a couple blocks down the boardwalk.The coffee shop seemed convenient - I didn't end up buying anything there but the pastries and coffee looked good and I think it's open 24hrs. Best thing was that when you left the hotel all you had to do was cross the boardwalk and you are on the beach! Which, to me, was the most important part of our vacation. I love Ocean City, MD's beach. Its very clean, not a lot of shells to step on and whenever we have been there - no green flies to bite you. We saw dolphins, surfers, windsurfers (of course the annoying advertising boats) and the water was wonderful. With that, our vacation was perfect. I did like the Grand. I couldn't have asked for a better view and thought the price we paid was affordable. As far as staying there again, I'm not sure. I think I would have to see on their website that they have upgraded the hotel with new beds, t.v.'s, room furniture and even simple things like new shower curtains and, of course, pillows. If I see that, I will be back in a heartbeat and recommend them to all my friends otherwise, I will just make reservations earlier at the Holiday Inn.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irwin, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGrand Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Cyclone2933", "ReviewID": "UR132929676", "Content": "For over 40 years I've been going to OC and have stayed at some great places, and some not-so-great places. This will be the 3rd year that we have stayed and the Grand and years ago, I remember sitting on my deck in the Thunder Island condos, watching the Grand being built and remember thinking, \"what a cool curved hotel, I'd like to stay there some day.\" We arrived Wednesday, June 20th right in the middle of the MD State Fire Assoc parade, and we were warned about the traffic mess it caused even before we left our house. The front desk staff told us not to come in on rt 50, but to take the alternate route and come in through the northern part of OC. What a great tip. Since we got there before check-in, the front desk told me that they would text me when our room was ready, so we changed in the 2nd floor changing area and went swimming in the outdoor pool and watched the fireman's parade from the pool deck. Our 11th floor Signature room was very nicely appointed and this was the 2nd time we took advantage of the Signature room. The views from the room were spectacular and the room in general was very nice and clean. The beds were comfortable and the 4 of us loved the crisp white sheets. Other things to love at the Grand are the ample parking spaces in the garage and the proximity to every thing including dining, mini golf, souvenirs and the boards. If there was 1 negative thing that we could say, it was that our room was not made in about 2 days. One day the house keeper said she'd have it done, but never came back, then the next day we were out of our room at 10am and didn't return until after 4pm and the room was still not attended too. We did call the front desk and someone did come up after 4:30 to take care of our room while we went to dinner. The final thing that made us shake our heads, was our neighbor in 1114. Sometimes you just remember people, and this was the second year we stayed next to this particular gentleman.

You literally walk out of the hotel onto the boardwalk, no steps to go up or down. There was a parking garage right next door so our car did not have to bake in the sun (which was appreciated during the nearly 100 degree days). Negatives: Breakfast in the restaurant was only ok and very over-priced. The walls were a bit thin and we could hear our neighbor's TV and could even hear them talking. The air conditioning unit was set to \"auto\" and was glued so it could not be changed. This caused the air to turn on and off constantly as the thermostat adjusted. Normally this would not be an issue, but the unit was so loud each time it turned on, that it sometimes woke us up during the night.

Nobody is above anybody else but just members of the team. We were just there for a few days in June. When we checked into the hotel we were met by Levi and Ryan at the front desk. Ryan remembered us from our last stay. In addition to Ryan we met some new team players Stephanie, Danni, and Levi. They checked us in in a very timely manner and checked to see if there was anything they could do for us. Mr. Patrick Staub also greeted us by name. He is a manager that likes to see and be seen by the guests.Housekeeping kept our room spotless. The only problem we had during our stay was being short changed in the Pizzaria twice. I brought this to the attention of Anna the director of Food and Beverage at the Grand. As soon as I informed her of the problem she snapped to and took care of the problem right quick and fast.

Called earlier in the week with a higher floor request and was somewhat hopeful that our request would be granted. The disappointment regarding this manner was when I went to park the car and met with another person from our group and she told me that she was given a room on the 10th floor. So instead of pleading with the front desk about this, I just let it go because it was late and my wife and daughter were already settled in. The front desk/lobby area were nice but that is just a facade. Don't know how old the grand is, but it does need some \"sprucing\" up like carpeting in our \"upper\" 2nd floor. Why no carpets? The bed was harder than what I'm used to. Other than the sprucing up topic, I suppose it is a nice place to stay. Don't know if I would come back.

Located at 21st and Boardwalk, the Grand is unusual for a beach hotel in its sheer size. It boasts a very large lobby and ground floor with several beach-type retail shops, a pizza place, and a 24 hour coffee shop. The lobby exits directly onto the Boardwalk, as well, which is extremely convenient. Only a few blocks from the north end of the Boardwalk, it's also quiet. The parties and crowds happen further south, but it's an easy walk to get there. The hotel is an ocean-facing semi-circle and all the rooms have balconies with ocean views, although the closer to the middle you are, the better. The rooms themselves are above-average for a beach hotel and feature microwaves and mini-fridges. The beds are comfortable and they give you plenty of pillows. The television is basic and does not feature any on-demand programming, which would be a nice addition. There's also no room service - again, not uncommon for these beach hotels in Ocean City. The only significant complaint I have about the rooms is that the sliding glass doors onto the balconies, while large enough to provide great views, are often covered by a salty film that results from condensation between the glass. There's no way to clean this, but it definitely detracts from the overall experience when you can't see the view you paid for without going outside. Some of the rooms are better than others and the last time we had a really bad one, they moved us without a problem. Otherwise, the only other complaint I've ever had there are that they frequently host large events in their ballroom and if you're actually staying on that floor, it can get noisy. Ice machines and soda/snack vending machines are on alternate floors, so you may have to take an elevator to get ice, but again, many smaller beach hotels may only have one ice machine in the lobby, so that's really not a big deal. If you're looking for a great place to stay on the Boardwalk, but not expecting a five star resort hotel, the Grand is excellent.

Imagine my dismay when the front desk clerk informed me that my room was in fact NOT direct oceanfront, and they were completely booked and could not put me in such a room. However, before I could say anything, I was then told \"I'm so sorry for this. Let me speak with my manager & see what we can do for you.\" Such FANTASTIC customer service!!!! I was told I could go up to the room, check out the view, and if I took it they would give me a 20% discount per night for my troubles. I must say again such WONDERFUL customer service!!! Both girls at check-in that night ROCK!!!! Our room (619) was just great for what we needed. The only \"bumps\" we ran into were: the water temperature in the shower (the water kept running way too hot), the game area (majority of the games kept eating our quarters ~ a HUGE dissapointment to our little one), and the indoor pool (really small for such a huge hotel; the water temperature the first day was too cold, 2nd was better... though it was the morning of check-out). The hotel has a 24 hour quick stop on-site where you can get a quickie breakfast or snack during the day, and a pizzeria (really yummy pizza), where we had lunch Saturday. I would've loved to use the spa amenities, but ran out of time. The location of the hotel is right on the beach, but away from all the hustle & bustle of the \"main\" boardwalk which is nice.

When speaking to the \"reservation manager\" Nina four days later, after 3 phone calls & an email, I was told sorry that is the price & it didn't matter what I booked they weren't giving me that rate. What she could do is charge me the $200.00 more & give me a generous free upgrade..... Really? Free? I call it a $200.00 dollar upgrade and an injustice to consumers. How do you accept a 50% deposit & charge a credit card to decide your not giving the rate quoted because that wasn't supposed to be the rate? Sounds like issues in their system & not my fault! I should not be charged for their mistake! The Grand manager Patrick then called me patently dishonest for making very sad attempts to get the quoted rate. I was refunded my money so that they could say they offered every available option. This will cost the company thousands of dollars in return visits & I would beware just because it looks like your getting a deal doesn't mean you are!

I removed the so called libelous content, but would like everyone to know this hotel does not offer customer service in any fashion. It has many terrible reviews on the internet for a reason and despite Patrick's belief that I am the only person in America not willing to pay an increased price because the law will not make him honor the original price given from his website directly, I am sure others value their hard earned money as well and deserve to know in advance the company they are dealing with before making binding decisions.

The walls were very thin and ever noise could be heard.

Staying here is like staying at a mini all inclusive hotel. Ideas for improvements would be: It would have been nice to have a couch in our room so that we could sit and drink coffee while viewing the ocean (we had dbl queen beds and a small table with chairs. There is 1 other chair (at the desk) in the room. The room sleeps 4 but only has 3 chairs, so someone had to sit on the bed to eat, talk, relax, etc. Couch and cozy chair would have made it much nicer. Another suggestion would be to upgrade to a flat screen tv. Our tv was small and the picture is not as clear as HD. Also, it would have been nice to have some basic dishes, silverware and napkins in the kitchen area. When we went to get ice cream, almost all of the flavors were empty, so we really only had a choice of 3 flavors. Hand lotion would be a great plus in the ladies room!

The hotel is beautifully decorated and clean, check in was very easy and parking was convenient to hotel. We had a double-queen room on the 8th floor with a beautiful ocean view. Our room was spacious and very clean. The only negative we had was that while the hotel was virtually empty, we were sandwiched between two very, very loud rooms. To our right were the 'door slammers' and to our left were the 'clueless family.' The door slammers were just annoying for a little while, but clueless was annoying for hours. The first night we arrived, they came home after we did and proceeded to yell and scream at their already screaming bratty child. A screaming child is bad enough, but two out-of-control parents were too much. After about an hour though, they all calmed down and it was peaceful. The next morning, at 6:30 AM, the screaming began again, this time 10x worse than the night before. After about an hour and a half of this, I called the front desk to complain. I asked if the screamers were checking out (we had one more night here) and if not we wished to be moved. A very friendly front desk clerk assured me that they were leaving and said she would call them. Unfortunately, I heard the phone ring next door after the screamers had left, but at least they tried. The only other downside was that there was boardwalk construction going on and that was a bit loud and disruptive.

It was our first time in OC in about 10 years and this was the only place allowing me to make a one night reservation during this event. Other hotels wanted 2-3 nights. Check-in was supposed to be 4:00, but we arrived about 1:00, and was told our room was ready. By the way, the young ladies at the front desk were courteous and friendly. Our son and his girlfriend were with us--they had reservations elsewhere, which they much regretted later on,--so they went with us up to our room. We had a Signature direct oceanfront room on the 11th floor, and upon entering, we were all impressed with the large area, beautifully made beds, and WONDERFUL view from our balcony! The metal dividers on the balcony between the rooms also had a section of lattice on the lower half that made it feel a little more private, although you could still see through it. Everything was clean--although I do think the bathtub was not freshly cleaned because the tub and faucet looked dull instead of shiny like a just-cleaned tub should look. Apart from that, everything else in the room and bathroom were fine; there were no odd smells like I've read about in some reviews. Two bottles of water were on the table, but no robes like I read were supposed to be included, although that didn't matter to us. There were a couple of coffee cups available for the coffee pot, as well as some styrofoam cups in the cubboard, but no other dishes of any sort . Small bottles of toiletries, including mouthwash, were in the bathroom, too. I've also read complaints about the \"loudness\" of the AC; yes, you can hear it cycle on and off, but it was nothing to keep you awake at night, that's for sure. I don't understand why some people are just so picky about small things like that! Our only regret was that the weather was very cloudy and even foggy at times, so our view from our balcony was not as clear out over the ocean as it would have been otherwise. To sum it all up, the whole hotel was very clean and attractive, as well as our room. It was very quiet, so we had a peaceful night's sleep. We are hoping to return for another weekend next month, and we will request another Signature room for sure. Our son and his girlfriend did not fare nearly as well where they stayed outside of OC. They want to stay at this hotel on their next visit, too. We really enjoyed our stay at the Grand, and will definitely return. We will tell our friends about it, as well.

Even a pocket door, or the door opening the opposite way would help. There was a fan vent, but it didn't seem hooked up. 2) Internet access STUNK!

For those who have had complaints, I think that you should consider the value of a place that puts you in the heart of everything and offers a great nights rest in rooms that are comfortable and clean. We walked around and looked at other hotels to see up close what we had seen online....we were glad we chose the Grand Hotel. No loud parties and very family friendly if traveling with kids.

The man at the check in was very friendly and helpful. Our room was exactly what we had requested, direct ocean view. The room was very clean and housekeeping was very helpful and kind. We had a small kitchen area in our room (microwave, sink, refrigerator, counter area, cabinets, coffee maker) which was fantastic with two children. We had a nice sized balcony with a fantastic view. Our only complaint is that the balcony\u2019s are not private and you are only provided two plastic chairs. Four chairs would have been nice and maybe a table for morning coffee. Privacy was an issue, as we had a \"neighbor\" who enjoyed smoking on their balcony despite the fact that we were on a \"no smoking\" floor. Plus, it is vacation...privacy is nice. Perhaps privacy screens could be added at some point. I am a bit surprised with some of the complaints that others have posted. It was \"Senior Week\" this past week, which we found out a few days before our arrival. Despite this, the hotel was very quiet and the beaches and boardwalk were not crowded or noisy. My children loved the hotel's outdoor pool, especially for night swimming. It would be nice if the pool overlooked the ocean, verses the parking lot. It is a nice and clean pool. There is also a pool bar open during the day hours, but not at night. The hotel has a pizza shop hat is beach front, a few surf shops, ice cream shop and a 24 hour cafe. They were a little pricey and only accepted cash, however, the convenience was well worth it. The icecream shop was not impressive, it was warm inside and the employees were not as friendly as all the other shops associated iwth the hotel.

As such, it is party central. Since our last stay, the luxurious dark green carpeting in the rooms has been replaced with ceramic tile.

Large portions of the wall paper were peeling off of the walls. We stayed on the second floor for the first time and you could not see the boardwalk at all due to the first floor roof jutting outward and the view of the beach and ocean was through the fence surrounding the roof.

We were very pleased to find how beautiful the hotel was and that they had everything we needed, from a gourmet coffee shop in the lobby for mourning latte\u2019s, to a great lounge with live music at night. In between there was the indoor pool and sauna with a second floor view of the Bay, and a pizza shop for lunch with a view of the ocean. What more could you ask for? Even the room had everything we needed, complete with a kitchenette, refrigerator and microwave. The room was very clean and service was great. We really wanted to have massages at their spa, because the price was very reasonable and they offered \u00bd hour sections for two but alas our beautiful room, with personal Jacuzzi was so tantalizing we sent a lot of our time there.

But it was lovely. The hotel lobby was very clean and nicely appointed, and the 24-hour coffee shop was so convenient. We didn't use the indoor pool on the 2nd floor, or the outdoor pool, for that matter (although it was open), but they looked fine, and also the video games, etc, in the atrium by the pool were \"cool\" according to the girls. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The decor could use a little updating, in my opinion, but I don't go to the beach for an updated room. We go for the beach and the room views, which were both excellent. The mini-kitchen was convenient, with cupboards, microwave and coffeemaker, but there were no utensils or plates, pans, etc., so be aware you need to bring your own. I'm not about cooking on a weekend jaunt, so no worries there. Customer service was absolutely stellar. The first evening I realized rollaways were available, so after calling for one, it was delivered with five minutes, no exaggeration, by a very sweet girl. The next night we called for an extra blanket, and two were delivered in less than five minutes again. I realize it is off season and they're not quite as busy, but under any circumstances, that's great service. My husband was having a muscle problem in his neck, and I had read great reviews about the spa/salon in the hotel. Didn't take much arm-twisting to get him to go down for a massage, and they did not disappoint. He's not a massage kind of guy, but that neck massage saved our little weekend. We saw the masseuse later in the lobby and he thanked her again, and she was just as nice as could be and genuinely appreciated his thank you. (and mine, believe me) We did eat in the restaurant on the 5th floor, and the food was really good. TVs had good channel selection, housekeeping even made up our 9 year old's bed with her little bear all tucked in cute. Noise was okay, but it WAS Bike Week. I'm an ear-plug kind of gal on vacation anyway, so slept like a baby. The beds were okay as far as comfort. I like really soft beds, but my husband was fine with it.

This past time was the first we ever stayed at the Grand Stowaway Hotel. All in all we had a positive and pleasant experience. The lobby is spacious and offers direct access to the Boardwalk. At 21st Street the hotel is not completely central, but it is still an excellent location and everything on the Boardwalk is within fairly easy walking distance. The 24 hour cafe is a very nice touch. The breakfast sandwiches and bagels were only so so, but the muffins, brownies, and pound cake were all very good. One minor gripe is that the Grand Terrace restaurant was only open from 7 am til noon. It seems to me that an in-hotel restaurant should be open for all 3 meals and offer room service, but perhaps that is just I. We had a room with an excellent view of the ocean, two queen beds, mini fridge, and microwave. The cleaning service was superlative -- not just for our room, but the entire hotel. It was very clear that they expend a great deal of time and effort keeping the place free of sand (as much as can be for a beach hotel during peak tourism, anyway). I was impressed by how cool and clean the halls, lobby, and elevators were. The outdoor pool was very nice, but the indoor pool seemed to be over-chlorinated and was too warm. The fitness center and gameroom were nice plusses; although I think they should have had more than 2 treadmills, especially since one was quite rough over about 5 mph. In general the room was comfortable and spacious with a nice balcony, but the mattresses were a bit firm for my wife and daughters. I was also disappointed that high speed internet access was only in the lobby. For me this was inconvenient. I definitely prefer to have in-room high speed internet access. Also the A/C was fairly loud. There was no high/medium/low control for the fan... just a thermostat. Whenever the A/C kicked on it would seemingly jar the entire room. We ended up just shutting it off at night. Even so, our stay there was pleasurable and I would recommend the Grand Hotel to others... just with the above caveats.

The beds, pillows and linens in the were very comfortable and the 4 of us sleep very well (for the most-part) in the 2 queen beds. The furnishing are a bit worn and our carpeting too was a bit bumpy. Now, I cannot say that our stay was perfect, because on our first night a group of teens a few doors down were partying and making a ton of noise, then the second night the single guy in room 1115 comes in at 4:30am with a couple of LOUD women and kept us up for hours. We did turn him into the front desk that morning. The nice woman manager said the hotel has a 3 strike policy. After that, all was well until the weekend when some idiot at 1:30am decided to set off the fire alarm. Nothing like getting your 9 and 5 year olds down 11 flights of steps. Worse than that was the 80+ year old woman in front of us being basically carried down by her family. There were 2 days that our room was never made-up. we were out of our room by 9am and returned at 3 or 4 and can back to unmade beds. Those days, my wife made the beds and went to the maid's cart to get towels, soap and shampoo. Also, if you have an over-height vehicle (like we do), you cannot park in the garage. Even though there are signs telling people to park their cars in the garage, they still insist on parking in the lot out front of the hotel. After a few days, I finally told the front desk and they let me park in the 15 minute loading/unloading spaces. Finally, while these things sound terrible our stay was one of the better ones, compared to some of the other places that I've stayed at in OC. Being on the Boards is a plus and having a huge beach, an indoor and outdoor pool, mini-golf, fine dining, amusements and other entertainment within walking distant is a big plus with a family of 4.

When my husband sat in one of the green plastic chairs on the balcony, it broke. They are getting weather worn and brittle and in need of replacing. We love the Grand Hotel.

We were woken up at other times the same week by the fire alarm, twice in one nite. this not being the hotels fault. once was someone smoking ciggarettes in the room.

The rooms have always been nice and clean; the beds always extremely comfortable, and the view impeccable for the price, this time wasn't any different. We arrived early on Sunday, and showed up at our hotel at two-thirty. Our room was not ready, which is fine, since check in time is not until four anyway. A lot of people have commented that they've showed up before four, and were not able to get in, this frustrated and \"apalled\" them, however, four is check in time, and I'm sure it's somewhat late since check out time isn't until 11, and I'm sure if it was any earlier, people would complain about that as well. Moving on, we went back to check out 3:00 and were able to get in. The staff was friendly, as usual, and checked us in quickly and orderly. We were able to park in a free parking lot, and there was never a lack of parking, so it was easy to get to and from the lot. Both elevators and stairs were easily accessible. The elevator was never too slow, and big enough to fit our beach cart, and luggage later on. We were on the third floor, so we just walked down the steps usually, which were as clean as a stairwell could be. The pool was nice, but unfortunately was always crowded, due to a full house the entire stay, however it was often evened out by the indoor pool. There was a huge game room, which is garenteed to keep kids happy, there is also a work out room, and stores at the bottom of the hotel, which were good if we needed supplies, or wanted to shop for beach equipment, or souvenir. The location was excellent, and directly on the Boardwalk. The one problem we had was the alarm. Around eleven, after I had already gone to bed, a fire alarm went off. My sister, who was about to fall asleep, jumped up and screamed, my mom, quickly changed and woke me up. I have to admit I didn't even hear the alarm, so have it not been for my mom and sister, I would probably not of gotten up. We were directed to go outside, our room was right across from the stairwell, which was easy, and stand outside the hotel.

Although it rained a good portion of the time, we had plenty to do in the hotel (pool, games, pizzaria, lounge).

The rooms were clean. Beds were fine. TV was old. Balcony was far from private (just \"prison bars\" to break up the balconies, you could see your neighbor and kids could squeeze through) and although it's a non-smoking hotel, the guests on the left of us smoked constantly all day long, so we smelled it indoors and out. Ug. The bathrooms were clean, but one day the maids definitely didn't clean the toilet. Sliding glass door locks didn't work on 3 out of 4 of our doors, but they had installed lock bars to use, I guess because they didn't want to replace the doors? The microwave/fridge/sink area is nice. Worst problem? The pools. The indoor pool was frigid, sort of grimy and mildewy. I watched one girl slip on the wet tile. It's like they didn't consider that large tile would get slippery when wet. The supplied towels were hard to come by. The wi-fi was non-existent on the 9th floor, something that made it very difficult for my husband who was trying to do an online class. He had to get up at 5 a.m. to go to the lobby to use the wi-fi in quiet. If your mini-van has a storage case on top, you won't fit in the garage. You have to hope there are spaces out front. If not, you have to find other parking on the street. But, the staff did allow us to use the 15 minute spaces when the garage was full one time. The outdoor pool was absolutely freezing! The ocean was warmer than this pool. The worst part? The pool deck is dangerous. If it's wet, it's a hazard. Case in point, my daughter slipped forward, pushed her two front teeth through her lower lip and split her chin open. When I realized what happened (there are no guards), I picked her up and put a towel to her face while I tried to check the damage. Another guest ran to get ice for her. Clearly the bartender knew what he was getting ice for, but never called security or risk management or anyone to assist. We finally realized she needed stitches. We asked the front desk on the way out where the nearest clinic was, and that was the only reason they knew she was injured. When we returned with 7 stitches later, security took a report. They said they would try to find the tapes, and that was that. It's a week later, and no one has called us to see how she's doing, nothing. I'm surprised at the lack of hospitality. After going to Ocean City for many, many years, we thought we had found our new hotel home. However, after this incident, we aren't sure we can trust that the amenities are safe.

We LOVED the whirlpool, and for the small price difference, that is something we plan to always get in the future too. The view is spectacular since all rooms with the whirlpools are on the 12th floor. Sitting out on the balcony was just awesome! Even though I would prefer it more private so that the balconies to the left & right of us were not in view, that didn't bother me too much. The big thing I really liked is how clean the room was, especially the bathroom. That is a BIG deal to me and usually rooms at the beach, or on the boardwalk seem to have almost a slight type of mildew in the room's air, but ours didn't at THE GRAND HOTEL which I again just loved!! And what a nice bathroom too. Plenty of shelf space to put all your personal products during your stay. King size bed AND very comfy!

We wanted a hotel which was on the boardwalk, and close to shoppes and restaurants. Upon arriving at the hotel, we realized that there were multiple \"biker clubs\" staying at the hotel, as evident of the 50+ sport bikes parked directly outside of the lobby. It was obvious this almost immediately spelled disaster, as the bikers were loud from the get-go, and one could tell they were ready to let loose. When we checked into the hotel, the front desk personnel was polite and allowed us to check into our room a few hours early, which we found convenient. However, the room we stayed in was something to be desired, as there was no carpet in the room at all, instead ceramic tile floors. The balcony doors lock was broken, so we were forced to use the safety beam against the door frames for security. The outside balcony was dirty and unclean. There were plastic bags, cigarette butts, old cigars, and miscellaneous trash scattered around the outside of our room. Needless to say, we wasn't going to take advantage of sitting on the balcony. ( 2nd floor ) Getting past the dirty balcony and the odd tiled room floor, we did enjoy the options the hotel had to offer, such as the downstairs cafe, and the shoppes directly underneath the hotel. In addition, we had hot water throughout the stay, which is always a positive. The over-all cleanliness of the room *inside* was good, as was the bathroom. However, out stay was cut 1 day/1 night short due to the rowdiness of other hotel guests. As mentioned earlier, there were apparently many \"biker clubs \" ( I mention biker clubs loosely, most likely closer to gangs ) staying in this hotel, which had 0 respect for other people or families staying in the hotel, or visiting Ocean City Maryland. During the day, some of the younger biker members were hanging off the balcony throwing objects, and yelling loudly at other \"bikers\" at a hotel across the street. They were also practicing burnouts on their bikes, blasting profane music, and simply being an annoyance to vacationers. If one were to want a good idea of what this was like, look no further than a typical frat party at a large university. (minus the kegs of beer and nudity-at least I did not witness ) There were also many annoyances of car alarms constantly going off, and horns being blown, which almost seemed to be done on purpose, just to disturb the peace of people around the area. I therefore consider it the hotels responsibility to keep this type of behavior to a minimum, either by hotel security, or by getting the Ocean City Police involved. Neither happened. The best part of our stay happened during the nights, typically from the hours of 10pm-4am. The first nights stay consisted of random noise outside; bike motors revving, music blaring, and car alarms going off. The second night however, was much worse. There was consistent noise from 12:30am, till 4am. Not only was there motorcycles doing burnouts, revving their motors outside of our room on the public street, but there were also multiple vehicles parked in the hotel parking lot blasting bass music, setting off alarms, and blowing their horns, up until 4am. We called the front office twice, asking them to take care of the situation. Each time, they apologized, stating they have called the police. After waiting for an hour and a half for the situation to die down, we decided to call the police ourselves. Longer story short; nothing was ever done to minimize the noise, or childish behavior by these bikers. This left us with the following options: 1) stay put for another evening, and put up with the \"hands off\" approach by the hotel and police or 2) leave a day early and get a decent nights sleep at home. We took option 2. We were hoping to obtain a refund or rain check for the one night early departure by the hotel, after telling them our experience, and how we called the front desk twice, however, their policy did not cover this. Apparently, there were at least four other couples who were complaining around the same time we were there, who were also requesting their money back for an early departure, however the hotel would have none of it. With all of the above stated, I would come to the following conclusions: 1) the hotel management was not as concerned about other customers, compared to the needs of the bikers. The bikers took up at least 50 rooms in the hotel, and I believe the hotel wants \"return customers,\" even if it is thugs such as these. After all, what are five or six rented rooms compared to 50 bikers? 2) the hotel and/or OC police don't have the courage to uphold the law when it comes to disturbing the peace, and noise ordinances. 3) the hotel obviously went against their own policies for not enforcing policies for noise, however, they would not take consideration for the displeasure of our stay, and several complaints to the front desk. Again, the hotel management catered to the \"outlaw\" thuggish behavior of the bikers, rather than family oriented travelers. All in all, the only way I would recommend this hotel, is if there aren't any special events happening in the hotel, and if you as a guest are willing to take a chance of not needing anything but a hotel room to stay in, with no expectations of hotel security or catering to you as a guest. I would also recommend not staying in some of the 2nd floor rooms, unless the hotel decides to clean up the balconies, and does something about the room flooring.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cnot a great stay.\u201d", "Author": "kris123Maryland", "ReviewID": "UR28112387", "Content": "we went to oc for the easter holiday.

If you want people to stay there on easter weekend i think you should know things like that for your guests that are staying there. so i will be staying at another hotel next year. the have bad service. and the rooms are not that clean. unless you complain ,.oh and if you want the internet they say they have it but you can not get a signal in your room. so you will have to go down to the lobby. just to get one.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY State", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "CheerFan", "ReviewID": "UR26340446", "Content": "Came in for the Cheerleading Competition.

As the years have gone by, the Grand has started to go downhill. WAY DOWNHILL!! This year we made our reservations SIX MONTHS in advance. We requested a certain room. After being a hotel guest for five years I didn't think that was unreasonable. We also sent a letter a month prior to vacation-again requesting the room. We also called a week prior-again making sure our request was noted and also to find out what our FINAL balance was.So to make a very long story short-we did not get the requested room, we had to stay in one room one night and then move. We paid our balance(which was the SAME AMOUNT we were told it would be when we spoke to them a week earlier). But the next day were told they \"didn't think they charged us enough\". Yet after the girl at the desk had three tries with a calculator and still couldn't come up with the same amount twice, she said \"we'll get back to you\". So we went on to enjoy our vacation, and at no time did anyone from the hotel ATTEMPT to contact us regarding any rate dispute. But when we got our credit card bill the next month-they had placed an additional $178 on our card. Management at the Grand had more than suffecient time to let us know of any \"undercharge\" Like the six months from the time we booked our vacation up to our arrival. Or the WEEK we were there. Yet they chose not to say a word-just put the charge on our card. I feel this is inexcusable and unprofessional! Perhaps they need to get new management, or desk clerks that actually speak and understand english! Also the day we were checking in there were two women there who could not get into their rooms. Turns out THEY WERE BOTH BOOKED INTO THE SAME ROOM!! To top it off THERE WAS SOMEONE ALREADY IN THE ROOM!! I hope the Grand enjoyed that extra $178 cause it's the last money they'll ever get from us!

I am sorry to say that, on this trip, I have explored alternative accommodations, as the service on this particular vacation were at an all-time low. First, we arrived at OC,MD around 2:00pm and was told that our room was not ready. So, I suited up my young kids and we all trekked to the beach while my Mother stayed back waiting the official word that our room was ready. She asked the reception desk for status updates on our room and was repeatedly told, \"Maam, It's not ready yet.\" Suddenly, a gentleman from NY walked in asking if the hotel had any vacancy. The receptionist confirmed that there was vacancy and the gentleman was told that the room was ready for immediate check-in. Unbelievable!!! So, does the Grand Hotel inconvenience their reservation guests, knowing that we are a \"sure-thing.\" I think it should be the other way around! Immediate check-in granted for those with reservations---for those without reservations, if you get lucky enough to find a hotel with vacancy then you should expect to wait. Good grief!! This was enough to deter me from ever returning here in the future. My second disappointment was the housekeeping service. No housekeeper touched our room until after 4:00pm, so we simply helped ourselves to clean towels from the housekeeping cart on a daily basis. We never had our carpets vaccumed or our beds changed the whole time, yet we saw 3-4 non-English speaking housekeepers conversing in the hallways routinely. Lastly, while trying to get ready for dinner and sweating profusely in our room, we discovered that the A/C was not working. We called the front desk and was told that the entire building's A/C system was not working. We were so uncomfortable since we were unable to come back to our room to cool off after a day in the sun, that we left 2 days earlier than anticipated. The girl at check-out was wonderful and granted us full refund on the 2 days that we intended to stay & even gave us a full refund on the previous day for having to sleep in an sweaty room.

Upon check-in, the level of customer service was poor. Only 1 of 3 agents understood English and their computer system. This made for an extremely long line at 3:00. Our room was very average. It was a decent size, however the bathroom was extremely small. The door had no hooks on the back so there was no place to put your clothes. The mini-kitchen in the room was very handy; although this is standard in most beach hotel rooms. The balcony came with two chairs BUT no table. Very inconvenient. Our room was cleaned very late in the day every day but once, I had to call for housecleaning because at 5:30 they still have not come. Pros of the facility: Common areas very clean Location on boardwalk; ample parking Cons of the facility: Poor customer service No tables in pool area or on balconies Disgusting indoor pool On our third night there, the fire alarm went off at 2am and again at 7am. Is this the fault of their system, or of a stupid individual. Who knows? BUT it sure was annoying. Would we return again to OC? Definately not. The boardwalk games and rides were extremely expensive. You definately get \"more for your buck\" at VA Beach or Myrtle. If we were to return, my #1 choice for accommodations would be The Breaker's Hotel.

We got a great rate from discounted website. Initially were disappointed that we were unable to get an non-smoking room but we understood that upon booking thru the discounted service that room type was not guaranteed. (NOTE to Management : Please consider converting additional rooms to non-smoking. While we were checking in, we saw & heard 3 other parties also request non-smoking but were total the Grand had \"run out.\") Despite having a smoking room, there was only a trace of lingering smoke smell. Plus the manager quickly sent up 8 new pillows to replace the bed pillows which also freshened up the room. Didn't even notice the hallway being smokey -- maybe the floor was full of other non-smokers like us who were also stuck in smoking rooms. The room was generous in size, with 2 queen beds. The beds were very comfortable, complete with double sheeting. I think I read that the mattresses were replaced this summer, it seemed so to me. Minor flaw was no fan in bathroom, it got rather hot/stuffy in there after 4 showers. There were plentiful thick cotton towels which also seemed new. The room and common areas were very clean, I'm always impressed when a beach hotel does this good of job keeping the sand out. The mini-kitchen area was handy, plenty of counter space and separate sink area. While we were mostly on the beach, we went to the outdoor pool a couple of times. The pool was very clean, with lots of available seating and pool towels. It was not very crowded while we were there. The kids enjoyed game room but said that 2 or 3 games were not working. We only ate at the coffee shop and pizza shop on the 1st floor. Both are very convenient. I thought the coffee shop was reasonably priced and the coffee/pastries were fresh and tasty. The pizza place was a bit overpriced and the food typical -- I guess you are paying for the boardwalk location. Staff were pleasant and helpful when asked any questions. When we needed extra shampoo and coffee, it was quickly brought up to our room and we were given extra. Minor complaint about non-working room key cards, we had to have them replaced at least 4 times in 4 days. Again, the staff was helpful and very quick to replace the keys but maybe they should change or upgrade their system? Overall, our stay was excellent. We had stayed here about 4 or 5 years ago and I was a little concerned beforehand based on some of the more recent reviews on this site. But overall we were very pleased -- I would still put the Grand in the top 10 of Ocean City hotels based on location, cleanliness & comfort, service and amenities. We have stayed practically everywhere nice in OC (except at the Hilton) and would gladly return to the Grand especially with the competitive pricing they offered.

We booked last minute thru Expedia.com and save over $60/nite over booking with the hotel directly. My husband and his work crew lived at The Grand for 3 months in 2005 and we visited often. Took a few mini trips after that so we knew what to expect. For those who complain \"oceanfront is not oceanfront\", oh yes it is. If you look at my two pics and the photos of the hotel on it's own website and those of other travelers, you'll see that all rooms are oceanfront but some are more oceanfront than others. Since we arrived late we were given probably the worst view in the place, near the end on the side on the 5th floor and the view was still wonderful. \"Grand View\" rooms are cheaper and \"Premier View\" rooms are full front facing and higher floors. If you have a balcony, you have a nice view of the beach. Good points: The view. This hotel sits directly on the boardwalk at 21st Street. Not too busy and noisy. Rooms start on the 2nd floor so no street noise really. Unless you have a king suite, the beds are queen-size, perfect for those with kids who don't like to sleep together. Rooms are roomy with 2 queen beds, a kitchenette, table for 2, a desk and a large balcony. Baths are small and the vanity is inside the bath. Hotel has indoor pool and outdoor pool with a bar. Restaurants and shops downstairs and another lounge. BEST PART: a parking garage. No hunting for parking spots so you don't have to worry about leaving the place in your vehicle. Bad Points: The outdoor pools is advertised with signs several areas on The Grand property as being \"open to the public\". Yep, you pay all that money and have to hob-knob with locals off the beach. Outdoor pool doesn't have enough chaise lounges and you have to walk thru the bar area to get to the pool. I had to take my two kids thru a sea of \"guys\" who were drinking and smoking. I can't take my kids into the lounge downstairs but must take my kids thru a bar to get to the pool. The indoor pool, which has always been very nice in the past, was a dump. We visited only one evening. Chairs were all over the place, dirty towels all over the chairs, trash on the floor and big puddles of water on the floor. Water was very cloudy and \"icky\" looking I didn't get in and washed my kids' suits after we got back to the room. The security camera probably filmed me straightening the chairs. I moved the chairs back into place while my husband asked someone to get clean towels (there were none). Towels came quickly but nobody made an attempt to clean the area. Gross. Yes it was a holiday weekend, but The Grand should have made arrangements for proper staff to maintain it's image. The room: We were in a nice room, but the wooden furnishings were a bit banged up. A can of Min-Wax stain would turn the knicks in the cabinets, chairs and dresses looking like new. Beds were very comfy. The carpet was \"wavy\", probably just needed restretched. The patio doors were huge but one was either dirty or it's seal was broken because it had a big cloud on it. You pay for the view, right? Housekeeping: Minimal. Someone could have cleaned the patio doors. We were there 3 nights and the girl never once cleaned the sink bowls in our bathroom or the kitchenette. Yeah, it was our toothpaste but isn't that her job? Also, bottled water is supposed to be left every day - it never was. My husband left a tip one day, just as a test, to see if the service would get better. Nope. Finally, at 4:30 A.M. on our check out date, we received a phone call from The Grand. It was a recording of the services and ammenities offered by The Grand. The same recording you might expect if you were placed on hold when calling the hotel. At 4:30 in the morning? Did I complain about these things while I was actually at The Grand? No, I did not. Why? Because in this world today, you never know who will retaliate. Like many hotels these days, The Grand has taken to hiring from overseas. Sometimes when you complain that someone doesn't do their job, they retaliate. Sounds crazy, but it's true. Today I sent my customer survey to The Grand, along with a letter explaining my position on thier hotel. I would stay there again, but during off-season. Never again at full/fool price. By the way .... July is a great time to visit Ocean City. Never EVER visit OC in June. The high school seniors take over and those immature drunk people will ruin your vacation. I highly recommend PGN Crab House on 30th Street across from Jolly Rogers. It's a hole in the wall if there ever was one but their all-you-can-eat crabs are DEE-licious!

No mistake -- and no hesitation to book the room either!! I am so glad we did. Even at the regular rates, this place is worth the money. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and I was told it's only about 8 years old. A large, open, luxurious lobby greets you. Check/in went very smoothly. Our large, nicely appointed room was located on the 5th floor and had a beautiful ocean view from the balcony, two queen beds, and a kitchenette. The bathroom was a bit cramped but clean. Two pools, a salon, a workout room, 24 hour coffee shop, several little stores and an ice cream place were all right there at the hotel or right outside the doors. A few short steps from the elevator and your feet hit the boardwalk and beach, which was one of the cleanest we've seen. There was limited parking right outside the hotel and a huge parking garage just steps away from the front door. The only negatives that I can mention are few and wouldn't deter us from booking there again. We had asked for fresh towels and never got them, so I had to go to the front desk for those. Also, after the second day of our stay, we had put the maid service sign on the door but no one ever came for that either. Not sure what the deal with that was. Also, the restaurant in the hotel seemed to never be open. Overlooking this beautiful hotel would be a mistake if you are searching for comfort, cleanliness and the desire to be close to everything.

We have been going there for five years in a row and will continue to in the future! Our favorite part of the hotel is the pool bar along with the convenience of walking to some of the night life's hot spots! I would HIGHLY recommend going to Fishtales and Seacrets if you visit Ocean City, Maryland. Fishtales is within walking distance of the hotel and to get to Seacrets you can either take the \"drunk bus\" or drive the short distance. The Grand Hotel offers a very family friendly atmosphere and is on the boardwalk. Each year, we end up getting rooms with ocean view balconies although we\u2019ve never asked for one \u2013 very nice surprise! Parking is free and is in a parking garage next to the hotel. There are tons of restaurants to eat at along the main strip and Philip\u2019s Buffet is right next to the hotel. Seacrets is arguably the best bar/night club on the East Coast! Drink and float on a water tube during the day and dance your shoes off at night! I would recommend this hotel for bachelor and/or bachelorette parties, too. I would also recommend this hotel for families since there seem to be a lot of them during the summer months. There is definitely something for everyone between the beach, the boardwalk, golf, mini-golf, bars, pool, and so much more! I also would like to mention that each room has a microwave and refrigerator that is very convenient. I have to confess that the Hilton in Ocean City is probably the BEST HOTEL THERE!.... if you can afford it!!!

Unfortunately, we were located on the second floor near the pools and there was an extended roof by our balcony where guests continually threw food that the seagulls would fight over.
