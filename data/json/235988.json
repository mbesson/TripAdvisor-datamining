The hotel was very conveniently located only a short distance from the major train station. The hotel staff was very pleasant and spoke great English. Our room was by far the largest we stayed in in all of Europe. The bathroom was also large - the only drawback that there isn't a shower per-se, as much as just a faucet on the wall and a drain in the floor with a shower curtain. We take everything in stride, so we just thought it was comical!The breakfast was nice, not huge, but just enough to get you by for a morning running around and hold you over 'til lunch. The only drawback to the hotel in general is that there was no lift and we were on the 4th floor - it took the two of us a good half hour to drag all of our luggage up those steps!! But once we were in our room, it was only a short walk to San Lorenzo and the Mercato Centrale and there were lots of little convenience stores and restaurants in the vicinty.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR694680999", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "alissac1983"}, {"Content": "Nuova Italia is a one star hotel We found this dreadful hotel in Frommer's Guide. Obviously no one from there has seen this place in years. There are lots of stairs, room was totally devoid of any charm or pleasant decor and there were flies in the window. But we really couldn't open the window anyway after discovering the noise from San Lorenzo market carts which were shuffled down the street at midnight and again at 5am. It would be difficult to really describe how bad the noise was. The entire staff smoked and the breakfast room reeked of smoke. As another poster said, the NI is ugly. We stayed at another hotel in Florence that was lower priced and was, in fact, quite charming. We won't count on Frommer again. We left very early the next am for a flight to London and the only courtesy we got from the staff was a call for a taxi. As someone mentioned, this place may satisfy backpackers but it is really a pit.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR133068028", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "chatelet"}, {"Content": "small and friendly and very very clean! we came to celebrate my 50th Birthday and enjoyed it .

The bottom line is that you really can't expect much. While most of the staff is friendly, it is barely worth the money. There is no elevator, so if you have a room on the third floor you had better not have heavy bags; they say is it not their job to help you. Also, the shower floor is the same as the bathroom floor so when you shower the entire bathroom gets wet - and often the bedroom.

The rather plain interior is wonderfully embellished with a huge collection of numbered prints (some of really stellar quality) and an eclectic group of museum posters, making the interior both charming and interesting. Beds are very comfortable and its is impeccably clean. Sure the rooms, especially the bathrooms, are small, but you didn't go to Florence to sit in your hotel room, did you? Actually, my daughter (aged 10) and I spent a good bit of time in the room during our recent one-week stay in between outings during some very very hot weather. The room was a quiet and cool oasis, due to more than adequate airconditionion and airport-hotel-quality windows that really blocked the sound of what could have been a somewhat noisy street. Staff is helpful, breakfast is very plain but with outstanding coffee and cappucinos. All the main Florence destinations are within a 5 minute walk.

After having spent considerable time in two stars hotels through out Europe, people, let me tell you, this is it. This isn't the land of Holiday Inns. What does two stars in Europe mean? Generally: your own bathroom and clean facilities. People being upset because there isn't a lip in the shower? Get out and travel! This ain't america. That isn't a plumbing standard. I bet the bidet really through you for a loop.I found this hotel to be excellent for a two star; EXCELLENT location and the friendliest staff (also, exceedingly helpful with sites/tourism). If you want a Ritz, you're simply going to have to pay for it. And look for four-five stars. Europeans don't just hand them out like we do--they have meanings.That said, for my future travel: I would only stay here when I have children. I fell in love with a three star (Beacci Tornabuoni) for adult travel. But with children, this location would be ideal. (I ascribe to the first class or with children school of travel).

Their description makes it sound like this is an underrated hotel. It's a 2 star hotel and deserves the rating.This place may seem like a refuge if you're backpacking across Europe since it is safe and clean. However, it is not a good hotel. While the common room downstairs is basic but fine, the main stairway is ugly.The room decor is atrocious - very dated 1970s. The orb hanging from the ceiling in our room looked liked like something out of A clockwork Orange.The bathroom was indescribable. The shower drained through a port in the floor. There is not a shower stall. The water pressure was non existent and the temperature drifted continuously. The bidet was broken with no hot water as was the toilet seat. The decor of this bathroom was bright red tile and must have looked good 30 years ago.Finally - the air conditioning scheme is strange. In order to get it to run you have to call the desk downstairs and they turn it on for you. Ours dripped condensate into our room, creating a puddle on the floor.As for Breakfast - this is two star basic as well.
