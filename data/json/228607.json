Sadly a last minute trip budget didn't stretch to the cover price of the Hilton this time so we decided we would like to stay in a similar area and settled on the Hesperia Del Mar. The hotel itsself was fine nothing much wrong with it apart from the small details that really make a difference. The hotel is looking quite old and tired in parts now, the reception areas are pleasant but the bedrooms are small and cramped with not much space for luggage and two people. We were travelling with another two people who reserved a twin room which was larger and more comfortable than our double. I would recommend this is as a decent 3 star rather than the 4 star rating it currently holds. The staff were pleasant although we were awoken each morning by the cleaning staff slamming doors and speaking at high volumes in the corridors.

The hotel is nice and well located near the sea. There are plenty of Restaurant on the main street in front (Passeig Garcia Farria) as well as just behind the hotel on street like passeig Taulat and surronding streets. The hotel is considered as a 4-star hotel but it is really a 3-star. The entrance is a bit strange as you have to go down to a lower level than the street to get in. There is though a small elevator to get there if you have heavy suitcases or for handicapped people. The room we had 111 was rather small but the bathroom was spacious, and had bath, shower and bidet (see pictures). The hotel is quiet and that room gave on a park behind the hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. We have asked about restaurant and were always well advised. For anyone interested, there is a Hotel and restauration School just on the street behind called Escola Hotelera de Barceloa (on passeig Taulat) and they serve fabulous meals from Monday to Friday. We went to their upscale restaurant and a 5-course meal for supper costed 21 euros. The nearest subway stations (there are 2 at equal distances) are Poble Nou and Selva de Mar, at around 10 minutes walk. The bus # 41 passes in front on Passeig Garcia Farria and will get you to Plaza Catalunya which is the center of Barcelona, where you can walk to Las Ramblas and the trip takes about 20 minutes.

The only negatives I have about this hotel is: - The location - The hotel is located in Poblenou within Barcelona, just up the beach. It was fine for us because we love long walks but it took us about an hour to get to La Rambla. If you don't like walking then there is a bus stop next to the hotel and the number 41 bus stops at Placa de Catalunya and is only 1 euro 40! Another way is walking up the road to Poblenou metro station which isn't far. During the summer, the Bus Touristic green route will run near the hotel too but it wasn't running in December so we walked to the end of the road to catch the red route (there are Bus Touristic maps in the hotel), I strongly recommend these busses! - The food prices - Breakfast wasn't included in our package, so we normally walked next door to a small bar/restaurant for coffee and a croissant for 2 euro 10 but one day I thought it would be nice to see what the breakfast buffet was like. It was nice, quiet, peaceful, and the food was lovely, a nice variety! I didn't see a price list anywhere so just assumed it would be on our room bill at the end of the say. It was, and one breakfast was 14 euro! Everything else I loved! The hotel was clean, our towels were done everyday, the maid even put my roses in a glass of water for me! Came everyday at about half 10 so gave us time to get ready. The staff were so friendly. Their English was very good and we stupidly forgot adaptors but the receptionist let us borrow one! Every time we walked in or out of the hotel the person on reception would always say hello which I thought was lovely. At the end of our stay, we had to check out at 12 but because our flight wasn't till the evening she gave us an extra hour free and after that put our luggage in the luggage room so we could come back later. The rooms are really nice, you can choose smoking or non-smoking, we had a nice balcony overlooking the beach and saw the sunrise most days! The bed was huge, king size, with amazing pillows! There was even a pillow leaflet if you wanted different pillows! The mini-bar was good value, all snacks, soft drinks and beer was 2 euro, spirits were 3 euro. There was a safe inside the wardrobe which was free to use and the bathroom was lovely and clean with hair wash, moisturiser, shower gel, a toothbrush kit, shaving kit, sponge and hair cap on the side that got refreshed everyday if you used it. We even used room service once and reception ordered the pizza we wanted for us because we weren't very good at Spanish! Overall we thought the hotel was brilliant and we really enjoyed our stay, we're dying to go to Barcelona again because it is absolutely stunning and there is so much to do and see! We would definately stay here again if we come back! Perhaps in the summer next time because then the walk along the beach to La Rambla would be beautiful and we could sunbathe across the road from the hotel!", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cwmbran", "Title": "\u201cClean and Comfortable, but take a kettle!\u201d", "Author": "jules0711", "ReviewID": "UR83307151", "Content": "The female receptionist there was amazing, nothing was too much trouble for her to sort out.

We were looking for a holiday which was a combination of a chill out beach holiday and a busy city break and we managed to crack it with Barcelona. We decided it was best to get a hotel next to the beach as most days we started there or featured a whole day there. The Hesperia fitted the bill perfectly. It was literally across the road from the clean and uncrowded Bogatell Beach which you can get to within five minutes. There is a good enough cafe there for food/drinks but if you walk further along the beachside walkways, there is a yacht port where there are plenty of excellent, abeit touristy, restaurants, but ideal if you stay here and are looking for a good meal close by. We spent many afternoons and most evenings in the city. We thought the easiest way to get there was by Metro for which the closest station, Poblenou, is about a 10 minute walk (five/six blocks away). We found this no problem and it also felt relatively safe being in a mainly residential area as we walked it regularly late at night. You could, as we did, get off the metro earlier and walk along the seafront back to the hotel which was a nicer way to walk off the tapas. The city centre was about 10 mins away on the Metro. We found the hotel itself to be clean, comfortable, safe and the staff were friendly. Our standard room was spacious and fine for our needs as we didn't spend a lot of time in it. You don't need to eat breakfast in the hotel - we found a lovely bakery at the end of the same block the hotel is on which sold delicious croissants and coffee for breakfast. The only (minor) complaint about the hotel would be that all the TV Channels were in German or Spanish - as a couple of news junkies it would have been nice to have Sky News or CNN on while we were getting ready but nevermind, who goes on holiday to watch TV anyway??!!

The hotel itself is quiet, air conditioned and comfortable. The rooms/toilets are spacious and very clean. The staff were polite and knowledgeable. The breakfast was also very good, with a wide selection.

Some people commented that the hotel was too far to town, but that is so lazy! It is literally a ten minute walk through a lovely park to the metro stop! The hotel-because it isnt central Barcelona-is in a quiet area, perfect after a day walking all around Barcelona. The facilities were great. Everything was clean and modern. The only thing I would say is that there was only 1 english channel on the tv. But if, like us, you only went back to the room to sleep after a busy day, it was fine. Definately recommended!

This is last row of buildings across the highway from the beach, but perpendicular to the beach. Only a few rooms have beach front views. Free wifi was advertised but there was no signal, the staff wouldn't change the room for that. Friends changed their room because the room smelled. I understand the other comment that it is isolated - the nearest Metro is about 15 minute walk, the longest I've had in a Barcelona hotel. We also stayed in a small hotel near Diagonal, no views but clean, friendly, and conveniently located. So, I can't recommend this hotel for the location - it's only near the beach and most rooms don't have views. It's not well located to a Metro stop, and the price is the similar to other hotels near the beach with views or more conveniently located.
