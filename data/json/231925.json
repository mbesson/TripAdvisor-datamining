I had read earlier reviews and upon arrival was a little concerned when we were assigned room 90. However, the room turned out to be fine. As others have commented the room was a little small but by way of compensation it had doors leading to a tiled garden area the same size as the room. Perfect for sitting and relaxing. The bed was very comfy and in contrast with some European hotels there were additional pillows available. The bathroom was clean and well equipped if a little cramped, omitting the bidet might have been advisable. Towels were changed everyday. The television only seemed capable of being tuned to one channel (RAI2) so offered little in terms of entertainment. There are no tea or coffee making facilities but as seasoned travelers we took our own. There was a mini bar in the room. Overall the room was adequate as you do not go to Rome to sit in the room all day. The location of the hotel is excellent and sights such as the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Colleseum and the Forum are all within easy walking distance. Take some comfortable shoes though as the streets are cobbled and often uneven. The Metro is also an easy walk and offers excellent value though it is crowded at peak times. There are bars and eateries within a ten minute stroll of the hotel so the lack of such a facility in the hotel is not a major drawback. We found it more enjoyable to get out and mingle though we were lucky to have excellent weather throughout our stay. The breakfast offers a good choice and items are regularly replenished. The room is cramped. We elected to eat on the terrace though in March this can be a little chilly first thing. The staff were helpful and friendly and all had sufficient English to assist us. I agree with other reviewers that the decor is in need of some update but I found the hotel charming and would not be loathe to return although the 4 star rating is probably a little high.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRated two stars above reality !!\u201d", "Author": "scorpio7935", "ReviewID": "UR126058751", "Content": "The hotel was average at best, in no way was it four star though it did serve it's purpose.

When we first arrived we were told we had a room on the lower level of the hotel with a large private patio garden. While true there was a large private patio, the room was the worst I have ever seen in Europe. The smell of mould hit you as soon as you stepped off the elevator and got alot worse when you entered the room. The room itself was small with only room for one bedside table as the bed was pushed up against the wall. The bath room was nasty and had black mould under the rim of the sink - yuck! They had stuck a battery operated spray air freshener to the wall to try to cover up some of the stick but the batteries had long since died. We aired out the room for 2 hours without sucess and then tried the air conditioner which only made things worse. For the first time in history we went up and requested another room. We were told they were booked and we could not move until the next day. The front desk staff was not surpised, I suspect they get complaints about this room all the time. When booking make sure you are given a room on the first floor or higher. Do not accept a room in the \"basement\". Our room number was 96, if your room number starts with a \"9\" find a new hotel. The next day we were moved to the second floor to a small but mould-free room without a balcony. Had I been given this room off of the start my review would be different...but I wasn't. There is a nice public patio on both the 4th and 5th floor and the breakfast was average. You are able to eat your breakfast on the patio or indoors which was nice. On our last morning there I was unable to get any water pressure in the shower, not even a dribble. Not sure why, didn't have time to ask as we were catching a flight. The location is good about a 10 minute walk to the colosseum and 20 minutes to the spanish steps and trevi fountain.

Nevertheless it was still value for money. Our arrival was somewhat comical (my fault for not booking the right room) and Fernando - while efficiently surly - was more than pleasant it dealing with our request for a room change (in a hotel that was 95% full!). We originally found Room 406 WAY too small and were moved down to the basement room 95 ... now, here's a little tip - if you're going in the summer and are a smoker, REQUEST this room. It has it's own little secret - a private courtyard (I believe Room 90 is the only other one with the same facility). If, however, you go in winter, avoid the basement like the plague - it is FREEZING and the Aircons only appear to be able to cool the rooms down. We eventually ended up in room 312, which more than adequately addressed our need for comfort, space and a livable temperature! Breakfast is basic continental - if you go towards the end of the 3 hour window you run the risk of facing a Gallic-style shrug when the more popular items have run out. The Coffee was, however, the worst we experienced in Rome! For a coffee-holic like me that was somewhat traumatic! I took to going to the local coffee house at the top of the road (3-4 minute walk) to get my fix! Location-wise the hotel is well placed: 5-10 minutes walk to the Termini (although we chose to walk everywhere for the 3 days we were in Rome), 15 minutes to the Colosseum, 20 to the Trevi Fountain, 35 to the Spanish Steps and a gentle 50 minutes stroll to St Peter's Square in the Vatican. This review is skewed marginally on the positive side, but I find myself unable to say that I would recommend it to a friend - I think my friends' tastes are somewaht more discerning than mine (except maybe in friends!). To be fair, if I returned to Rome, I don't think I would stay at the hotel again. Or be willing to pay as much as \u00a360 a night again ... I can HIGHLY recommend the three local Ristorantes we went to for our three dinners: Trattoria il Tettarello (Via dei Capocci), L'Esquilino (Via Cavour 87) and L'Archetto (Via Cavour 195) - all within 5-6 minutes walk.

Also, there is a good restaurant just a 2 minute walk away from the hotel that was recommended by the staff--Restaurant Tema. Very good!

Before we had a big investigation through web, Viminale was our final choice, just because we were tired of reading reviews, calculating costs...etc. By chance, Viminale was what we had expected from a hotel. The best of all is its location. It is just so near to many important places such as; Termini? May be 7 minutes.Colosseum? May be 15 minutes... Bus station? Just on the main street ahead. Safe and good location, no problem at night. Well lit street, a good Napolese restaurant at the corner of the street. Lets continue with the cleanliness, Although we had no problem about hygene I wish the hotel were much more well kept. Clean towels, room cleaning everyday... What should I ask for more? Rooms are a bit small but it is okay, feasible space. I liked the bathroom very much. Value is just okay, we made a profit on our budget because it was cheaper than we had expected to spend on Rome hotels from our budget. Breakfast: Cereals, youghurt, ham, cheese, milk, orange juice, jams, chocolate cream, tomatoes, eggs, fruits, cake, croissants, bread, butter, tea, coffee and hot chocolate... What else may I need? There is a coffee machine which serves hot water, hot milk, capuccino, hot chocolate all together. The reception is helpful. Wireless for a small charge. As I see from hotel comments, generally I come up with the critics about the elevator size and carrying the luggage. Yes the elevator is small and yes you carry your luggage, but if you are in Rome just to discover the city, these little details may not disturb you. We were all relaxed about it so we did not have to give tip to bellboy for carrying our luggage on the elevator to one floor up. The hotel is best for budget travellers who wants a clean and nice place to stay... Not a romantic getaway !!! It also has a small fitness centre. Shortly, the hotel is good, comfortable(2 extra pillows in the wardrobe with a blanket), clean... The breakfast is very fine...

You can walk to about anywhere of interest within 15 / 20 minutes and the metro is only around the corner which gets you into the Vatican City within 5 stops. We found in general that Rome prices were a bit of a rip off 10 euros in one place for 2 caffe latte. But we found the cheaper and better places after asking around. One great place to try for a great selection of wine and fantastic cheese board (they have a selection, Mild, Medium, Strong which the latter comes with a wonderful side dish of local honey to help with the digestion.

Upon arriving at the Termini station we asked taxi drivers how to get to the Viminale and found them to be unhelpful, suggesting that we should jump in the cab and for 25 euros they would take us there. Given that it was late in the evening we finally managed to haggle our way down to 15 euros. The journey took no longer than 5 minutes - a mere stones throw! A lesson for us, were in future we would phone the hotel ahead and arrange for a taxi - so not a fantastic start! Reception staff were very professional and efficient, to the point that they could be percieved as being quite cold. We were given a room on the 1st floor, and the room was of adequate size. The bathroom was tiny, with a shower door that didn't quite shut, it had seen better days, but overall it was clean and presentable. Again the main room was clean and presentable, with a TV, all italian channels bar one, which was BBC world news. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and both me and my partner would wake up each morning feeling that we needed a good stretch to iron out aches and pains from the restless nights sleep. We then realised that the bed itself was a camp bed! Breakfast was good, plenty of meats, bread, cereals and juice and staff would come over and ask if you would like tea or coffee. I did find the waiter to be very rude - and did not have personal experience of this until our last day. He seemed to be over familiar but not in a charming or friendly way but quite sarcastic. My italian is very good and noticed that he seemed to be more abrupt with guests who didn't speak the language. On our last day we had to come down to breakfast very early and were one of the first guests to enter the area - whilst helping ourselves to the breakfast I requested if we could have two teas. With that he began to sneer at me and sarcastically responded \"what do you think i'm doing?\" I could not believe that he would speak to a guest in this way and suggested to him that maybe he got out of bed on the wrong side. He then composed himself and tried to make a joke of it saying that he had not won the lottery and that's why he wasn't his best.

The guy on reception only works there one night a week and was fairly new so didn't really know a great deal. We asked if they could book, and pay, for a taxi for us, as at this time in the morning didn't fancy walking to try and find the Viminale. He reassured us it was only 5 minutes away and gave us a map (although he had difficulty himself trying to find the street on the map). We started to walk but gave up and got a taxi (who also got lost!!!). Upon arrival at the Viminale, the receptionist was rather uncourtious and snappy and didn't give us any information about the hotel other than breakfast was between 7.00 and 10.00. The room was a fairly decent size (although the bathroom wasn't big enough to swing a cat). The toilet seat in the bathroom was falling off, and the doors in the shower cubicle seemed to be falling to bits. The bed wasn't particularly comfortable either. I think the main water pipes ran somewhere through the walls of our room as each morning there was the sound of gushing water constantly for about an hour (presumably where people were getting up and having showers/flushing toilet chain etc), it sounded like there was torrential rain outside!!! There was also a generator type noise which went off every few seconds which became rather annoying. We didn't find the receptionists to be particularly helpful, although the waiter at breakfast seemed like a nice chap. As we hadn't seen any reviews, or an overview of this hotel as it wasn't the one we were supposed to be staying in, we didn't know anything about the terraces either, or any of the other facilities it had to offer.

We had booked through Expedia to stay at another hotel within the group (Hotel San Guisto in Piazza Bologna), after making our way to our booked hotel, we were told by reception that there was a problem with overbooking and that they were sending us to stay at Hotel Viminale, another hotel in their chain. They paid for our taxi there which turned out to be a fun ride. As a result we had not read any reviews and had no expectations of Hotel Viminale, which after now reading them was probably a blessing. We were happier with the more central location though. The place is definately in need of a face lift. They were doing a lot of work on the place while we were there, but it didn't keep us awake, etc. They had also just put in a new lift (the wrapping on this new lift was never even taken off while we were there). Our room had a rotten view and you couldn't throw a cat in it as it was so small. It had a black and white TV that only got BBC news in English, a tiny fridge that worked well, a so so comfy bed, and what looked to be a fairly decent European bathroom on the surface. The heating didn't seem to work as it should, so we were either freezing or too warm. Every time we showered it flooded the bedroom. It smelt damp and rotten every time we came back to the room, but we just opened the window every time to get rid of the smell. We did report the flooding a few times, a nice chap came along to look at the situation, he didn't speak English though and nothing was ever done. We were only there for 3 nights so didn't worry too much, it was their problem more than ours, we only got wet feet a couple of times. The staff at reception ranged from bright, cheery and helpful, to rude and nasty. On a brighter note, our rooms were cleaned well and restocked every day. The breakfast was average, nothing special, but filled you up. The male waiter was very funny, pretending to complain when you asked for Cappucino. He was entertaining though and one of the highlights. Looking at the hotel online now....I can say that the advertised gym was no where to be found. We are also disappointed that we didn't know prior to our stay about the roof terrace, it looks like there is a nice view from the shots posted online, but we never ventured there as we knew nothing about it until we got home and looked at this site. We also never saw a bar at this place as it seems to say exisits on the hotel's webpage. We ate at the restaurant on the corner one night and found it very nice, reasonably priced and yummy. Most of the patrants were residents of the Viminale. Quite a few locals ate here, but they were always sat at the back of the restaurant in the pizzaria and it made you feel a bit left out, but it was a pleasant enough place to eat and very tempting as only a stone's through from hotel which was good after a hard day of siteseeing and sore feet. The location of the hotel is fantastic, you can walk to all the main sites and the M, Termini, etc. is 5-10 mins away. Overall, we can't complain too much.

The waiter joked around with us sometimes.. The front desk weren't too friendly, but helpful if you ask them questions ( they all spoke English). Actually, Luigi was one of the nicer ones! Overall, the hotel was just OK. It's within walking distance to most of the beautiful spots in Rome. Take the metro if you can, it only costs 1 Euro per person/per ride, instead of taking the taxi which could cost up to 10 Euros. We don't recommend the restaurant just a few feet down the street from the hotel. Go to Via Cavour, there are a lot of restaurants to choose from, especially Roberto's, great wine and Osso Bucco!", "Date": "January 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWould stay there again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3007022", "Content": "I too booked my stay at the Viminale before the bad reviews started coming in, so I was a little nervous coming in from the airport as to what to expect.

There is a terrace upstairs which I would probably enjoy more in warmer weather but it was nice to have anyway.

The location of the hotel was great! We were able to walk to many sites such as the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, the Spanish steps, piazza novona, the Pantheon, and Trevi fountain. It's a short bus ride to the vatican, St. Angelo's castle and the basilica of St. Peter. Plus, it is a five minute walk from Termini station. There is a nice little restaurant on the corner and a street market and a bank just up the street. Our only problem was finding the hotel in the first place. (Although it is a short distance, we had no directions.) When you leave Termini station, go right until you find Via Cavour. Go left on Cavour and then right on Via Torino OR on Via Agost. de Pretis.

We booked before all the bad reviews came popping up. After reading them the last month or so, we were scared of staying there and considered paying more to stay at a different hotel. I'm so glad we didn't. Room - We had a room facing the front on the hotel. It was nicely decorated and had enough space for 2 people with a fair amt of luggage and we still had room to move around. The room was cleaned every day. New towels, soap, trash emptied, and it was vaccuumed. The soap dispenser in the shower was gross, but I always bring my own soap anyway so that was not a big deal for me. The fridge worked and kept our drinks cold. The water in the shower was really hot. The bed was mushy, but comfortable. Public Rooms - I thought they were nicely decorated, many plants, clean, drab, yes, but the buildings are so old there and we were only there to sleep so we didn't care. Staff - They were typical, not overly friendly, but when we needed something, they did what they could. All in all, I would definately stay there again and recommend it to anyone.

On the plus-side, the hotel is located conveniently to Termini Train Station -- about a 5-10 minute easy walk (even with luggage). That's good if you don't want to deal with taxis or the Metro. The Colesseum was only a 15-minute walk away. And, even though the hotel is located in the busy train station neighborhood, off of Cavour Street, it is actually on a small, quiet side street, making for a peaceful sleep. The breakfast was pretty good too, with a selection of cold cereals, fruits, juices, yogurts, cold meat & cheese, plain rolls and pastries. The highlight of breakfast was eating outdoors on the patio, surrounded by plants. On the down-side, the whole property needs a good steam-cleaning and painting. It's pretty drab in the public spaces and a little smelly in parts. Our room was smallish, but typical for that class of European hotel. The bed was large, but with a mushy foam mattress and a big piece of wood between the mattress and box spring. The walls of the room were stained, as were the carpets, and the wallpaper was peeling and completely ripped off in some areas. All of the furniture and woodwork (doors, etc) were scuffed, dirty and chipped. Mold was growing on the bathroom door and on the drop ceiling tiles in the foyer area of the room. The bathroom featured soap dispensers like you'd expect to see in a highway rest stop. The dispensers were broken and contained no soap. On our last day, no bar of soap was provided. The wand-style shower head made showering difficult, especially since there was no shower curtain. The bathroom walls and floor had a nice, shiny tile, but the other fixtures, especially faucets were old and corroded.

He goes on about how there are no rooms because of this flood so he is shifting us to another hotel. That was totally unacceptable to us since we were there bright and early. We also suggested that we can leave the luggage and come back when people would have checked out. He said, it is not possible. So I blew a fuse and said - FLOOD? You mean OVERBOOKED.
