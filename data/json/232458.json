For the price we paid (just over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 last minute booking), it was good value. In summary - if you're looking to have a cebtral location but don't plan to be spending a lot of time at the hotel, it's more than adequate. What you shouldn't expect is luxury and all your needs catered to, like a chain hotel would. With that in mind, this hotel is fine. However, I wouldn't stay here for longer than a 3 nights, it's not that comfortable for a long stay. Also consider the NH Doelen (part of the NH Hotel chain), which is just across the canal as sometimes they have similar rates according to the people we spoke with in Amsterdam. It looks like a much nicer hotel and I would certainly stay there if that's the case (it was fully booked when we asked). Pros and cons below: Pros Location: Excellent for the price. Walking distance everywhere. Room: Decent size (if you're not staying long!) Cons: 1. Bed was comfortable but pillows are too thin - could be thicker, but posed no problems for me. 2. Front desk reception wasn't curtious, but wasn't rude either - again not a problem for me. 3. Street noise - we had a room facing the canal and could hear street noise. This may be a problem for light sleepers. 4. No blackout blinds / curtains - so may be a problem if you want total darkness to sleep.

I read a lot of reviews before hand to make sure we chose a good location, and this was absolutely superb. On the map it seemed potentially a bit far from the main square, but it's literally a five minute walk. There's also a small square roughly a minute away which has lots of bars and places to eat which is fantastic. If you're going for the first time, the airport is roughly 20 minutes away by train from the city centre (very easy to use and the ticket staff are very friendly), and the train station it arrives into is probably 15 minutes walk through the city centre to Hotel Nes. It's a great location for anything in the centre. We went to the ice bar, Heineken museum, red light district, etc, all within walking distance - and the trams are frequent and cheap if you need to use those too. In terms of the hotel itself, it was relatively basic, but we only used it to sleep in. The rooms were medium sized but the beds were comfy and the curtains kept the light out, so we couldn't really ask for much more. Big plus side was we could open our window right out and it overlooked the canal which is right outside the hotel, so it was good to sit there and watch the boats go buy in the morning. All in all a great place to stay at.

However, a small room here really does mean small, it makes London hotel rooms look palatial. Despite the fabulous photos and promotion of canal views on the website and even the promotional materials in the hotel itself, there are NO single rooms with a canal view; rather, single travellers are sent to the tiny rooms where it's best just to keep the curtains closed or you'll be looking through someone else's hotel window. Although breakfast was basic it was typical of many European budget hotels and perfectly acceptable, but definitely not worth the 10 euros charged for it. The cafe at the corner is excellent, for food or a quiet drink. If you're realistic about what to expect then this is a clean and comfortable budget hotel.

However, I can see how others could have had a worse experience than I did. Indeed, the location is great. About a 10 minute walk from the Red Light District and Dam square, but far-enough away so as to be in a quiet neighborhood. I paid 130 Euros a night for a room with two single beds (for one person), with a bathroom. Booked online with easytobook.com. No problems with the staff. They were friendly, efficient, and helpful. The public areas downstairs are indeed clean, tasteful, and pleasant. Breakfast was decent: Facilities were clean, food was good, with a good choice of items (though yes...Orange juice costs extra, which is sort-of a theme at this hotel...More in a moment). My room (number 8) was plenty-big enough for one, and would be fine for two, as well. A small desk, two chairs, a closet, two operable windows, and a standing floor fan. Bathroom was pretty small, but that's to be expected in Amsterdam. Standard bath amenities included (towels, soap, shampoo, shower cap). Overall, the hotel is a bit of a hodgepodge, as if they're still in the process of refurbishing: There are some stylish lamps and furnishings in the rooms, though the bathroom light was a spooky fluorescent disc that took some time to come up to full power (like, minutes). Bedding and towels were clean, but the inside of the door to my room had been patched with spackle (on a metal door), and as-yet unpainted. Not very attractive, but certainly not a big deal. As for the aforementioned 'theme': There is a computer terminal in the lobby. I asked how to access the internet with it, and was told that I'd need to buy a card from them for 6 Euros per hour to use it. The guy also (thankfully) offered that there are cheaper ways to get online in town at various internet cafes and coffeeshops...Which is true. So, no ripoff there. Later, I asked how to make a local phone call from my room. I was told that they had to 'turn on' the phone to access an outside line, and that it was 'expensive'. I just bought a sim card for my GSM phone instead for 15 euros. So, while they were fair-enough about suggesting cheaper alternatives to the requests I made, at the same time, my requests were pretty standard for guests' needs at a hotel, yet were seemingly 'out of the ordinary' at this place. And MY experience with the TV is as follows: Upon arrival and dumping my bag in my room, I turned on the TV to find a very poor picture on the screen, on a number of channels. I touched the dongle hanging from my room key to the 'eye' on the TV, and nothing improved. I later found out that this cost me 9 Euros for 'pay tv'. Never did see any improvement in the picture for the rest of the day, nor was I even given access to any other channels. The TV was utterly baffling: For a short while, I was getting a snowy version of BBC, which was great. But later on, I couldn't access that channel at all...The 'channel up' button would get me as far as channel 13 before automatically switching back to channel one after a few minutes. In fact, I still don't quite know how to turn the damn thing ON in the first place. You can push the power button all day, and nothing happens. But go to the bathroom, and when you come out, the TV has decided to turn on, after all. Totally and unnecessarily complicated. But...Who comes to Amsterdam to watch TV, anyway? So, in closing: The hotel Nes was well-priced for a city like Amsterdam, with a good location, and other than the silliness of the TV, I had no major complaints. But then, I only stayed two nights. If I were to stay there for more time that that, things might have gotten to me a bit more.", "Date": "September 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot much for the money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5363656", "Content": "Hotel Nes was rather disappointing. The location was fantastic (I guess this is what you paid for...) and the downstairs lounge and breakfast restaurant were nice, clean and contemporary. HOWEVER once you got upstairs into the communal corridors and bedrooms it was a different story. We paid 315 Euro for 2 people for 2 nights including tax... my mother runs a Bed & Breakfast in the UK near the beach in beautiful South Devon which is cleaner, brighter, more comfortable and half the price. The communal corridors in Hotel Nes were dark and grimy, not sure when it had last seen a lick of paint. Our bedroom was tiny, did not have a bath, was not very clean, the bathroom smelt of the last occupier (along with several of the last occupiers hairs, yuck), there was one tiny single cupboard with 3 coathangers (not enough to service 2 guests), there were no tea or coffee making facilities, one chair to sit on, marks and scuffs on the walls, only one stand for one suitcase (no good when there is two of you!), and you had to pay extra to watch TV. The staff also left a lot to be desired. There appeared to be some quibble over my credit card when I arrived and the male receptionist told us very aggressively that he had almost sold our room as we were 'so late in arriving' (it was 3 in the afternoon and we had just driven from Germany, and they knew this because we had called the week before to check our booking and confirm our time of arrival), they denied all knowledge of the phone call. Then when I approached a different male receptionist to complain about the room, I was told to speak to a Duty Manager in the morning (this was about 6.30pm, not really an unsociable time to ask for a manager). I also witnessed a variety of general rudeness to other guests from male receptionists, including one who refused to take cash to pay for a room and insisted that the guest use his credit card instead. Each time I either handed the room key in, or asked for it when we came back, I was merely grunted at. The breakfast was plentiful but basic European fare, however you had to pay extra for orange juice (?). All in all I felt we did not get value for money, nor would we stay there again or recommend it to anyone else. My advice? - Stay in a FAMILY RUN hotel, or somewhere very expensive, that way you are guaranteed better service and a more caring attitude.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Locatation\u201d", "Author": "TRAVLDAWG", "ReviewID": "UR5145095", "Content": "I mainly chose this hotel for the location,very close to the rembrandtsplein with its various brown cafes, resturants and close to many gay bars.Since I stayed 8 nights ,I was given a front canal view on the 3rd floor wich was great.

The hotel blamed the agency but nevertheless gave us a 50% discount on the first night. The absolutely tiny room was situated right underneath the sloping roof. The first thing I noticed was a foul stench coming from the cupboard. Then I was a bit shocked to find the bathroom ceiling sloping to the extent that it was only possible to have a shower kneeling down. I am also convinced that the bed cover was inhabited by flees.
