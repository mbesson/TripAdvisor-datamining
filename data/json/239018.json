She is very friendly and calm, but if you have an allergy to dogs (as I do), it makes for a congested stay. The hair from the dog is cleaned up, but still effected our allergies.

I wanted something that was more like a guest house than a hotel, with a lot of uniqueness and charm, in a good location within walking distance of the major tourist sites -- and it didn't disappoint. The Wiechmann is not a 5-star hotel - if that's what you are looking for, you'd better book the Marriott or Crowne Plaza. This is a charming 3-4 star hotel that is the result of 3 historic canal-houses that have been connected together. The stairs are steep and narrow, the wooden floors creak, the decor is eclectic, and I loved it! The hotel is located on the outermost canal ring, the Prinsengracht canal. It's an easy 5 minute walk from the nearest tram stop, which from there you can also easily get to the Centraal train station and the Amsterdam Schipol airport. The \"neighborhood\" was very lovely and I felt very safe as I walked around. From the hotel, I walked almost everywhere in the central tourist district of Amsterdam, but took the tram sometimes just to save time (or my feet!). The hotel had a nice sitting area in the main reception area, and if you were lucky, the friendly family dog, Taz, would be there to say hello and ask for a belly rub :) There was also a lounge with comfy chairs, a small bar, a TV and a book exchange table. Although I never used it, there was also an internet computer available for guests upon request. The breakfast room was absolutely charming, sitting on the corner of the building, with lovely window views looking out over two canals (one on the front of the building, and the other on the side). It's easy to see that the breakfast room used to be a cafe. It was a pleasure to watch the comings and goings of the Amsterdammers as they went about their daily life while I was eating my breakfast :) The breakfast itself (which was included in the price of the room) was very satisfactory, with an assortment of cereals, fresh fruit, breads, jams, cold meats and cheeses, boiled eggs, juices, milk and coffee/tea. I had a standard-sized single room on the 3rd floor, with a large window overlooking the Prinsengracht canal in front of the hotel. The view was stunning, it was the quintessential view of Amsterdam that I was so eager to see -- and I was even happier to have the view right out my room. My room was not lush, but it was clean, sufficient and functional. I had a large double bed (maybe it was a queen?) which was comfortable and had nice linens with a thick coverlet. The room also had a nice, small flat-screen TV mounted to the wall, a small wall-safe (which wasn't big enough for my laptop or my Kindle, but was perfect for my passport, extra cash, keys, etc.), a heater under the window, and also a freestanding electrical air-conditioner. The bathroom was somewhat small, but it was perfectly fine for one person, and all of the facilities were updated and clean. The room didn't come with a hairdryer, but the front desk was happy to loan me one during my stay. The entire hotel had complimentary wireless internet access, and I had no problems accessing it from my room -- which was a nice bonus. The staff of the hotel were friendly and accommodating. They assisted me with directions and touristic recommendations, they printed some airline boarding passes for me, and they arranged a very early morning taxi back to the airport for me. There was also a slight discrepancy with my rate when I checked-out, and they proactively contacted me before I'd even arrived back home in the States with a resolution. The only thing I can say negative about this hotel is that the walls and ceilings/floors were fairly thin, so I could hear most of what my neighbors were saying and doing in their rooms -- but this is something I would expect in a historical guest house. Also, although I'm very happy that my room overlooked the canal, the downside was having to deal with the noise. Amsterdam doesn't have many cars, but it does have people who are out and about at all hours of the night walking along the canals -- and the sound from their talking and laughter was amplified by the water of the canals and the buildings surrounding them like a canyon. So, because of the \"street noise\" and the chatter of other hotel guests, I found that the best way to sleep was with ear plugs. Also, although the steep stairs didn't bother me at all, this might be a detractor for someone who is mobility challenged or has a lot of large/heavy luggage to carry. Overall, this hotel was perfect for me. It was precisely the experience I was looking for during my visit to Amsterdam and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to others planning to visit the city.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "joyt", "ReviewID": "UR118896864", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Wiechmann in a quad room.

We enjoyed watching Amsterdam life as we drank tea and fresh orange juice.

The hotel displays some interesting pieces of furniture which are family possessions and their pride and love of their business shines through. I can't think of a single thing to fault.

This room was grotty & it got really hot, I couldn't wait to get out of there in the morning. Lucky I had a fan in my room but I overheard another guest asking for a fan in his room, so they must not all come with fans. I would not have been able to sleep if I didn't have one. Another thing that bugged me was that on a few occasions the cleaner did not replace my toilet paper & threw out my soap! The hotel did not have a lift which I don't normally mind but the staircase was so narrow I struggled to get my suitcase up there. The breakfast was average. There was enough to fill you up but I had stayed at Hotel 26 in Berlin prior to staying here & their breakfast was amazing so perhaps I was a little spoilt. The internet connection was very temperamental. I had to bring my laptop down into the communal lounge (which was a nice place to hang out) but even then it didn't always work. They did have a computer which you could use if you didn't have a laptop. Despite all this, I did enjoy my stay as the Jordaan really is the most charming neighbourhood in Amsterdam.

It is just as cool as I have always heard it is, only cooler! Just a beautiful city, sort of like a large Greenwich village, with canals, boats, and bikes running all through it. Cobblestone strreets with great little bars, cafes and \"coffee shops\" ;-) around every corner. My partner and I walked for hours, day & night. The whole city seems so sureal. The streets are quiet, with very few cars, tons of bikes, and 15th & 16th century buildings lining canal after canal. We both felt very relaxed and really enjoyed the whole experience. The Wiechmann Hotel is a great place to stay. It is not a luxury hotel, nor is it trying to be. If that is what you are looking for you may be disappointed...and you will pay more. It is a fairly simple, typical European style, small Hotel. It is well run, clean, and charming in its own way...with a few extras that make it special. First, all the rooms are non-smoking, and so is the breakfast room. This was my main reason for choosing this hotel, as I am easily bothered by the smell of smoke. Smoking is only permitted in the lobby/lounge area, while we were there this was not a problem. I assume most of the guests are non-smokers as well. I so appreciate the few non-smoking places in Amsterdam, this is one of them. (By the way, there actually are a few restaurants that are starting to offer smoke free rooms or areas, and it is indicated on the window with a decal. Of course there are also all the wonderful outdoor cafes, where the smoking is less bothersome) Next, the location of the hotel is perfect, as so many other reviewers have said. It sits right across the road from one of the central canals with wonderful views from the lobby and breakfast room of passerby's on foot and bicycle. From this spot you can walk to just about everywhere, in any direction. If you head straight out the door and across the bridge just in front of the hotel it takes you directly into the heart of town by way of plenty shops, bars and cafes. If you walk to the left, you will come to The Joordan area with more quaint shops, bars and cafes. If you walk to the right, it is a few blocks to Leidstraat, a main central road, and Leidsplein, a cool commercial square with banks, bars, restaurants, stores, tourist info and canal boat tours. From here you can catch one of the easy to use trams which connect the whole city, and to the central train station. The trams are great when you get tired of walking. The hotel, which comprises three canal house buildings in a row, is architecturally beautiful on the outside. At night it is lit-up and looks really nice from across the canal. Our room in the back, on the third floor was basic and simple: Two single beds pushed together with comfortable enough mattresses; a table, two chairs, desk area, a key-safe, and an armoire to unpack into; a decent size bathroom and shower with soap and shampoo; and two large windows that opened to let in the fresh air. It was very neat and clean, with maid service everyday. And yes, the stairs! They are steep and narrow and tiring, and like most similar hotels, there is no elevator. The breakfast was also simple but enjoyable. Nothing to write home about but it was free! Good coffee, toast, jams, cereal, boiled eggs, ham, cheese and a little fresh fruit. The view from the room, as described, is very storybook! I found the staff to be efficient and cordial, as I found the Amsterdamers in general. I would not describe the Dutch as gregarious people, but always polite and courteous, in a mind-your-own-business sort of way, which suits me just fine. As a point of reference, I own a restaurant, so I know what it takes to run a business and to try to please people. No matter how hard you try there will always be some who are not satisfied. I read a few of the negative comments below, but I also read between the lines, and I am glad I did. I cannot say I have any complaints about this hotel. I am obviously recommending it to those seeking a well run, perfectly adequate, and relatively inexpensive, place to stay.

The physical facility is decent (as long as you're healthy enough, and have moderately sized suitcases, so that the steep narrow staircases won't give you trouble.) But the service orientation is really lacking. I paid 100 euros for my room, and neither the TV nor the wireless internet was working, not exactly what I expect for that price. When I went to check out, I asked the girl at the desk if these deficiencies might merit some price reduction, she said no but she'd call the owner to see what he said. His response was a big laugh. I told her OK but pointed out that in this day and age with people posting reviews of their hotel experiences on the internet, I would feel obligated to inform people of both positive and negative aspects of my stay. I was being polite the whole time, as I was certainly not in a position to demand a reduced price (the hotel was in no way obligated), I just wanted to see if they'd want to give one to show that they recognized the deficiences as not normal. Nonetheless her immediate response was to say in an offended way, \"That sounds like a threat!\" So if you'd like to stay at a place where tripadvisor reviews are seen as a threat, then the Wiechmann Hotel is the place for you ;-).

We booked through the hotel's website, which is easy to use and you know exactly what type of room you are booking, which is rarely the case in my experience of booking hotel rooms. I was desperate for a canal view, having stayed in Amsterdam three times previously in a succession of rooms with appalling views (at both the Pulitzer and Krasnapolsky we overlooked internal corridors/roofs and at the Swissotel, unbelievably, the window was only feet away from the wall of the next building and allowed very little daylight into the room.) Most hotels offering rooms with canal views charge exorbitant rates for these rooms. We booked a double room at the Wiechmann with bath, shower and canal view, with breakfast included, for 150 Euros per night, which compared very favourably with rates I had been offered elsewhere. We took a taxi from the Dorint Sofitel Amsterdam Airport (an excellent hotel - see my review elsewhere), which cost 35 Euros. You could not ask for a more central hotel than the Hotel Wiechmann. Amsterdam is right on your doorstep, with Dam Square and Leidseplein both within walking distance. Be prepared, though, that the hotel decor is very old fashioned and may not be to everyone's taste - as another reviewer wrote, it is a little like staying at your grandparents' house. Our room wasn't huge; large enough for a double bed, wardrobe, dressing table, a small table and an armchair. There was no mini bar but there was a small wall safe. However, even if I wasn't bowled over by the decor and facilities, I certainly got my canal view! Wow! We had a corner room and the whole of the outside wall on two sides of the room consisted of floor to ceiling windows, two of which opened onto a ledge with a pretty wrought iron grill to elbow height, almost like having a balcony. And the canal is right outside. The only drawback with the central location and canal view is that it is very noisy at night - we were there over a weekend, though; perhaps it isn't as bad during the week. We were on the first floor (i.e. one floor up from the street) and, while trying to get to sleep, I could overhear people asking for directions in the street below. The first time we went down to breakfast we were extremely disappointed. It was a Saturday morning and very busy. The tables are packed in tight and there was barely space to pull out a chair to sit down. Breakfast is essentially an unsupervised buffet, with a pretty limited selection. We didn't bother with breakfast on the Sunday morning, but decided we should on the Monday morning as we were flying home that evening and had a long day ahead of us. It was a completely different experience. The breakfast room was almost desserted and we were able to sit at a table in the window with views out onto the street and canals. It was lovely. Be warned that, although the rooms are non-smoking, the public areas are not, and you have to pass through these to reach the rooms. Smoke also tends to drift up the stairs towards the rooms, which is very unpleasant. The stairs might cause problems for some, as they are very steep and narrow and you have to carry your own luggage. The staff were civil but not exactly chatty. On a more positive note, there is a small computer room behind reception with unlimited free internet access, which we really appreciated. A previous hotel had charged 5 Euros for 30 minutes. If you are looking for a bed and breakfast (because that is what this is, really) in central Amsterdam with enviable canal views, I would definitely recommend Hotel Wiechmann.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co.

The situation is perfect, near everything. We got to see so much in the 3 days and all on foot. The staff were really nice and helpful, before we arrived and during out stay, even recommended a lovely restaurant. The breakfast room was a threat.
