After a few days we received the concerned coupon by glamoo.com along with the contact details of their partner, i.e. the tour operator where we could book our flight and hotel according to availability. The given tour operator was viaggiare.it which was definitely difficult to reach by phone; once we succeeded the person in charge first suggested the period from 02 to 04 Feb which we confirmed as possible. It was just after having already communicated flight times and hotel name that he noticed to be wrong as the flight was sold out on that day and asked whether we could travel from 03 to 05 Feb 2012. OK, we were available and the reservation was confirmed. The assigned hotel was Aldea Novum (B\u00fclowstr.). It took just a few days to get our booking confirmation per email, which reported all the relevant data about both our flight and hotel along with an ID booking no. On 03 Feb we took our flight to Berlin and arrived at the Aldea Novum Hotel in the afternoon. Upon check-in we immediately had trouble with our booking confirmation received by viaggiare.it: the receptionist told us that the hotel management did not have any reservation under our names. After some discussion they discovered that they had got our reservation by Gulliver Travel Associated (presumably a partner of viaggiare.it) but for the period from 02 to 04 Feb 2012! How could it be possible? Our flight had been correctly booked respectively on 03 and 05 Feb\u2026 How could we arrive at the hotel on 02 Feb when flying on 03 Feb and conversely fly back on 05 Feb whereas our hotel stay ended on 04 Feb? We felt just like Kafka\u2019s characters in one of his outstanding novels. But unfortunately this was pure reality. We asked to call the concerned tour operator in order to clear the situation; so, the hotel receptionist spoke to an operator who checked our reservation and confirmed the paradoxical data: FIRST arrival at the hotel and THE DAY AFTER flight to the destination where the hotel is located (!), departure from the hotel ONE DAY BEFORE flying back home. Our questions about the absurd contradiction of the data got no answer by the receptionist. It took more than an hour before she decided to have mercy to us and gave us our room key. We agreed that the hotel management would have definitely cleared the problem the day after by calling Gulliver once again. After so much trouble we could finally enjoy our room (which was spacious and correctly equipped for a 3-star hotel, though the bathroom is quite small and lacking of a proper lighting for make-up). We were confident that the hotel management and Gulliver would have solved the problem undoubtedly caused by a Gulliver\u2019s operator who had typed the wrong period. The day after we went out after breakfast in order to visit some must-see places. It was very cold but the sun shined on the German capital fabulously whitened by a thick layer of snow. When coming back to the hotel in the mid-afternoon we found ourselves wrapped by the sequel of the Kafka\u2019s novel: the receptionist told us that Gulliver had confirmed once again the contradictory periods. We also asked why they did not take into consideration our booking confirmation: the receptionist answered that the tour operator would have never paid them the night 04-05 Feb; so we had to pay \u2013 IMMEDIATELY \u2013 that night (a night which we had already paid!) or leave the hotel IMMEDIATELY. Really great! In order to make our decision we asked for the room key so that we could rest for a while and decide about. Sorry: we were not allowed to go up into our room and make use of our luggage unless we first communicated our decision. When asking whether they were aware of the seriousness of their behavior they simply answered that otherwise we could go up, spend that night there and the day after leave the hotel without paying anything. Do you imagine what we decided? We informed the receptionist that we were leaving in a few minutes the hotel, so we got the key, went up to get our luggage, paid our extra-charges and went away from the worst hotel we had ever run up against and with a temperature of -18\u00b0 C we searched for another hotel in the neighborhood of the airport. Our short holiday had been strongly polluted by such a non-professional behavior which was definitely insulting for us.

The reception team at the Aldea were really polite and professional, and all speak excellent English which is handy if, like me, your German isn't too good. The room was ok - clean enough with a tiny bathroom (w.c., sink and shower) where you can singe your rear end on the radiator when you get out of the shower cubicle. Reception had apologised for the lack of a double bed and advised that the twins had been pushed together (which isn't unusual in Europe) but not only were the wooden frames a bit of a health and safety hazard but the slatted bed bases were so noisy even when you sat on them that they were a bit of a passion killer! The radiators in the bathroom and bedroom work extremely well, so that even on a moderate setting you found that it got very warm rather quickly. That came in really handy as the weather was rather cold for the duration of our stay and you thawed out fast when you got back to the hotel. The room safe was free - which was great - and big enough to hold a DSLR camera plus attached lens as well as the usual passports and mobile phones etc. Access to the U-bahn is simple - out of the hotel and cross the road to Bulowstrasse and you're on the main line (U2) which is very handy for sightseeing expeditions and getting to most places across the city. The location of the hotel is fine - good for transport links and so not too far away from Zoo Station/Potsdamer Platz etc. There are a few nice local cafes for breakfast if you decide not to pay the 7.50 Euro per person charge - and to be honest the only good thing about the hotel breakfast was that I could drink a few cups of coffee before going out. I do recommend Bar Noir around the corner and opposite the City B Novum where the owner (a chap named Uwe) is really friendly and his croissants (and coffee) are delicious.

No fancy furniture or design, but it was in good condition. The bathroom felt clean, even though it could have been slightly more spacious. I never tried the breakfast as you could get a good breakfast with a 5 minute travel with the u-bahn. One thing that bothered me during the stay was the noise from other hotel guests. You can't really complain at the hotel for having noisy guests..but I mean, an after-party at 3 o'clock in the hallway at night?? Luckily my room had its view into a backyard, and not the main road. That way I avoided the worst noise. I can also mention that my room was cleaned everyday, and the towels were changed. As for the area - it's not a very \"photogenic\" area to walk around in. It's fairly central if you're going to use the u-bahn (be aware that some lines are closed due to an upgrade). At night there were a few prostitutes here & there. However, they did not seem to make any trouble towards any of the tourits. Overall, an ok stay.

Bought room online for about 60 Euros per day. They let me go straight to a room even though I arrived a couple of hours before official check-in time. Clean room. The two single-person beds were fine. Typically, there was only a comforter covered in a sheet sack. Berlin still has cool nights in May so this was okay in the middle of the night, but I am used to a sheet/blanket combo as this is more comfortable if it's still pretty warm in the room as you are going to sleep. Although the beds were comfortable enough, they also held a hidden danger. The wooden frame around the beds rises up to within a couple of inches of the top of the mattress. If you suddenly try to kneel on the edge of the mattress, as I did, your shin will rapidly extend downward with the mattress and bang into the wood, as my shin did, causing a rather serious bruise. The mini-bar under the desk had a nice little assortment of snacks and drinks. If you were desperate and wanted to pay five Euros for a beer or a box of peanuts, it might come in handy though there is all-night food and a non-stop bar, not to mention one or two non-stop Maedchen's, on the corner of Buelowstr. and Potsdamer Str. While the beds were fine, the sofa/bed in the corner was a bit ratty. One of its slats actually popped out when I sat on it. The cloth cover over the whole shebang was disintegrating. Not very sturdy. I never actually tried to unfold this sofa and sleep on it, but it seemed a bit dubious. There was no Do Not Disturb or Lass Mich in Ruhe or whatever sign in the room. In fact, the staff appears to not be familiar with the concept. While I had already gone out into the hall and traded my dirty towels for three clean ones, the cleaning guy came in, after I had left, and did the room anyway. The TV had the usual assortment of about two dozen channels, including the BBC and maybe a couple of others auf Englisch. The pay sports/movie/porn channels were activated for much of my stay. This was alarming as a note on the TV said there was a 10 Euro charge for these channels and that this charge was billed directly to you and the hotel had nothing to do with it (except of course for supplying the Deutsches Porno Kanal with your credit card number and expiration date). I had done nothing to activate these channels. The front desk people told me they were only supposed to play for a couple of minutes at a time in a preview mode. Not all the staff were friendly. The head day-shift desk clerk was efficient but not terribly warm (personality-wise; I did not check her actual body temperature though it would not have been at all surprising had this been well below the norm for warm-blooded creatures). And it wasn't like you could just ignore the staff. Not here. Just like at a little family-run French hotel, this place uses actual room keys, with each room key having a very heavy weight so you don't forget to return it to the front desk every time you go anywhere. Each time you return, you have to tell them your room number. If they do not remember your face, which was the case pretty much each time a new shift came on at the desk, you would also have to produce ID or have them look up your name. What a freaking pain. To be fair, some of the front desk staff were personable. However, the aforementioned head day-shift clerk made sure to ensure my departure was unpleasant by refusing to give me a receipt. Obviously, I needed a receipt in case there was some future confusion about charging me for the premium channels which I had never activated. She stated that I already had a receipt from the internet outfit from whom I had booked the room. This reminded of the policy for the porn channels. It's between me and the company I booked from and the hotel has nothing to do with me being a guest there.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon - England", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "wila", "ReviewID": "UR29920237", "Content": "I stayed at the Agon Adea in Berlin for one night.

The location of the Hotel is quite convinient with the U-bahn stations Nollendorf and B\u00fclowstra\u00dfe just a few meters away. The neighbourhood surrounding the hotel has a few mini markets such as the \"Kaiser's\" and a late night shop if you feel like buying beer. Two streets down on Maa\u00dfenstra\u00dfe there are several restaurants offering everthing from vietnamese, indian and chinese food to more traditional german dishes. I'd really like to reccomend the indian restaurant \"Amrit\" on the corner of Maa\u00dfen and Winterfeldstra\u00dfe, quite possibly the best indian food I have ever eaten, massive portions lots of flavour and medium priced. The Hotel Aldea might be a three star Hotel, but the german standard would possibly put it up there with the four star hotels internationally. The immediate street surroundings might be the only real downside, it's quite dead except for the occational prositute further down the street (don't be alarmed, it's quite commonplace in most capitals), and the waiters in the Hotel restaurant are sometimes a little less than friendly. On the other hand all other staff at the Hotel are very friendly and the seperate breakfast buff\u00e9t still makes my mouth water. The buff\u00e9t is very extensive with 6 types of bread, an arranged selection of marmalade, atleast 15 types of ham and sausages, vegetables, 4 types of juice, milk, coffe, tea, fruits such as kiwi, cantilope, peach and diffrent kinds of yogurts and buttermilk. On top of all that there are about 4 types of cake to choose from and a few chocolate selections. You have to show your room key to gain entrance to the breakfast diner, but once you're in there you can eat as much as you like. The hotel TV has about 18 channels, most of them make out the standard german selection of channels, but for english speaking guests there is CNN and SKy News, the Hotel also has Internal pay per View channels showing englishspeaking films for 9:90 Euro. You're also able to leave your clothes in a laundry bag if you wish to have them cleaned, the price list is avaiable in your wardrobe together with a safe for valuables. The standard double rooms are very spacious with comfortable beds a tv, a sofa, a chair, a desk and a mini-bar/fridge. The fridge contains coca-cola, assorted juices, beer, red and white wine and champagne. The rooms are very clean and the bathroom (including shower and hair dryer) was spotless.

Towels could be doing with being replaced though as they were wearing a tad thin. The breakfast was lovely. Buffet style. Hot and cold food. Usual stuff. Never saw a hooker or a transvestite and we were wandering home quite late every night. I would stay here again. Berlin is a brilliant place. There is lots to see and do.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cA very good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Soldado", "ReviewID": "UR5825855", "Content": "We booked a room for 4 people, but was allowed to stay there with 5.

The Hotel sits by a very busy crossroads . To the front of the Hotel, the Underground station runs across the front of the building above ground (this is now closed until 1st December 2006). However, it is extremely noisy when operating. To one side of the building, during the late evening/night, the street is taken over by Hookers and Transvestites. There is much horn honking and derisive shouting throughout the night from clients and passing cars. The Hotel has double glazing which minimises the noise but no air con. While we were there it was so hot, we needed the windows open. A fan deadened the noise and enabled us to get some sleep. The Hotel itself is very clean although somewhat dated. Our room was a good size, immaculately clean and the bedding and towels white but a little threadbare. The shower room, small but adequate. Our bedding was not changed during our stay. The complimentary toiletries consist of a combined wash/shower/shampoo liquid above the sink and in the shower cubicle. There is no complimentary 'hospitality tray' - but we do not know if these tea/coffee facilities are usual in other German establishments. We had a plumbing leak which was promptly dealt with by a very polite and helpful staff member. Some staff have a rather short, sharp manner but maybe this is the 'german way' rather than 'impolite indifference'. The Hotel is a 15/20 minute walk to the Kurfurstendam. The nearest Underground station (Kurfurstenstrasse) about a 4/5 minute walk. There are local shops and cafes nearby. We do not agree that this is a 4 star Hotel but we paid such a bargain price, we feel we still had our moneysworth. We would however feel very differently had we paid the standard rate of 165 euros a night.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cAldea, Oh dear you mean!\u201d", "Author": "Miiky", "ReviewID": "UR5500735", "Content": "Well!

I ordered the room from hotelopia.com which stated they did have room service but I presume what they actually mean is someone tidies and makes the bed. The staff were friendly and nice and the breakfast was a nice buffet although the surroundings could be better, but you're only there for half an hour or so, so not that important to me really. This hotel is in an excellent location, the U-bahn is a 60 second walk and only a couple of stops from the Zoological Garten meaning you can get to Tegel airport within half an hour by U-bahn and bus. Berlin is one of the most vibrant, metropolitan and wonderful cities I have ever had the great fortune to visit and so if you are looking for a docking bay form which to leave and visit the sights this hotel is perfect. The rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable, easily affordable, yes the bathroom is small but pretty and more than good enough.

The place was spotless, the staff were friendly, great breakfast. Why are some of the contributors so hung up on the hallways? (painted various shades of grey) as someone has already said how much time do you spend in a hotel hallway? From a location point of view it's less than two minutes walk from the nearest metro station, less than five minutes walk from Nollendorflatz, which is hopping with gay nightlife. I'd stay there again and recommend it to anyone. One small thing.

The rooms were spacious enough, everything was spotlessly clean, beds were comfortable. Proved to be a perfect base for our trip to Berlin - we spent two nights there. The U2 U-bahn line runs past the door - the nearest station is a couple of minutes' walk. The U2 line takes you to places like Potsdamer Platz, Alexanderplatz, the Zoo etc. Would be hard to beat this hotel for value-for-money.
