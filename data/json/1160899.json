The value for the price I paid (55 euros/night) was excellent. I stayed in a room that was cleaned daily, with a comfortable bed, and a decent shower in an adorable neighborhood slightly outside the center of Rome. Keep in mind that this is seriously a \"no frills\" type of place -- the desk is only staffed for a few hours each day, there is no other onsite staff, and nobody ever answered the listed phone number when I called. But if you're looking for good value and don't need a doorman/concierge, this is an excellent choice. The hotel is conveniently located in the Trastevere neighborhood, which has many streets to explore with cute cafes. It's also across a bridge from the old Jewish Ghetto. Largo Argentina, with plenty of bus connections, is about 5-8 minutes walking distance. The Vatican and the Forum are about 20-25 minutes walking distance. There is no metro line nearby. The hallway had free Rome street maps available for those who like walking. Cyrus, one of the hotel's staff, was very friendly in person and via email (as stated above, I could never reach anybody via the phone number, but Cyrus always responded to emails). Although the staff is only onsite for a few hours per day, Cyrus went out of his way to be sure that I could leave my luggage at the hotel for pickup before my late evening flight. (The staff keeps track of guests' flight/train arrival information and they leave after all check-ins are complete.) For the price, my room was large, with plenty of storage, and warm enough (in winter) that I needed to turn down the heat. The beds were comfortable. Towels were not incredibly soft, but I think that's a minor detail. The room had a shower (no bathtub) that was two steps up from the bedroom. The room was cleaned every day. (I think that I may have been quietly upgraded to a larger room than what I paid for, but I'm not sure.) Although it is listed here as a B&B, I was not offered breakfast, and in fact the reservation form specifically stated that breakfast was not included. For the price (and the fact that there are actual bakeries around the corner), this was not a problem. The rooms are located on the 4th floor of an apartment building in Trastevere. From Fiumicino airport, take the local (NOT the express) to Trastevere station, and then take the #8 tram to a stop near the hotel. The door to the building is not well marked, so look at Google Maps to be sure you know what it looks like. I had no problem finding the place.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201cExcelent Place for a seeing Rome\u201d", "Author": "Gumbo J", "ReviewID": "UR122003266", "Content": "This is a great little place. It is a converted apartment flat so things are a little different from a normal Hotel. A lot of reviewers were complaining about the noise, but room 1 was silent. I didn't hear a thing through the windows. The bed and towels were very clean as well. The rooms them selves were a little spartan but honestly i wasn't expecting a lavish room. It's exactly what you need for exploring Rome and not staying in your room the entire time. The bed and pillows were very firm, but that's about the same all over Italy from what I gathered from other reviews. The Hotel does have Wi-Fi and I never had an issue with it. A good solid signal with good speeds. There was a TV, but honestly i think i flipped it on once. The location... that's the kicker. This place is great! you literally have a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum and a 15 minute walk to the Vatican. It's very centrally located and you can't get lost going home. You just find the Tibber river and head down river until you hit Ponte Geribaldi and head down the Viale Trastevere. After a long day of walking there are plenty of good restaurants around the hotel as well. I found a place called Da Vittiro, good service, great food and it wasn't crawling with people either. Check out Santa Maria in Trastevere while you're over there. It was my favorite church out of all of Rome. The hotel staff (Sairis (sorry if I misspelled your name)) is very helpful and good to talk to. He ends up coming in at all hours to check people in as they arrive at the hotel. He speaks Indian, English and Italian and maybe another but I can't remember off the top of my head. The stairs up to the hotel aren't bad, just make sure you count out the right number of floors and dont try going into the door a level down... I definitely didnt do that.

Having been to Rome before i would recommend Trastevere to anyone who is deciding which area to stay in. It has real character with lovely little cobbled streets and piazzas, and the bars and restaurants are much cheaper and nicer than the tourist rip-off places near Piazza Navona etc. The centre of Rome however is easily accessible either on foot or the tram stops just outside the hotel. The Vatican is about a twenty minute stroll along the river. I would certainly recommend Sonnino Suites. The rooms were spacious, with fridge, safe,tv,air-conditioning and hairdryer all provided. The bed was very comfortable indeed. Although our room over-looked the busy Viale Trastevere, the excellent double-glazing blocked out any noise. Sonnino Suites is a bed and breakfast, not a hotel so reception is not open 24hrs. However, the staff will email you to find out your expected arrival time and will be there to welcome you. You are given a ticket for each day's breakfast which is taken at the small cafe downstairs. The breakfast is assorted croissants, coffee and toast but we found it enough to start the day. The hotel is slightly difficult to find as it is on 4th floor of a large building and there is no sign on the outside door, but this is quite typical of Rome. I printed a picture off the web which made it much easier as i recognised it straight away. We found an excellent restaurant called Pontefino, in the square behind the hotel which offered a 10 euro menu. This included starter, main course, dessert and even a drink, excellent value for money and good food, Pancotto, across the road, was also very good. A word of warning, in central Rome, especially in the Piazza Navona, the price of a beer was an extortionate 9 euros.The best way to get to Trastevere from the airport is to take the local F1 train to Trastevere Station. Tickets are 8 euros and the journey takes about 25 mins. You then cross the carpark outside the station and get tram no 8 to Belli which is 6 stops and costs 1 euro.

The ambience and staff were also great and we often popped in after a days sightseeing for a drink.

When we arrived, the building is unnassuming- no sign, just a building number to let you know where you are. If you look, there is a very small bell to the left of the door and the name \"Sonnino Suites\" is on the bell, very small. We didnt see that, but entered the lobby because people were leaving, and asked some workmen where the suites were. They are on the 4th floor, there is a miniscule lift, but it is a lift so be happy. As with so many places we have stayed in Europe (we are on a 3 week family trip) there are plusses and minuses to every location at which we have stayed. Here are the plusses of Sonnino Suites: Right on a very main artery-plenty of transportation within 2 minute walk; A tourist infor booth right across the street and tabachi to buy tickets; near nice restaurants and some sights (go to Pancotto across the street-very good food, reasonable prices, friendly people). The rooms, being on the 4th floor, are quiet and have good AC and good sound proof windows, OK view. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms very clean, showers very good, hot water good. Ammenities like soap and shampoo are provided. The minuses: there is basicaly no reception much time you will be here- meaning in the mornings before you leave for your destinations and in the evenings when you return. I never met Tomasso, with whom I corresponded. I met his desk guy, Sayles I think his name is, who is here from maybe 9-10 & 2-4 some times. On the room door it says reception is here 8-10, then 14:30-19:30. Its not. The building is fairly unnoccupied- there is a dentist office on the first floor, Ive never seen anyone else except a couple of other travellers entering the other suites on this floor. This is most definately NOT a B&B- there is no breakfast, no coffee, nothing but beds. The TV didnt work. There is a fridge in the room, so you can go to the local market (left out the door about 2 blocks and across the street) and get some very nice things to eat. But you still wont be able to make your own coffee unless you brought an electric appliance to do that. When you check in you will be asked to pay in full up front, unlike many places that let you settle the bill on your way out. If I hadnt done this I would have looked for other lodgings with more ammenities for the same price- I am sure we could have found something that offered more, but I'm also sure that that is why they have you pay up front. Oh, and PS, I cant load pictures until we get back to the States, but the room looks nothing like the small photo on the TA website.
