{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved it We didn't have a reservation and arrived to Frankfurt around midnight. Tried to get into any hotel at that point.Columbus wasn't fully booked like the first one (don't remember the name), so we get the room.Pro's-room was overall clean, shower OK, TV and internet connection worked fine, and thing I liked the BEST - breakfast! I would stay in this hotel just for the breakfast, really. Comparing to other places we went in our European journey, Germany is the country where you can actually find great food and enjoy every bite of it. Stuff was very friendly and helpful! Not the most fancy hotel, but wonderful service.Con's-carpet has stains.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR137806780", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fleurage"}, {"Content": "Overpriced tinny room! Granted most hotels were full on my visit, but for my $166 I got a room the size of a match box. There was barley enough room for the single bed. The carpet was dirty. The TV was placed so high up you really needed to be standing to see it. Again the room and bathroom was so small, I though I was in a sleeper car on a train. There was not even a place to put the suitcase. Do to the full status of the hotels in the area, this would have been ok if the price was much more resonable for this room. I would say the room was really worth $40.", "Date": "Feb 6, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR443565164", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Gut f\u7709r Kurzzeitaufenthalt   showReview(19648852, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR656697498", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Zentral gelegenes einfaches Hotel mit nettem Service   showReview(17431392, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR448211572", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(11315890, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR240436451", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "wer keinen Luxus sucht ist hier richtig   showReview(11436052, 'full');", "Date": "May 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR395762746", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Klein, aber fein   showReview(11401014, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR930540002", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d258102-r19397840-Columbus_Hotel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "258102", "Price": "$170"}}
