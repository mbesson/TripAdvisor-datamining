Both stays were bad. For starters, the hotel is located in a very out of the way and inconvenient part of the city. Many taxi drivers have no idea where it is, which is a problem because you have to take a taxi to go anywhere of interest. And each cab ride runs about $15 to $25 USD, so the cost of the rids add up. To make matters worse, the hotel also attempted to charge me $113 USD for a small load of laundry, which equated to roughly $6 USD per pair of socks! I had to stay there a secondtime because the tour group had booked there. During that stay, my shower and telephone did not work. They moved me to another room that we so small the bed literally blocked the doorway to the bathroom. Several of my friends on the trip experienced similar problems and had to request new rooms because there were dead cockroaches in their uncleaned bathrooms. I will never stay at this hotel again and urge anyone considering it to reconsider.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "KUWAIT", "Title": "\u201cGOOD LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "AHMAD B", "ReviewID": "UR80073096", "Content": "the hotel location it an excelant and had a betuful although it had small room,no left,no wireless in the rooms.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ile de france", "Title": "\u201cnice and quiet out of the Istanbul noise\u201d", "Author": "tansy78", "ReviewID": "UR36464815", "Content": "We only spent 1 night here before catching the plane back so didn't really test out the service.

Located in an old part of Istambul, you find amazing views of the city from the \"Aziyade Restauant\" while having your breakfast. The staff was friendly, welcoming with broad smiles, service - perfect. Though the rooms are small, they are always kept clean. On the first day of our arrival we felt tired and slept too long, so our breakfast time was gone. We woke up as hungry as a wolf and started to look for a place to have something. We went into the cafe next to the \"Aziyade Restaurant\" and inquired about the breakfast (we didn;'t yet know anything)... though the Turkish guy didn't understand our English, he soon found out that we were newcommers and offered us breakfast for free(!) that was touching. There is also a \"Nargilevi\" bar where you can smoke water pipe (Nargile), play backgammon (\"Tavla\") and enjoy various teas. I think the hotel will be the perfect place to visit during summer time. If you want to get acquainted with Turks and Turkish life well, you should come to Turquhouse Boutique Hotel. Taxi arrives within a minute. You don't have to wait long.

The location is not central however you can get taxis easily plus you can take the cable cars from right outside the hotel for just 1.3 lira which will take u down (as the hotel is located on a hill) and from there you can catch buses very easily to the main areas. HOwever i was disappointed with 3 things mainly: 1) on the website where i booked the hotel it said that the hotel would provide free transport from the airport for stay of 3 nights and more and return back to the airport for 5 nights stay. My stay was 5 nights and when i called the hotel to inform abt my flight for airport pick up they flaty refused saying the cars were unavailable - same when we wanted a drop to the airport. If theairport transfer was not part of the package than they shud not have advertised it so - ths was most unprofessional. 2) the staff could not communicate properly in english so it was difficult to even make a complaint. once the bathroom was not cleaned properly and when i called to complain no one came by after that also - so there was no response to my complaint. 3) When we first reached and we asked them abt how to get to the main city center the receptionist told us that only taxi was the option - so for the first 3 days we spent heavily on taxis and only after that we discovered that theres a very cheap cable car right behind the hotel that takes u down the hill from where u can get buses very easily. this was again most irritating that they did not guide us properly.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riederich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cAutentic and wonderful Turquhouse\u201d", "Author": "Ramtha", "ReviewID": "UR7193134", "Content": "HOTEL: Turquhouse Boutique Hotel My stay: December 23 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c January 03, 2007 In a nutshell: \u00c2\u00b7Beautiful view overlooking Istanbul \u00c2\u00b7Very friendly and helpful staff at the reception (English and German) \u00c2\u00b7The hotel facilities are designed for natives, however, foreigners are very welcome. Breakfast: \u00c2\u00b7The breakfast buffet is served in a restaurant overlooking the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Golden Horn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Halic). You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never forget this spectacular view!!! \u00c2\u00b7The typical Turkish breakfast consists of olives, feta and black tea. The hotel also offers an American breakfast & fresh fruits. Rooms: \u00c2\u00b7You can enjoy international standard in the cosy, comfortable and inviting rooms. \u00c2\u00b7Rooms are nicely and thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis. Dining: \u00c2\u00b7The hotel houses two restaurants: A snack style restaurant that serves dinner from 8pm until late at night. The other restaurant offers national tasty food for a reasonable price. \u00c2\u00b7The hotel has an inviting caf\u00c3\u00a9 where you can enjoy excellent sweets and coffee variations. \u00c2\u00b7Furthermore, you can spend your evening in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authentic water pipe caf\u00c3\u00a9 where you can meet locals. (Due to the close grave yard and the holy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eyup\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mosque, alcoholic beverages are not offered but can be bought in the small shop across the street and can be enjoyed in your room.) Internet: \u00c2\u00b7Internet is available in the hotel lobby. The connection is slow but enough to check your emails or find useful information online. Transportation: \u00c2\u00b7A relaxing way to get to the centre of Istanbul is by cable car and ferry boat that takes you right into town. On the ferryboat you can enjoy a nice cup of chai or salep. Hamam: \u00c2\u00b7The hotel has its own Hamam wich I tried once, but you might want to check out one of the professional Hamams in town. Closeby Points of Interest: \u00c2\u00b7The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pierre Loti\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hill is a popular spot for natives and travellers. Please be aware that on Sundays and Holidays the caf\u00c3\u00a9, restaurant and viewing points are crowded. Conclusion: \u00c2\u00b7I highly recommend the Turquhouse Boutique Hotel and its facilities for a relaxed stay in Istanbul. Turquhouse leaves you satisfied and offers you a truly authentic stay. \u00c2\u00b7Thank you Turque Hotel for your hospitality. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking forward to seeing you in the near future.

The driver was there as expected, waiting for me. My trip to the hotel was by small minibus. We turned a corner after taking a winding small road to the top of the hill, and it was like changing locations. The entrance was staffed by several plain clothes security men with radios, a bell man to carry my bags, and the driver to help me to the check in. Not only was security a pleasant surprise, but the grounds were immaculate, beautiful with flowers and a wonderful breeze to make it a picture perfect start of a vacation. The rooms are in an old style wooden hotel, though it was all modern and perfectly maintained. The beds were absolutely nice to sleep in, though the rooms were a little small. There is a hotel safe at the front desk that is free. Once I had a complaint about the shower leaking. Within 30 minutes a maintenance man arrived and changed the entire shower with a new part, then cleaned up his work and checked the shower. Great service. I noticed that this was not a business or international travelers hotel, but more of a locals hotel. I saw only a few international travellers at breakfast in the mornings, though there were small groups from other cities in Turkey. I have been in Turkey several times, including several other cities, so I have a feel for the \"real\" Turkey, and this was it. There are several nice restaurants to eat in, with a nice buffet. Being a \"Turkish\" hotel the breakfast buffet caters to a Turkish clientel, though Europeans and Americans will find enough variety. Don't arrive late for breakfast (closes at 11:00 AM) , if you wish to enjoy all the items, though few are ever \"out\" completly. I opted for the eggs, breads, cereal and fruit most mornings. Service was very good, and pleasant. The main restaurant in the evening had an English menu, though English was not widely spoken ordering was not too difficult. Remember this is a Turkish hotel designed for Turkish clients. The food was nice though not cheap. The staff was helpful as to how to get around, with the front desk speaking English very well. They had great ideas on where to go. One nice service is that they wil call a taxi for you, from a taxi company that charges a fair price. Every time I took one from there, it was perfect. The locals use the outdoor coffee shops looking over the Golden Horn. You can take the cable car back to the hotel and save the ride around to the top. Nice view. Best way to get around in Istanbul is to take the cable car to the waterfront below, transferring to the ferry to Eninonu. From there you can transfer to the Tram up to the historical sights near the Sultanamet. Though across from the ferry, there is a delightful park near the mosque, with small cafes that are open till 11 pm (2300). Nice to walk in. To go to Taksim Square, take the tram Eminonu to the end (though it is being lengthened) and take a taxi to the top. Dont walk. At the ferry landings you can take a ferry ride to Iskudar or Darampasha across the water, about 30 minutes. There you can eat in a local cafe, though English menus are non-existent. Be prepared to point and order. Dont complain if it is wrong. The prices were always charged fairly, for what I received. There is a Bosphorus ferry that costs YTL7.50 (USD 5.00) that takes you to the last town before the Black Sea, where you can climb to the old Crusader fort for a beautiful view (3 hours stop). Beware the fish shops are expensive at the ferry stop, so order a sandwach and water to go. Take your own TP for the ferry ride, as a Turkish toliet is all that available. You did ask for a complete, authentic Turkish experience. All these were suggestions from the excellent front desk staff. Be sure to ask for the Airport Pickup This will be my \"home\" in Istanbul in the future.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maasmechelen Belgium", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful atmosphere ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4415716", "Content": "turquhouse boutique hotel in istanbul turkiye has a unique atmosphere.. design, comfort, quality, food, everything is very well arranged, clean and high quality.. has a beautiful view of city.. and personnel is very kind, helpful and friendly.. as i am on business trips all the time, i see many different places, but turquhouse is really different, i will not forget it..", "Date": "February 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "piestany", "Title": "\u201cturquhouse boutique,really boutique hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4412893", "Content": "we stayed at turquhouse boutique hotel 3 weeks ago, it was excellent and we felt that really turkish culture. thanks to all management", "Date": "February 4, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Turquhouse Boutique Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d581991-Reviews-Turquhouse_Boutique_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$91 - $144*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Merkez Mah.
