There is also free WiFi available at the hotel. My only complaint was that unfortunately we stayed during the coldest spell in Barcelona in years, (not teh hotels fault :) ) there was no duvet, only sheets on the beds and there was only one blanket available between the two beds in the room, although I'm sure that reception would have provided us with another had we asked.

The hotel was above average, though has room for improvement. This is definitely a business hotel, situated near the university and Palau de Congresso away from the main tourist areas. The nearest train station is an 8 minute walk away, and there are a few cafes nearby for a quick meal. The department store El Corte Ingles is close by, but the hotel isn't close to any other shops. I was lucky that I had a south facing room with some sunlight (most of the rooms don't have natural light). The room was modern and well furnished, though lighting could have been better. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large, with a well stocked supply of toiletries. I found it hypocritical that there were signs warning guests to save water, while the shower head was massive - the most water wasting shower I've ever experienced in a hotel. If the hotel is serious serious about saving water, perhaps they should change their shower-heads? Staff was friendly enough, though could have been a bit more helpful. It often took a while to find the barista at the hotel bar to get a quick coffee. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on the food. As a 4* hotel, it would be nice if there was a kettle in the room for coffee. One thing that I found particularly frustrating was the slow wifi, especially in the room. This is especially frustrating for a business traveller. If the wifi is slow, at least offer a premium upgrade so that people can use skype.

The comfort was excellent. (It was a smoking room. We forgot to specify we prefer non smoking in our online reservation...) The view however was non existent unless you appreciate the relative calm of... a wall (this could be specific to our room). We had all our breakfasts with the hotel.

For us, it was more than worth the time on the metro to have the peace and quiet and high quality room at the Catalonia Rigoletto. Our room was reasonably sized for Europe, and had nice clean modern styling. It had a nice flat screen TV with decent cable selections, and a FANTASTIC bathroom and shower. The showerhead was one of those overhead \"rain\" types which was luxurious. It was amazingly quiet at night. I had used earplugs at every other hotel on our trip, but didn't even need them there. The staff was outstanding. They went out of their way to make sure that we could watch the women's world cup final. We asked the day before if it would be showing on our cable system, and then they arranged for us to watch it with some of our friends in the cafe downstairs, and brought us drinks and chips and nuts. The staff kept coming out to check on the score and help us cheer (we really liked the guy whose name we can't remember, but who had studied in Florida and spoke flawless English -- he was helpful and super friendly). We also really liked Danni and the bartender and well, everybody we dealt with there. One big downside was that our room was way too hot. It was July, and humid out, and though our room had \"air conditioning\", we had it set on the coldest setting and I was still sweating. I'm pretty sure it was only a fan. We asked the staff to look into it, but it really never improved. Also, the breakfast was not included and was overpriced at 13 Euros (we were easily able to find cafe's nearby with cafe con leche and a croissant for 5 Euros or so.) Another bonus was the easy access to the metro station, though we were on a relatively quiet side street. Also, at the end of the street is a tunnel freeway entrance that made the trip to the airport quick and relatively cheap by cab.

Would definitely go to the Rigoletto again!", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SAN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value for Great Sleeping\u201d", "Author": "nzpilot", "ReviewID": "UR67232627", "Content": "No, it's not on Las Ramblas, but it is easy to get to the tourist part of town. It is only 2 blocks from a Metro and 3 blocks from a hop-on/hop-off bus stop. When we are in our hotel, we want to sleep, and this place excelled in providing a modern, clean room with the biggest and best shower we have ever had in Europe. We stayed here at the end of a cruise because other \"1st choices\" were not available, BUT this is our new 1st choice. The rooms have black out curtains for those who need to sleep in the day. We arrived at 9am and immediately were offered a room. The staff thought we had just flown in over night and was very sensitive to getting us in a room. The hotel breakfast looked typical and NOT a great value since it was not included in our rate (174E total for 2 nights through booking.com). BUT local cafes are a stone throw from the door. Having been on a 2 week cruise, we had a ton of laundry that we did not want to pay hotel prices for. The desk clerk staff was quite understanding (also spoke excellent English), found a local wash n' fold within an 8 min walk, and printed out a map of how to get there off the internet. A large taxi van from the cruise port to the hotel was easily available on the pier for 35 euros for our party of 4 and 6 bags. The desk arranged a taxi to the airport on departure for about the same price. This hotel is adjacent to the university and perfect for someone attending a football event. It is only 2 yrs old, so the rooms are great and a substantial value for money. The free wireless internet was an added bonus. Desk was happy to print out our boarding our airline boarding passes for free asking me to email them a pdf. Bottomline: we will be back!!", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baku, Azerbaijan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent and friendly\u201d", "Author": "VasfIsmail", "ReviewID": "UR62599032", "Content": "It's small.

We stayed here for 2 nights as we could not get further nights at our origional hotel, I have to say that I was a bit worried having read a tripadviser review saying that it was horrible but as I was so stressed out by not knowing if we would ever get home I decided to give it a go. I can honestly say that I am completely baffled as to why it should have received a bad review. On arriving at the hotel the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, they offered to take our case to the room and check in was seamless and quick. The room was beautiful, extremely modern and clean. We had booked a standard room with shower. The bed was huge and very comfortable, a comfortable chair and table were provided. The lighting was excellent and varied - no problem being able to see to read. A minibar/fridge and free electronic safe were provided and the cupboard space was ample. The room was very quiet both day and night due to thesecondary glazing. Another lovely feature was the bathroom which was all dark marble and contained a 2 headed power shower. The cubicle was so big that you could have had a party of people in there all at once if you were that way inclined! The metro which is just round the corner is Maria cristiana. It is on a main line three stops from the main rail station and goes direct to all the tourist stops which are all in the same zone. The area of this hotel itself is lovely - quite modern as it is in the business and University section, within an easy walk there are three must sees; the Gaudi gates, a serene Monastry with some of the largest Medieval cloisters in Europe and the Royal Palace which houses 3 excellent museums all for just 5 euros. There is also a large shopping centre nearby. As we were stuck due to the cancelled flights with very little money we decided to eat at the hotel so that we could put it on the room bill. The food was exceptional - some of the best I have had and very good value at 12 euros for 3 courses and & 7 euros for a bottle of very decent house wine. The restaurant was modern, spotless and on 2 different levels with big windows downstairs. It was very popular and as so well used. The day I left I had to pack really quickly as my husband had gone ahead to the airport and managed to get us on an earlier flight which was leaving in 2 hours giving me just an hour to get to the airport. I was in a terrible panic but the Manager and 2 of his reception staff were absolutely brilliant, they got me a taxi within 2 minutes, carried my bag to it and even got my mobile phone working again which had jammed!!! I don't think I'll be back to Barcelona in the near future but if I am I would definately stay at rhis lovely hotel no questions asked.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "TAadvisor", "ReviewID": "UR48542368", "Content": "I booked the Catalonia Rigoletto after reading the great reviews on trip advisor and after being impressed at its high rating and low rates per night. When I drove up, I knew that I had been mislead. I wish I had taken a picture to caution others about what they are getting into.The neighborhood is very far away from all sights in barcelona, in a very concrete area. There was no one to help with my bags. When we arrived there was one sweaty clerk behind the desk who informed us the closest restaurant besides theirs which was very unappetizing, was 2 subway stops away. The hotel \"restaurant\" was an all white room with no windows and a few tables and didnt look like a legitimate restaurant, or anywhere I would like to eat. The hotel room was not cleaned properly as there was a thick layer of dust on everything and the shower smelled strongly of mildew. Additionally, we rarely saw any other guests in the hotel, it was a very eerie feeling to be walking down a new looking but dusty hallway, that was dark (motion sensor lights) and our footsteps were literally echoing. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone.
