The suite I stayed in for 2 nights had water radiator that kept dripping so I called the front desk and they sent in the maid who wrapped a towel around the pipe and taped it and then put a cloth on the carpet to keep it dry. How primitive. The thing dripped for 2 days and the suite took on a tenement atmosphere. Eventually the heater broke down so the front desk brought me a small heater to plug in. . I wanted to move to another suite but the one they showed me smelled like a horse's stable. I moved to another room and it was close to their pub and the noise from the music was very loud and pulsating so I asked for another room. This room was on a floor they were renovating with tiles and was a mess. To get to your room you had to walk over boards and tiles and plaster and it was a safety hazard too. I asked for another room and ended up in one of their older rooms which stunk like body odor PLUS in the bathroom At this point, I was tired and took the room for one last night. Luckily, I had some good room spray on me so it helped. But in any of their rooms I ever stayed in there was always the pungent smell of sulphur coming out of the bathrrom drains. The maids were surly and belligerent and a few times it sounded like their was a hen fight going on in the courtyard as they hollered at each other back and forth. They offer a continental breakfast for $ 7 which is overpriced. It was served by a woman who does not speak English very well and the coffee was gross and the food stale. I would avoid this place in the future. Pay a bit more for a better place.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Banff, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMet my expectations, considering what I paid for.\u201d", "Author": "Gazpacho16", "ReviewID": "UR124042933", "Content": "I stayed at the Barclay quite a few times over the years, and it offers good accommodation for the budget traveler (if you are not picky, of course).

It's a fairly touristy area, the red shuttle trolleys stop across the street to tour you around town and since it's fairly central you're close to most all of the destinations. Now for the \"mediocre comfort\" part. Our particular room, I believe, was the cheapest room in this hotel so consider that when reading this. (We walked around the hotel and peeked in a few other more expensive rooms and they looked much bigger and nicer). Our room was the smallest hotel I've ever stayed in; there was barely enough room for the bed and very little walking around space. The bathroom was also very small and in some places there was some minor damage (broken floor tiles). The room did seem clean, but my biggest complaint was the bed. It was very hard and sunken in right in the middle. No matter what you tried, you'd always end up rolling back in - kind of like sleeping in a bowl. The TV was broken and made everyone's head look huge and there is also no elevator so pack light. Am I complaining? Sort of but not really - it's good for seeing Vancouver on a budget and if we wanted luxury we'd stay up the street at one of the big towers and pay double. The service was actually quite good; the man at the front desk did not speak much English but he was friendly and when our toilet got stuck he offered to come up and plunge it (to which I basically said, thanks but I think I should do it myself). Also, the man downstairs in the lounge actually offered to warm up some leftovers for us in his microwave in the back - he didn't have to do that and I think he went above and beyond the call of duty. I'd probably look into staying here again, but I would opt for a larger room and hope the bed isn't a bowl-bed.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MANCHESTER UK", "Title": "\u201cAdequate hotel + great location = very good value\u201d", "Author": "BRADHILL Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR116734682", "Content": "Could have paid same amount for better quality at airport or North Vancouver but was persuaded to stay downtown.

I and a friend rented a Deluxe Twin room. In our case it meant that in addition to the usually hotet room, bed, two night tables,lamp, phone, clock radio, desk, chair, fridge, armoire containing a TV, with remote, as well as three clothes drawers, there was a second room. This second room was the inner room so there was no window to the outdoors. There was a nine panelled window(minus the glass) between the two rooms. Both rooms had doors which closed off the hallway. There was a clothes closet, with a door, in the hall way and the bathrooom,which had a window, was off the hallway. We were at the back of the hotel so that the bedroom window looked unto the court yard and the bathroom window looked out unto the alley. We had no issuses with noise and slept soundly. The hotel is old and worn but is was clean. The linens were scent free, a plus for me since I have asthma. No harsh chemicals were used in the cleaning of the bathroom or the rooms. There was no shortage hot water. All the staff were polite and helpful at all times. There was a true mixture of hotel guests with ages ranging from children under ten to those who have been senior citizens for a few years. I personally met people from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. I have been to Vancouver more than forty times so I was well aware of the excellent location of the Barcly Hotel. The location allows one to walk to major shopping, Stanley Park, English Bay, numberous restaurants, bars, night clubs and the Skytrain. If you are not a big walker you can get public transit within one block of the hotel. I have travelled, literally ,around the world and have stayed in hotels that should have been burnt to the ground to one of the top ten hotels in the world(at the time). I really wonder about the travel experience of some of the people who write poor reviews of this hotel. They must be inexperienced in travel, do not understand rating systems, live with high expectations or are people who are just naturally negative, because this hotel is a good deal. Personally my only complaint is that the computer in the lobby was out of order too much. I suppose I could compain a bit about the bed not being smooth, but then neither are those of friends and family whom I visit. Those who have trouble with stairs should avoid this hotel unless they can be assurred that they will have a room on the first floor;however, they must keep in mind that you mush walk up a half flight of stairs from the street level to reach the lobby. The rooms are not spacious, but you are not paying spacious prices.My travelling friend was not happy with the lack of a parking lot near the hotel, which is not the hotel's fault. Yet, she was pleased enough with the hotel that she booked the same unit for another week after I had to leave. This hotel is a good deal and I will be staying there in 2009. J. M.

I walked passed this hotel and went in to enquire about a room. First of all let me say that this hotel is cheap (about CDN 40 a night for a single room with own bathroom) - in fact a local (who is a travel agent) advised me that this is probably the cheapest hotel in Vancouver. The location is also excellent. However, I did not end up booking this hotel for a few key reasons: 1) As a woman travelling alone, it just did not feel safe. I felt fine walking around the streets at night, so it was not the area. The hotel is dark and old and had a seedy atmosphere. 2) The ambiance of the hotel was bleak and depressing. If you are a traveller who will just use your room to sleep and have a quick shower, you will probably find this OK. But if you are a traveller who likes to relax in your room, watch TV, have a leisurely bath etc do yourself a favour and go to either the Listel or Blue Horizon up the road. 3) The gentleman at the front desk was most peculiar. He had a very fussy manner and did not exactly put you at ease. When I inspected the rooms, I tested the hardness of the bed by sitting on it and he chucked it and spent about 2 mins smoothing out non-existence wrinkles - you think he was running a 5 star joint the way he carried on. Also, one of the rooms I saw had the sink bedside the bed (eventhough there was a separate bathroom) - I find this kind of strange.

There was a bathroom with bath and shower, toilet and washbasin. In the living room, we found a fireplace, TV, writing desk, fridge and large leather sofa. We felt safe and secure for the two nights we spent in Vancouver before we picked up the hire car.There were also tea and coffee making facilities. Breakfast was available for a small charge and not free as I believe was previously stated on the website. The reception desk was also manned 24 hours.
