The hotel is in a very good location considering its proximity to Spinneys supermarket, metro, Karama....and if you are driving, quite accessible to a lot of destinations. We got the ne bedroom unit as we have a 1.5 y/o toddler with us. The space was great for her to run around. The dvd player was a big help to keep her busy and the kitchen was really convenient. Downside during our stay was that over the 11 nights we stayed, we did not get the cot we requested for. The bathroom is in need of some update and house keeping will need to vacuum everyday if you have little ones. Sound insulation was very good so our baby slept in the room peacefullly while we entertain guests in the living room. Staff was very friendly and helpful even if they were running a full hotel since it was Dubai Shopping Festival time. Breakfast was okay since it came with our room package. Very basic food and buffet selection doesnt change much...i am not complaining about it but hubby got tired of the food. Thankfully, Spinneys is just round the corner and they have McDonalds, Fiesta Cafe and Max's Restaurant. We rented a car and found out that they do have very good free parking space at the hotel basement. We always managed to get a slot right next to the entrance. Friends who visited us also got to enjoy free parking.

The breakfast spread - is lovely and all is so well-co-ordinated by the breakfast room supervisor/manager( Manav).

A 3* Hotel-Apartment which is well maintained and in an excellent location, close to mega supermarket Spinneys and Centre Point. Location:. Located on Kuwait Street, this Hotel Apartment is right behind Burjuman Shopping Centre (A good landmark to mention to cab drivers). The back entrance of this Apartment Hotel leads you to a short walk where shops such as McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Baskins, Centre Point, Burjuman Shopping Mall, Spinneys and various other restaurants within a easy reach. Room: We had booked a studio apartment as had our 1.5 yr old with us. A cot was provided and the size of the room is large and spacious. As you enter the room you have a basin, cupboards and 2 hot plates on your left. There is a washer-dryer machine as well as small fridge freezer and a microwave-cooker. On the right of the corridor is the wc/bathroom which has a shower. Bathroom was clean and not exactly new but clean nevertheless. The room itself contained wall-ceiling storage cupboards, a king size bed, a huge 32' flat screen on the wall, dressing table and 2 sofa chairs with a small table. Plenty of drawer space and Ironing Board/Iron provided as well. A very impressive range of various cutlery from plates, bowls, mugs etc are provided for light cooking only which came in handy for us to make some boiled vegetables for our toddler. A window that looked out to nearby buildings and could also be opened up if needed. AC/Heater had various settings and separate hot water switch controlled hot water for the room. Washing machine/dryer was perfect and came in handy to get all our clothes cleaned before going back home as we just ran it while we were out and about. A good size electronic safe was also inside the room which was very useful and had easy password pin protected number facility. Room is cleaned daily and towels also changed daily if kept on the floor. Pictures of the room are uploaded. Breakfast: Breakfast was provided daily at the ground floor from 7AM to 10:30AM. Breakfast was a modest affair but more than adequate. A tea/coffee machine was available. Masalla tea or tea bags/hot water available. Bread, croissants and cakes available with butter/jam and a selection of fruit such as apples, oranges and bananas. A commercial toaster to toast bread was available but you had to out you bread twice to get it toasted properly. Other hot food available such as boiled eggs, scramble eggs, chips, beans, roti, French toast and at times curries (yes.. for breakfast to cater for the Indian guests) The best part of breakfast was eggs could be ordered as required i.e omelettes, sunny side up, omelettes with vegetables would be made fresh in the kitchen and brought out within a few minutes. We were told porridge was also available. We were a little surprised that no high chairs were available which is something we found in other hotels - so we could not make our little one sit with us and that annoyed him. Summary: Hotel was in an excellent location in Karama, a stone throw away from Meena Bazaar and Burjuman Shopping Centre. 20 mins away from the airport and cabs charged us 22 dirhams. Distance to Bar Dubai Gold Soukh was long but only due to crazy traffic. I am told they are in the process of extending the Dubai Metro train to the Gold Souk but will take time. It was a relief to walk for 7 mins and have Spinneys which practically contained anything you could get in the UK at UK prices!

There was also a washing machine although I did not use it. The ensuite was quite acceptable. The staff were friendly and always helpful courteous. It was close to a future metro stop and within a moderate walk to an open station near the Burjuman Shopping Centre. For a budget hotel it was good value for money.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Yum1", "ReviewID": "UR37322992", "Content": "I stayed for 7 nights at the Belvedere Court Apartments from 18 Jul - 25 Jul 09. It was offered to me by a Dubai Tour Operator and after reading reviews on tripadvisor regarding this hotel, I didn't think twice about booking it. It was affordable, perfectly situated ie close to Karama Shopping area, Beach and Spinneys Supermarket is also within walking distance. Service was excellent, although having said this, I think that the restaurant staff could do with a little more training in that on at least 3 occassions, there was a shortage of glasses for the juice, and the hotel wasn't that full at the time. Guests had to ask for the glasses. What I also found a little unprofessional was the fact that the porridge was re-filled into the bowls in full view of guests .... would have been better if the waiter took the bowls into the kitchen, filled them there and then brought them out again. Other than this, I'd definitely recommend this hotel, rooms are spacious and the bed is HUGE. Every room is equipped with tea/coffee making facilities and a little kitchenette which includes microwave, fridge, cutlery & washing machine. There's also a bus stop across the road .. bus trips are cheap and buses come along frequently on this road. Alternatively, if you're returning from somewhere, you should ask the bus driver to drop you off at Big Spinneys (there's a few and we weren't aware of this until a taxi driver dropped us off at a different Spinneys) or Burjuman Centre....these are the landmarks close to the hotel from where you can walk.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 Dubai", "Title": "\u201cPerfect !\u201d", "Author": "jinx4384", "ReviewID": "UR26365280", "Content": "I've been in Dubai since January for business and will stay until end July.

Breakfast was served in a lounge and plenty were having it but I had breakfast meetings all week so did not indulge myself. No room service but the reception had take away menus which you could have delivered to the room. Very nice pool on the rooftop with sun loungers.
