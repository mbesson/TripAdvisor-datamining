Anyway, I paid for a studio unit for two nights, and when I got to the hotel, there were none left, so they upgraded me to a one bedroom suite on the roof of the building, with a huge lounge, kitchen with laundry, and two bathrooms. I felt bad for taking it, as I'm sure there were families who were slumming it in 1 bedroom apartments. Anyway, the pool was ok, a little dusty and in need of a clean up there. Ok location.

This is definitely not a 4 star. Its ambience is not.Facilities probably are. Room was clean and nicely furnished. Pots/utensils in kitchen were old and worn and didnt feel like using them. Breakfast just about ok.u get eggs/toast/jam/cereals/muffins etc. breakfast area has only 6 tables Room has a balcony. All in all was very good for the price we stayed there. again depends which room you get , and in which block A or B. The reception desk is in block A, rooms in this block are probably better maintained than the ones in B. Expect a 3 star and you wont be disappointed. Finding the hotel is pretty easy, all u have to tell the driver is near richmond hotel. Once there you wont miss it, its opposite a mosque. \"We were never disturbed by the noise as some people claim \" Our experience was spoiled by the hotel reception, who on our arrival said there was no room available so he would have to move us to Deira side of Dubai in a deluxe room. I refused because I knew in Dubai, most to see or to do was in Bur Dubai, not in Diera. He then kept us waiting for 30 mins and said a room (1bedroom) was now available. He sent us to block B. On entering the room, it turned out to be studio (not 1 bedroom) and I was really upset. Also the room didnt look very good. Went back to the reception and said we would in no way accept a studio when we had booked a 1 bed. He then said he would move us to a 2 bed room instead (NOTE THAT : from NO ROOM available, this guy now had a studio and 2 bedroom available , hah! ). He made us wait another 30 mins and finally said he had a 1 bedroom available so we would move there (NOTE: from no rooms to studio, 1 bed, 2 bed, everything was suddenly available) So almost after an hour, we finally moved to a 1 bedroom in block A, which was well kept and overall we enjoyed there. Again,for the price we paid, it was very very good. We booked via wwww.ebookers.com. This website and www.asiahotels.com had the same price.

I was in a one bedroom apartment, though I only paid for a studio. The apartment was massive, with 2 big bathrooms, fully equipped kitchen (washing machine!), and massive living room. The d\u00e9cor is modern chic. The hotel swimming pool is on the small side but perfectly adequate for refreshing dip, and there is a gym with dedicated hours for women only. The bed was extremely comfortable and room service was fine. Generally the hotel seemed very quiet, there is a masjid (mosque) across the street so I did hear the 5am call for prayer, but this is an Islamic country so you will hear that wherever you are. It only lasted for a short time though and then it was back to being quiet again. Breakfast was included in the rate and it was good. A choice of various hot items plus toast, fruit and pastries will keep most people happy and they change the selection daily. The staff were very friendly and helpful. One downside is that you have to pay for internet and local calls, but I have been told this is the case across Dubai. There are some internet cafes where it is cheaper that Zagy\u2019s rate of 15 Dhs an hour. For example on Al-Mankhool road across from the wonderful Lebanese Village restaurant (I ate there most nights, reasonably priced, nice food and service) there is an internet cafe in the shopping centre across the street which is only 5Dhs an hour. The hotel is in Bur Dubai off the Mankhool road in a new subdivision. Buses run along Mankhool road, and once you figure out how to read the bus map (which is posted at most bus stops), they are a cheap way to get around for a flat fare of 2 Dirhams per bus ride. The other way to get around is by taxi, but they are frustratingly difficult to flag down on the street.

Our usual preference is 5* beach resorts but we needed to be in the City and the Zagy came up on ebookers at an excellent rate including flights with Royal Brunei. Admittedly went with reservations with it being a 4* hotel (in Dubai there's a big difference between 3-4* and 5* hotels). We were very pleasantly surprised. The location is away from the hustle & bustle so it can be touch and go getting a taxi, but on one occasion we were able to get one just as we came out and we got the number of one taxi driver who we got on with so every time we needed to go somewhere we arranged a time with him to pick us up outside - so that solved taxi problems. We got in very late evening and asked about an upgrade and we managed to haggle a bit and get it reduced. Their policy is to ask for a AED100 deposit for mini-bar which is returnable if you don't use anything. The hotel reception isn't grand at all, but the staff were very, very welcoming. And yes we can agree with the other reviewer about the lady from Africa, she is very helpful and we found the cleaning ladies very cheerful on the whole. One small point is they don't wash up your dishes when they clean the room. The wi-fi is very quick, easy to get on to and a real bonus that you can access from the rooms as the 'business centre' is really only two terminals just past reception by the lifts. It's AED15/hr which is expensive compared to around AED5/hr at internet cafes, but hotels are always more expensive and you can log in and out as many times as you need to until your hour is used up. The hotel has two buildings A & B, both have got pools, but A's got the Gym and B's got the restaurant. We were in building A so going for breakfast meant going next door, but they're happy for you to call, place your order and will bring breakfast to your room for no extra charge (our rate also included breakfast daily). The restaurant is tiny but they have an acceptable range on offer for breakfast that can really set you up for the day. The 2-bed room suite was brilliant. Very spacious; modern; comfortable; good climate control, BIG kitchen - what they referred to as the mini-bar is a full sized fridge-freezer! The only negative points were that the room was short on some of the crockery/cutlery but we mostly ate out so didn't miss them but advised the hotel when we first got to the room to avoid problems later. There was also some advertised things missing - no in-room safe, bathrobes or shower curtain in one bathroom, but these things were all sorted out efficiently and quickly. We came across quite a few dust balls around the rooms, but generally the rooms were very clean. The morning call to prayer from the Mosque opposite is quite loud, so maybe ask for a room at the other side of the hotel. All in all we found very little fault with the accommodation and we found it a very acceptable alternative to our normal hotel choices, so much so that if we opt to stay in the city again, we would definitely go back there.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cValue For Money\u201d", "Author": "AkshaySharma", "ReviewID": "UR22369880", "Content": "Being a travel agent, we had got a fantastic deal of INR 5945/- per person including taxes for DEL-DXB-DEL ticket which I got booked or my wife and myself.

The hotel is located on a quiet street right opposite to a mosque. The suite that we were given had 2 spacious bedroooms, a dining table, a sitting area, 2 attached bathrooms and a fully equipped kitchen. All in all, it was very good apartment. The swimimg pool, which is located on the rooftop, had very cold water. The breakfast was average or probably below average in my opinion. There is vegetarian restaurant about 5 mins walk and a supermarket about 3 mins walk from the hotel.Overall, it was a value for money deal and if I were to go back, I would like to stay there again.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cClean and safe - Was lucky to find this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "ManifestStefany", "ReviewID": "UR21498162", "Content": "The hotel itself is lovely and in a safe area. There is a Mosque across the parking lot so be ready to wake up at 5am! There is also a grocery store behind the Mosque. Very convenient for quick trips. DO NOT USE the hotel cab. You will be charged triple the rate or more. They seem to make it up as they go along. Just go to the main street and get a cab. Not always easy but it's worth the saving. On my last day, they tried to charge me 100 dirhams for a 25 dirham trip to the airport. Also, their drivers are not always knowledgeable of Dubai. My last driver was so unsafe and new to Dubai and driving , I didn't think I was going to make it to my destination. In fact, I was very late - to the Burj Al Arab. One of the most famous hotel in the region and a cabbie can't find it? Give me a break! There are 2 gyms and 2 pools. One was working when I was there and the Gyms are a little frustrating in that you have to call to have them unlock the door even during gym hours. But it is very clean and the equipment is good. The free breakfast is pretty good. A mix of Middle eastern and Indian food. Also traditional eggs and toast options The staff in the coffee shop are very nice! As is the nice man who cleans the rooms and the lady who operates the gyms. If there is anything you need, be sure to ask the wonderful Kenyan lady on the day shift. Avaoind the male evening staff. She is the most knowledgeable and honest person there. Her prices were always fair and correct and you never felt she was cheating you. She was a pleasure! All in all, I enjoyed my stay. I loved the room ( has a washer dryer + full kitchen!!!!) and I would absolutely recommend it to others. Like anywhere, there are small annoyances to be aware of but the hotel over all is great.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Zagy Arabian Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1078457-Reviews-Zagy_Arabian_Suites-Dubai.html", "Price": "$68 - $299*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">PO Box 28120</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1078457", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b0/47/b0471a6378f1d40d8e7bf1d2fb9291863large.jpg"}}
