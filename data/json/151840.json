The staff at the Hotel always has been very helpful and caring. We spend Friday afternoon at Culebritas Island, and they made all the arrangements with the water taxi. We enjoy a delicious Caribbean Lobster that night at the Hotel restaurant. They also have a delicious breakfast. On Saturday morning we took the complimentary kayaks and make it to Dakiti, where we enjoy the beach and the gorgeous view.

In his free time, Dave organized a trip for the hotel's guests to the small and amazingly beautiful cayo just outside of the island's bay.

When I asked why my room had been double booked, the front desk person simply unapologetically replied, \"it happens alot\". This was the first red flag during our stay.The room was prepaid, so I decided to make the best of it, as I knew that they weren't going to offer a refund. On the day that we switched rooms, we waited until noon to get the key to our Deluxe room, but the counter person kept telling us that it wasn't ready and she couldn't give us the new key. We informed her that we would be out until later that evening, and she simply told us to check in at the office at that time. When we returned at 7pm, there was nobody in site. The three phone numbers listed at the front desk went unanswered. They didn't even leave a note on the desk informing us where to get the key. We finally decided to look in the desk drawer, and by chance, found an extra copy of the key to our room. After two hours of searching for a staff worker, making phone calls, and simply waiting in our Jeep, we were finally able to get in our room. We later found out that the property manager had our copy of the key and we were somehow, telepathically supposed to know who he was and where he lived. The next morning we brought this up to the counter lady, and she once again was very dismissive, and once again, NO apology. Cleaning service was sub-par. Floors were left unswept, room trash can was not emptied. The room door fit poorly on the frame, leaving 1/4 inch gaps under the door, where huge roaches and one scorpion crawled in through. We had to cover the gaps with folded towels. They mentioned that they offer wi-fi, but they didn't mention that we would need to leave our villa and walk down to the office to get any sort of decent wifi signal. We ordered the boxed lunch (turkey rap), and were disappointed when we took the food out of the cooler. It was wrapped in Saran wrap and the water had seeped right through, making it a mushy inedible sloppy mess. We returned the cooler with the wraps, and they once again brushed it off with no apology, yet still charged me $36 for the meal. The audacity of these people! Club Seabourne is nothing but a sham. Their glitzy, photoshopped website photos are just a facade. The staff is very unprofessional, irresponsible and just plain rude. I've stayed at Culebra Beach Villas, and Hotel Kokomo in the past. Had I known what I was in for, I would have stayed at either one instead. They're more rustic in style, but you get what you pay for, plus the staff is courteous and attentive. I don't ask for much when I stay at a hotel. I simply want honesty, cleanliness, a good value, and decent service, neither of which were offered at Club Seabourne. Please stay away from this place.

We would definitely recommend Club Seabourne for either the perfect beach/island vacation or wedding (or other event). Getting to Culebra may be a deterrent for those who are more used to direct airport to resort, but for more well rounded travelers you can either get their by a small plane, or by getting to Fajardo and taking the ferry (approx. 1.5 hr ferry ride). They pick you up at the ferry dock so you don't have to worry about transportation on the island, but you can also rent a golf-cart or Jeep to get around on your own. Stay packages can include free bikes for guest use, and breakfast and coffee in the morning, which is a bonus since a lot of the restaurants on the island definitely have the laid back beach island mentality of closing when they want or need to.

This resort is located on the hill side a few miles outside of town and from the local airport - by Fulladosa Bay & a dock where some guests will park their boats if they arrive this way. Otherwise there are two more traditional ways to get to Culebra Island; by mini plane from San Juan or Cieba or ferry from Fajardo. Club Seaborne offers regular hotel rooms in the main building and cottages on the hill side at a premium price. Both times I have opted to pay a bit more and get a cottage with a balcony and views over Fulladosa Bay. We stayed here again in July, last month after I had spoken to Linda from the front office in order to tailor the perfect package for my family which by the way she did a great job of doing! They have many different packages to choose from based on the guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest. Our package included welcome amenities and breakfast, (which is a la carte in the restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and very good food/hot menu selections). We also had the use of mountain bikes which we loved so we could ride into town and eat lunch and we had the use of beach towels which also came in handy the day we went to Flamenco Beach. All the cottages were remodeled and all had nice new king size beds with bamboo posts, contemporary d\u00c3\u00a9cor and bathroom re-done in a natural stone with oversize showerheads etc. A/C, safe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s & mini refrigerators were also in the cottages and along with the king size bed new pull out sofa beds. I believe the regular hotel rooms were remodeled as well. The outside area between the cottages was nicely kept with cut grass, walk ways, palm trees and the area is lit up at night. Once we got to the island the Club Seabourne driver picked us up in the hotel van; he was a very nice man who answered all our questions with the most sincerity. The restaurant was re-furbished; we saw new local art pieces on the walls and the restaurant manager was present for both breakfast and dinner service. Since I was there last time the resort has established quite the wine cellar which is not something you expect on such a small island; as a matter of fact it is even hard to find a restaurant with a good wine selections on the main land of Puerto Rico. The night we ate in the restaurant it was packed - still service was impeccable. The manager suggested a wonderful sauvignon blanc for me to go with the Paella we ordered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a perfect pairing. We also had a nice platter of islands appetizers including mini empanadas and conk, a tasty salad & the best home made lemon tart with vanilla ice cream. We saw many other appetizing dishes being served that evening including lobsters, steaks, whole fish etc. This seem to be the only upscale restaurant on this island so guest who are not staying at the resort will got here for a nice dinner. Club Seaborne has one of the two pools to be found on the island and it is very well maintained along with the lounge area by the pool and the pool bar where I got the best mojito I have probably had in my life. The bartender was great and there were not a drink he could not mix; my mojito - he took some time making with fresh mint, cane sugar and local rum, crushed ice. (Things take bit longer on this island but is all worth the wait).

First of all I will say that if you are looking for a resort, you will not find it in Culebra. That was part of the reason we went. We wanted a laid back place where our kids, ages 7 and 5 yr old twins could snorkel off of the beaches without paying high prices for a boat, when we weren't even sure that they would be game for going. Culebra was perfect for them. I also would say, from what I saw this is probablly the best hotel to stay in on the island. The hotel is in a nice location. Close to Dewey and not too far from the beaches. The pool was great after a day at the beach or snorkeling for the kids to wind down after a long day. They enjoyed seeing chickens and lizards around. We stayed in the family suite which had a queen, 2 twins and a sleeper sofa. The beds were comfortable. They could use some new pillows but I thought for a family of 5, the price we paid was fair. The room was not the cleanest but really, we were just there just to sleep, were out most of the day and the amount of sand my kids tracked in each day, even if it was spotless, it wouldn't stay that way for long. The staff was attentive. Our air conditioner stopped working one evening. I mentioned it to the owner in the morning and it was fixed by the time we returned in the afternoon. There were ceiling fans in each room so we weren't uncomfortable even without it for a night. The fact that breakfast was included was great. It's not at other hotels we looked at. One complaint about breakfast was that it didn't open until 8:30, my kids were used to eating at 7am at home, but again, really, do we need to be at the beach baking in the sun that early each day, probably not. So it worked for us. The biggest let down for us was the restaurant. We ate there the first night but not again for dinner. The kids meals were $10 each for basically a box of Kraft mac and cheese EACH, huge portions, but I would have been happy with half the amount for 1/2 to 3/4 of the price. I ordered scallops which were way overcooked. My husband had issues with his fish but he wasn't expecting the WHOLE fish, so that was just a cultural issue, not Club Seabourne's. The next day at breakfast I ordered an omelette, again, way overcooked and the rest of the family had pancakes, some burned. From that day on we ordered the continental breakfast which was fine but we were served burnt toast 5 out of 6 days, which were more like croutons. lol I think if they stopped overcooking the food the restaurant might be quite good. Also if you are a tea drinker you are better off bringing your own. We ended up eating 3 nights at Baha Marina's restaurant which was fine and 3 night at El Eden, which we LOVED. Best Mahi Mahi I have ever had. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to people, just don't expect a 5 star hotel where you are pampered and there are staff around to cater to you. As I stated earlier, I think it is the best you will get on the island, and I was happy with our decision of staying here.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean Springs, MS", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property, nice amenities, overall would recommend\u201d", "Author": "nmgirl87", "ReviewID": "UR115845372", "Content": "Overall I would recommend Club Seabourne to others staying in Culebra. The property was very beautiful and well kept, it was nice to have a pool there after a long day of snorkeling. The service was great when we first got there, enjoyed the a la carte breakfast very much and especially enjoyed the bushwackers at the bar in the afternoons made by friendly Joe. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice. My husband had fun feeding the chickens that roamed the grounds. I enjoyed sitting on the balcony and seeing the view of the bay. I thought the location was good and I actually walked to the pretty, rocky, beach at Punta Soldado which was a nice snorkel spot and excellent place to watch the sunset. A bit of a hike but a short ride in the car. Unfortunately we did not eat dinner there, had waited until our last night and the restaurant was closed - poor planning on our part. There were a few problems, but overall I would rate this stay as a positive experience. When we first arrived we noticed our shower had a loose piece of slate that could have fallen and shattered so we notified the front desk and they removed it but didn't fix it while we were there. Overall the service was excellent but when we were getting ready to check out there was no one at the front desk, they were gone to buy fruit for the breakfast...we made it to the airport on time though. We stayed through Tuesday and definitely noticed a decline in service after the weekend when it was busier.

The restaurant food was very tasty but service was lacking. It took 30 minutes for us to get our drinks and the food took over an hour. Breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, was fine but even here, the staff had issues. They could not agree if the plate of fruit was included in the pricing (no issue like this the day before). We booked a trip to Culebrita through the hotel. Our ride arrive an hour late. Although this is not their fault, the hotel staff couldn't figure out who they had called. In the end, things worked out but in the end we learned of other boat captains that provided service to Culebrita (while waiting on the dock, they kept coming back and forth).

There is a certain tranquility and peace at Club Seabourne that hypnotizes. Something I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain or blame on the fact that we were coming in from a blizzard in New York. At the hotel they were nice enough to let us check in early without an extra charge...We were so enthralled by how calming and pretty the place was that we didn't make a big fuss about the patio table in our room plus Carlos, the gentleman that checked us in, warned us that they were not expecting us so early and were still painting the balcony, thus the table and chair inside our room. We immediately changed into our swimwear and drove off to Flamenco beach (by the way, YES rent a car!! The hotel rate includes a bike for an hour...but trust me the roads are somewhat crazy and tricky and you don't want to bike it anywhere!). The car ride to Flamenco was about 10-15. The minute we arrived at Flamenco and saw its light turquoise blue waters that same thought came over me again: \"I don't want to leave\"....It is one of the most breathtaking and beautiful places you will ever see. However, believe it or not Zoni beach is even more beautiful. The next day driving back from Zoni, Flamenco and Tamarindo beach we kept going straight past Club Seabourne to Punta Soldado beach (about 5 mins from the hotel, and good for snorkeling)....just in time to catch the sun setting. We were the only ones on the beach...and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the beauties of Culebra, it is small and intimate. Ok now back to the hotel. Overall Club Seabourne is a beautiful, quiet and private place. We actually looked forward coming back to the hotel at the end of the day because we knew we could have a good time just lounging on a hammock by the pool (open all night) or on our balcony.

A quick note on how we got there, Jet Blue flight to San Juan about $150 return from Orlando. $20 taxi ride from SJU to Isla Grande airport to get the Air Flamenco -rollacoaster-great fun -Islander flight to the island. These were $105 return which we booked by phone from the UK as they don't do internet bookings. We got charged for overweight cases but this isn't in the same league as Ryanair and we were only billed about $20. We found the room to be very clean, with TV, music system, small fridge but curiously no coffee maker! The price for the hotel was quite expensive when compared to prices in PR and Florida but I guess most things are more expensive on the island(food in the supermarket, car rental etc). Breakfast was very nice, and plenty of it, fresh fruit, bread, rolls, juice, coffee etc, and we had 1 dinner at the restaurant which was very nice(a little pricey though). One of the other reviews prepared us for the restaurant closing on Mon /Tue and if you haven't brought food you'll starve! Seriously though, you have to back into town to sort some food out and your options are a little limited there. Yes it is quite a long way (not walkable) from the only town so we felt a car rental was needed but taxis are an option. I can see why some reviews mention lack of staff but, as we like being left alone, it was perfect for us. They picked us up from the airport and when we saw that we needed a jeep took us back to get one. All the staff we saw were extremely pleasant and helpful. If you like a laid back vibe, little night life and to be left alone then you'll find the island fantastic! The weather in May was great, very hot and only 1 afternoon when it rained, so we were amazed to find about 15 people on Flamenco Beach and the most we counted on Rosario beach was 10. I know it was their slower season but at times it felt like we were the only people on the beaches. The day we went to Zoni we WERE the only people on the beach. We like to snorkel and found Rosario to be the best with the reef literally 10 feet off the beach. A good selection of Parrotfish, rays, coral etc, etc. Flamenco is a great beach with good snorkelling up by the old tank and great fun messing around in the waves at the centre of the beach(but be careful, these waves can hurt!!). Melones wasn't too bad for snorkelling either. We didn't get see all the snorkelling places but its a place that we would definitely go back to to explore the rest..

The good: nice pool, good location, nice grounds. Breakfast in the AM is basic continental, but was fine for us. They picked us up promptly in Dewey upon arrival.

There is a road nearby that has a bit of local traffic you'll hear, and some dogs and roosters in the neighborhood (but that's anywhere in Culebra). Restaurant is expensive, but my partner is still raving about the filet mignon there, so I'd say they did the job food-wise (service was just ok). The mojitos at the bar were amazing!!! The not so good: Staff was helpful and friendly when they could be found. There isn't an overabundance of staff, so you need to be patient sometimes or go looking for someone if you need something. Restaurant and bar are closed Monday and Tues. (we were there Sun. thru Wed. AM). We turned down the A/C one night and got wet as the unit dripped like mad. Had to get beach towels from the desk clerk to mop up. Satellite TV was sort of tough to figure out and the CD player in the room had a mind of it's own. Also, the mat in the living room area was most uncomfortable to walk on without shoes on. The bed was acceptable to me, but my partner wasn't too happy. It's a decent place - we felt some of these negative reviews were harsh compared to our experience, which was pleasant enough. Not sure we'd go back - Bahia Marina just up the road was about $40 cheaper per night and the rooms looked like they were better appointed.

We spent three days and two nights on the charming island of Culebra. Our friends had honeymooned at this property and highly recommended it. Our large one-room villa had a small porch overlooking the water. It was almost like being in a secluded resort. The pool was nice; the restaurant was pretty great as well, though we only at there one night. A few notes about Culebra--be prepared for roosters to wake you up at dawn, and then keep cock-a-doodle-dooing for a couple more hours. You get used to it, but being a city girl myself, I was not prepared. Also, I highly recommend renting a Jeep from Carlos' Jeep Rental. It's located right in the teensy-tiny airport and it's the best way to see this gem of an island. Also, be prepared for a restaurant to not have a dish you order--it's just the nature of being on an island. Sometimes your entree ingredients are on a ship that won't arrive for two more days...such is island life. There are a handful of restaurants on the island that I recommend exploring, including the Blue Iguana and Dinghy Dock. I think we ate at the Dock three or so times. It's right on the water and boats pull up throughout the day. I would also take some time to explore all of the beaches on the island. Zoni is by far the best, though others will try to tell you Playa Flamenco is number one. Don't listen! Zoni has beautiful white sand and was virtually empty when we were there.

It was very evident they didn't bother to clean up. The bathroom and the entire floor of the room was filthy (lizard poop, cockroach parts, disgusting!) The bathroom curtain was filled with mildew and the shower was approximately 2 feet wide; the wall of the shower was gooped with silicone to seal (without accomplishing it) the crack (2 inches) between the floor and wall. Needless to say with such little space we had to shower moving as little as possible; water pressure terrible too. Need of major remodeling.

Yes this place is not a five start hotel but it's abot the same quality that the rest of the hotels on the island provide except that's it's much more romantic. Carribean decor, island colors, our room was very spacious, had a couch, nice touches such as turtle book ends, wooden birdcage. Some evidence of disrepair with occasional paint chipping off, patched up screens, the bathroom needs a little work. The public rooms are all in great shape, awesome outdoor bar, romantic restaurant, the service was excellent, and the food was good. The pool was clean, no odor like some of the reviewers noted. The grounds are well maintained as you can see by well groomed palm trees. A bunch of humming birds were having feast around our villa's flowers. After a few drinks at the bar we had our third and final dinner on the island. It didn't dissapoint. After the dinner we hung out on the hammock by the pool looking at the starry sky nicely framed by the palm trees. I would recommend this place for a romantic getaway any time, but don't be shocked if this is not a five star experience, nothing on the island is, because when you travel to Culebra not only you \"get away from it all\" but you also step back in time where not everything is quite up to the Western standards, but that's what makes the island authentic.

We knew going in that the island was very casual and laid back, so we were not expecting luxury accommodations, but through some web work, we found Club Seabourne. Their website sells you on the promise of a higher end experience and accommodation. Our family of four decided on their Family Villa, at a cost of a whopping $320 per night (2-3 times the average rate on the island). At that price, it has to be good right? Boy, were we wrong. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153villa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was located in the parking lot (something that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the photos on the website), and it was so tiny there was no room to walk once we put down our bags. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unpack, because there were no closets or dressers to put our things. We immediately went to the hotel staff to ask for another room, but the other rooms were not only booked, but smaller than the place we had. In fairness, the staff person was very nice, and gave us no problem when we immediately checked out. The remainder of our first day was spent looking for other accommodations, which was looking pretty bleak until we stumbled upon a place relatively newly opened just up the road called the Bahia Marina resort. What an awesome place. First only $150 a night for a spacious two room fully air conditioned place complete with full size fridge, microwave and stove. All new appliances. Two queen beds in the BR and a fold out couch if you need it in the LR. 2 Full Baths, and a spectacular view of the Bay. Top it off with a great simming pool, a full service restaurant/bar and truly warm and accommodating staff. Our vacation went from hell to bliss in the turn of a key. We loved it so much we extended our trip by a day, with dreams of chucking it all to stay forever. Jeep rental is key\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well worth it.

Entrees were $20-$30 and the only seafood on the menu was frozen lobster tails that were broiled, hard and over seasoned, or lobster rice with bits of the aforementioned lobster and tons of uninspired rice. Service was good, but the food way overpriced for what it was. We did find, the hands down best dining experience on the island on our last night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Juanita Banannas ----------------. Incredible atmosphere and views only topped but the menu and service. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BYOB, so the emphasis is on the food.
