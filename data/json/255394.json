The hotel was very clean and easy to find. Room service was really nice and offered a few types of pillows for us to use at no extra cost. The room was a little small, but not to small...so me and my wife fit pretty well. i was there during Mardi Gras so at night it got kinda loud out on the street, im not sure if it is like that just for Mardi Gras or if its always like that. Also on the next street over there are alot of sex shops and strip places, which did not bother me and the wife, but if we had kids, i would not want them walking down that street, so families keep that in mind. That being said the Subway (Kings Cross) is directly next door, and i mean directly....so its really really close. Also there is a shopping center with a grocery store (Coles), subway and an internet cafe across the street. Also alot of food options are near, so that was nice. All around a good hotel, i will come back. i also ran into the band Switchfoot in the lobby, they were staying there as well, so that was cool. As far internet, the guy at the front desk told me it was pretty expansive in room, but everyday they give 20 mins of free wifi in the lobby per device. So seeing as though i brought two tablets and one cell phone, i got an hour free internet each day. Just don't try to upload pics on the free 20 mins, you only have a limited supply of MBs and once that's used up, free time is over even if you still have mins left.

There is a complex charging structure based on minutes on line with a max. daily charge but also a download limit - all way to complicated for a short stay when many international hotels provide this kind of thing for a nominal daily charge or nothing.

I stay in many 5 and 4 star hotels, at least 60 to100 room nights a year .( i travel on vacation for at least 3 to 4 months of year .And this is one hotel that continually gives me good memories of its good location ,and room layout. Shame you cant get rid of the noisy bird outside the window, But they do not destroy your stay , to many possitives to make up for nature . For me the hotel feels like home, and thats important for me as i spend so many nights on vacation each year . sadly the only thing lacking that i need ,and becomes the norm in most overseas hotels that i stay in now, Is FREE IN ROOM INTERNET , so can keep up with my business and friends whislt on holiday", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cGood locale - great value\u201d", "Author": "Hulinea", "ReviewID": "UR39407852", "Content": "We have just returned from two nights staying at this Hotel.

I called and then they made a debit to my creditcard, but as you know the CC company only debits it one month later! very annoying.

Especially Hugh! and Nick and Daniel also do their best to keep you happy. If their manager ever reads this, then you should give Hugh a raise cause he really makes you feel welcome.

Another benefit of staying at the hotel is that the King's Cross rail station is just a few steps away.

After more than 20 hours of flights, I arrived in Sydney in the early morning jet-lagged and tired. After inquiring, I was directed to a bus outside that took us to the Central CityRail station free of charge. From there, I took the CityRail to the Kings Cross station. It turns out the Holiday Inn is less than a 30-seconds walk after getting out of the station. Really could not be closer or more convenient. It was 1030 in the morning and I was expecting to just drop off my luggage and returning later to check-in. Kimberly, working the front desk, immediately checked and told me that my room was ready for me. What a surprise and without prompting on my part. Also without any prompting from me, she asked if I would like a late check-out as late as 2 PM. Wow! Then I was asked for my newspaper preference in the morning. Maybe from a 5-star property but I didn't expect this from a Holiday Inn. So I checked in to my room at 1030 AM. Even though my room was only on the 2nd floor, I had a nice view of the Harbor Bridge and the Opera House. I imagine the view from the upper floors would be even better. Definitely get a room with the harbor view rather than the street view. Later that night I heard noises and looked out the window to see a fireworks show near the Harbor Bridge. Another nice bonus surprise. The room itself was spacious and clean with modern furnishings. If I want to nit-pick, the carpet had some stains. O/W I was pleased with everything else. I went downstairs to look for the business center and could not find it. Went looking down the wrong hallway and asked a cleaning lady who then walked me all the way to the computer terminals, she didn't just give me directions or point to its location. How's that for service. It costs A$5 for 15 minutes (or 30 minutes, I can't remember now). There was a small gym in the hotel but ask for the free pass to FitnessFirst that is located kind of kitty corner from the hotel. It's part of a chain of fitness clubs in Australia and has a nice variety of equipment. It's less than a minute walk from the hotel if not for the slow signal at the intersection. There was a restaurant in the hotel which I did not try but it looked nice. There were plenty of eating places nearby and with the CityRail station essentially right underneath the hotel, you could get all over the city easily. The hotel is close to the club area of Darlinghurst but I felt very safe. It's a bit more crowded and rowdy at night. Families with young children would likely avoid that area anyways. The immediate area surrounding the hotel and the short walk from the hotel to the CityRail station is perfectly safe for families.

It has nightclubs, strip clubs and fast food. The doors to all these places are open and the music blasts out onto the street. It gets quite seedy in this area and one that I found unsafe.

A lot quieter this time - previously we got a room near the lifts & it was noisier. As others mention, location is a big plus for this hotel. Right above Kings Cross Railway Station and within easy walk of lots of restaurants. We didn't walk far this time due to weather but used trains. Of course, not far (50 metres) from the start of the\"entertainment\" strip of Kings Cross, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your perspective - easy to avoid if you aren't interested. We left our car in their garage until 1pm after checking out (no additional parking fee - just the fee for the time we had been booked in), went back into city for some additional shopping time.

We were pleasantly surprised as the food both for breakfast and evening meal was very good and reasonably priced compared to some places we have stayed. Children eat free for both breakfast and evening meal, there is a childrens menu in the evening which you can choose from. They are also given coloured pencils so that they can draw on the paper tablecloths that are on each table, meaning that they do not get bored inbetween courses - a brilliant idea! Our son had great fun drawing all the things that he had seen that day. I would just mention that the hotel is not in Potts Point. It is in Kings Cross, right next to the station. Luckily we did not have any noise from the station, and it was very convenient for getting into the sights. It was also not far to walk with sore feet after pounding the pavements all day! Would recommend that you take a taxi from the airport - approx $35 for us, as the train cost about the same and involved a change of line, hassle you can do without when you are dragging suitcases around! If you wish to use the internet would advise you go to the backpackers travel agent across the road to the left of the hotel.
