Business suites\u201d", "Author": "Jster", "ReviewID": "UR120759712", "Content": "Recently stayed for two days at Candlewood Suites for a business trip. The room was about what you expect. The only real complaints were that the AC unit exuded a cigarette smell (easily cured with a Lysol spray) and some of the television channels were pretty fuzzy. My partner said his TV only received a few channels clearly, but he didn't really watch much. The bathroom floor could use a cleaning with bleach. The hotel as a whole is clean, has an honor-system \"Cupboard\" with snacks, frozen dinners, and drinks that is combined with a free laundry (accesible with the room card), a pool and hot tub, and an exercise room. The location is a bit of a problem as it is on the I17 frontage road. This means that north is the only direction you can go when leaving. To go south, you have to go north and back to the southbound side. The \"Enter\" sign is small and is obscured by landscaping shrubs until you are just at it. However, the hotel has access to the biking trail of a city park, which means that taking a walk for exercise or fresh air is just a matter of walking through the pool area and out a gate. Aside from traffic noise from the Interstate, it was pretty quiet. There are signs up all over announcing a renovation project scheduled to start in December 2011. The kitchenette was clean and had just about everything you might need in this sort of room.

If you like one, you'll probably like the other. As noted, there's no daily maid service (gee, just like home), but there were more than enough towels for three nights. And you can swap them out at the desk if you need replacements. I was upgraded (Priority Club) to a suite with a bedroom which was nice. The suite is large enough, with TVs in both rooms and a DVD/VCR combo in the living room. I borrowed a free movie from the front desk. Bed was comfy. The room also has a full-size refrigerator/freezer, very handy. Unlike Marriott, they don't offer free breakfast here, but you have a coffee maker, microwave and range top, along with a full set of dishes/silverware and a dishwasher. Check-in and out was easy. Everyone was friendly, and they graciously let me stay a bit later so that my computer wouldn't melt in the car (the Internet, by the way, is wired and very good). The location is on the side of I-17, but it was quiet. Didn't use the pool, but it looked clean. Free washing machines were handy, with mini detergent boxes available for purchase. I left before the Wed. night pizza party, but it sounded nice. One thing -- they have one of those sensors that knows when you leave and hikes the room temperature to 77. Yes, it's the wave of the future, and yes, they have to save electricity. But when it's 112 outside, it takes longer than the promised 15 minutes to returned to the desired 70.
