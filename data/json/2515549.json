I think some people fail to distiguish their ratings of a motel or resort. So in comparison to motels I give it a 3 because I have stayed at Quality Inns and Extended stays that are better (and worse) the Vagabond is right in the middle. PROS- Allow dogs and there are plenty of walking paths to walk the dog along the docks. You don't even have to cross a street to get to the docks and the walking path goes all the way to Liberty Station which has a HUGE off leash dog park. Also clean microwave and clean fridge although I couldn't get it past cool. They have ice machines. Rooms are big (@lst ours was) we stayed in 115 and were able to fit our bikes easily in the room. Bathroom is not tiny although you can't get ready at the same time it ok do your make up at the big vanity instead. Shower is tube/shower and the remodel is a thurogh improvement meaning not just new faucets the tile is all clean and tubs have no stains. Every light worked which is more than I can say for the Hyatt I stayed at a month ago. Also compared to the other hotels this location on a quieter street than Rosecreans is the best I don't regret picking this one almost souley base on the street location and light walking path by the marina. There is a little sandwich place along the marina where we picked up sammy's on our way to Liberty station dog park for a picnic. CONS- WiFi didn't work (refer to picture). Comforter had a hole right on top probably someone smoking burnt it. The furniture is chipped along with some wear on the wall paper. Ceiling is popcorn and we could get the door to lock so we only used the latchy thing. The sofa chair had a couple tears and looked 2nd hand meaning I wouldn't sit in it, but it did give my little dog a place besides the bed. Parking loat was full when we got back from dinner so we had to drive around the block and walk. The spots are small so my car did get hit, I saw it from my window and went over to see if their door left a mark but it didn't so I said it was ok. There is a bar across the street which is the latest night life within 4blocks kind of a dive but this isn't downtown. TIP- if you can pair your stay with a concert at Humphreys by the Bay you can walk. The Point Break has $2 pints everyday 4-6:30. Bring your bikes if you can, because you'll get to enjoy more of the trail sin Liberty Station. And easy ride to BevMo down the street.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGood Night Stay\u201d", "Author": "wildcatgrad07", "ReviewID": "UR119193728", "Content": "I got there late at night and got help right away.

The site advertises \"newly remodeled rooms\", however the rooms are old, small and dirty. Beer bottle caps found on floor in the room & someone else's hair in our unused towels. My husband and I wondered if the sheets were changed between guests. The TV picture was messed up. Very Noisy- you can hear anything from people flushing toilets to talking or watching tv in the next room. We were woken up at 2 am by a crowd of people yelling in the parking lot- one of them bragging about everything he had stollen that day. Called front desk, but noise level continued. The hotel offers free parking- but good luck finding it. There are limited spots in the crammed parking lot- my car was hit while parked there. The hotel site advertises heated pool- too cold for us! Site also advertised free breakfast which we were told upon arrival was a muffin and cup of coffee. On a good note: Decent location near- not on the water, Very close to the Airport, and only about 10 min to get to the Gaslamp Quarter. As far as dog friendliness- not very many places to walk puppy to do his business. I wouldn't pay more than $40 for a room here. BUT if you do stay here- stop by Mitches seafood for dinner.

The Vagabond Inn at Point Loma falls into the \"pot roast\" category - which can be great as long as you are expecting it. We stayed there for a couple of nights in early September and we found it entirely adequate, which is what we were paying for. here's what we got: 1) a clean, renovated bathroom - a bit small, but we didn't have any bathroom parties planned, so it wasn't a disappointment; 2) a smallish room with a view of a parking lot (but the bed was big and comfortable, and there was room to sort out our stuff - again, we didn't expect to be playing touch football in there); 3) a hard-working but functional refrigerator; 4) a television that probably worked but it didn't matter since we never turned it on; 5) a decent location close to the things that we wanted to see and do, with plenty of coffee shops, convenience stores and restauraunts within easy walking distance; 6) a pleasant desk attendant; 7) the \"free\" breakfast that you would expect - fruit, pastries, coffee and juice; 8) free parking; 9) a pool that we didn't use but which seemed clean and would have come in handy if it the weather had been hotter (we missed the heat wave by a week). Are there downsides? You bet. The room smelled damp and clammy when we arrived, but it improved when we turned on the A/C to get some circulation. The decor is somewhat dated and might come across as shabby, but it was clean and neat. The room WAS smallish, as I said - and with two big suitcases plus peripheral stuff we had to be judicious in how we spread ourselves around. That said, it was as big as most European hotel rooms that I have ever been in. The hotel is wedged between a busy fish market and the street, and the pool is street-side. But people were using and enjoying the pool, and the high fence between the pool deck and the street offers security if not privacy. Even though it seems like it would be a noisy place, it wasn't - at least, not when we stayed there. Don't go to the Vagabond Inn if you are looking for a high-end hotel experience. You won't get that. But if you are looking for a place that offers basic accommodation at a reasonable price, the Vagabond fits the bill.

My husband had booked the room online, and said it had gotten fairly good reviews, and since we were only going to be in the room for about 12 hours, a budget motel should be o.k. Upon first glance inside the room, everything looked 'o.k.' When I went to check out the bathroom, however, that's when my heart sank a bit. There was a bunch of hair stuck in the bathtub train, clearly visible, leading me to believe the room hadn't been cleaned. There was a yellow stain on the bath towel. I also was slightly horrified that there was a window at eye level in the bathroom, facing directly into the motel walkway. Now, this window was \"frosted\", but I could clearly see people when they would walk by, so I'm sure they could at least see me to some degree--very uncomfortable. There were stains on the walls; the carpet looked like it had not been vacuumed in a decade, and worst of all, when I went to go to bed, there were a bunch of dark hairs on the sheets. I made my husband go down to the front desk to ask for new sheets. He offered to move us to another room, and apologized, but our two kids were already asleep in bed, so we just got new sheets. The shower took forever to get hot water (like 10 minutes), so I had to just settle for washing with a washcloth that night. In the morning, I felt so dirty from being in that bed/room that I did decide to take a shower and take my chances. I was never so happy to check out of that place. My husband asked for a refund in the morning, but the manager said he couldn't do that. The only pro to this place is that it's close to the airport. Unless you are really financially strapped and don't mind dirty disgusting rooms , I would not recommend staying at this motel. I felt dirty just being in that room, and kept praying that I didn't contract any diseases from being there.", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "bettyboop0429", "ReviewID": "UR19433470", "Content": "This place is excellent, they really go the extra mile as soon as you walk in the door.

Weighing one against the other, we cannot recommend this property. First, the positives. The front desk crew is terrific. Want recommendations for restaurants? No problem. Need the wireless computer system rebooted? Sure thing. Looking for directions to the Gaslamp District? Thats' easy. These guys are friendly and courteous and go the extra mile. They are easily the best thing the Vagabond has going for it. The location is also a plus. It's in Point Loma, right near the fancy boats and within walking distance of a number of good restaurants, including the iconic Point Loma Seafood, which is right next door. The hotel is a short drive from Ocean Beach, our favorite in SD, and an easy drive to Old Town and the Gaslamp District. It's not on a touristy street -- right across from the hotel is a bar advertising \"semi-live music,\" whatever that is -- but the location is good. This is not a new hotel at all, but it is kept very clean. The bed was firm but not a pillow-top. Okay,but nothing fancy. The rooms have wireless access. Our refirigerator was decently sized and, unlike those in most tourist hotels, was icy cold. Now, the problems. It all starts and ends with the thin walls that let all sorts of sounds in. Others have complained about the sounds of airplanes and traffic. We had an inside room, so we did not suffer those problems. Instead, our room was next to the housekeeping room. We were awakened one day by the maid's cart rattling by...and again...and again. The next day my wife, trying to sleep late, was awakened by staff members standing outside the housekeeping room holding a three-way discussion with no concern that people might be in their rooms on either side. We could hear traffic out on the street, but it was not much of a bother. For people on the other side of the building, it might be a problem. The hotel has a heated pool that seems clean. We didn't use it because the weather was cool, but we would have been willing to. We paid about $100 a night on a holiday weekend, which is not bad considering SD's inflated prices.

We trusted in Trip Advisor ratings, and took a chance on the Vagabond Inn despite some negative reviews. The Vagabond Inn is a little run down but generally well kept. We stayed for three days in mid-January seeking the sun and warmth (we're from Wisconsin). We had a 2Q N/S room on the second level overlooking the outdoor poor. The entire time we stayed we never saw anyone in the pool, but is was kept heated and well maintained. The price we paid for the off-season was reasonable. Housekeeping was pretty good, and the rooms were clean. It was surprising quiet with the windows closed and drapes pulled. Almost all the rooms overlook the parking lot of a seafood store with a small cafe. Store hours were from 9 to 6, but delivery trucks and garbage trucks started early, so don't expect to sleep past 7AM. Evenings were generally quiet. The location and Inn was just what we wanted. We could walk to Shelter Island, enjoyed seeing the private and commercial boats, and were within easy walking distance of some interesting and affordable cafe's, deli's and restaurants. (When you check in ask for dining recommendations, we received a complementary discount at Miguels, which was very good.) Additionally, the downtown area with many attractions, as well as the ocean, were only minutes away by car. If you want to experience a real ocean side harbor experience I would highly recommend the Point Loma area. We were able to see two aircraft carriers, several large naval ships, military aircraft, and two large cruise ships, all in the same harbor on the same day. However, the downside is that is was a very noisy area, not far from the flight path of the airport's one runway, and with lots of activity on the road, in the harbor, and in the skies. Our three days there was a great experience, but we were happy to move north for the rest of the triip to the Pacific Beach area. )See my review for the Pacific Shores Inn).", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "broadbill", "ReviewID": "UR10826016", "Content": "I stayed at the Vagabond Inn for four nights during November.The place is situated right next to Point Loma,an excellent location for fishermen who are heading out on the long range fleet,which I was.

We booked at this location during our move to San Diego from out of state. Since we were moving with our two cats, we needed a pet friendly place to stay. We chose the Vagabond Inn Point Loma. Upon our arrival, we received a rude greeting and it only continued from there. When we asked a question about why they needed to photocopy my husband's driver's license and credit card, the answer was given quite rudely and the front desk person proceeded to treat us poorly. We then discovered additional pet charges and a ridiculous pet policy. The most ridiculous part of the policy was that at a pet friendly hotel, we were not allowed to leave our pets (our cats) alone in the hotel room. We were in the process of moving, we needed to be at work, we needed a pet friendly hotel so that our pets could be somewhere while we worked. Instead, it seemed the expectation was that we'd either stay in the room or put our animals in the car all day. We found that to be completely inhumane. We'd already paid for the hotel through travelocity and worked with them to try to get our money back. Vagabond was going to charge us for all 7 days but after discussing it with Traveloctiy changed their policy to charge us for 4. Technically, we'd only stayed for 1 night.

I called the front desk back and that individual told me that she would look into the camera situation and for me to call her back in 30 minutes. It wasn't my idea of impeccable customer service... or even good customer service. The parking was very limited as well. We also found that on the 2nd and 4th nights there, our keys had been deactivated so, a visit to the front desk was necessary. Each time, the staff member was friendly but never apologized for the inconvenience. It's also important that you understand the location of this hotel. It is right next to a dock/marina where boats apparently come into and out of port/dock regularly.

I had read about this place in the Mobil Travel Guide, which recommended it as inexpensive and clean. I can say that those two terms together were correct. But what they didn't say was run down. The location was great - it is located behind the docks next to the Point Loma Seafood's restaurant. We walked to dinner a few nights and other nights, sat at the tables outside after the restaurants closed with a bottle of wine and watched the fishing boats come in. It was also interesting in the morning to walk over and see the overnight boats come in and unload the fish from the boats. When we checked in, we had booked our room right through the Vagabond Inn's website. The room was supposed to be $79 and $89 per night. We arrived with another couple who booked their room on Travelocity. They got a room in the back of the hotel - we were given a room right next to the office, which was noisy and inconvenient. We requested a room in a different area and were charged an additional $15 per night. Since we clearly did not want the noise next to the office, we grudingly paid the extra money. Our room was on the second floor. The room was clean and a decent size, but the dresser was very worn. The bathroom, while clean, had a peeling bathtub. (So did our friends' room). There was mismatched bath tiles on the wall and the tub faucet leaked. The beds were comfortable and the showers nice and hot, but if you are a bath person, stay away - the peeling of the tub was very off putting. There was a small pool that was located directly on the main road of Scott Street. If it doesn't bother you to swim where traffic from the road is only a few feet away from you, this won't bother you. Most of the clerks were friendly, but on one occasion an overnight female desk clerk ignored us while she was on the phone with her boyfriend when we were trying to get so information from her. There is a coffeemaker in each room but ours had a broken top on the pot. There is also none of that powder in the rooms to lighten the coffee if you make it, so we just got coffee in the main office as a continental breakfast was provided, as well as free newspapers. Our friends had a refrigerator in their room and a microwave, ours did not. When we inquired about it, the clerk told us that's just the way it was - some rooms had them, some didn't and they couldn't do anything about the rooms that didn't have them. That was a little off putting - all rooms should be consistent in this travel agents opinion. The parking lot was very small in the hotel. If you went out and came back after 9:00 PM, you usually had to park on the street. This hotel is ideal for anyone who is going on a few days of fishing - the location is right next to the boat docks and it was cheap. We loved Point Loma but will go an extra $20 or $30 next time and stay at another hotel in Shelter Island. When we checked out, a friendly clerk asked where we were going next and we told him San Luis Obispo. He told us there is another Vagabond Inn there and he'd be happy to make us a reservation - we said thanks but no thanks - our experience with staying at a Vagabond Inn is over for this lifetime.

If you go, try to get there during the day!! Jose, the front desk clerk then is AWESOME - we checked in and went to our non-smoking room, and as soon as we walked in, we were bombarded with the smell of cigarette smoke. I'm sometimes sensitive to this and sometimes not, but, being almost 6 months pregnant, I was gagging after about 5 seconds, so I went back to Jose. He apologized over and over about the room, and then walked me personally to the next room so that I could look it over and make sure it was okay. From then on, everything was perfect. I happened to walk into the lobby for extra towels about 10 minutes after the complimentary continental breakfast was over, and Jose still made sure to have me look and take whatever I wanted. The night staff isn't rude or anything, they just definitely aren't as great as the day staff.
