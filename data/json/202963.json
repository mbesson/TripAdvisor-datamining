Here is a summary of our stay and I will be as objective as possible.Good points:Nice bathroom (clean, good size), good location (though Florence is small and everything is easy walking distance). Now for the negative points:Our room was absolutely tiny and awkwardly shaped. It was on the third floor, last room at the end of the corridor and there was hardly any room to move around the double bed. The air conditioning was switched off in the room and it was absolutely sweltering unless the window was opened (though this was not a big issue in April). As someone else also mentioned, there was a very strange odour at reception, which hits you as soon as you get through the revolving doors. Not nice.General comments:The staff were fine, but it wasn't exactly service with a smile. On one evening, we asked for assistance in booking a particular restaurant for dinner. We were told that they would phone later in the evening. We ended up making the reservation ourselves. We did not eat their breakfasts or drink in their bar so cannot comment on that The decor in general is a bit old fashioned for my tastes, but that's merely a personal thing.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR643344016", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "commedesgarcons"}, {"Content": "Great Location! Top notch Sofitel Sofitel FirenzeWe stayed at the Sofitel in the third week in September 2007 for four nights. This hotel is located on a main street in the historic center of Florence/ Firenze about equi-distance between the Santa Maria Novella Cathedral, the Duomo, and the main shopping streets. It is a beautifully converted palace with a small bar and elegant dining room on the ground floor. Our room on the 4th floor was large by European standards, absolutely soundproof and had a spectacular view of a nearby church\u9225\u6a9a dome. The marble bathroom had all of the usual first class amenities including a deep tub, plenty of well lighted mirror as well as robes and slippers. The twin beds were comfortable but lacked the luxury bedding the Sofitel hotels in the US enjoy. We had a small closet and dressing area that was poorly lighted. The hotel provides an American style buffet breakfast as part of the room cost. We had a beautiful selection of scrambled eggs, sausage, sliced fruits, cold cuts, and breads/cereals. The service was excellent with wonderful coffee, steamed milk and the buffet refilled continuously. We also ate at the hotel in the dining room and in the bar. We enjoyed delicious food and gracious service throughout.The front desk staff was gracious and competent. A real standout was a young woman who seemed to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the museum schedules, near-by restaurants and the best time to go to high traffic attractions to avoid the lines. I was particularly impressed by her willingness to encourage us to visit the Duomo late in the evening to enjoy the beautiful weather, the extraordinary architecture of the cathedral and the completely unique street scene. We visited the Duomo museum at 9pm and had the Michelangelo Pieta to ourselves and wandered through the exhibits as if on a private tour.This is a great central location within easy walking distance of all of the major sights in this extraordinary city.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR336475385", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lesm1981"}, {"Content": "A comfy stay       comfy bed", "Date": "Oct 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR502583187", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "adatrip"}, {"Content": "Average Sofitel Firenze has a very central location, but hotel itself is nothing special.

But it was convenient, in particular for Accor card holders (of the kind that leads to upgrades etc.), to stay at a central spot where w'd get a shower on the hot hours between the visits, and a good night' sleep.We got to the hotel before noon, were told our room would be ready in some 45 minutes, left our luggage and went for a stroll. It took us more than 2 hours to get back to the reception desk, all wet from the sudden storm that broke. Nevertheless, our room was still not ready (at 14:25). We stood there, dripping, for another 20 minutes, during which the not-really-polite and hardly helpful personnel was busy re-registering us. The room was standard, darkish (1st floor, courtyard view), functionally furnished. The bathroom was standard as well. It all seemed not to have been redone since the last decade (century!). But (bathrobe and slippers present) it was clean. Or so it seemd. Because an ant strolled along the bathtub - which I courageously drowned and disposed of - only for her to be given a few hours later a funeral-march by her many friends. This time we called the reception, who promptly answered that they were full so no other room was available. A second call was necessary to get an employee come and spray the ants.Our second day started with a mediocre breakfast in the gloomy restaurant. After enjoying Florence, we got back to our room in the late afternoon, went out again, and got back to dress for a late dinner. We were surprised to receive a phone call from the reception, announcing us (at 22:00!) that another room was available for us, for our second and last night there. I went to see it - being on the 3rd floor and with a city view, it was a much brighter one, but neither nicer nor bigger. Given the late hour, we slept in our initial room, leaving the next morning. So to the lack of charm, one should take into account the below-standard service, the unappealing decoration, and the hardly appetizing breakfast before booking.

My wife is a Corporate Flight Attendant and the FBO at Florence airport booked the hotel. I flew on my own into Rome the following day and took the train up to Florence.It was very convenient. About a 5 minute walk from the main Florence train station. That was nice--especially upon arrival when you arrive after a long overnight flight and train connections from Rome to Florence. It was also about a 5 minutes walk to the Duomo.While our room was small by USA standards, the high ceiling made it seem plenty spacious. I don't think alot of Americans realize that most hotels in European city centers are going to have smaller rooms--unless you want to spend $500+ per night. The bathroom was extremely nice. Tub/Shower, bath-robes, hair dryer, toiletries, etc. They have a buffet breakfast in their restaurant. However, since a Continental Breakfast was included in the price of the room, and there was no extra charge to have that breakfast delivered to your room in the morning, we always had the room service. To us, that was a no-brainer. Fill out a card the night before, circle the 15 minute window of time for delivery, and hang it outside your door. We always had our breakfast delivered at the exact time specified. Lastly--it was very clear that this is a very well-managed property. Housekeeping, bar and restaurant facilities, the Room Serivce breakfast, and their Concierge services. Front desk people speak good English and were always helpful.Couple of words of wisdom. Watch out when crossing streets. At least in Florence cars and motorbikes go very fast and think they have the total right of way over pedestrians. And everywhere in Italy there seem to be a number of black African male entrepraneurs selling fake purses and handbags made to look like Gucci, Louis Viutton, etc. They display them spread out on a white bedsheet and are very aggressive in their sales pitch.

The official website begins, The modern Sofitel Firenze is located in the heart of the historic town centre. While this snatch of copy is true, the uninitated to Firenze may not realize that 90% of Florence's hotels can make the same claim. Beyond it's centrality this property represents both a lost opportunity and a great disappointment. Located in a historic building the management chose to renovate the interior in a modern theme that is unsympathetic to the subdued, but classical architecture of the building in which it is located.The rooms are clean, but cramped. Their restaurant, Il Patio is acceptable, but like the rest the property has to offer it's overpriced for what you receive, and it is hardly seductive enough to lure you away from other dining opportunities in Florence. I can imagine eating there if one is really tired, but I can't envisage locals bringing guests there to show off.The service isn't objectionable, just mediocre. No special touches, or flourishes. After staying at their sister property, Sofitel Roma near the Via Veneto, the d\u8305cor and service was an unexpected disappointment. In the clutter of transnational ownership I believe Sofitel still claims to be the upscale brand of the French accommodations giant, Accor Hotels. While not quite a Red Roof Inn, this property doesn't meet the expectation of the Sofitel cachet. Rather than sully the brand this property should probably carry their Novotel, or even Mercure designation.Could one find a worse hotel in Florence, but of course! However, the management team that renovated this property has abused the opportunity to add another jewel in the Sofitel crown and settled for a hotel that is clean, but overpriced \u9225?a commodity that can be found anywhere in the world.

However, one quickly realizes that Florence is not as large as Rome and most things are a few minutes walk from everywhere else. It is not on a charming street, but rather the street that goes directly to the train station. This is not a criticism, but merely a comment. If a person is going to Florence and seeking romance and charm, the Sofitel may not be the best hotel. However, if one is looking for convenience and easy access to the train station, it is a good location.I was pleased with the desk staff and they were helpful after changing our rooms. They had good recommendations for places to eat, but for the most part, we had our own itinerary and used them for directions and making reservations.
