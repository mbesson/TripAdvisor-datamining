Overall stay was very good. will definitely recommend for families. Easy access to al nahda metro station just 5 mintutes walk. stayed in deluxe room which was good and nice . Supermarket in shopping mall in same building was very helpful. Mac Donald's is open 24 hrs in the same building. swimmimg pool is small but good. Laundry service is available free of cost but you have to drop & pick up your clothes. Breakfast was OK needs improvement at times it was crowded. Bell Captain service was good but staff shortage will cause you delay in service as they are busy all the time. House keeping was very good they would make our suite look fresh & new every day during our stay.Plug points in room are less for charging your mobile/laptops.

I had called from london at least 10 times(prior to booking and after)to comfirm only 1 thing\"can you accomodate 2 adults and 1 11 year old child\" time and time again i was told ofcource they can BUT they didnt tell me the truth and decieved me into booking so i was fairly dissapointed so after having had my buffet breakfast(only good thing) i went and asked for the manager who came after 15 min(i think his name was james)after a long disscusion maybe 40 minutes he concluded that there was nothing he could do i was utterly shocked at his response he even went so far as to tell me that if we thought that we had been decieved that we are free to checkout!!! horrible service! i had paid around \u00a370 a night and had another booking at the fairmont for 3 days so we left it with him that if he could do something pls do but when we came back that evening and there was no change in his opinion so we just bide our time there and moved onto the fabulous part of our holiday at the fairmont,rags to riches as my son put it. good points of staying at this hotel al nahda station 5 min walk away mc donalds,subway,chemist and mini market on premesis fast check in and checkout reasonable breakfast in the restaurant, big selection of hot and cold food.

The food outlets were okay - the Pastry Shop our favourite. Getting taxis too and from the Centre just depended on the time of day and the route.

The staff were respectful, friendly and helpful on the few occasions we approached them. The Shuttle bus gave guests the opportunity to visit down town or the beach, although I would have liked a more frequent service perhaps. Most guest we spoke with like us, were pleased to stay at an inexpensive, but comfortable establishment as part of a stopover. I would recommend Al Bustan Residence from my experience.

Got to the hotel at 12.00 midnight and led to our room which only had 2 single beds. My complaints to management fell on deaf ears - they stated that we booked a double room & only sleeps 2 people - my confirmation letter stated 3 people - Hotel manager assured me they didnt have any other rooms to give us - they didnt even have a fold up bed to bring in so they brought up a dirty blanket and a pillow and expected one of us to sleep on the floor! I took the dirty blanket and pillow and went to reception and set myself up on the couch and told them if I didnt get a change I would sleep in reception where everyone would see me - within 60 seconds we were given another room. We finally got into our room at 1.30am which was useless as we had to get out at 8am to catch our morning flight Also, this hotel is not 5 mins from airport - it took 20 mins with no traffic, so if there's traffic it will take you more than 30 mins. THIS PLACE IS A SCAM - DO NOT STAY AT AL BUSTAN RESIDENCE, DUBAI DO NOT USE DIRECT ROOMS.COM (GLAD ENTERPRISES) The booking website also gives a different address which makes you think you are booking the Al Bustan Hotel which IS close to the airport and IS a reputable hotel - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT HOTEL Oh, and checkin took ages!

I was rather disappointed that the swimming pool was nothing like they had displayed on the photo infact it was tiny and could have done with a good clean. There was no bar in this hotel and restaurant facilities only available in shopping centre. The staff attitude was a big issue. obviously when you have booked a hotel they know your check in and check out date. we booked through an agent as a package, our flight back home was at 23:45 and we recieved a note from the hotel mid week regarding our transfer that evening, the hotel informed us we would be picked up at 20:00. what they didn't inform us was that we had to check out by 12:00. we soon found this out when we arrived back to the hotel at 17:30 all ready for the airport our bags were in our room already packed since the morning, we literally just had to pick them up. Our key would not work in the door so we went to reception to inform them. They then told us we should have already checked out and that we have to pay 50% of a nightly rate which was 360 dirhams (\u00a355). We were willing to make our own way to the airport early so we just needed to get our cases that was all, we still had to pay. when i went to the room every thing was made up ready for the next people so there was really no need to charge us as we didnt stop them doing what they needed to do ie; cleaning. This done it for me, the attitude of the staff means i would not choose this hotel again. it was my 3rd visit to dubai and definatly my last to that hotel.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney NSW", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Manal", "ReviewID": "UR3471864", "Content": "I'm not sure who rated this place as a 2 star but it definatley is closer to a 4!
