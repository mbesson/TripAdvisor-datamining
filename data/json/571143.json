No issues with booking etc, but as others have commented, the service on arrival is poor. You have to drag your luggage to collect the keys from their offices and then back to find a taxi etc. I discovered that others on the trip had their apartment providers meet them and take them to the apartment, meaning that they could use services like the Alilugana which is easier than the bus and water taxi needed to pick up keys. The apartment is basic - is served my purposes as I was there for the Biennale and the location is therefore great. Some negatives, apartment just had two sheets and a bedspread on the bed, springs on the bed not great so if you have a bad back be aware of this. Did find some blankets in the cupboard as it got cold. Also only two towels so a bit difficult to manage. It does have a small washing machine and outside courtyard which is nice. In terms of the kitchen, I had planned to cook most of my meals, but the utensils provided make it really difficult. For example there is no frying pan, so if you just wanted to cook a quick piece of fish would be difficult. No grater so grating parmesan cheese for pasta not possible - we are in Italy after all! So, in summary, great location - think a bit overpriced for what is on offer, could be a great place with a new mattress, some better linen, towels and a few additional utensils in kitchen.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turkiye", "Title": "\u201cwww.veniceapartment.com\u201d", "Author": "progressiverock", "ReviewID": "UR118451842", "Content": "We were really surprised with very warm welcome and a very cosy atmosphere.

We found the Roiter apartment and it was fantasic, spacious and with your own private altona (roof top terrace). we thought being in the Saint Marks area it would be noisy but this was not the case, it was also very reasonable. We loved having our own private accomodation and would happily reccomend it as an option for people. The service tried to give clear instructions, we found the office ok but the directions to the apartment were very confusing.

The major problem we had was that it is SO humid in there the apartment. It would be nice to have some screens on the windows since we open them a lot because of the humidity, but the insects can come in. This apartment was really well equip, I've never had such a well equip apartment. It even had a washer and a drier. It's also well located near place St-Mark. The television over there sucked big time. When it rains in Venice, there isn't a whole lot to do. So when you want to stay inside, well, you better have a book with you or know how to speak Italian, because the television is practically in Italian and it doesn't have a lot of channels.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGreat apartment with friendly service for the price of hostel\u201d", "Author": "MarcinOlak", "ReviewID": "UR70167052", "Content": "We rented the apartment via Internet and got very detailed information on how to pick up keys and how to reach our apartment. Both instructions were accurate and precise so we quickly found the office for picking up keys - very very close to Piazzale Roma and Railway Station. We've splited - party with luggages waited near the Grand Canal, and second group went to pick up keys so we didn't have to carry our luggages to and forth. Whenever you can leave your baggage - leave it. In Venice there are many bridges and they're quite steep. Lady in the office was very friendly and answered to all of our questions e.g. she told us how to get to the beach at Lido which is one of the best I've seen so far. Few days later we met her somwhere in the city and she suggested us some nice drink (Spritz with Aperol) to check out. Was really good! Travelling by Vaporetto was very expensive by our standards (50 euros / 3 days). Fortunately we found a cheaper tickets (22 euros / 3 days). Look at www.hellovenezia.com for info how can you get Hello Venezia card. It is poorly advertised in Venice so you have to know what and where to look for in advance. Equipped with HelloVenezia card we took Vaporetto to Arsenale station. Trip takes more than 30 minutes but whole party enjoyed it a lot. Views were simply stagerring! Our apartment (Trabanico) was located in very silent neighbourhood. We were approached by very friendly old man living nearby. He spontaneously offered us electric fan which proved to be a life-saver - it gets very hot and moisty late afternoon. Apartment was small but equipped with everything necessary. Worth mentioning - delivered clean with a set of fresh towels. We especially enjoyed coffee service with two moka pots (coffee is so cheap in Venice - 1.5 euro for 250g pack of good quality coffee). Trabanico apartment is located in Arsenale district. It is 10 minutes walk from Piazza San Marco and also offers some nice places to visit. It offers especially good access to other Venice Lagoon islands: Murano, Lido and Guidecca. It is close to Vaporetto stations from where you take ride there. At the end of our stay staff was very helpful in printing our boarding passes, spent like 30 minutes talking with us about our experiences and suggestions. All in all I would recommend Venice Apartments for their great and friendly service to all travelers. I would recommend Trabanico Apartment especially to all those looking for a higher standard than hostel while still in the same price range. BTW. For us students and young graduates from Poland Venice turned out to be quite cheap city - as long as we were not eating on Piazza San Marco ;)", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cVeniceApartments.org - I was so disappointed\u201d", "Author": "NationalParkFans", "ReviewID": "UR67884832", "Content": "We booked the Rialto apartment with VeniceApartments.org and would not use them again. If this is your first visit to Venice the rental agency is difficult to find and if you arrive after hours (our plane was 3 hours late) there is no one to help you find the office or apartment. Dragging your luggage while looking for a place you've never been (1st the agency and then the apartment) in the windy alleys of Venice is not fun. The apartment is on the other side of the Rialto bridge so there are many steps. We finally found the apartment and the bedrooms and general area were clean but the bathroom reeked of sewer the entire time we were there. The kitchen was very inadequate - they had 4 coffee pots and three were broken (missing handles, etc.) There were stains on the drapes and furniture covers. The apartment was originally advertised as having a washing machine which one of the the main reasons we booked it. We knew we needed to wash clothes after a week of travel. We were going to use it and there was no electricity and we called the agency - they said the washer was not advertised as being part of the apartment. I know it was when I booked it and instead of being gracious and apologizing the agency owner all of sudden was rude, started yelling and his English became poor (it was excellent when I made the call). They have now added no washing machine to the apartment description. On the positive side, the beds were very comfortable and we loved Venice. If they fixed the sewer smell and added some newer, decent furniture and stocked the kitchen adequately this would be a nice apartment.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, Calif, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, helpful, very roomy & stylish apt\u201d", "Author": "ndwoods", "ReviewID": "UR17085908", "Content": "We used this service to book an apartment for a short stay in Venice.

We arrived a couple of hours before our friends who we were sharing the apartment with. I called the office to say we were on our way to San Marco station as directed in our email, so someone could meet us and take us to the apartment. To cut a long story short, they tried to get us to stay at a different smaller apartment which was further away from san marco square, than the one we originally booked. The lady i spoke to in the office seemed really flustered to hear from me, and then kept cutting me off during HER mid sentence as she 'couldnt hear me??', then the phone was always engaged for a while. At first they said it wasn't a different flat, then they said it was different, but a much nicer flat and they tried to get me and my fiancee to accept the 'other' flat, before my friends had arrived. We were accused of wasting their time, as we insisted on waiting for our friends to arrive before deciding on accepting the flat. They said we had to decide there and then, or wait another 2 hours before they had time to take us there again. We had no choice but to wait, as my friends weren't going to get to venice for another half hour. Our original flat had one double bedroom, one twin bedroom, a living room with a double sofa bed, a kitchenette and one bathroom. The alternative flat had one double bedroom, a living room with a double sofabed and kitchenette, which meant our two (straight) guy friends had to share a bed in the living room. They wanted to charge us the same rate for something smaller and further away and insisted we were 'lucky' to have somewhere to stay and should just accept it. When we said it was unacceptable at the same rate, they proceeded to ask where we were from. The guy then insisted there was no negotiations possible and told us to hurry up as he was in a rush. We were insistent that it wasn't right, so the guy got onto the phone to the office, and told them we were 'chinese, and from London' (i don't see how that makes any difference?) They eventually agreed to cut the rate from 540 to 480 euros, i'll be checking my credit card to see no more is taken. It was a shame, because the place we eventually stayed at wasn't too bad, the holiday was relaxing after all that commotion, The people we had to deal with were really rude and we ended up having to wait around for bout 3 hours dragging suitcases around san marco square due to their ?admin errors. (I suspect they double booked, although they insist it was because there was no hot water at the original flat) The company blaming US for the hassle really put a bad start our holiday!! I definitely recommend confirming and reconfirming your booking before arriving, and also don't get bullied into taking an alternative.
