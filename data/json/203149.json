The hotel was clean, the furnitures were modern and the location was very convenient. The price was pretty reasonable (100 Euros per night because August is the low season for Rome) for a central hotel. The rooms was small but we didn' t mind at all, since we didn't spend a lot of day time in the room. The staff was always smilling and helpful.

However, our experience was really good. They confirmed our booking 24 hours before arrival and there was no problem with our booking when we arrived! The hotel is in a great location for seeing the sights around Rome: it's located close to Spanish Steps and nothing is more then about twenty minutes walk away. Our room was comfortable and clean, although it was on the small side. The air-conditioning unit coped well with the scorching August heat. The shower worked well, powerful and plenty of hot water. We had a room facing away from the street, so there was no street noise, we did however have some problems with the hum of a heat exchanger fan outside and on one evening we could hear people taking loudly through the wall (although they stopped when we banged on the wall!). Breakfast was decent: a warm croissant and roll, coffee or tea, fruit juice, cereal and yogurts. The staff were friendly, and spoke passable English. We had an evening flight back and the hotel took care of our bags during the day after we checked out. In summary, Condotti 29 exceeded our expectations and we would recommend it.", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotorua", "Title": "\u201cNot the place for me\u201d", "Author": "SueRotorua", "ReviewID": "UR16590792", "Content": "Our room was pleasant, and was in a good location, but from a fire safety point of view, I had concerns.

We had all the paper work with us, including confirmation. They couldn't have cared less. This was crazy as our friends had arrived the night before and told the manager that they were excited to see us and they reconfirmed the room. We were exhausted after a 12 hour flight from Shanghai, so we were a bit shell shocked and just did what the manager told us. We got in a taxi (40 euro) and went to a dump that they recc, thank goodness we asked to see the room before we committed, it was awful, bare wiring hanging from the ceiling etc. So, we got back in the taxi (40 euro) and stayed in the lobby of the Via Condoti 29 until we called Expedia (thank goodness, this was the only place on that trip that we did book through them) and they got us a room at the \"sister property\" across the street, which turned out to be better than Condoti 29. What we found out later is that the manager was trying to keep our original rate and send us to a dump and pocket the difference, instead of sending us to the more expensive(nicer) sister property directly across the street. So, while Expedia did refund our money, we were out the 80 euro taxi and the international cell phone calls. Which all added up and we could have stayed in a really nice place for all the extra money we spent. This was the worse service we had in all of Italy and all the other places we stayed turned out great. On our return to Rome on our flight out, we skipped the city altogether and stayed about 30 minutes from the airport at El Due Largo, which was fantastic!", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cperfect\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4161257", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Via Condoti 29 for 7 days for our honeymoon in 2004, and it was absolutely wonderful!

It was centrally located, so really easy to get to all the sites, and had a very relaxing jacuzzi tub which was great for 2 after a long day of walking.

My experience at the Condotti, however, was literally *the* worst. A while back I had an overnighter in Rome, and since I needed a reasonably priced, but still five-star, hotel in the central area of the city -- keeping in mind that many places were already fully booked -- I made a reservation at the Condotti. Upon arrival at the hotel, I buzzed the front door, surprised that the facility had no lobby. I was met at the door by a woman who called herself the manager, who informed me that the hotel had to be closed due to an emergency. She said that they had lost their water supply due to construction going on outside the hotel (some road repair people accidentally cracked the water main, she said) and that they had booked me a room at another hotel outside of the city. It indeed looked like there was construction going on outside the hotel, so I bought the story; however, I decided not to stay at the place where she had rebooked me. I couldn't find it in any of my guide books, plus it was located a considerable distance from the city center, so I ended up getting a last-minute room at the Hassler, at considerable additional expense, instead. Upon returning to the States, I discovered on my AmEx statement that I had been charged in full for the Condotti room, which is where the problems started. I immediately disputed the charge, and a few months later I heard back from AmEx. Not only did the Condotti manager deny in a letter to AmEx (they sent me a copy of it) that she had told me the hotel was closed due to a water main interruption, she claimed that I had entered the hotel, declared it \"unfit,\" and stormed off!! Naturally, since I was a \"no show\" under this \"policy,\" they were \"forced\" to retain a one-night deposit of $255. Thankfully, being a professional travel writer, I had considerable leverage with my booking agency, and they refunded my credit card in full. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the Condotti pulled from the GDS (global hotel reservation system) - in other to keep other people from being scammed -- but believe me, I tried. In sum, this was the *worst* hotel experience I've had in my entire life, and I advise you to avoid this place like the plague!!", "Date": "June 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cgreat location - -surly service\u201d", "Author": "kft421", "ReviewID": "UR3321335", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel in May 2003. As many of the reviews state, the location is terrific - -truly just a stones throw from the Spanish Steps - -but there is no real service provided. The hotel (think \"Inn\" by U.S. standards) is located on the upper floor of a commercial building with retail shops at street level. We had to drag our bags up the steps and into the tiny lift to the hotel. There, we were \"greeted\" by a rude young woman who seemed bothered by our arrival. That said, our room was small (although not all that small by European standards) but lovely. It was one of the rooms on the street. Some might be bothered by the noise, but we enjoyed opening the windows and watching the crowds below. The bathroom was bright, clean and modern. However, throughout our stay, all of the workers seemed put out by the tiniest request for the services that are advertised as included in the $220 per night charge -- breakfast, wine, etc.. They also overcharged us for phone calls like the other folks who have posted to this site.

So we asked for our bill and we had used a phone card to call home and they charged a service charge for using their phones. Our bill was almost $200 for five days. So I payed the bill because we are two young girls and didn't really know what else to do. Then when we checked out it took them about an hour to run my credit card and the guy was on the phone doing it which was strange and made us late as well.
