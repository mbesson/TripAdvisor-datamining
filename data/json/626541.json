Have to say that first. My girlfriend and I stayed for two nights to the tune of 158 euros total through booking.com. I diligently went over the reviews on this site and left thinking it would be an average room at best. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. YOU CAN DO BETTER, JUST BE PREPARED TO HUNT. Now, on to the positives; the bathroom was clean. The reception people were helpful for the most part but uninformed on certain key points. There is a brewery down the road from the hotel that is built into a windmill. It is cool spot and we asked the reception guy, a young person with hipster glasses, \"what time does it close?\" He told us not till late, 10 or 11 p.m. Turns out it closed at 8 on that particular night. We never made it inside or had one of their tasty beverages. It left a bad taste, no pun intended. Another good point to mention is that the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood. And there is a real cool bar just next door on Plantage steet. There are locals inside, and tables outside and it seems like everyone has to smoke in order to occupy them. But the music has a cool vibe and the bartender speaks some English. My girlfriend and I got our beers and just sat back and soaked it all in. It was one of the more memorable moments of our time in Amsterdam. Now back to the doll's house they call a hotel...the room is small, and when I say \"SMALL,\" I mean s-m-a-l-l. I am sorry, but I have to keep emphasizing this. I am six feet four and have never been in prison or arrested, but staying in this property gave the feeling of solitary confinement. I think backpackers who stay in hostels have more room to leisurely enjoy their private or communal surroundings. I have read the reviews from others, and I understand that people just like to complain because they are given a forum. But TWO people should not be staying in what they consider a \"double room.\" There may be two small beds in the room, but this room is not meant for two people. Both people cannot move about the room. One person has to lie on the bed or go for a smoke break in order for the other person to move about. I won't use the term \"freely\" because of the cell like confines, but you get the gist. One thing to note, we stayed in room #15. There is no phone in this room. I am not sure if there are phones in any of the rooms. But you should know that you cannot receive a wake up call. Without an alarm clock we had to ask the reception person to come knock on our door as a kind of wake up call. He obliged but it is just a budget situation that left us scratching our heads. One good thing is that no one is getting in there that does not belong. You have to walk by the reception area to get inside to the rooms, and this is a kind of security check so that no freaks or hairies gains access. Only stay here if you are a firm believer and understand wholeheartedly the concept of \"Europe Small.'", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evesham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHandy for Amsterdam Arena and the Dam\u201d", "Author": "Woodall42", "ReviewID": "UR115583818", "Content": "Very friendly and helpful staff Quiet but has a bar, kebab shop, chinese , cash point and tram stop all virtually on the doorstep.

Don't confuse this hotel with the Plantage Hotel which is across the road and around the corner. Room was small but as I was already aware of this it was no problem at all, and I am on the very large size myself. Just meant only one at a time in the bathroom! If you have stayed in NY budget hotels you'll manage here no problem. Ours was an attic room with low beams - ouch! A big plus compared to similar hotels in Amsterdam is that it has an elevator. Even though it is small its way better than 'mountain climbing' the stairs. I now know why many Amsterdam buildings have a pulley system on the roof, there is just no way to get anything much larger than a suitcase up those narrow steep stairs. Friendly helpful staff, the lady on duty during the day in particular. Showed us on a map where to go etc. When asked she suggested an Italian/Turkish restaurant around the corner - excellent meal. Always felt safe in this area even after midnight. If you have time visit the Zoo it's a few hundred yards away, it also has planetarium shows but when we were there only in Dutch - a pity. As has been said before trams to town, nos. 9 and 14 are yards away and trams from town stop almost at the door.

The trams are cheap (1.60 euro for the whole day) and run until 12.30 . Taxis from the city centre wil cost around 8-10 euro. Watch out for the hidden taxes added onto the price quoted by the hotel.
