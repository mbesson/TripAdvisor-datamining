We are only giving the Polo 3 out of 5 for a few reasons. First, our experience with the staff was different than some other people's. We found them pleasant, helpful and they seemed sincerely happy to see us in the morning as we left for the day's excursions or in the evening when we returned home. The entire staff - from housekeeping, to the restaurant, to the people at the front desk - went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to be helpful. There was a small supermarket around the corner and the people were used to tourists from the hotel and they also helped to make our stay a pleasant one. (I hope this doesn't come across as arrogant, but after having travelled a bit, I find that simply asking someone their name, telling them yours and then trying to say please and thank you in their language will usually end up getting you better service - wherever you are). Is this hotel out of the way? Definitely yes, but it depends a little on your perspective. I was able to jog from the hotel to the coliseum in about 35 minutes. The closest metro is Flaminio which is fifteen minutes away, but the train station, Euclide, is only 5 minutes away and it is one stop away from Flaminio and the rest of the metro system - and it uses the same 1 euro ticket which is good for 75 minutes throughout the network of trains, buses and metros. The trains run every fifteen minutes during the day. A taxi from the hotel to the Coliseum at 4:30 in the afternoon cost me exactly 8.40 euros. You can walk from the hotel to even the farthest tourist site in the city in 45 minutes if you so choose, otherwise there are metro stops at most of the important sites. We walked everywhere we went and we used to enjoy our walks home at night long the Tevere (Tiber) river. I am 58 with arthritis in the knees and after walking up and down hills in Rome for two weeks, I actually lost a little weight and my knees were better for having had the exercise. It might, however, be harder for a senior or someone with small children because of the distances. This was my first trip to Europe and I found the room exceptionally small even though I had been warned. We had ants in our room, but in all fairness, the front desk did eventually send someone to deal with the problem once they had been informed. Later, however, while sitting in the armchair in the lobby, I suddenly felt three or four on my arms. The breakfast was adequate (the coffee was great), but they served the exact same limited, mediocre menu every day for two weeks which grew very tiresome. As I said, I have never been to Europe before, but I have stayed in 4 star hotels in Cuba, Japan, the US, the Philippines, and in Canada and when I do an overall comparison to the Polo Hotel, it just doesn't measure up as well. Even though Cuba is still under an embargo the breakfasts are generally more interesting, better prepared and more varied. There was great inexpensive fruit at the supermarket near the Polo, especially the gigantic seedless Italian grapes, but the fruit at breakfast was a little old and unappetizing. The TV had only about 10 channels, most of which were Italian with 2 or 3 Russian stations, one Spanish and CNN International in English. There were no films available to watch, not even for rental. The view from our room looked out on a junky area behind the hotel. The shower stall was a tight fit for one person, I wouldn't suggest trying to fit two. The hotel might be better off eliminating the biday and increasing the size of the shower. The internet service was reasonable priced and fairly reliable for WIFI. Bottom line: would I go back? Maybe yes, because of the staff and because all the walking caused me to see things I wouldn't have had I been staying at a downtown hotel. Would I recommend the hotel? Not at the prices we paid. This is simply not a 4 star hotel.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice but not good location.\u201d", "Author": "DawnLouiseAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR115782036", "Content": "The hotel was nice enough.

We flew in and took RomeCabs to the Polo Hotel for $55 euros. We mentioned to our driver how we are planning to buy the Roma Pass and he offered to wait for us after we checked in and take us to Termini Station to purchase them. We were welcomed with a smile and checked in to our 2 clean rooms. We checked in to room 309, with a small walk-out balcony and the view is facing the building across, facing their balconies as well. Room 312 has a basic window facing the street. We had all the basic toiletries, hair dryer, and a few extras such as shower caps and shoe shine buffers. The room and bathroom were very clean and each adult had their own little closet, set of drawers, in addition to a dresser. Cable channels were iffy, but who really wants to watch TV? Both rooms also had keyboards for internet access, at a fee. There is also a small fridge in the room and my tiny bottle of water was the only thing that fit (worked for me). We enjoyed breakfast and always had plenty to eat. We ate dinner there the first night because we were exhausted and were the only guests for dinner. We didn't see many guests and perhaps that is why there was always plenty to eat at breakfast. The hotel is not located in the city, but we had easy access to the train station and never had to wait long for a train (5 to 10 minute walk). One bus runs in front of the hotel, but we didn't take it. As you face out the front doors, there is a grocery store up the hill on the left. We went there about 3 times for water, fruit, and snacks. The walk from the train station to the hotel was nice and allowed us to talk about our day.

Piazza Euclide is easily accessible and is only a 5-minute train ride from Piazza Di Populo. Just take the Viterbo suburban train one stop. There are a few small restaurants located in the square across from the train station and a small supermarket for supplies. There are also several buses that run from Termini station past the hotel and from Piazza del Popolo, bus 926 goes right by the hotel.

By the end of the check -in process, my boyfriend and I felt as though we had been time-transported back to high school and we were going to be grounded for arriving past curfew! The clerk had absolutely no sympathy for our situation and went on to chastise us for missing the hotel car that I had reserved for our transportation. Absurdly, being on a severely delayed flight, stuck in the plane on the runway, these were not valid excuses for this guy...and forget about a warm welcome after a difficult trip! He went so far as to explain that these situations are exactly why he never travels. Weird... I thought people in the \"hospitality industry\" encouraged travel... The clerk on duty the following day was not any more welcoming, or even polite. The bottom line here, is that the treatment that we received by these two front desk clerks had a negative impact not only on our hotel stay, but also on our trip in general. I would have walked out and stayed somewhere else, had the room not been part of a package deal. Beyond the emotional distress, this hotel is generally okay. They do offer a good breakfast and the rooms are comfortable. The location should be taken into consideration, as other people have written here. It is not in the central area of Rome. Taking the train to the subway is easy, though the trains stop running by 9 or 10pm. Taxis have to be used after that. If you don't mind a little travel time, staying here will offer a quiet residential experience. Also, as another person wrote, the internet access was ellusive and the front desk only offered a neighborhood internet cafe. There is a bar around the corner that offers delicious snacks.

We asked the lady at the front desk where the nearest Internet Cafe was, and she gave us a map and indicated which Metro line to take to the nearest Piazza -- unfortunately, we didnt find out until the day we checked out that they actually had an internet room in the hotel (why she didn't mention that to us, I will never know). I wouldn't suggest taking the Metro. When we walked to the nearest Metro Station about 5-10 minute walk away, we waited nearly half an hour for the nearest train to arrive, and when it did, it was PACKED wall to wall with people. My husband and I wound up taking Taxis the remainder of our time there. The Polo hotel is very close to the Borghese Gallery, which is an excellent museum, but that's about it. Everything else - Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Colliseum, Forum, Piazza Navona, etc. are all kinda far. But since we took taxis, it only cost about 6-10 euro per ride, depending on where you are going -- well, I guess that did tend to get sort of expensive. In the three days that we stayed at the Polo Hotel, I would guess that we spent somewhere between 100-200 euros on taxis. The taxi stand is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel - just about a block away. Taxis were by far the most convenient transportation for us -- dropped us off exactly where we wanted to go, so we never got lost. The hotel itself was nice - the manager in the restaurant is awesome, as well as the bartenders. We had drinks there in the hotel restaurant at the end of each of our night. The hotel breakfast is delivered to your room for just 3 euros extra, and they loaded us up with food (cooked eggs, fresh fruit, breads, etc). The bathroom in our room was nice -- actually the biggest bathroom that we had compared to London and Paris hotels that we stayed at. There is no smoking in the hotel at all. Oh, and our air conditioner in the room never seemed to work, but we never bothered reporting it either. And it was pretty warm when we were there. Felt like summer already. They didn't have any tourist tour info at all at the front desk. We had to go into town to get info on tourist places, restaurants, etc. Luckily we also had our Frommer's Rome day by day book. Don't forget to bring a small Italian Phrase book- mine was from Lonely Planet \"Fast Talk Italian\" and fits in your backpocket -- that was our security blanket and saving grace while we were there. They do speak english at the hotel, so that was no problem, but since the hotel is in a residential area, away from tourist places, you will need the phrasebook. People in town are very cooperative, as long as you at least try to speak the language. We stayed at his hotel from 05/15 - 05/18 - Overall, I kinda wished we picked a hotel closer to tourist spots, although this hotel was very nice. Hope this info helps! I will post pics of our room in a few days -- standard room, there were other nicer rooms there.", "Date": "May 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shipley, UK", "Title": "\u201cAway from the hustle and bustle!\u201d", "Author": "Magsmor", "ReviewID": "UR5035284", "Content": "Ideal base for your stay in Rome.

Unless you are the size of a four year-old, it is most difficult to utilize the toilet in its location directly against the shower. Secondly, the hotel is located in a quiet residential area where the dogs tend to \"do their business\" all over the sidewalk. My advice is to watch your step! If you don't mind taking the train one stop to access the A line on the metro, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

The hotel was clean, the maid service, excellent, and the staff, friendly. However, our room was rather small, even by European standards. The breakfast buffet was very good, but we don\u2019t recommend the restaurant for dinner. Service was slow, and the food, barely warm. One cook plus one server is a formula for inefficient service. There is a supermarket 150 meters from the hotel, and several small food shops nearby. We REALLY enjoyed the restaurant around the corner, next to the movie theater. The waiters were very helpful and friendly, and the proprietor checked on us regularly to see how we enjoyed the meal. They also brought us extras, such as champagne aperitifs, appetizers, and desserts. The filet was heavenly, the salads, delicious, and the oven-baked potatoes, superb. All the servers were good; the waiter, \u201cCarmine\u201d was great: Angelico Ristorante; Via L. Luciani, 52. The hotel's location is particularly nice, being only two blocks from a train line that runs every 15 minutes or so. This line is not marked on most street maps, but a 1-, 3-, or 7-day metro pass is also good for the intercity part of this line. To get to the hotel, take the metro line A to Flaminia, take the far right exit, and the train station is only 30 meters to the right. Hop on the train and get off 3-4 minutes later at the first stop, Euclide. Go up to the street (left exit), turn left, and walk 2 blocks straight up to the hotel. Maps of Rome tend to be confusing, but with a little skill, you can walk from the hotel to the Borghese Museum in only 15 minutes. Only superlatives can describe this museum, but you MUST have a reservation beforehand. Visits are limited to 2 hours. Given the hotel\u2019s amenities, it\u2019s proximity to the train and the Angelico, we will likely stay there again.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo, MI", "Title": "\u201cQuiet part of town\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3508062", "Content": "We did get a feel for being in a Rome neighborhood by being in this Hotel.

The location of the hotel is in a very quiet area on the outskirts of Rome. If you want to be close to The Gallery borghese and The Gallery of Modern Art then you are in walking distance of both.

You will need to walk to the nearest train station (Euclides), which is a good 5 minute walk from the hotel, and get of 10-15 minutes later at Flaminio station, in the heart of Rome. The hotel itself is clean and tidy and the staff although not overly friendly seem to be somewhat interested in there guests. The main problem with this hotel is the restaurant. I have to say that a new outside organisation had only just taken over the restaurant 5 days before our stay but this was no excuse for probably the worst hotel meal I have ever had. The meal was prepared by a chef that has no interest in food. It was unimaginative, bland and boring. do not eat in this restaurant if you like food.
