After reading so many good reviews, I rang up and spoke to the lovely front manager who was happy to accommodate us at late notice and very understanding.

Imagine the surprise when we walked into an upgraded room (deluxe to a suite!) with champagne on ice and fruits on the dining table! Even had a personalized welcoming card. The suite is absolutely amazing with abundance of room and everything is so well laid out and thought through. It actually shames the Hilton Sydney's king suite that we stayed in for our honeymoon night. The suite is so quiet and clean that it makes you feel like you're at home rather than at a hotel.

We just had that pleasant of an experience at Le Six. First, months before we even came to France, I was trying to narrow down our hotel options and got in contact with Anne, who runs the hotel. Ann's responses were very quick, helpful, and in perfect English. Our interactions with her convinced us to book at the hotel, along with a friend's recommendation. When we arrived the room was very spacious for a European room. We had a junior suite, which by American standards was about as big as a normal sized hotel room. The room was in perfect condition, with beautiful modern decor. The lobby and other public areas were similarly gorgeous. If you're looking for a classic, old-Europe style feel this is not your place, but neither is it one of those super-trendy modern places. It was a nice middle ground that made the place feel new and hip without trying too hard. Stayed with my wife for three nights and everyone was very helpful. We had an unsolicited email from the concierge a few days before our arrival asking if she could help us with restaurant reservations, an offer which was gratefully accepted as our French is not perfect. Martin, the night clerk, was also especially friendly and helpful. The breakfast each morning was great. It was included in our room fee, so I'm not sure how much the extra fee is a la carte. I'm not sure we would have paid it, as there are plenty of cafes nearby that would have been a better value proposition, but since it was included it was nice to be able to just go downstairs, eat a nice meal, and then go back upstairs to get ready for our day. The hotel is perfectly located a short walk (under 5 minutes) from 4 different Metro stations. It was extremely easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go. In the end, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It was our third hotel in Paris, and easily our favorite. Great location, great decor, and a wonderful staff that was attentive but not intrusive, and had no trace of any of those French-people-are-rude stereotype. Pros: Location Decor Service Value for price Cons: A few nitpicky things that will depend on taste, e.g. my wife thought the mattress was too hard, but I thought it was ok.

Professional staffs, elegant decoration ,cozy ambience, and the relatively spacious superior room are all its advantages. However, when the cost is taken into account, I believe the hotel should be better. The hotel charges for more than 200euros per night. For example, the breakfast is a little bit too simple for a boutique hotel. The variety of hams and sausages is small. Secondly, there is no complimentary mineral water in the room.

She goes regularly on business at least once a year to Paris, usually staying at Le Six, and I accompany her when she goes in the summer. It is cool and trendy boutique hotel with a small bar area adjacent to the lobby, and really quite good and large buffet breakfasts. (We usually find a newspaper in the lobby on the way down to breakfast.) The rooms are very modern and well furnished on a small and fairly quiet street, and the staff is very helpful. (Once I had a dental problem while we were staying there, and the girl at the front desk was able to direct me to a dentist just across the way.) The first couple of times it was not terribly busy, and we were given a special rate for a suite, which was gorgeous with two rooms and a huge high-tech bathroom that looked that it belonged in Architectural Digest. Lately, Le Six might appear to be getting more discovered, so we didn't get the upgrades to the suite anymore. Generally, we now stay in a room one step up from a standard room, but these can tend to be rather small, and sometimes do not have a bathtub. Montparnasse is a pretty good area to stay in Paris, and a variety of internationally recognized restaurants are just two or three blocks away including La Coupole, Le Dome, and Le Select, as well as many well-rated neighborhood restaurants. Some supermarkets and grocery stores are in the area if you don't want to live out of the minibar, and a sushi place is next door to the hotel. Maybe we did enjoy it somewhat more the one time we rented an apartment for a month in Montmartre, but you can certainly do worse than stay at Le Six, and it's more convenient to book a room at a hotel compared to trying to arrange an apartment. We have stayed a number of times in the past at hotels near Place de la Concorde/Vendome, too; Le Six is certainly a better value than staying there, although that former area is more cosmopolitan than Montparnasse. And Le Six is near a variety of metro lines (without necessarily going to the stop at the train station of Montparnasse), making it more than reasonably easy to get around the city on business. It's a great place to stay if you're going for a fling in Paris, too. Considering the alternatives, Le Six might be slightly pricey, but its cool aesthetic can be very appealing to come home to. Because I have stayed there a number of times, I can see the positives and negatives to Le Six, but the fact that we continue to go back there says something in itself.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illawarra", "Title": "\u201cGreat little boutique style hotel\u201d", "Author": "Boltreview", "ReviewID": "UR123284459", "Content": "This hotel is a \"gem\".

I still think the rates are high, but hey, it\u2019s Paris, everything is expensive. There\u2019s also a spa in the hotel but I didn\u2019t get a chance to see it. The lobby is nice. There\u2019s a sitting space with a good selection of magazines and newspapers. The breakfast buffet is good without being amazing: selection of croissants, bread, cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, ham, cheese, yoghurts, fruit, and natural fruit juices. All in all I had a very pleasant stay, but if you\u2019re considering spending most of the day out visiting, I\u2019m not quite sure the price is worth it, depending on what kind of trip you\u2019re planning.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nytrvl", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel\u201d", "Author": "nytrvl", "ReviewID": "UR121305476", "Content": "My husband & I stayed in the hotel Le Six for one night in October. We were on our way to a weekend in Bordeaux & the location proved to be perfect for us since I arrived in Charles de Gaule on a Friday morning & left from Montparnasse Saturday afternoon. The hotel was within walking distance (less than 10 min) from the RER station (Port Royal) and about a 5 minute walk to Gare Montparnasse. I arrived solo & don't speak French & was able to find my way just fine. Unfortunately when I arrived off the overnight flight my room was not ready so I dropped my bags & walked around the area. Luxemburg gardens is about 10 minutes away with shops in between. The hotel staff was really very nice. When I finally got into my room around 2pm & desperate to take a nap it was a bit noisy. We stayed in a deluxe room that faced the street. The room was average size for an American hotel room, probably a bit spacious for Paris standards & very nice & modern. Unfortunately the noise was coming from within the hotel- the doors shutting to other rooms, the cleaning staff banging around their equipment & getting supplies which I suspect were in a closet really close to our room. I understand most people are probably not trying to sleep in their room in Paris in the middle of the day but I was just really exhausted from not sleeping on the overnight flight & it really was disappointing to not be able to get a nap in. My husband was already in Europe & arrived later that night & he too had no issues taking the RER from the airport to the hotel. We walked to the St. Michel area for dinner & the next day before catching the TGV went to Trocodero & the Eiffel tower which was just a short metro ride away. We booked the room with the included breakfast & they had a really nice buffet selection- definitely worth it. Another bonus was the hotel had free wifi which made skyping with the kids back home nice.

Room was well appointed, bathroom spacious, and it was a very comfortable place to stay in a fantastic location near several Metro stops that will have you to the main tourist attractions along the Seine within 10-15 minutes. In addition, the RER train out to Charles de Gaulle is just a short walk down Blvd. Montparnesse. Plan for a 40-minute train ride at 9.10E per ticket. The hotel location was great (safe to walk around at night, no problem) and many good restaurants within an easy 15-minute walk, although I'd eschew the ones along Blvd. Montparnesse, which seem to thrive on their location alone, and seek out smaller, better ones tucked away in the neighborhoods. Call ahead. The good ones will book up completely. There were just two small problems. First, our room was too hot. When the digital thermostat in the room didn't respond to a cooler setting, I called the front desk and was informed that whole hotel was set to \"heat,\" so I should therefore turn off the thermostat and open the room window. Well, the city street is really noisy, so having to open the window to keep the room cool at night was a major bummer for our sleep quality. Secondly, at a whopping 22E, the hotel breakfast is almost doomed to failure for its steep price, but this one hurt its own cause with undercooked hard-cooked eggs, a stray piece of plastic in the prunes, tepid juices, and tragic looking fruit cocktail that had languished in the bowl for quite a while.

My mother in law had a deluxe standard one door down which was so nice since she is 87 yrs old. The beds are fabulous...Extremely clean and the rooms are medium size. We were hardly there to hang out so NO Complaints on size. We included breakfast which I recommend... American coffee with CREAM...finally! Multiple choices and the salmon alone with all the fixings is wonndrful, especially with their artisan breads. I ate the best raspberries everyday!

We stayed in a suite with our two children for two nights in August. The room was modern, clean and well maintained, as was the hotel. The suite had a bedroom with a king bed and separate living area - however the fold out sofa was open and the bed made when we arrived so there was no real suite - just two adjoining bedrooms. We overlooked the interior courtyard -no view. The air conditioning worked well (it was very hot in Paris when we were there). The staff were pleasant enough but not particularly well trained or knowledgeable. They seemed young and inexperienced. When we asked for a restaurant recommendation we were given the names of the main large and somewhat touristy restaurants on Boulevard du Montparnasse. When we tried to get a sense of the restaurants we were told they were \"all about the same\". No mention was made of anything special in the neighbourhood although we did later walk by a very well reviewed small bistro near Luxembourg Gardens and I am sure there were others. The breakfast was included with our room charge and was again - ok. There is apparently no cooking facility in the hotel - or wasn't the morning we were there - other than a microwave. A gentleman (not with our group) asked for the scrambled eggs which were on the buffet to be cooked a bit more and was told this could not be done as they had no more eggs. When he repeatedly asked that the eggs from the buffet be cooked more he was ultimately answered by a young woman who brought a box of pre-packaged scrambled eggs from the kitchen to show him that \"this is the way they come\". This revelation explained why my kids had already refused to eat them - stating that \"they do not taste like eggs\". Hard to believe you are spending $700.00 a night on a hotel that does not even not offer fresh eggs. (Even in Paris they can't cost that much!) Harder to believe that a hotel staff member would be standing in the middle of the breakfast room waving about packaged eggs in order to prove that she was right and the \"customer\" was wrong.

Everyone greets you on sight, reception staff remember your name etc. Angela the receptionist (? at least i think she's a receptionist) was really MOST EXCELLENT and bent over backwards to help us secure nice restaurants all over paris.

Location - most excellent location, situated a stone's throw between two different metro lines, getting anywhere at all was a breeze, not to mention the endless choices of eating places nearby, this hotel was a real gem for location.

There are two lifts- the service lift is roomier and actually runs faster than the guest lift. Rooms are not the largest around, but big enough with a VERY comfortable king sized bed. Decor in the rooms is again very tasteful and decently lit. The amenities are excellent and we liked the provided slippers, the little chocolates left in our room every day by room service, an iron and ironing board, slippers, shoe cloths- the hotel seems to have thought of everything. Food Room service is provided up to 11pm daily by the L'Atlier restaurant nearby, but the resturant itself is 2 mins walk away and open 24 hours, not to mention about 10 euros cheaper than the room service. So why bother? Breakfast is great and has a wide spread BUT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE HOTEL PRICE. Be careful of that! If its not included its something like 20 euros per person, which is a bit pricey considering I can get a good crepe outside for 10-15 euros. In summary, a very nice boutique hotel with most excellent staff and a lot of very thoughtful touches.

As Trip Advisor has always permitted us to better judge the quality of hotels, sites and restaurants in Europe, we wish to share our recent experience with what was for us a new hotel in Paris where we spent ten nights last June. We are French Quebecers, we have always felt very much \"at home\" in France and Paris, even though our French accent is different. It was our eight visit to Paris last June. We have previously stayed in charming hotels near Place Vend\u00f4me, in the Latin Quarter, near La Sorbonne university and in St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. In April 2008, we stayed for the first time in Montparnasse at the Littr\u00e9 hotel, nice, good service but old style rooms, a little stuffy! Through Air Transat services (we also flew with this airline), we learnt about another hotel, Hotel Le Six, a boutique hotel very near where we had stayed in 2008. We had fully enjoyed the sixth arrondissement, around the Gare Montparnasse, the wide choice of restaurants, groceries, boutiques, great public transportation. So we decided Le Six was worth a try, and believe us we did not regret our choice at all! It was more expensive than the hotels where we had stayed before, but we enjoyed the more modern, zen decor and ambiance on the quiet Stanislas Street. Air Transat was offering two room classes: the classical and superior. We opted for the superior and were upgraded to superior deluxe, the difference being in the overall size of the room. Mind you hotel rooms in Paris are generally moderate size to sort of small compared to North American standards, we were quite pleased with our Superior Deluxe on the fifth floor. Huge confortable bed, two large windows, great bathroom with shower and bath, bathrobes, iron and ironing board, flat screen TV, good choice of channels except TV5 (for us it is a useful channel), small noiseless mini fridge. Not enough closet space however, but no problem, we used the back of two chairs to pile a few tops and our small cabin luggages placed at the foot of the bed to serve as additonal drawers. Oh, and for women with thick, long hair, there is a standard hair dryer not the small attached-to-the-wall kind!!! We did not use the Spa, did not have time! Nice breakfast room, with buffet breakfast, smiles and great coffee every morning as we arrived. Professional service throughout, we heard perfect English and of course had the pleasure of speaking cheeringly in our own mother tongue. Delightful boudoir under a large verri\u00e8re, choice of interesting touring magazines, small bar. The reception clerks always patient, smiling and ready to help the customers in any way they wish. Stanislas street is just lovely with a church just at the corner of the Montparnasse Boulevard. Our room was on the fa\u00e7ade and we were never bothered by the urban hustle and bustle. We were near the Gare Montparnasse, famous restaurants such as Montparnasse 1900 (with its fantastic Menu La Belle \u00c9poque, dined there twice, do reserve), La Coupole (dined once after seeing Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris movie, what a special evening that was), there is La Rotonde and a more family like fish restaurant very popular with the locals called La Cri\u00e9e. Hairdressers nearby, cinemas, the FNAC bookstore where you can purchase tickets to exhibitions and shows, all kinds of boutiques. We could easily walk to St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, the Luxembourg Garden. By bus, it was also very easy, straight to the Arc de Triomphe, or to Garnier Op\u00e9ra, or the Bastille Op\u00e9ra, or near Alma Marceau for a short walk either to the Eiffel Tower, or the Quai Branly Museum (visit at least the outside garden!), or to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es Theatre, or to get to the B\u00e2teaux-Mouches for a wonderful promenade on the Seine, straight to the Louvre if we wanted. Believe us, staying in Montparnasse is a great way to explore Paris for the cuisine, the culture, the cinemas, the boutiques, the reliable bus service (never waited more than five minutes) or metro and of course to come by train or leave by train for instance to Bordeaux. Le Six is now our favorite base camp in Paris and we recommend it without hesitation. We used for the first time the \"Paris Shuttle\" service from and to the CDG airport. To get to the hotel we had a shared ride with other travelers and had to wait a while at the terminal, so we changed the formula to go back to the airport and opted for the private transfer just for a small additional charge. We arrived at the hotel just before 1:00 PM, we were escorted right away to our room and we left on a quiet Sunday morning, our shuttle arriving at 8:00 AM sharp and got the Terminal 3 at 8:40AM! Our exchange through e-mail and phone was perfect with the Shuttle personnel, we will definetly use that service again but the private not shared transfer both ways and our e-mails to the Hotel Le Six were always answered swiftly.

Alex, the Bartender, was our favorite, providing us with wonderful restaurant recommendations, and keeping us entertained with discussions of French life and politics. The only disappointment was the \"gym\" - really more of a little nook with a couple of out-dated pieces of cardio equipment (this wasn't a huge problem, though, as we were able to run around the Jardin du Luxembourg every day before walking for hours).

The rooms are quite small but everything is modern, clean and very comfortable. The only down point is that there are no drawers to put your clothes in.

We travelled to France because my brother had some business to take care of in Nantes, and we wanted to see Paris for a few days before flying home. I was the travel agent, and after a couple months of checking out hotels online, I decided on le Six. The stay didn't get off to a very good start. We arrived an hour after check-in started, but had to wait in the lobby for 30 minutes while they finished cleaning the room. After that, we head up to the room to chill out, and after a few minutes a hotel employee and new guest opened the door and came in (they had apparently double-booked our specific room). I imagine that was pretty weird for the other hotel guest, to walk into their room and see 2 lanky dudes laying on their beds with expressions like, 'what in the hell?' Both of those aspects of our stay at le Six were annoying, but not something that ruined our time there. After we got settled in and toughed through those 2 minor issues, the hotel was great. We had free internet and the bathroom was pretty sweet too. In Nantes, we had been staying in a dorm/loft setup that was nice, but not exactly clean/comfortable. So when we got to chill out and sleep on beds that weren't 15 years old and smelly, we certainly took advantage.

The room was very small, but that is to be expected in Paris. The staff were friendly. One of the bar tenders is an Adrian Brody look-a-like. The breakfast wasn't worth 22 Euros, so don't pay that. Just walk a block to a Patisserie and pick up a coffee and croissant for 4 Euros. The hotel was certainly clean, fresh and well maintained. We had a king size bed in a superior room overlooking the street. The TV was big...we ended up watching a lot of BBC World after the Japan Earthquake. The location in fantastic...probably the best part of the hotel. You are 1-2 blocks away from 3 Metro stops (Notre Dame de Champs, Vavin and Montparnasse Bienvenue). It is also about a 5 minute walk from the Port Royal RER (commuter train) stop that will take you to the CDG airport in 45 minutes for 8.70 Euros rather than a 45 minute taxi ride for 55 Euros. The Metro is fantastic. You can be from your hotel room the the Tour Eiffel or Arc de Triomph in 15 minutes. There is no need for a car and no need to waste money on taxis.

The hotel lobby is very welcoming and extremely well presented. The staff were very helpful as soon as we arrived. The staff do speak excellent English! I speak French, however my girlfriend doesn't and she had no problems in communication with the staff. The rooms are lovely, very nice and modern, the bathrooms are great with amazing showers and kitted out with some fantastic stuff. Excellent Melton Brown toiletries!!! The beds are very comfortable and and clean. The only problem we had in the whole stay was that the first morning we were woken up by the next door neighbours doing some DIY work against the wall we shared with them. This was not something the hotel could control, but they did everything they could to sort the situation out for us. The manager went round first to find out what was going on, however he could not pursuade them to stop, so we were moved into another room, it turned out it was an upgraded room because that's all there was. The speed and understanding of the staff was fantastic and we were swiftly moved rooms. Even though we were at the hotel for only three nights I felt like I had built a raport with the staff and they were very approachable and understanding of any needs. They were happy to book us a taxi to a restaurant and happy to place reservations at a restaurant too. The hotel's location is perfect. In a quiet street so you don't have to worry about people making noise at night, however just walk up the street 30 seconds and you are on Boulevard Montparnasse which has lots of restaurants and shops on etc. There is a pharmacy about 60 seconds away down the road, and two Metro stops about a minute away. One of the Metro stations, Vavin, is on Line 4 which is the same line Gare Du Nord is on...so if you're coming on Eurostar, like we did, then transport connections are perfect! The other station Notre Dame des Champs is on another great line to be on! I went through tripadvisor for hours trying to find the best hotel that wasn't like \u00a3500 a night.

Upon opening the door, disappointment set in. The fact that this room was $388/night was nauseating. Yes, it was clean and nice. But it was a bed and a bathroom. Not much more - for almost $400/night without breakfast. In addition, we could hear the room above us, the rooms around us and the people coming and going from the lobby. In a word, not even worth $200/night for that room. Simply stated, it was a major disappointment and I was frustrated thinking about staying in that room for $1,200 for three nights. Needless to say, I barely slept the first night. Now for the transition.....asked if a bigger room was available and the wonderful staff upgraded us for 75 euro per night. The suite was a completely different story! Top floor, no noise and TONS of space for a Parisian hotel. A sitting room with a desk, a chair, sofa and coffee table. A HUGE shower and bath and a separate toilet area with a second sink. Separate bedroom with king bed and lots of storage. Great Molton Brown products, big picture windows with views and two TVs. Now this is what I was expecting from the reviews. This room was perfect. Slept like a baby, loved the space. The staff was just wonderful. Brought coffee to the room for us at no additional charge. Helped with restaurant reservations. Always spoke perfect English. Helped with Taxi to CDG and even send up pastries and coffee upon our early morning departure. Every person in the staff always said hello and offered to help with anything. Wi-fi worked great. Overall, a great place to stay...if you can get a suite. A couple of final observations. First, beware that the rooms have hardwood floors. As someone who lived in lofts in Chicago, I knew this was a bad idea! Of course you can hear every step of the people above you - meaning if they are up at 2am, so are you. Second, breakfast is 22 euro and that is a big disappointment when you are paying $400-$600 per night for a room. I have stayed a countless luxury hotels throughout the world and this is one of the select few that does not include breakfast - even when staying in a suite. Third, make sure you are ok with public transit - I have been to Paris many times so taking the Metro everywhere is not a problem, but for first time visitors I would suggest a hotel on the river and closer to the usual first time visitor sites.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haifa", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "UriW", "ReviewID": "UR88345101", "Content": "Excellent location: almost all interesting places are within one train.

This staff took care of us before and after our stay with them. The front desk team was exceptional, and we felt a warm welcome coming into their hotel. My husband and I had to find another hotel to stay at quickly as our other vacation rental had an emergency flooding. So we walked into Le Six about 10:30am. They were quick to let us know that they could keep our luggage, and they would have the room available as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I can't remember everyone's name, but the beautiful young blonde, and the young gentleman with the glasses were the first we met. They were great and accommodating to us, and let us bumble our brand new French words we had just learned a couple of days ago:) Then it only gets better!! We were only to stay at Le Six for a couple of days as we were supposed to catch a train to Spain. But our train was canceled and so we decided that maybe we could stay at Le Six again, until our next train departure. We went to the hotel, and the hotel was full. My husband and I quickly found out that almost all hotels in Paris were full, especially the ones in our price range. I was just beginning to freak out, when Jan appeared with his magical smile, and said he just had someone leave, and they would clean the room quickly for us to stay with them. This is about 9:00pm. He invited us to have a drink at the bar, and he would let us know when it was ready. That's when we were enchanted by Alex the bartender. He was such a great conversationalist, and my husband and both enjoyed speaking with him...Jan came over and asked what we were going to do for the rest of our time, since our train wasn't going to be leaving for a couple more days. I told him I was going to keep looking tonight online, and hopefully we will find something available. By the morning, they had already found us another hotel near by, and had booked us those nights!!! I was amazed by their willing to help us over and beyond what most hotel staff would do for their customers! Special thanks to Jan, and the rest of the Front desk staff, and a special shout out to Alex!

Loved, loved loved the spa-like washrooms & could have showered in there forever, with the amazing Molten Brown bath products. We found the area to be extremely convenient, we took the subway (Montparnesse station) to most destinations as it is super easy in Paris, and we were able to avoid the high costs of taxis, which we only took a couple of times. There are lots of great places to eat in the area & St.Germain de Pres neighbourhoods was one of our favourite places in all of Paris (within easy walking distance), for restaurants and little shops. You must also visit Laduree for their exquisite macarons, and to see their beautiful shop! Indiana resto nearby was great for typical American fare, Le Christine (although was full of tourists) was delicious French food, and a beautiful restaurant. Crepes on the street closeby were a delicious quick snack or lunch. Had great pizza everywhere, and Alberto's nearby looked particularly delicious although we never made it there!

This place does exactly what it says on the tin. It is in a good location and there are lots of good places to eat, drink and just hang out, just a short walk away. If expensive food is your thing then I can reccommend Helene Darrose's Gastronomic restaurant, which is a ten minute walk from the hotel. If you want to venture a little further into town, try La Maison Blanche with it's fantastic views over the City or Laurent Restaurant, which is very romantic. If it's something more down to earth that you are looking for, La Closerie des Lilas is very nice and only a short walk from the hotel or try the wonderful La Fermette Marbeuf, just off the Champs Elysee, but ask for a table in the back room with it's fabulous Art Deco interior. Sorry, I forgot that this was a hotel review. This hotel is good value, we upgraded to an executive room which didn't break the bank and was pretty spacious for Paris standards. Ladies, this place has nice Molton Brown toiletries but NO conditioner, so make sure you pack one or there is a pharmacy just round the corner. The rooms have everything that you would need from your stay and I liked that they had free wireless in the rooms for the duration of our stay. Front of house are very nice and helpful. Restaurant reccommendations were good on the whole but one night they sent us a place behind Notre Dame and within a few minutes I saw a large group of Americans who were also at our hotel strolling in. I think they must have been sent from the same guy...commission? If you want to stay closer to Saint Germain then have a look at Hotel Le Senat, which was a little closer to the action. If it's romance you're going for then Renaissance Paris Hotel Le Parc might be for you, but it's the opposite side of town. Overall this hotel was a great little base for our trip to Paris.

We traveled with two children so our hotel options were limited. Most hotels didn't allow four to a room. This hotel is highly rated on TripAdvisor.com and for very good reason. I studied for hours looking for a hotel and read so many reviews about small, unclean rooms. Not here. We stayed in a suite on the 5th floor (actually 6th floor, but they call the first floor 0) and it was very large with a king bed in the master bedroom and a pull out sofa for the kids, huge bathroom with the best shower. Everything is very modern and trendy. The photos on their web site looked good, but being there is better. The room was very clean. The lobby was spotless. We found the staff very helpful. Everyone spoke english. Everyone was very friendly. The downside for us was simply location. Some people would love the location because it is near Montparnasse Blvd, which is full or restaurants. Rue de Rennes is around the corner, which is a great shopping area. However, we wanted to wander around and do the typical tourist stuff and this was not ideal walking distance from any where. Nothing was less than a 30 minute walk. At first it wasn't a problem, but after a few days it started to impact us. The good news is that the Metro is just around the corner and easy to use. At night, less traffic, taxis were reasonable. From the Eiffel tower to the hotel was about $10 euros in a cab. If you go to Paris I highly recommend this hotel. Also, make sure you go to the Latin Quarter (rue mouffetard), it is a wonderful area.

This was the first time we stayed with them and it definitely will not be our last. Yes, they are not the cheapest (we paid ~\u00a3700 for four nights), but they were, in our opinion, definitely worth the extra money. We got a better deal directly through the hotel website (the same price but without breakfast on many travel sites). On arrival the staff were pleasant and courteous and we were quickly checked-in and shown to our room. Our shamefully poor command of the French language meant we had to converse in English, but this was no worry - every member of staff spoke excellent English. We were allocated a room on the first floor overlooking Rue Stanislas, with the double-glazed French window opening onto a very small balcony. The bed was very, very comfortable, the pillows just right and the modern, quiet aircon allowed us to adjust the temperature if we needed. The bathroom was very clean and the drench shower was a God-send after long days walking round Paris. There was no bath, but we were fine with that. The standard of housekeeping was excellent. Sheets were turned down of an evening and toiletries replenished (of course, being Molton Brown, these went down very well indeed). A couple of bathrobes were a bonus. One slight downside was the lack of English TV channels (news only I'm afraid), but then who goes to Paris to watch TV?!?!?!? Our room rate included the buffet breakfast, which for a small boutique hotel was quite extensive. Lots of cereals, pastries, hams, cheeses and even bacon & egg on offer. The service was excellent - very prompt. In terms of location, we were looking for a hotel in the Latin Quarter, so this really fit the bill! It's nothing but a short stroll from the Notre-dame des-Champs (Line 12) and Montparnasse Bienvenue (Lines 4, 6, 12 and 13). The short walk to Notre-dame des-Champs station gets you to the Place de la Concorde (ideal for the Louvre) and Abbesses (for the Sacre Coeur), whereas the walk to Montparnasse Bienvenue for the Line 6 will take you to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. Admittedly, the walk for the Line 6 is a little longer (perhaps 5-minutes), but this was a small price to pay! Also on the location front, there's a Monoprix supermarket within a 5-minute walk opposite Gare de Montparnasse; go here if you don't want to pay a fortune for mineral water (one Euro for 3 litres of Volvic!). There's no shortage of reasonably priced, good quality eateries in the area. We paid about twenty Euros each for a main course and an alcoholic drink (diet Coke is actually more expensive than alcohol). Arriving and departing: According to one of the delightful ladies on reception at the Hotel, the price of a taxi is between 50 and 80 Euros to CDG airport, so think hard about that option! We took the RER Line B into the City (about 9 Euros each), but decided it against it on our return to CDG because of kerfuffle with cases on trains etc etc; instead, we took the Air France bus from Montparnasse station. This was 16 Euros each one-way, but a guaranteed seat and dropped of right at the terminal! Overall, this hotel was about \u00a350 per night more expensive than a four-star chain hotel (ie Hilton, Le Meridien), but it is beautifully presented and the staff are all excellent. I'd certainly rate it at least one star higher than most of the big-chain equivalents.

After exhaustive searched of Tripadvisor and other such websites, we were fraught with worry about choosing the right accommodations. With Le Six, we were totally at ease with our choice. The staff was eager to please, and handled each of our requests smoothly. They tolerated my sometimes halting attempts at French ( which got better with usage) with good nature, and other American guests who just flat-out loudly spoke English at all times (which I thought a bit rude, but c'est la vie.) The room, like 99% of others in Paris, was small; but the bathroom was comparatively large, and the bed cozy. The style of the hotel was chic-ly Euro, and the included (when we booked the room)\"American breakfast,\" featured a good selection of cheeses, smoked salmon, and great bread and fruit juices. The negatives we found were a pretty disappointing water pressure in the shower, and an annoying sign-on for the wireless internet, which I used with my iPod Touch to look up restaurants (on Tripadvisor Mobile, of course) and send emails back home. One major score was a restaurant around the corner, Le Parc Aux Cerfs, which I'll add a review of soon. The neighborhood around the hotel was wonderful, with plenty of good eating options, an entire street lined with Creperies just up Bvd Montparnasse. (Hint: Everyone we spoke to said that Josselin Creperie was the best of the bunch; we ate there and loved it!), also many Huitres in the area (shellfish, seafood). Only a 10 minute stroll to the RER \"B\" line train, as well, which took us straight to CDG airport on our departure day (but not before we loaded up on baguettes, Pain de Chocolate and such for the troops back home) Also close by to the Metro, and a short walk to the posh St Germain shopping district.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cThe absolute best hotel!\u201d", "Author": "rbrnyc", "ReviewID": "UR63153906", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights in Le Six after reading all the positive reviews here.

Booking directly with the hotel meant we had a deal which included breakfast, free WiFi, and use of the steam bath in the basement spa for up to 30 minutes a day. The breakfast we thought very good indeed, though would not have paid 22 euros each on top of room rate. Hotel is located near to montparnasse which means it is handy for lots of restaurants as well as being near Notre Dame des Champs metro (1 minute walk) and Vavin on the more useful Line 4 is two minutes away.

While this boutique hotel is quite lovely all on its own, the exceptional, friendly staff make it even more so. First, however, I'll comment on the rooms. We stayed in a suite, which is a nice size and is well-appointed in a contemporary style. We like the suite because it has a door separating the livingroom from the bedroom (we don't always wake up at the same time, so this configuration afforded us a bit more shut-eye if one of us were up and about). If this isn't a concern, however, the junior suites are very nice, as well, but don't have the separating door. We didn't see any other rooms, so we can't comment. The bathrooms have a large tub and large walk-in shower, all surrounded by brownish marble. The hotel offers Moulton Brown toiletries - a nice touch. The rooms are large by Parisian standards, but well-priced. They are likewise a comfortable size by North American standards. There are many restaurants and shops near the hotel, but to access most tourist sites requires about a 10-minute metro ride. The metros are located very close to the hotel, so it's no problem. Also, the hotel staff are excellent at giving directions (whether you're traveling by foot, metro, or bus), so you're sure not to get lost. We absolutely loved our stay at Hotel Le Six, especially because the staff is so exceptional. They are competent, friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable - absolutely top-notch (and we're not easy customers to please!). It felt like coming home whenever we returned to the hotel from a day's excursion. Staff members go out of their way to help solve any problems you might encounter (problems that will likely be of no relation to the hotel). They really do go above and beyond to make your stay special and easy. I had a massage at the spa on the lower level, and highly recommend it. The rooms have a soothing East Asian contemporary vibe to them and, apparently, there's even a hammam (although I didn't try it). All in all, we highly recommend Hotel Le Six. The only suggestion for improvement I could make is for the hotel to offer room service.

The location is perfect, and the hotel is immaculate, chic and comfortable. But most importantly, the staff is the best in Paris. Unlike some hotels where the receptionists confuse snootiness with class, each and every employee we met was warm, kind and helpful. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome, including my teenagers and energetic youngest. We arrived from an overnight flight many hours before check-in, expecting only to leave our luggage for the intervening hours. Instead, they allowed us to check in immediately which was a huge relief with three boys (18, 16 and 9). We were able to rest and shower and start our first day in Paris feeling rested and refreshed instead of dragging ourselves around until we could check in to our rooms. I've done that and it is not fun. The staff is multilingual, but they were kind enough to let me practice my tortured French on them. Free wireless is a huge plus for my teenagers and me, and they even loaned us electrical adapters, as I had forgotten ours at home. Even though the gym is very small, my husband and older sons used it every day. But really, who needs a gym in Paris? You walk or bike everywhere, so a full day of activities is all the exercise you need. The breakfast at 22 Euros is expensive when there are so many cafes so close. Nevertheless, two of my sons partook on our last morning and said it was delicious. I had intended to join them, but soaking in the deep bathtub full of Molton Brown bubbles was a luxury for which I was willing to give up food. Amazing toiletries included a luxurious tube of lip moisturizer that I made sure to take with me when we left. We spent a few days in Aix-en-Provence before returning to le Six. Unfortunately my youngest son left his suitcase on the platform in the excitement of boarding the TGV. Audrey Pernot, the front desk manager, was unbelievably helpful, even offering to pick it up in Aix when she traveled to a town about 60 km away later in the month and send it to us in the States. I'm still humbled by her kindness. There isn't enough of that in the world, and even less it seems in four star hotels in major world cities. I could continue raving about our stay, but I'm already afraid that when the rest of the world learns about Hotel Le Six, we won't be able to book a room on our next trip.

Overall we were quite happy with our choice of hotel for our first visit to Paris. Since it was our first visit we did alot of sightseeing and were quite busy/tired so it was nice to come back to a room/hotel we enjoyed and could relax in. The positives: Very friendly and helpful english speaking front desk staff - overall they were really great and pleasant to interact with and made our stay that much more enjoyable Very clean rooms and prompt housekeeping and no smell of cigarette smoke whatsoever in the rooms/hotel We were staying in the jr. suite on the top floor, it has a beautiful bathroom and the room feels like you are staying in your own little apartment in Paris. Minimalist/modern decor with hardwood floors Ironing board/iron available in room Potential Downfalls: You can be fooled by the address, despite the address of being in the 6th arrondissment so you are in fact at the edge of it away from the heart of the area and you end up being closer to the Montparnasse area. Which is not a bad thing, it has cute cafes/shops in the area and we enjoyed it, but some people may find it far from the sites if they are only staying a few days. The internet connection was on and off during our visit which we did need access to so that was frustrating The breakfast buffet was quite minimal and sparse - we only did it once and opted to eat at the local restaurants instead We could hear the next door guest walking around his room in the evenings, luckily he was by himself and we didn't hear any talking etc. to keep us up.

The room was spacious for Paris, immaculately clean, at a good temperature and very comfortable - and this was a standard room. All the hotel staff were openly friendly and on hand to assist with all the enquiries we had - exactly what we needed. Thanks to them we had a stress free holiday and we left Paris wanting to return. Unfortunately, we had rain for a few days during our stay and the umbrellas provided free by the Hotel were a nice touch and well needed. We didn't eat at the Hotel but in reality there was no need. Within a stones throw there is an abundance of cafes and we usually took a 10 minute walk to Germain De Pres which had even more choice.

We arrived from our late afternoon flight feeling a bit tired and grumpy from the Air France shuttle bus. The hotel was a short walk from the bus stop near the Montparnasse Tower, which made it very easy to find from any spot in Paris. All we had to do was look for the big black tower and head in that direction. General Information Hotel Le Six consists of 35 rooms and six suites. It's decorated in a modern motif, with lots of reds and oranges, along with pictures of planets. There's a big screen television in the lobby. When we were there, it seemed like there was a continous fashion show going on. Hotel Le Six has a spa, a small cocktail bar (which is run on the honor system), and a small fitness room. Breakfast is offered for 22 euros per person. We did not use the spa, but the man who checked us in told us the hammam is free for guests to use as long as they make an appointment. Check in Checking in was a breeze. A nicely dressed young man who spoke excellent English took us to room 506, a classic (low end) room at the end of the hall. Our room Our classic room was fairly small and interestingly laid out. It was sort of like a horseshoe, with the bathroom on the other side of the room. There was a very comfortable king sized bed, a large window that opened into a decorated shaft, a telephone, a mini bar and a closet. The room came with free wifi; we asked for the code from the reception. There was also a small desk and a flat screen television mounted on the wall. The television got several news channels in English; I can't comment on what else was available, since my husband pretty much manned the remote. Unfortunately, the room was so small that it was hard to actually sit at the desk. I was glad to see that the room also had a coffee set up that even included hot chocolate, even if we didn't use it. The bathroom The bathroom had a nice tub and a rainfall shower. However, the first time I tried to get in the tub, I slipped and bruised the inside of my legs. The same thing happened to my husband when he tried it. Also, there was a screen mounted on the tub, but it didn't the greatest job keeping the water from getting on the floor. The bathroom came with high end toiletries, a towel warmer, a makeup mirror, bathrobes, and very nice, soft towels. Service We found a nice welcome note left on the desk for us upon arrival. There was a magazine about Paris in English, as well as a couple of French magazines. The maid service was prompt about cleaning the room and did a very thorough job. We came back to the room on Saturday and took a nap, then went out again until the evening. When we got back, the bed was remade and turned down. Two nougats were left on our pillows. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, too. Noise There was very little noise to speak of at Hotel Le Six. In fact, while Montparnasse is a rather busy, bustling, noisy part of Paris, we immediately noticed a drop in the noise level as soon as we turned onto Rue Stanislas. The hotel is located on a lovely tree lined street next to a big, beautiful church. The whole area is very serene; in fact, the Luxembourg Gardens are a short walk away. If you're looking for a quiet place to sleep, Hotel Le Six is likely to fit the bill nicely. We found the bed to be very comfortable, too. I slept like a rock. Some things to know Hotel Le Six is not very close to the big tourist spots in Paris. We were able to walk to the Eiffel Tower, but it was a bit of a hike. Luckily, there is a metro stop very close to Hotel Le Six for those who would rather not walk. Frankly, I was kind of glad not to be right in the heart of tourist land. Check in is at 2:00pm. Check out is at noon. One child aged 3 and under may stay for free when sharing the room with a parent. Please inform the hotel ahead of time. Small dogs can be accommodated. There's a great sushi place right next door to the hotel, as well as a very interesting French/Iranian/Greek style restaurant at the end of Rue Stanislas. There are also several nearby good places to go for breakfast if you don't want to spend 22 euros a person for the American buffet at the hotel. Overall We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Le Six and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. However, we would advise looking online for a good deal. Our room had a rack rate of 300 euros, which I thought was a bit expensive for what we got. The 189 euros per night rate we got from Expedia.com was more reasonable.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel!\u201d", "Author": "JadoreParis11", "ReviewID": "UR29040275", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a week-long vacation in Paris and we absolutely adored this hotel.

The decor is classy and sophisticated, with plenty of lighting (2) The concierge is one of the nicest and most helpful I've ever encountered. Everyone is smiling and helpful. They go out of their way to help you. When I asked if they might have some bubble wrap lying around so I could wrap my wine and place it in my suitcase, one of the gentlemen proceeded to double wrap my bottle of wine with paper, padding and tape...and took great care to do it well. The bottle could've been dropped off the building and it wouldn't have shattered. The service is quick as well. (3) The neighborhood is grand. Don't stay in the touristy areas if you can help it because they are overpriced and don't allow you a sense of what Paris is like. The 6th arrondissement is ideal because it's chic, preppy and clean, is close to all the sites by metro (or walking to the Jardins du Luxembourg) for instance, and is near a lot of great, authentic French restaurants and bars. Who wants to spend time in Paris surrounded by a bunch of Americans. Get the real French experience...and the location of the Hotel Le Six will provide that. (4) Housekeeping is fantastic. The rooms are spotless and the towels are warming up when you return. Their response time is great too. They check up on you once or twice during the day to turn down the bed etc. I could probably go on and on. The company paid for my stay which is lucky for me because it wasn't cheap. But it's worth every penny. I highly recommend this hotel and encourage everyone to stay here. I will definitely return on my next trip out to Paris.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Angie059", "ReviewID": "UR26612445", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Le Six for 2 days and the staff made us feel at home.

Very modern with a bohemienne touch, very friendly and helpful staff. Great, puffy pillows, free sleepers and soft towels. Just great! Not to mention the comfortable bed! Anyone travelling to Paris I believe you should stop by. It offers a great service compared to the price.

We chose this hotel from previous reviews on this site. From the outset we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff are most welcoming, as well as being friendly, pleasing and very helpful. The room we received was great, looking to the front of hotel on to a quiet little street, with excellent choice of restaurants, cafes and bars just at the top of the road. A main metro line is less than 5 minute walk away. The location of this hotel is excellent. Our room was wonderful, with great little touches to the room. There were bathrobes and slippers provided in room as well as tea/coffee making facilities, which is most unusual in parisian hotels. An excellent ensuite with large walk in shower and molton brown products sealed the deal!! The buffet breakfast was well stocked with excellent choice with something for everyone and again very pleasing staff most accommadating.
