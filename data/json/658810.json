{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the Sofitel Wanda I recently stayed 3 nights at the Sofitel Wanda. I was on an escorted tour of China The hotel is beautiful. All of our hotels were 5 star. Out of all of them The Sofitel was my favorite. The staff is extremely helpful and went out of their way to accomodate us. They were eager to practice thier English skills and happy to talk to us no matter what we requested. In fact we asked for a different room because our toilet didn't flush on the second day. There was no problem at all changing rooms. The accomodations are beautiful, and modern with comfortable beds. I loved the comforter/quilts....just like home. The bathroom has the largest rainbow shower head I ever saw in my life. There are nice touches all over the room including orchids  fruit baskets. Two bottles of water are supplied daily by the hotel. If you want more all you have to do is ask. Someone will come to your room immediately with more water. The service at this hotel is amazing!!The breakfast buffet is fantastic. It includes everything you could ever want for breakfast...including Chinese food; which I looked forward to every morning. I didn't have a lot of free time to wander around the area. I did visit a very upscale mall which is a few blocks away. I also went to a Walmart which is also very close to the hotel. There are several restaurants and shops located within walking distance. As I said, I didn't have a lot of free time in Beijing to explore the area. I would definitely stay at this hotel again because I really thought it was a beautiful hotel.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR618187994", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "smooshie"}, {"Content": "Not close to the action Three nights at the Wanda Sofitel Beijing was long enough. This hotel is in one of the business districts of Beijing, but not close to the central attractions - so visiting anything else requires rather lengthy journeys, given the traffic on Beijing roads.The hotel is modern and spacious with an attentive staff - although some need more training in how to be helpful without being intrusive. The rooms are large and comfortable, and everything works well. The indoor pool is a superb one. The conference areas are pleasant, but the hotel adjoins a cinema and shopping complex - so some conferences seem to involve invasion by thousands. The food is really excellent, with a magnificent choice. The hotel is impressively clean. Check-in and check-out were good. However, I would prefer to stay somewhere closer to the centre - where you don't have to sit in a bus for 30-90 minutes to reach the main attractions.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR566734940", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "FrequentFrier"}, {"Content": "Wow! This is a GREAT hotel! I've stayed in over a dozen hotels in Beijing for business. The Sofitel is BY FAR THE BEST. New and stylish. Nothing was out of place. Great fitness centre, good food, convenient to the CBD. Near two subway lines and on the east side of the city for convenient access to the airport. The rooms just ooze fabulous. Good bathroom products and most of all, good lighting in the rooms. All of my clients who met me in the lobby were quite impressed with how stylish the hotel looks.I will DEFINITELY stay here again!", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR458484461", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jetlagwoofer"}, {"Content": "Perfection at the Sofitel Wanda Staggeringly good and stylish hotel, whether for biz or leisure. If there are better in Beijing then I sure as hell haven't stayed there (and I have stayed at a pretty decent sprinkling of 5* properties in the capital).Rooms = fantastic. I was in a deluxe room (ie. standard) and found no fault at all. Big enough. Bathroom wonderful. Bed comfy. Tastefully decorated. Flat screen TV. View wasn't up to much, but they have FREE WI-FI. I have stayed in plenty of top-end hotels which insist you pay extra for internet access - and it really pisses me off. But this comes complimentary at the Sofitel, which makes me a very happy boy.Location is ok. 35 mins from airport. Close to the weirdly-shaped CCTV building, and within easy reach of Sanlitun. Not far from the subway, but I'm a taxi man (unless really pressed), so no complaints.Breakfast was included in my rate - and was decent. Didn't try the other restaurants - but then again my expense account wasn't vast this time around (sadly). The Japanese restaurant is supposed to be excellent.Pool, although indoor, is sublime. Massive. Very friendly staff. Lovely girls on reception. English speaking.Will certainly stay here again and will recommend everyone else to do so as well.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR958391428", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "golfer78"}, {"Content": "very flash Great new hotel, standard rooms very large nicely decorated , great features like rain shower and tv in bathroom .

Lots of staff who are happy to help. Booked their car transfer from the airport - staff meet you directly off the plane - take you to immigration, baggage claim and out to car. It was quite expensive when a taxi is about a fifth of the price - however we had a late arrival. Hotel room was everything you needed - very modern - great bathroom - once again - sofitel have the most comfortable beds. Great location.

It cost about 70 RMB by taxi from the airport. We booked Deluxe rooms (as always in Asia, 'deluxe' means the smallest room in the hotel) but the room was large and the bed huge. Two TVs in the room, one by the bed and one by the bath. Interactive service sporadic, but TV signal fine with CNN, BBC and TV5. Kettle in room which was good, given that breakfast was 200 RMB.Free broadband, both cabled and WiFi was also appreciated.Bathroom huge with rain shower, big bath etc. Huge safe in the room which fitted a laptop and more.Only sorry that I had one day here so didn't have time to use the other facilities.Hotel is 5 mins walk from a metro stop (Dawangli on Line 1) and you can be at Tiananmen Square in 10 mins for 2RMB ticket.Behind the hotel is a WalMart supermarket, a Starbucks and a New World Department Store.

The hotel at first glance is pure luxury and glamour. The lobby area is impressive and well designed with crystals, lush draperies, chandeliers and clever lighting. However, one night's stay will reveal all it's flaws and much needed attention to details. Problem areas:1) the TV did not work because of a faulty connection behind the flatscreen TV. I'm obviously the first resident of this new room.2) they must have been fixing a light bulb in the bathroom before I checked in - they left a ladder in the bathroom and left a lot of dirt in the bathtub3) again, I must have been a ginna pig - when I first turned on the shower hose, mud water came out. Watch out folks!4) the water kettle stored in a cabinet near the front door - no where near the mini-bar - who would have thought?Overall, the decor is impressive, the staff friendly (English not superb though), and situated in a good location in Chaoyang.

This hotel is pure luxury in an otherwise dull and grey city. The hotel has everything, several restaurants (chinese, french, casual, night club/bar), gym, swimmingpool, beauty salon and more. The hotel is brand new, and it really shows. It looks like a palace, and I've stayed in several hotels worldwide (also in other places in Asia, so Asian hospitality is familiar to me), and used to work in a five stars hotel a few years back. Oh yeah, did I mention that the rooms are huge! They had very friendly staff who were always very eager to help. They really proved themselves when I left my brand new, top of the line, Nokia mobile phone in the hotel room as I left for Shanghai. They sent it with DHL to Shanghai and I got it the following day! This is why I don't mind paying extra, a hotel that lives up to their service promises. I write this review even with the risk of them becoming more popular as I might not get a room next time, but they deserve it.
