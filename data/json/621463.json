Upon Arrival another guest stole my IPAD while I was checking in. I immediately told the front desk staff and the response was \"What do you want us to do\"?. There was a camera system there and initially they refused to view the film. I called police and again requested we view the film. We were able to determine that there was one couple who must have taken the IPAD due to the fact that they were the only ones in the lobby at the time of the incident. Management refused to even ask them if they had seen my IPAD and did nothing. I am sure if it was them who were robbed they would have viewed the video in a timely fashion and attempted to locate my stolen property. This all happened in plain view while I was checking in. If you stay there remember that WHEN your stuff is stolen management will do NOTHING to help you retrieve.

The staff at the hotel are extremely nice, the rooms spacious and well appointed, and I loved the tub with the jets! Just out back is another rental property, and sitting in its parking garage watching the sun set over the bay was one of the most peaceful experiences I've had. I suppose it's entirely different in high season, but that's the beauty of off-season. A huge room with breakfast for $50 can't be beat. The bike lane is right out front, and walking to the beach takes about 3 minutes as the island is so narrow. The hotel is about 30-odd blocks from the north end of boardwalk, but with my bike I had no issues. The staff also said I could keep my bike in my room if I wished. (I just left it locked on my car rack) The elevator is nice and big so it would not be a problem. The fitness center was decent enough to work up a sweat before breakfast. The only issues I had were minor- no \"Do Not Disturb\" hangtag for my door, and the pen and notepad were hidden in a drawer so I had to scramble to find something when taking a phone message. The housekeeping staff replaced the hangtag as soon as they saw my handwritten note in the door. There is a computer and printer for guest use in the breakfast room so checking email was easy. There is covered parking, which is nice if the weather doesn't cooperate. I would definitely stay again, kudos to the the incredible staff here.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia beach", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service!\u201d", "Author": "cpo-chick", "ReviewID": "UR48002958", "Content": "The service at this Best Western was outstanding.

The room was a standard but spacious with a plenty of seating for relaxing or eating. Once again the room and all other areas were spotless and staff helpful. The first time I stayed here in 2007 I was with the same tour group. This hotel had everything ready and our check-in was completed before we exited the bus and our luggage taken to our rooms. The same process was done upon check-out. Great large clean rooms/suites, accommodating and pleasant staff. The free continental breakfast is a plus for those who may be on a budget. Additionally in room fridges and coffee maker make this a winner for a moderate priced stay in Ocean City, Maryland.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save a few bucks by staying a block from the beach instead of on the beach and who doesn't want to be near the board walk. Don't try to check in before three. We got there at 2:30 and had to kill about 45 minutes. You will not be wowed by this hotel (the picture on this site is pretty much the whole picture). You will feel comfortable, safe, clean, frugal, etc. If that's what you're looking for, go for it.
