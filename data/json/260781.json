The rooms themselves were a good size and certainly had a traditional Venetian theme to them. The hotel had recently been refurbished and was to a good standard. The bathroom was clean and had a good power shower with bedding and towels being replaced everyday. The only draw back I would say about the room was that it was advertised as having Saterlite Tv. This however just means the only channel in English is CNN. I know its not a deal breaker but it is a nice option to have a TV to watch if the weather is bad and your confined to the room. Breakfast was very basic, coffee/tea, a coissant and a couple of bread rolls and that was it. The staff were friendly and spoke quite good English and made a few suggestions of what we could do since the weather was so bad!

If you don't know that you are looking for it you would not find it. Follow the hotel directions and you will find it in minutes. Leaving the bus stationp ass the three bridges, walk a minute or two along the water and then make one right then a second right and you find it. EXCELLENT PRICE AND VALUE! Minutes from the bus station and train station this hotel is magnificent. Small hotel, clean room and excellent service from Pietro. Every morning breakfast is delivered to your room by pietro at the time that is most accomodating to you. He is very discreat and he is not a bother. THE ROOM is large enough for a european hotel and is extremely clean! The room is cleaned daily and has an in room safe, satellite tv, phone and desk. AC in room and whole hotel!!! NO ELEVATOR!! BAGGAGE STORAGE!! THE BATHROOM is newly renovated and includes all the neccesities you may nead including a bidet. They give enough towels and change them everyday. The whole time that we were there, there was construction in the hotel but we did not feel bothered by it. Our room was on the ground floor and we did not hear anyone at reception or walking around the hotel. LOCATION: EXCELLENT!! Minutes from the grand canal, train station and bus station. All we did was walk and we did not feel the need to look for transportation unless we were going to Murano. Venice is not a city to lug around your luggage in from place to place since there are so many bridges. If you plan on doing that either take a water taxi to get to your destination or pack light. Pietro speaks english and he is ready to answer all you questions. Outside the hotel there is a water well and the water is safe to drink!

The rooms were cute and clean and the location was great. The breakfast was not memorable. A piece of dry white bread, jam and a packaged pastry. Also, the lovely view of the dining area outside. Not that lovely and you can't eat out there. We had the room at the end of the lobby area and it was really noisy and you could smell the smoke from the guy at the front desk.

The breakfast was served in our room every morning right on time and it was perfect to start the day that way! The best is the location of this hotel, it's in a quiet part of town and easy to get to everything. Even from Plaza Roma with having to carry stuff over just a few bridges and the walk was easy, so that helped with everything. The other good thing about this place and it's location is that it is so close to Plaza Roma you jump on the vapporetto and the next stop is the train station.. perfect nice and close! My in-laws loved it and so did my husband and I. The staff was great, they did have construction they were doing on the hotel but never did it too early or too late in the day so it was no issue. It is hiden off the main walk way but if you ask, people are so friendly they will show you where it is at.

The outside terrace is no longer available for breakfast and guests have to take this in their rooms (ours was very small and dark). When we asked if we could carry our tray out onto the terrace we were told by the older man on reception (owner?) quite rudely that this was impossible as they no longer had a licence to serve breakfast there and would get into trouble with the police - all website descriptions of the hotel currently show a photo of a pretty terrace where breakfast can be taken. The older receptionist/owner? was dismissive and unwelcoming, which was a shame. He could have made up for the inconveniences by being more pleasant.
