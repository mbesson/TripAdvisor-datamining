My friend booked the room as she has stayed here on a few other occasions. I unfortunately read everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reviews on here before I went so I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t holding out any hope of it being anything more than a hell hole. Firstly, without the risk of sounding like a snob, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never stayed in a hotel like it, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad. The hotel owns 5 other hotels on the same street, you check in at Holly House Hotel. We were staying in Cedar Hotel and in the only basement room (room 71) in the hotel. When we got into the room it was being cleaned, so we left our bags and went exploring round London. By the time we got back, the room had been cleaned. It was boiling hot and looked to be clean and tidy. We had 2 (clean) towels each and a bar of soap. The tea and coffee facilities were good; the mugs, water glasses and spoon were all individually packed which was a good sign. The beds were comfy and despite people on here saying that they were dirty, they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We booked a twin room and got a triple room, which was 1 single and 1 double bed. There was a small flat screen TV which was good and a decent sized mirror too, ample plug sockets around the room too. There is also a fridge in the room which came in handy for pre-theatre drinks. The only downside to the room was the bathroom, it was tiny and smelt grim. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem the cleanest either. But, the shower was good with a constant supply of hot water. They serve breakfast from 7am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 9am but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try it. Being in the basement room, anyone who walked up and down the corridor above us woke me up. And in the morning, when some inconsiderate guests were going for breakfast, who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very quiet at all, I got woke up by them (the restaurant is in the basement too) The room also backed onto the train line behind the hotel, which was very busy but the noise of the trains wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad, unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a light sleeper. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book this hotel for a nice break to the City with my partner but I probably would stay here again with a friend, as location wise it was perfect for us (we were going to the Victoria Theatre) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend it to people but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say to strictly avoid it, especially if you are on a tight budget.

It was clean, the staff were friendly, and suitable for a short stay on a tight budget. The room was small but clean, the en suite was tiny but functional, it had a small fridge, kettle and tea and coffee, and a small TV.

On arrival the reception was fine nothing special but then the room was just completely NOT what I expected. The decor is dingy and univiting generally but the rooms felt like I had booked time in a nuns convent. The room was cramped with two small single beds somehow shoved in, with just about room to move on foot from one side to the other or to bathroom. The bedding was clean but so basic and bland. Being at the top it was so warm and we could only open the top part of the window which made no difference. BUT then the ensuite - now I am not a big person but I struggled to fit myself in there to use the toilet which was badly put in as you could not even keep the seat lid up, you had to balance it on your back and the shower was just NOT going to be attempted to be used as it was so univiting and small to say the least. Then to top it off I was expecting a bit of choice at breakfast with the continental declaration and firstly there was no room for 3 of us in this hotel so we got sent down the road to another one that we barely got into. The choice then was poor, one piece of toast each and a couple of cereals to choose from. It was all too small and dingy for my liking, I wished I had booked the holiday inn. On the plus side I found the beds clean and comfortable and like I said the location was ideal.

Handy location. The shower had plentiful hot water. You are given a map which entitles you to tourist discounts, and a business guide to the area. The sheets were clean and the staff, while not bursting with enthusiasm, were pleasant enough. But...the place looks as if it's been furnished from a council skip. It's shabby, tatty, grubby, grim, dreadful by any standard of taste. Although the sheets were clean, the headboard wasn't. I didn't dare look at the mattress. There was a folding chair/bed covered in nameless stains. Ugh. My room, booked as single, had a double bed, which was a bonus, and also bunk beds, so it could have been let to a family of four. There was something which was supposed to be a wardrobe, very narrow and unable to take anything longer than a jacket. Inside were two hangers. In a room for four? Come on! There was a TV, which I didn't bother with. No hairdryer, no facility to make hot drinks in rooms. The 'view' from my window was a cell-like concrete yard with a grime-caked toddler's plastic swing in it, nothing else, not even a pot plant. Despite being near to Victoria, the hotel would have been quite quiet, if not for a loud electronic bleep that went off four times every six seconds or so, and continued all night. I don't know what it was but I now have some idea what it feels like to undergo the Chinese water torture. For breakfast I was offered cornflakes, cocoa pops or all- bran. I don't like any of these, but chose cornflakes as the least sickly and received a fair-sized portion. Toast was white, no brown bread on offer, no margarine. Just white bread, butter, jam. The coffee came as instant coffee powder with a pot of hot water, a new low in B&B catering as far as I'm concerned. NB the Ivy House hotel next door is the same establishment!

I chose this hotel because we were going on a 3 day Theatre break in London, travelling by coach and wanted to be close to the coach station. This is THE ONLY positive thing about this hotel. On arrival we were sent to another hotel, obviously part of the same group of hotels, 5 doors away where we had been put in the first room on the ground floor, conveniently located right next to the front door!! which was constantly being opened throughout the night, it was a heavy door on a spring so everyone walked in and let the door slam shut after them, this shook our room and woke us up several times. The windows were old fashioned single pane sash windows, in fact my husband thought the window was wide open as it was so noisy and draughty!! The ensuite was ridiculous, the door opened only part way as the toilet stopped it and you had to sit on the loo at a 45% angle, the toilet seat was loose, the cold water tap had no pressure, there was no plunger on the sink plug so it could not be filled, the light fitting had been placed in such a way that the door caught on it when you opened it, the wood weather board on the inside of the door was hanging off with 2 screws sticking out, the toilet itself was surprisingly, clean !! There was a shelf above the radiator which was sloping so badly that you couldn't put anything on it. The \"wardrobe\" was a home built affair that was about 12 inches wide,,,,useless.There was a fridge,,,,,noisy all night long. The whole room needed a coat of paint, wallpaper was hanging off the wall, and there were greasy marks on the wall above the bed where people had been leaning,,,,,,,yuk !!! all these things could have so easily been put right for a few pounds.

Starting with the cons: 1) Do NOT count on the Wifi they claim to have. In the 3 days we were there, it was working for half a day. (They were also completely unapologetic when it was down, which was almost constantly.) More importantly, the Wifi does NOT work at all in any of the houses, other than the main \"Holly House.\" As other reviewers have pointed out, there are a few houses all in a row next to the Holly House itself, and its more likely than not that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll actually be staying in one of these houses, rather than \"Holly House\" proper. So I definitely feel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty misleading on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part to claim they have Wifi because it rarely works, and actually only functions in just one of the many houses that they put their guests up in. We were counting on the Wifi to make plans/be in touch with friends and not having it was beyond inconvenient. (Luckily the Starbucks around the corner has free Wifi, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still not super-convenient when you thought you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be emailing from bed.) 2) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a generally dinginess to the hotel, just in general. Nothing atrocious, but not super well-maintained. 3) The rooms are truly minuscule. We had big bags, as we were traveling for almost 2 weeks, and we could barely open them inside the room. I know, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re barely in the room anyway when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling, but by day 3 I was lusting after the Days Inn around the corner... 4) No fans/temperature moderation of any kind. I bet this is probably fine usually, but it did get quite warm when we were there (it was August) so the room definitely had some stuffiness to it. But you can open the windows, that helped a bit. But there are also pros! 1) LOCATION! The posh Victoria neighborhood is super safe, beautiful, and about as centrally located as you can get. Minutes from the tube/buses/coaches/rail lines, etc. 2) They really mean it when they say they have 24-hour check in. We arrived at some God-awful hour, like 2 AM, and the check in desk was manned, as promised, and our room was ready for us. 3) Clean sheets and everything, every day. 4) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fridge! Great for leftovers. So all in all, as an already-broke American dealing with a horrific exchange rate, I found this hotel to be, ya know, okay. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the whole Wifi fiasco I think the experience would have been exponentially better.
