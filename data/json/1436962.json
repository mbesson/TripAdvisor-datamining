Overall, the hotel was very good, rooms were modern and very clean. We were given a room on the first floor which had views over the street and a large bathroom. Unfortunately, we found the noise from outside really loud! We have stayed in many large cities before without any effects on sleeping and expect traffic noise, but I honestly felt that we slept with the window open through the night. The hotel staff dealt with our concerns very well and offered us a room which faced the courtyard. This was quieter, although there was still noise from other doors slamming along the corridor. Rooms are well equiped with hairdryers, plenty of plug sockets, safe, wardrobe and the a good range of toiletries are provided. Breakfast was average, selection of fruit, cereals, yoghurts, pastries, bread, ham cheese etc. Was very busy at the weekend and would advise going down a bit earlier. Certainly enough to keep you going until lunch time. Location of the hotel was very good, short walk from Lepanto metro station, which connects you with other parts of Rome. We particularly enjoyed walking to the Vatican City with an ice cream at night, it's nice and quiet and looks lovely lit up. There are some nice restaurants in the local area, we found a selection as we walked to the Vatican City. There is a nice bar a few doors down from the hotel, it's on the corner of Via Cicerone and Piazza Cola di Rienzo. It was always busy day and night full of locals, it's a good place for a drink at any time of the day! I would still recommend this hotel, as it is a modern hotel for a good price (something which was difficult to find in Rome), just perhaps not to light sleepers!", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel and fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "matthew789", "ReviewID": "UR127081018", "Content": "my partner and i stayed here for 3 nights, loved every minute of it. the hotel is a fantastic location, very clean and modern, couldn't of asked for much more, a great place to come back and relax too. also at night we found it very quiet considering this is a major city. its surrounded by cafes, ice cream parlours and shops which seem to be a lot cheaper than those which are located on the other side of the bridge. we walked everywhere and found it fine, approx 10 minutes to the vatican, 15 too spanish steps and trevi fountain and 20-25 to the colosseum. would highly recommend getting tour guides at the vatican and the colosseum. 1.because you skip the queues 2. because you have no idea on where to start first! . felt extremely safe walking around rome at night, but like any city you should still be aware of whats going on and keep an eye open for pick pockets. there are a few beggar's and people trying to sell you stuff, which does get a bit annoying, but to be honest we didn't get troubled too much and you just have to firmly say no and carry on walking. just don't make eye contact in the first place! the food in rome is very pricey, tastes good but nothing special, just have to accept it. there is so much to do and see in rome, you are never going to see it all so we planned out what we wanted to see and spaced it out. if you try doing too much it becomes very stressful and you cant take any more information in. don't ruin your holiday! all in all we absolutely loved rome and would love to go back.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing! twentyone hotel and Rome\u201d", "Author": "j199010", "ReviewID": "UR126986758", "Content": "The twentyone hotel was perfect I couldn\u2019t say a bad word about it. The hotel is well presented and rooms kept clean by the maids every day. The staff were very nice and polite, any questions you have they will help. Rooms are modern and well decorated, and equipped with everything you need. In the morning, there is a nice continental breakfast, everything thing you would expect from a four star hotel. Also located in the hotel is a small bar, this is good, and they serve food into the evening, or if you just want a drink. Checking in and out was very easy, they ask for your passport and card you booked with and make a copy when you check in. When you check out, you need to pay the city tax, this is around 3euors per night. The location is brilliant, you can walk to all the main sites and only ten min walk away from the Vatican city. The road the hotel is situated on, is full of shops, cafes and restaurants. Opposite the hotel, there is a ice cream and crepe shop, you must go there for a snack, also next to that is a cute caf\u00e9 to grab a drink. All around the city you will find ice cream stands, it is the best ice cream I have ever tasted they are full of flavour and not to expensive. Food in Rome is general expensive, but you cant really avoid that. There are lots of baggers and people trying to sell you things, and all you can do I say no a walk away, some will accept that, but other will be forceful, but just keep walking. I recommend getting tours around the collosuim, Vatican and the roman ruins, you avoid the queues and have somebody to explain the history of Rome, it really does help make it more fascinating. Rome is a beautiful city, the people are well dressed and it is full of designer shops so bring plenty of money if you like shopping! From the airport to the hotel we used a shuttle bus service called consorzio airport shuttle bus, it\u2019s a shared bus that goes to central hotels in Rome this only cost \u00a324 for a round trip per person. We booked through expedia so I recommend this service.

Just ask, and the staff will tell you how to get to anywhere that you want to go. It was my birthday, and I love the spa. The hotel staff suggested El Spa which is only a 5 minute walk, and it was wonderful. The hotel is in a very safe neighborhood, and as everyone has said, is right near the attractions and close to the metro. The hotel is clean, but the rooms are not as small as expected based on previous reviews. Our double faced Via Cola di Rienzo which has plenty of shops and restaurants, but best deals are with the street vendors right outside the hotel. The breakfast buffet (included) was plentiful but became very boring after a couple of days. The dinner buffet for 12 euro was also plentiful, but how many times can you eat bread and cold cuts? We also visited the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, T-Bone Station, and McDonald\u2019s for some American food and caught a bus from St. Peters Basilica to the Castel Romano Designer Outlet for 13 euro round-trip to get away from the crowds and for some less expensive designer shopping. My husband and I went everywhere...the Vatican City, the Sistine Chapel, St. Peters Basilica, the Spanish steps, Trevi Fountain, but rode an open-top bus to the Coliseum and the more distant sites. The open-top buses are right at the Vatican City. The WIFI sucks, and there were only three English channels. Then again, who goes to Rome to watch television?

We checked in late so we were given a terrible room, and it must have been the handicap room because the shower in the bathroom didn\u2019t have a barrior of any sort to retain the water when you shower (just a flat surface). In a matter of 12 seconds your bathroom was entirely flooded and within a few minutes it would have started to flood the rest of the hotel room. This is without a doubt the most ridiculous shower we have ever seen. I had to create a sponge barrier by using 16 towels so that the room wouldn\u2019t flood after a 10 minute shower. When we complained to the front desk they looked at us like we were from outer space and not once did they say that they were sorry that our room wasn\u2019t satisfactory. When we checked out of the hotel the front desk asked how our stay was. We told her why we were unhappy with the room and that they really shouldn\u2019t rent that room out. Again she didn\u2019t say that she was sorry that we didn\u2019t enjoy our stay, instead she just gave us a blank stare. We will never stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone.

Breakfast is more than generous although coffee was less memorable compared to other Italian venues although that's sadly true of most Rome hotels who seem to cater to American tastes.

We had breakfast in there and it was plenty of food, continental breakfast, a very nice good coffee that you could ask separately free from the kitchen, breakfast was server for a few hours so it wasn't busy downstairs, you could find a table in the restaurant even if you were going later. Staff was friendly at the reception and in the restaurant too and also the cleaner was smiling and being very polite. We had dinner too in there and personnel was very polite and nice, we asked many things about Rome and they gave us information, dinner was also very nice and the wine the same. Prices at the restaurant were more than ok, at least in my opinion. It was raining and we were able to borrow free big umbrellas from the reception. Also we requested some adapter from the reception and we were given right away. Internet was working too, no problem with that. Bathroom was very nice, very warm inside, everything clean and modern. That was a big review, but I enjoyed my staying in there, Diana", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cmodern, clean, good location\u201d", "Author": "w0rldtravelers2", "ReviewID": "UR87385531", "Content": "just returned for 7 day vacation to see the ancient areas of Rome and taste the food. Thought it impossible to find a clean and modern hotel in Rome until we found this hotel. Clean is most important to us and it did not disappoint us in this way. Although quite small, very modern & nice bathroom, shower. Room a bit too warm, even with the heat off. Opened window to cool. Not necessarily as walkable to sites as they say. The Vatican is the closet attraction with a good 10 minute walk. We used the metro to get around. Highly rec. buying the \"Rome Passes\" 2 free admits to museums and ride the buses, trolleys and trains all you want. Great deal for 3 days and only $25.00. Breakfast not so great but we expected this from reading reviews beforehand. Last day of our trip spent 4 hours on phone(Thank goodness we had \"Skype\") trying to confirm our prepaid ride back to airport next morning as they required. They hung up on us 3 times. Called Expedia and they hung up on them as well. Expedia was useless to help us. We ended up having the hotel order us a ride for 50 euros. A well dressed driver arrived in a very nice car. Don't try to drive yourself around there if you value your life. We were a little nervous on way back to airport, we were going close to 100 miles per hour! Seems like that is just how everyone drives there, very aggressive. Streets very busy hard to walk around so many people and I believe we went on an off season.

The room was spacious, clean, modern and with a comfortable bed. We had views over Via Cola Di Renza but no traffic noise. The only noise was from the room next door, if the occupants didn't have their TV on at full volume, there always seemed to be a huge crowd of people in the room. Other reviewers have complained about the mouldy smell in the bathroom which was also present in our room. We think it is because there is no ventilation in the bathroom - no window or fan - so propped the door open with a shoe. This did fix the problem somewhat but is an issue that the Hotel should permanently rectify. It is simply a case of bad execution for the sake of trendy design. The included breakfast was terrible. The food wasn't fresh and there were bugs buzzing around the meagre array of fruit. The coffee was OK. It would be better to go out and grab a coffee and brioche at a local cafe (standing up of course!). Of all the breakfast staff on duty, only 1 was cheerful and helpful. All the others tried really hard to pretend that they were busy doing other things - like talking to each other. The Front Desk Staff were efficient and whilst not overly friendly, were very helpful if any requests were made. We were able to book into the Galleria Borghese with less than 24 hours notice because the Concierge made a direct call on our behalf. The PC with free internet is very handy, and is located on Level 1 just outside the lifts. The location of the Hotel is great. Close to Lepanto Metro and easy walking distance to the Vatican, Castel St Angelo and Piazza del Popolo, walks along the Tiber etc. The Colosseum and \"ancient Rome\" are a bit further away but accessible by bus. We walked everywhere and caught the Metro where convenient. Definitely purchase a ROMA PASS which covers all modes of public transportation as well as gives you free entry to the 1st 2 museums/sights; and allows you to bypass the queues. Plus discounted entry to other sights. In addition Prati is a lovely neighborhood. It is leafy and stylish and has plenty of dining options. What we liked most about Prati is that it was away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds and noise in Rome, yet a short walk to the hustle and bustle when needed. The shopping on Via Cola Di Renzo is great with lots of big name stores, 2 department stores as well as a local produce market. There is a Billa supermarket in the basement of Coin Dept Store for those who like to buy their own supplies.

However we were deeply disappointed. First of all, the location of the hotel was not ideal. We visited the vatican for only one day and most other times found ourselves doing the 15-20 min walk to the other side of the river as the shops and restaurants there were a lot more interesting. The hotel is located on the same side as the vatican. I would recommend staying on the side of the trevi foundtain and spanish steps and most of the attractions restaurants and shops are on the other side. Secondly, service in the hotel was really stingy. Breakfast food when like pastries and fruit when depleted were not replaced. Also, the breads tasted stale and eggs consisted of miserable sliced hard boiled eggs and the fruit had fruit flies hovering above them. I felt sorry for myself when I sat at the breakfast table. There is much better fresher breakfast available for less than 1 euro if you venture out and find a cafe/deli. Thirdly, I realise from the reviews that if you were lucky enough to get allocated a large room than you would have had a pretty decent time. However, this hotel has many shoebox rooms. We were given one such hole in the wall which was so dark even with the lights on that I was unable to read my book. We asked for a rom change and they were happy to oblige but I can see how if I was stuck with the first room I would have hated my stay. Lastly, if you really must stay in this hotel I would highly recommend booking direct as booking through these online sites would slap a $80-90 premium per night on your accomodation", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cManager and Customer Service was ZERO\u201d", "Author": "victor747", "ReviewID": "UR81544725", "Content": "The Manager there was very rude.

You can use taxi but its expensive (sth about 9 EUR form hotel to Pantheon). We have had spend sth about 36 EUR daily for taxi :( 2. Room Rooms are VERY nice, well decorated, nic to stay in.

Unfortunatelly hotel has a \"patio\" which is 3x3x3 square meter (VERY SMALL), so be advised to NOT BOOK room with \"patio\" view - rooms are dark (no sun light), and you are able to see very good your neighberhoods :( We did get one, but at the reception they didn't make problem to change the room. Second room we get was street view - nice, but pretty noisy at the night. 3. Staff Very nice and helpful, big plus! 4. Breakfast Not so good, poor choice. You can get scrambled eggs, some sausage and... thats all. Of course youghurt, croissant but no vegetables ( :() and only one sort of bred. But you can count for a really good coffe. 5.

Cola Di Rienzo is a very handy road to be based on. There are lots of different shops and used mainly by locals to do there shopping. The area in general is very quiet and you don't see many tourists hanging around. This area of Rome is very handy for the majority of sites. 5 mins up the road is Piazza De Popolo, 10 mins in the opposite direction is the Vatican.

The manager stated that there was absolutely nothing he could do and that he had booked us into similar quality hotel near the centre of town earlier in the day. This was quite simply a lie, as the hotel we were dropped off at in the taxi (paid for by the hotel) was in no way comparable with what we were expecting from Hotel Twentyone (see attached photos). In fact, it was of such poor quality it ruined our brief stay in Rome. As we were only staying in the city for 2 days we did not have time to return to Twentyone Hotel and demand alternative accommodation. However, we did email the management immediately upon arrival to request a more suitable alternative for the following night. Needless to say Twentyone Hotel failed to respond to this email and then claimed they had not received it until I asked an Italian speaker to telephone them on our behalf. Then mysteriously the email was found! The result was a token reduction in the rate we were due to pay at Hotel Twentyone and being informed that we would now have to settle our bill at the replacement hotel (as opposed to Hotel Twentyone settling the bill on our behalf as originally agreed) which conveniently prevented any further discussions on price / compensation. Twentyone Hotel appears to have a complete disregard for customer service and its management display an extremely arrogant attitude.

I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA good hotel - not outstanding, but not at all bad either\u201d", "Author": "stevewynnerival", "ReviewID": "UR34135342", "Content": "Spent a weekend in Rome with my girlfriend 26-29 June and stayed at the Twentyone for 3 nights. I lived in Rome for 4 years so know the city well and have stayed in a lot of Italian hotels. For those of you that haven't - they are very hit and miss. Very. Its in a decent area on a nice street on Via Cola di Rienzo which isn't super exciting but it's very safe and pretty central. 5 mins walk to Piazza del Popolo and not far from the Vatican. It's 5 mins walk from Le Panto tube (on Linea A - two stops from the Vatican stop Ottaviano). Its a small but well formed hotel. Check-in was fine, but typically haphazard Italian. Their English is fine, but not brilliant. Got a room on the 4th floor (401) which was surprsingly small. We didn't care as we weren't there for the room but the bed is literally next to the door. The room was well decorated - no swirly carpets or duvets - and because its a new hotel, no smell of stale smoke. Bathroom is also quite small but again good for what we needed. Hot power shower, not bad toiletries but an extremely heavy door ! There's a mini bar/fridge which wasn't super cold, but never use the mini bar so couldn't care less. Can't comment on breakfast as we missed it (but it is included) on all 3 mornings (although on Monday morning that was thanks to our 0630 flight back to London!) Overall, if you're paying 100-110 Euro a night, its decent value but anything much more than that would be expensive. Its a no-frills boutique hotel. Nothing outstandingly brilliant, but also nothing at all bad or to complain about. As I say, compared to a lot of overpriced Rome hotels (a lot of them), its a good safe bet. Pros : Location, comfortable, modern decor Cons : Not a \"full service\" hotel, rooms a bit small", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel - wrong booking - strange staff\u201d", "Author": "basenrobin", "ReviewID": "UR34040019", "Content": "We wanted to stay in this hotel for one weekend. Reservation was made 2 months before arrival date, two days before arrival send an email to confirm again my booking and let them know we would arrive in the evening, this was no problem, confirmed. When we arrived the man at the lobby said we were te last ones who have booked a room (2 months ago??). No room available. They offered to pay for a cab and go to another hotel, same owner. Not amused. The boy was not able to show the other hotel, which was strange, so after a while I looked at it myself online. Luckily a women showed up, she was very very sorry for the inconvenience and made a deal to book a room in the other hotel with big discount. In the end that hotel (Stay Inn, which has recently been opened) was ok, location even better (city centre), poor poor breakfast but nice staff and nice rooms in great building. The way the boy treated us is killing for this hotels reputation, which is a pity, as I do believe the hotel has a lot of potential. I do hope we will see the Stay Inn in this list soon!

The location is quite good but you have to do some walking. Price was good too. But breakfast was not a 4 star according to my standards... although I was told that in Rome breakfast is not very rich!!!... And some tips for the neighborhood... across the street nearby the bus station is a pizza called \"Pizza di Pazzi\" (or something like this)... avoid it at any cost... even if you are dying... we paid 15euro for two slices of pizza and 2 beers... the pizza was cold and I put it in the garbage... the beers were warm... I don't know if he stole us at the pricing but the food was to be thrown away... in Thessaloniki we have much better pizzas than him!!! On the other corner of the road to the Vatican is a nice cafe-bar... with happy hours (with 5 euro you can eat buffet)... we found that on our last day!...

From the outside, the hotel looks rather harsh and although it is brand new, it is a refurbishment of an old building, rather than a new build. Check in was quick and efficient and room allocated was exactly what we had booked, double deluxe on the 5th floor with a terrace. Room was cool and trendy with a very stylish fully tiled black bathroom. Well Stocked mini bar with reasonable prices, although we bought drinks from supermarket (doesnt everyone!!) Terrace was very large with views down the Via Del Rienzo towards St Peters Bassillica. The Hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Piazzo del Poppolo and from their we were able to visit all the major sites. 15 minute walk to Piazza Navona, 10 minutes to vatican city. Excellent take away Pizza place directly over the road who do an excellent cold tomato, mozerello, basil and rocket pizza. Perfect for an early evening snack with a cool peroni before venturing out to eat!! Only slight dissapointment was breakfast. Nothing really wrong with it, and freshly made coffees were good, but not a huge amount of choice, but maybe that is an italian breakfast rather than a criticism. I would definitely stay here again and having thrown my coin in the Trevi fountain, hopefully, I will.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Twentyone Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1436962-Reviews-Twentyone_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$137 - $323*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Cola di Rienzo 23</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00195</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1436962", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/36/3d/8c/jr-suite.jpg"}}
