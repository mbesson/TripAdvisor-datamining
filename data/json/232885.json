My husband and I stayed here for two nights in April, 2012. The Hotel is in excellent condition and classily decorated. Our room was large, bright, airy and in first class condition, with a double and a single bed. Extra blankets were available if needed too. There was plenty of hanging space for clothes and a safe for personal use. There was also a well stocked fridge. The bathroom was highly commendable and had a great shower with a strong spray. There were a number of obligatory toiletries which were much appreciated, plus a hairdrier and a fantastic magnifying mirror for shaving or applying makeup. The breakfast room was bright, pleasant and well attended by waiting staff. A good selection of food was on offer including hot scrambled, and boiled, eggs, tomatoes, ham, cheese, pastries, cereal, etc etc. Being Brits we weren't too keen on the strong coffee that Italians seem to drink, however, the staff were more than willing to make us our favourite cafe latte which was much appreciated. A variety of fruit juices, tea, water and milk were also available. Wi-Fi is available at a very modest charge. The Hotel is in a fabulous central location in Rome for seeing most of the well-known tourist attractions. 10-15 mins walk to The Spanish Steps and about 20 mins walk to The Trevi Fountain (at our leisurely speed). Just round the corner from the Hotel you can pick up the open-top buses for sight-seeing. Lots of great cafes, restaurants and shops in the immediate neighbourhood as well.

There were no shelves or drawers for clothes in my room (just wardrobes). Some of the light fittings in my room were very loosely fitted, the rooms themselves were not that well insulated for sound so I could easily hear my neighbours coming and going.

Close to the Spanish Steps and just a short walk to the Trevi Fountain. However, I found it to be a very centrally located property and it had a charm other hotels we have stayed in did not. The front desk can be warm or cold, depending on the time of day, number of people being dealt with and who is working. Overall, I found them to be very helpful, English speaking, but with a bit of an Italian quickness. The hotel is located on a hill and has no parking. Cabs will drop you at the front door, but buses are frowned upon in stopping at the front door. The street is too narrow. The lobby and public areas of the hotel were very clean. The breakfast area was quite nice and had an abundant variety of hot/cold items (eggs, meats, cheese, fruits, cereal, juices, breads, rolls etc) to choose from for breakfast. The wedding party of about 60 people that stayed at the hotel found it to be delightful place to meet and get ready for the day. We met many people from all over the world and the hotel even expanded the area when needed. The only thing that was slow, now and then, was the coffee pot being refilled. The hotel is located just around the corner from a metro station and a short walk to the HARD ROCK CAF\u00c9. There were many restaurants nearby, so you won\u2019t need to go far to eat. However, getting the front desk to get you a cab is easy and the cost is reasonable if you are interested in going to some places further away. The rooms were spotless and ours, a corner room, had views up the hill and toward the museum and plaza. The beds were very comfortable and the towels were large and fluffy. The bathroom had a shower and bidet and plenty of good lighting. The rooms were equipped with a refrigerator. Locks on the doors were electronic and took a bit of getting used to when returning at night. You do need to leave your room card in the inside holster to keep the lights on. There are English channels on the TV, just asked at the front desk how to access them with your remote; otherwise you will only be able to access Italian and French channels.

One minute to all bus stops. Lots of restaurants at all price points within a few blocks. Room was surprisingly spacious with comfortable beds.

Scrambled eggs, cappuccino, etc. Wifi only works in lobby. Grocery store 2 blocks away, great to stock up on \"cheap\" snacks in the mini fridge. We were little disappointed in staff.

We observed their interaction with other guests as well while using wifi in lobby. \"Allen\" was the only one who was friendly. Do not expect a concierge type service, they all spoke English and had appropriate brochures and maps. We like the location, room, and breakfast enough would probably consider staying again. Separate issue. We were disappointed by VAS tours, recommended by the hotel. We were stuck due to a Italian holiday and limited train schedule.

Well....thank you but whatever happened to the good old way of informing beforehand? Anyways, after stressing that this is not being appreciated at all, we were finally accomodated in the same hotel. The front desk was generally quite helpful, esp Alizeh and the bellboy too. There was this one tall gentleman at the front desk who proabably needs to learn a thing or two from his younger colleagues in client management. Anyways, we were given a room on the second floor and i did not see any lift/elevator-so quite some task carrying the baby stroller to and fro every time we were to go out. Rooms were modernly furnished-small by most standards but perhaps OK by European standards. Bedding was generally ok. Breakfast was nothing to much write home about but adequate and would feed most mouths as far as i could tell. Location is perhaps the biggest/sole advantage of this hotel. Practically a few steps from Piazza Barberini (which as some fellow traveller has rightly mentioned, every taxi driver knows) and 7-minute easy stroll to the fascinating Trevi fountain as well as a 10m walk to the Spanish Steps. Taxis are easily available from Piazza Barberini and to every other major attraction that we went to via taxi (Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Colesseum), i did not have to pay more than Euro 5-7 per trip. Vatican is some distance off from the historic part of the city and costs about Euro 30 if i recall correctly.

Firstly, hotel is on a good location, who ever says that it's location is not good, obviously expected to have hotel on the spanish steps. Hotel is literaly in the middle of everything; around 8-10 minutes to Spanish steps, from where you can walk to Vatican city, like we did. Hotel is around 5 minutes from fontana di Trevi, and some 25-30 minutes from forum Romanum. So, it is actualy very well located. That is also main advantage of the hotel. Although it is a 4* hotel, i would give it 3 stars with, as i stated in the title, minor faults... So, first thing that i didnt like is lack of any bar in hotel. I am not a \"bar guy\", but i like to sit in the evenig and have a drink with my wife. In Anglo Americano you can forget about it. Secondly, breakfast area is totaly crowded with chairs & tables, and if you are disabled or have small children, this may be a big problem. Breakfast is for sure not something you would expect in a 4* hotel, but, you can feed yourselves quite good till afternoon. Rooms are not big, no carpets in the rooms, heating system is actualy an AC but on the other hand - Rome is never so chilly. Furniture in rooms are basic. So, if you ar on budget, if you dont mind those minuses that i mentioned, you could feel quite okay in this hotel.

Firstly, I'd tell you to pay heed to the dates of the poorer reviews, as the hotel has been refurbished since then I believe. The hotel is very modern, and though not to my tastes, it is well decorated and clean. Our stay at the Anglo Americano was okay. Our room was by no means spacious, but it had plenty of space to store our luggage and a weeks worth of clothing and other items we brought along for our stay. The bathroom was always clean, and the facilities were always functioning, despite having a few loose fixtures. Whilst the room itself was clean, the surfaces were fairly dusty, especially by the end of our stay. The breakfast isn't all that. I woke up for it for the first 2 nights, then gave up on it and we ended up buying fruit from the nearby Spar to eat for our breakfast each morning. On 6 occasions we asked for the heating to be turned down in our room, as it was sweltering and we could barely sleep. It never happened, and you can't operate the airconditioning yourselves, and have to ask to have it turned on... They never did that either. Despite this, they were good at giving us tips on which places to eat at (Re degli Amici is fantastic) and they were always friendly. Take note that whilst the website may say the hotel is in a \"quiet\" road, this is not the case. No road in central Rome is really all that quiet, and being close to piazza Barberini, this place isn't either. But the location is fantastic. Piazza di Spagna is just up the road, and the Trevi fountain, Pantheon and Piazza Navona are all nearby too. We managed to walk everywhere, and though it tired us out, it was good to be close enough to everything to be able to walk to it. Overall, this is a nice hotel. It's not really to my tastes, and after the disappointment of being shoved here after looking forward to staying at the Domus Romana for 5 months, we had a good time, though that's purely down to the hotels location, and all the amazing things we got to see.

I have stayed in Hotels all over the world, in city centres and tourist resorts and this is definitely the most basic hotel I have ever stayed in. I could not honestly say it was more than 2 Star. We booked through Expedia and therefore expected there to be some form of credibility to the hotel ratings. Interesting, on their .co.uk website, the hotel is rated as 4* but on their .com website it is rated as 2*. When we checked into our room, we here horrified to see the floor covered in a grey, stained, office-like carpet. The wall partitions were extremely thin and we could easily hear the people in the next room talking. The curtains were filthy and stunk. The mini bar was extortionate and you would be well advised to buy a bottle of water from the nearby supermarket at 30 cents then spend nearly 3 Euros on one from their fridge. The bathroom was OK. The shower, however, was tiny and there was barely enough room to wash. As it was so tiny, the shower curtain was permanently stuck to my back and left side whilst using the shower. I did not feel as though I was clean when stepping out once. The only complimentary toiletries provided was bubble bath which was useless in a bathroom with only a shower cubicle. There is only one electricity point and this was not working. We asked to be moved to a new room and it took them 2 days to accommodate this request (we were only there for 3 nights) as they were fully booked for the Rome Marathon. The second room was as bad as the first. It was situated on the 7th floor with elevator access only to the 6th and a window that was so tiny that you could not see out of it unless you stood on something. It was also extremely warm and the air conditioning was not working in late March. The breakfast was OK if you don't mind bread, butter, processed ham, cheese and sickly orange squash masquerading as orange juice. On the plus side, we were provided with fresh towels and linen daily and had a pretty decent coffee at breakfast. Some of the reception staff were quite surly but one middle aged gentleman (I'm afraid I didn't ask his name) who worked in the early evenings was extremely helpful and recommended two restaurants to us that served fabulous traditional Italian/Roman food at reasonable prices, compared with the smutz served at most tourist orientated restaurants. As others have said, the location is good and is around a ten minute walk to both the Spanish Steps or Trevi fountain. If you are relatively fit, there will be no need to get public transport to anywhere in Rome from this hotel. All in all, if you are expecting a 4* hotel, I guarantee you that you will be disappointed. If you are only expecting 2* quality, then I'm sure you could do worse than the Anglo Americano.", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cHotel and staff were horrible!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4736026", "Content": "Do not stay at this hotel at all!

Although a bellman was loitering nearby, he made no effort to help us with our bags \u2013 either when we arrived by cab or when we had to drag them into the \u201clobby\u201d Our keys resembled truck stop restroom keys \u2013 with big wooden blocks attached \u2013 we were told to leave them when we went out, as if we would steal these things. The elevator dropped and bounced when we got into it \u2013 we feared we might be stuck in there. When we reached the second floor, I thought we were in the basement as the hallway was blocked by a metal maids cart, lit with exposed florescent lights, had utility pipes running through it and the walls were dingy fiber board panels with a tin drop ceiling. The rooms were cramped, reeking of cigarette smoke, with dirty grey stains on the walls and mildew, wet rot damage at the baseboards above the stained and dirt saturated old carpeting. No air conditioning was available in the 85 degree heat \u2013 contrary to advertisement. Fumes and noise came in through the one small window available for ventilation. The light in the bathroom did not work properly. The beds were tiny, and fitted with scratchy low quality sheets. On the positive side, I will say that the hot water supply was adequate and the bathrooms clean. Breakfast was also adequate. However, this hotel compares unfavorably to a two star hotel in the heart of Paris which I recently stayed in (2002) and which cost a third of the price of this place. I can stay in Manhattan at the Hotel Lucerne on the upper west side close to the Natural History Museum in a boutique hotel with bellhop service, outstanding restaurant and beautiful rooms for less than I paid for this place. If Hotel Anglo Americano of Rome rates 4 stars, please know that 4 stars in Rome equates to a Motel 6 level experience in the States at 4-5 times the cost.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201c4* for its Location,Location,Location!!\u201d", "Author": "kevjo", "ReviewID": "UR3346645", "Content": "We booked a 3 night break and couldn't believe a city centre 4* could be such good value.

The threadbare carpets and hard beds let it down, as does the en-suite shower that is only fit for people shorter than 5'5\"(165cm). Dont even bother having breakfast...tinned fruit in a plastic disposable bowl....I am 31 years old not 4 years old having a jelly and ice-cream party!! The absolute saving grace for thiis hotel is its LOCATION! Via Veneto is a one minute stroll and from there you have a choice of some fine restaurants and bars.

The decoration in the public areas was over the top but clean and always tidy. Our room (411) was simple but spacious, the double and 2 single beds were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was clean too including the shower curtain which is often forgotten. The pillow cases and towels were changed everyday and the sheets were changed once during our stay. Breakfast was a basic affair consisting of tinned fruit, cereals, pastries, rolls, cream cheese, boiled eggs, fruit juice and freshly made coffee. The staff were polite and always available. The air con was hopeless so don't go when the weather is hot. The hotels crowning glory is it's location. It's easy walking (5-20mins) from most of the important sites. The immediate area also has a lot to offer, historic sites - the National Gallery is next door, shops and restuurants.

Stayed from 14th to 18th February 2005. Firstly must say that we spent quite some time looking at many hotels on the internet and booked this one last year. We really struggled to find a room for our family at a price that suited. Many of the hotels we looked at were well out of our price range, especially as we guessed that we would spend very little time in the room. Weren't going to spend a lot of money on a room we would hardly see. Glad we booked this hotel prior to reading many of the reviews on this site, otherwise we may not have booked it. First impressions on our arrival were; hotel central to all major tourist attractions, foyer small and tidy. Staff were friendly. Were allocated room 114 just up the stairs from the foyer, at the rear of the hotel. (this meant street noise was negligable) The room was of a fair size and decorated at about the same time as the Colosseum. Must say though, that it was clean and tidy. Air conditioning of a sorts. Four single beds with hard mattresses. (This suited us fine) Sheets and towels were changed every day. Bathroom was clean. Shower was fine for those under 5'5\". I had to shower on my knees. If you were in Rome to watch TV then you will be disappointed. We were there to see the odd historic site or two. As long as you expect a continental style breakfast then you will be happy. If you expect a fry up in Rome, then the City is not for you. Again most of the staff were friendly, and fairly polite. One or two may not be early birds though. Overall I would say that the room was fine for what we paid. We did over 12 miles a day walking, and slept well enough to want more the next day. As far as four stars is concerned, they are probably the ones you can see out of the window at night, but as my review title suggests, compare the prices for a centrally located hotel and you can work out that you will not be staying in luxury. If friends asked me to recommend this hotel or not then I would say it was fine for what we wanted, just don\u2019t expect the Ritz!

The decor could do with upgrading, but again it is an Italian hotel, decorated in Italian, not British or American, style. The staff were exceptionally helpful. When we checked in we felt our two rooms were too far apart (we had 2 teenagers with us); as the hotel was full we were not able to move that night. However, the next day we were allowed to look at 2 adjoining rooms so that we could decide if we wanted to move. We did - the views were great. The staff also phoned our transport company on our behalf to confirm our travel arrangements back to the airport, at no charge. The shops and restaurants in the immediate area are excellent, and the hotel is within walking distance of all the major tourist attractions.
