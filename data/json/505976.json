Many of their hotels were obviously purchased from other owners and remodeled. The rooms are actually quite clean and modern. we spent one night in the Hotel 81 Princess in Geyland which is in the middle of the red light district. Many hotels in this and other areas rent by the hour. But here is the fatal flaw in this hotel chain - in all their hotels the mattresses are made, or at least covered, in Naugahyde plastic! The sheets are also about 90% plastic polyester. You cannot sleep on these beds! In my 40 years of world travels this was the worst mattress I have ever slept on. The sheets will slide around and off the bed and to top things off there is no mattress cover. I checked other Hotel 81's and they all have this horrible mattress. I told them I would rather sleep on a park bench which would have been more comfortable! We booked over the Internet for three nights but left after one night. They tried to charge us a one night penalty for \"cancelling\" but this was not a cancellation it was rejecting a room that was uninhabitible. They did refund our money for the extra two nights. No free Wi-Fi in these hotels. Our room at the Princess was postage stamp size and they mounted the small flat screen TV so that when you moved around the bed your head would impact the TV stand on the wall. If it weren't for the mattress and sheets this would have been a decent place to stay at a reasonable price for expensive Singapore.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "china", "Title": "\u201cA VERY CLEAN AND FUNCTIONAL MOTEL\u201d", "Author": "zuhur", "ReviewID": "UR84304002", "Content": "I stayed in many hotel 81.

I was quite hesitant in calling the reception at that hour fearing that they would suggest me to change the room. To my surprise, there was this handyman who knocked only 10 minutes later.

The return cab fare will include a booking fee if you ask the hotel to call a taxi for you. Tiny room, no fridge. It was a non smoking room but it was obvious from burn marks on the table and bathroom sink etc that people do smoke in here. Staff were efficient and helpful but also very business like \u2013 not overly friendly. All the hotels in this area are in the budget category \u2013 a very basic no frills set up. Cable broadband is available in the room at an additional cost. The shower/toilet area is tiny and stepping out of the bath can be a bit tricky and slippery as there is nothing to hold on to. No shower curtain so the whole area gets wet. The only power socket available (apart from the television socket) was where the kettle plugs in but it had a switch at the front that made it impossible to plug in my adaptor.. Each room is supplied daily with two packets of a coffee/milk/sugar mix . I stayed at two different hotels in the same location a week apart. On both occasions (late evening) I was told that the airport shuttle bus does not go to Geylang \u201cat this hour\u201d. Same price range in both hotels and almost identical room size and facilities although this room seemed to be in better condition than the room at the Frangrance hotel. The rooms are fairly clean but be prepared for a few marks/dents on the walls and furniture. The double bed was reasonably comfortable but the air-conditioning unit is a little noisy. Accommodation in Singapore is very expensive, if all you want is a place to rest and sleep stay here and spend the money you save on some duty free shopping. If you book online via an agent you will get the room at a substantial discount to the hotel\u2019s advertised rates. There are plenty of 7/11 type convenience stores close by as well as lots of eating-houses. The menus at these places are very traditional with dishes with names that were very unfamiliar to me. But if you take your time to find out what\u2019s in the dishes you should find something to suit your palate. Take-away coffee is served in a small plastic bag with handles and a straw.
