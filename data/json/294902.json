There were multiple restaurants, an upscale bar, a patisserie, jewelry store and more. It has an outdoor pool and is located on the Bosphorus, so it's the perfect place to spend time outside when the weather is nice. Their breakfast buffet is extensive and delicious and free--or at least it was with the rooms we booked. The rooms themselves are what you'd expect from a business style hotel.

Plus there are good restaurants nearby for business dinners and, in my case, many of my clients' offices are in the Florya district. And then there's that gym, indoor and outdoor pool. Used by hotel goers and outsiders, it is a full gym and great for a work-out. And I have to say, having gone there for over 10 years (or more!), it has some lovely staff with what seems to be a pretty low turnover. These guys care about giving a good service.

To spend a few days touring Istanbul on my own I'd be more likely to choose the Four Seasons or another spot in the Sultanhamet, but I wanted to spare my 70-ish parents the stickershock, and we also had rented a car, so we weren't put off by the 20 minute drive, which is easy and direct along the water to tourist center. The hotel is also very close to the airport, so good for in and out business travelers, but it is not an airport hotel. While still pricey and having a dated 70-80s feel to it (it could use some updating), as well as VERY slow elevators, it has many pluses. It offers a wide range of room types (due to odd circumstances we stayed in four different rooms including a suite), offers stunning views of the glimmering straits with ships lined up waiting to pass through, has lovely gardens and a huge swimming pool, offers a full service gym and spa and all the standard amenities you could want. It is very international, which to me is a plus - Russians, Saudis, and Europeans as well as Turks and Americans. The hotel is American owned but doesn't advertise its ownership and is a favorite for weddings. There is a lovely pastry shop in the lobby and the food in the restaurant is good, not great. The service is very polite, professional and caring altho the staff can get stress at checkout time; when we thought my mother mislaid her purse in the hotel, they scoured the place to try to find it; additionally, when my parents arrived early and we had requested an early checkin, they accommodated and actually moved us to a larger room. The exterior garden rooms are very small, but the ground floor attached \"garden wing doubles\" are extremely spacious-they are the steal of this hotel. There is security at all entrances, including the underground garage and the hotel is self-contained and well removed from other buildings. Room service breakfasts are generous and cost the same as a breakfast in the dining room. The gym and pool appear to be available to locals as well as hotel guests so they can become quite crowded at peak hours. The seafood restaurant next to the hotel (not the one actually connected to the hotel) is expensive but excellent.

It is close to the airport and great for early morning departures. There is an airport shuttle, but a taxi ride is less than 10TL if the timing for the shuttle does not work for you. I stayed in a deluxe garden room and these are huge! Never stayed in one of these rooms before and as well as a dining table, there is a desk, and a lounge/settee as well as additional chairs. And the bathroom had a tub as well as a shower (the other garden rooms only have a shower - not a huge deal for me as I generally do not have a bath). And of course there is shampoo and conditioner, and large bench area in the bathroom. The only issue I have is that although it was a non-smoking room, it can be used by smokers, so has that stale cigarette smell which I hate, but it was only one night. The spa, including a hamam, sauna and steam rooms as well as the indoor pool where you can swim lengths as well as a great gym, is a wonderful feature at this hotel. I did not have a massage this trip, but they have always been good when I have had one. Breakfast is always a nice selection (Turkish and western and Japanese) at Daphne's and great views of the sea. However, the highlight for me was the check-out. After the horrific experience at the hotel the day before it was so nice for all to go smoothly. A friend had joined me for breakfast and I had not been charged for the breakfasts. I queried whether I should be charged, they called down to the restaurant and said since they had not put through the charge at the time of my check-out (which was an hour later), they would provide the breakfast on a complimentary basis since I was so honest!

The room was nice, although there was not enough space to put all of out cloths away, only 2 small drawers inside the wardrobe. The bed was wonderful, no complaints there. We did have trouble with the Internet, there is no wireless in the rooms outside the main floors and the wired Internet was hit or miss, we had to call the desk and have someone troubleshoot the problem and even when it came back it left again the next day. Not sure what was going on, but this was an issue. Room service was nice, prompt, and the food was always good. The restaurant has some wonderful food, but pricy as you would expect. Breakfast was 45 TL and lunch buffet was 98 TL. Good food but over priced. The major issues we had with the stay were with service. The first main issues was running out of toilet paper. At this type of hotel, and for the price, you should never run out of anything. Next was a problem I had with a taxi driver. I wanted to report a complaint for a taxi driver that tried to scam me. The lady at the counter tried to call once, received a busy signal and said I would have go come back later. In was there on business for meetings and trying to report this during a break. Maybe I am out of line, but I felt the hotel should have taken this up on my behalf. I could return to provide details and sign whatever statement required, but I didn't receive any assistance on this. It's disappointing because if these events aren't reported and followed up on it will happen again. The last problem was with the shower. It leaked horribly. The supplied mat and both hand towels were not enough to keep the water at bay after just 1 of us showered, let alone both of us.

The proximety to the airport makes it a quick trip between flights. It is, howevwr, a 30- 60 plus minute drive to the city depending on traffic and 30-35 TL one way. If they are catering to the airport crowd, they have a problem with the wireless internet- 12TL/24 hrs which often cuts out making work a nightmare. There is a landliine which is much better. They did not charge for the wireless whn I checked out but I wish I had been warned as I wasted a lot of time.

A simple check in, and the supervisor on the club lounge organised our luggage to be brought up, whilst we had cool drinks and snacks. The outdoor pool is enormous and does not feel crowded even when there are many guests inside. The indoor pool is lovely! Room services prices are reasonable and overall a lovely lovely hotel. The staff aim to please and location perfect. We went on the shuttle bus which is a lovely journey to the city centre - which makes you realise how lucky you are not to be staying in this hustle, bustle which is tiring from just observing. A truely relaxing stay and a wonderful hotel - I would suggest club level. Oh and the breakfast at the restaurant Daphne - was lovely - felt truely 5*. A very 5* hotel.

The shuttle service helps to overcome this, but there are only 3 per day into the city (see the website for times) and they do not run late at night. We paid 22Lira to get into the Grand Bazaar, but I guess it would be quite a lot more if you were going right across to Taksim and through the horrendous traffic. If you are a little more adventurous however you can catch the train from/to Sirkeci for 1.25Lira to within half a mile and get a cab from there. We did it without any hassle at all and saved ourselves probably 30Lira each time. The rooms are standard Marriott ones with all main amenities, including the fantastic beds that they have. As noted elsewhere on TA though, the cost of the add-ons is very steep. The spa downstairs seemed quite busy as we passed it on our way to the pool, but we didn't partake in a visit. The seafood restaurant has a lovely terrace overloooking the water and the price of the fresh fish is reasonable although they get you with what is charged for drinks. My wife and I spent about 200 Lira on quite a lavish dinner, but this would have been twice that in London or New York. The food cost was less than half of that amount. The outdoor pool area was fantastic, with dozens of sun lounges and plenty of side areas to find some peace. This was especially necessary as the weather was in the high 20's and the pool gave a great respite from the madness of the city and to cool our tired bodies. We were happy to stay here, but if you are coming to Istanbul to see a lot in a short time it may pay to be closer to town, however if you don't mind a 20-30 minute commute into the sights then you can't really go wrong.

I would like to cover the positives as well as the negatives. Firstly I would like to say they I did not book this hotel myself as I was attending an international conference which was being held at the hotel. The positives: Location to the airport - 5 to 10 minutes away. Free transfers to and from the airport. Free transferes in to and out of the city (European side). Times etc are available on request. Room service good. Rooms clean albeit on the small side for a 5 star hotel. 2 swimming pools. Restuarants and shops inside the hotel very nice. Staff friendly and helpful. Business centre located on C floor above the lobby. ATM available in the lobby. Left luggage facility. Security was very good. Bags and guests are checked when they enter the hotel. Negatives Food and drinks very expensive. A can (33cl) of coke 12TL (6 Euro/\u00c2\u00a36/60SEK) the same can of pepsi can be bought around the corner in the local supermarket for 0.89TL. When sitting next to the pool we took with us a 2 litre bottle of coke which casts about 1.49TL from the local store and took our ice bucket from the room with us. Ice machines can be found on every floor and they are located in the fire escape! We then asked the bar for 2 glasses and we enjoyed ice cold drinks at the pool for a fraction of the price. Internet is not free. Internet can be obtained via cable, wifi or through the TV but at 8 euros a day (16TL/\u00c2\u00a38/80SEK) I thought this was very expensive. When I wanted to check-in for my return flight I asked if there was a facility to do this and was informed I could use the business centre. I checked in online but when I came to print the boarding passes the printer was out of toner. They told me if I emailed the passes to myself we could go to another business centre to print them off. Before doing this I thought I had better check I could access my email address. Unfortunately the computers would not allow me access to hotmail/msn etc. I couldn't enter my work email address either. eventually they found some toner and I was able to proceed. Distance from the city. You are quite some distance from the city centre. A taxi will take you at least 25 minutes and you can expect to pay 20-30 euros each way. The free transfer mentioned above only runs during the day. Money. Having been to Turkey before I brought euros with me. I visited Alanya before and everything was done in euros. Instanbul is different they prefer Turkish Lira and I found this a bind as I was having to do 3 conversions in my head everytime I wanted to buy something or pay for something. The room. Try and get a sea view. The first few floors are available for those of us who smoke. The hotel is like a triangle but one side looks directly at the airport. The sea views are better although there are hundreds of ships just off the coast waiting to transit the Bosphorus. There is a strong odour late at night. One evening the smell was so strong coming through the airconditioning that we were both woken up by the smell. I think this is about all I have to add.

The lobby is nice, but this doesn't really impress me since I am not sleeping in the lobby. As with many American-styled hotels in Istanbul, I found the metal detector was always in the lobby. The first few times I passed through this I found it strange, but soon became accustomed to it. The hotel itself is modern, updated, pricey (but this is standard for Renaissance Hotels). It is also in the middle of nowhere-- at least from a tourist's perspective. To reach this hotel, you must take the regional rail from central Istanbul to Yesilyurt. It's a short 10-minute walk from the station to the hotel. Watch out for hidden prices. It was free to use the pool, but you had to have some sort of bathing cap. If you don't bring one of your own it'll cost you TYL3. It's not a huge deal, but worth noting. Internet is not free, costing (I believe) around EUR5,00 per day. I cannot rate the internet as we did not use it. There is a table-sort of thing in the room with ridiculously high prices for things, but as I am guessing this hotel is aimed toward fly-in business folks and not budget-minded folks, I was not surprised by this. I can't comment on the television or anything related to it. It stayed 'off' the entire time we were there. There is a free hotel shuttle to the airport, but it only leaves every thirty minutes, and you MUST reserve in advance. Also, it only runs a specified time, and outside of this, you'll need to take a taxi to the airport, costing around TYL15. With so much to see, do and experience in downtown Istanbul, there really is no reason to use this hotel as a tourist other than as the last night before going to the airport. As a side note, there is also a Courtyard with almost the exact same amenities (including hotel shuttle) but at a much lower price.

Prior to arriving I'd communicated with the conceirge to arrange for a set of welcome gifts for my wife (a meat selection etc) and was very happy to have them waiting for us upon checking in, as well as room on the club level with a nice sea view. I believe this is a great hotel, with nice rooms, a good bathroom and a lovely view of the sea. In fact I think it would be a great place for a wedding or a relaxing holiday with side-trips into Istanbul for a few days out of 7. Transport-wise it was only a cheap cab ride to the airport (beware of the cabs as typical for Turkey, we had one attempted cheating which the hotel resolved and picking up a cab from the hotel to the airport once the driver used the night rate). From the airport you can get public transport into the city centre, though the hotel also offered a minibus into the centre a few times a day. In essence this was the main problem, we stayed at the hotel as we like Marriotts and used points to reduce the cost of the stay - however the Marriott in Istanbul was in the wrong location for a tourist, hence staying at a Marriott chain hotel. In hindsight we wasted 1.5 hours each day getting between the hotel and sights, so, it probably wasn't the right choice for a tourist. There weren't that many places nearby to eat, but we had room service one night and it was very good - not cheap, but not as expensive as Marriotts can sometimes be - the portions were also reasonable sizes and the food was very Turkish (better value and quality than many of the tourist restaurants in Sultanahmet). Breakfast was a good selection, with a nice view of the hotel pool and sea. With this being a country with a long history of Islamic influence you might expect no pork, but whilst the buffet had beef/chicken sausages they also had bacon. There was also a Turkish breakfast option in the buffet. The biggest disappointment was that the club lounge was closed from December 4th 2008 until January 28th 2009. The hotel had a very low occupancy and although the lounge was supposedly closed for 'renovations' - as I was on the club floor and you could see into the lounge from above (a nice setup actually, the lounge itself looked lovely and on two floors) and it was 'as is' with no changes underway... likely closed due to low capacity. In return for the closure club floors were given access to the normal hotel bars with complimentary drinks/breakfast/nibbles, which might be better to some (the full breakfast buffet was appreciated by my wife and I!) - but, its not quite the same as wandering into a pleasant quiet lounge right next to your room.

Its not perfect - i could complain about a few things, but the overriding opinion is good enough. anyway - will keep coming back here - dont stay at the SAS Airport, it is not good.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cSuperior quality Marriott hotel\u201d", "Author": "mmppwwzz", "ReviewID": "UR25705513", "Content": "I spent a couple of nights here on Marriott points at the end of a week in Istanbul after staying at the Empress Zoe in the Sultanahmet. Checked in at around 2pm - friendly staff, no issues. I was surprised at the level of security at the hotel, both the car check and guard at the gate, as well as the metal detector on entry to the hotel lobby. Staying on reward points was no problem on check-in - still the same excellent level of service and friendly attention and was given a concierge level room with views towards the airport. As a plane spotter, that was fine for me, but the better view is out towards the Bosphorous. Istanbul tends to be old fashioned and all the bell hops wore classic pill-box hats so there was a fun old-world feel to the uniforms. The hotel, however looks like it was built in the 1980's, but has been renovated and has a very understated contemporary feel - elegant and warm rather than minimalist - what you would expect. Turks are also very attentive without being over-bearing, and I found the level of service at the hotel to be understated and staff had a pride in their uniforms and jobs that you don't often see in the lower ranks in the United States. This is definitely a business hotel, although there didn't seem to be many businesses close by, so I'm guessing it does a lot of airport and convention trade with the odd wedding thrown in. After staying at the Empress Zoe for the first 5 nights of the week-long vacation, I found the Renaissance to be a pleasant change. The location is not problematic as there's a street close by with shops, cafes and restaurants which gave a more suburban everyday Istanbul expericence. I can't remember what the station is called, but there's also a train station within walking distance of the hotel which takes you to the Sultanahmet - the last station is near the Galata bridge. The train system looks like something out of the Soviet Union, but it's a fascinating way to travel downtown for around US$1 without the hassles of cab drivers/traffic. I headed back to the hotel in the evening to relax in the Concierge lounge. For some reason, it has views towards the airport, rather than the Bosphorous, but there was the usual tasteless h'ors douvers that you would find in any lounge. On the positive side, there was interesting Turkish cheese, beers for free, comfortable lounges and a big TV. Overall, a good experience, no real wow factor, but that's not what was expected.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stone Mountain, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cPolat means \"business\"\u201d", "Author": "EZE2B", "ReviewID": "UR20308671", "Content": "The Polat hotel is a new facility looking over the Marmara Sea.

As long as you (or your company) do not mind paying elevated prices then this is the place for you. This hotel will cater to your every need. There is no Turkish culture at this hotel. The property is also a highly secured with guards and fences. The restuarants are way over priced for the quality and quantity. Take the time and get a tax into town for real Turkish food. There are wonderful places to eat around Taksim Square. It will be cheaper and much more memorable. The Polat is located about 7-8 miles from downtown Istanbul. A tax ride is about $20 USD. There are city buses for about $1.15 #80 or 72T into Eminonu or Taksim. It's easy and convienent to ride the bus. The bus stop is down the street from the hotel.

Website advertised \"free airport shuttle,\" but when I called the hotel upon landing at 11:30am I was advised that the next shuttle wouldn't leave the airport until 2:30pm, so we cabbed the 4 km over to the hotel. Then we learned that the first shuttle in the morning doesn't leave the hotel until 6am (too late for our 5:50am flight, so two more cabs were required, the \"free shuttle\" wound up costing me 60YTL ($48). Early to bed to make the flight didn't work out so well when an extraordinarily loud poolside wedding party complete with fireworks show kicked off at about 10pm just outside our rooms. I've been in noisy hotels before, but the walls and furniture physically vibrated from this noise. Several phone calls and 45 minutes later the front desk finally found two more rooms on the 16th floor for us and sent two bellmen with the keys. The bellmen stayed behind as we hauled our stuff over to the tower ourselves and up to the 16th, apparently more concerned with inspecting our old rooms to see if we'd stolen some towels or something. The rooms on the 16th didn't actually vibrate, but the wedding band was still uncomfortably audible even up there. However as it was now after 11pm and it had been a long day, we actually fell asleep for a few hours until our early return to the airport. Checkout was one of those protacted affairs where the guy had to wander off to the back office and shuffle through a bunch of papers before he could finally come up with a total and process the payment. The hotel should have never booked the poolside rooms on a night when a big, loud party was planned, and really shouldn't have events that are so loud in any case. This is an overpriced hotel with several ordinary restaurants and poor to non-existent service that seems unaware that people might really want to get to and from the airport and sleep at night at an airport hotel.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Altos, CA (USA)", "Title": "\u201cA big disappointment\u201d", "Author": "tracyk45", "ReviewID": "UR16354523", "Content": "We were looking forward to staying at this hotel as a break from some of the small and less well-appointed places we had stayed during our three weeks in Turkey. We stayed here our last night in Turkey, thinking we would have a relaxing night, a great meal. and a sound sleep before we caught our planes early in the AM. Nothing of the sort happened. First of all, three of us piled out of a small taxi loaded down with bags from our travels and no one came to help us with the bags! We then checked in to find that our months' old request to have an extra bed put in the room (we were three women traveling together) had not been noted. The front desk person said he would get a bed up to the room asap. Didn't happen...and when someone finally did come with the bed it became crystal clear he was going to have to dismantle the room to make it fit! We should never have been booked in that size room with the promise that it would fit all of us. We went to the bar for a drink before dinner and saw martinis on the menu...so we ordered two. We were both blown away by the size of the martini, which by the way cost over $20...the thing could not have been more than a quarter of the glass. The server told us, when we complained, that it was because their glasses were so large -- NOT! Our dinner was average but we waited a long time to get our orders taken and between courses. The server was embarrassed enough that he gave us a glass of wine free at the end of the meal. In the Am there were no porters when we struggled down with our bags. The shuttle service to the airport did work as advertised, however. All in all, I would never recommend this hotel (we paid something like $425 for the room) to anyone. Oh, and it is a long ways away from anything in Istanbul. Given the horrible traffic in the city, it took us 55 minutes to get from the Yenikapi ferry boat station to the hotel, a trip that should have taken 12 minutes or so.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "holland", "Title": "\u201cgreat aiport hotel\u201d", "Author": "mandalaholland", "ReviewID": "UR15520292", "Content": "So unusual to sleep next to the aiport and having no trouble with the noise.
