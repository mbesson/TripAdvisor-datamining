It is housed on the 1st floor of an old building - the entrance hall and lift are a bit jaded, but don't be put off, because once you step into the Dolomiti's little lobby, you'll be very pleasantly surprised! Very compact, but spottlessly clean, nicely decorated and every member of staff we encountered during our stay could not have been more friendly or helpful. Our room was not a bad size at all for a 3 star city hotel, with a lovely little bathroom complete with walk in enclosed shower. Again, everything was spotlessly clean, I couldn't fault it! Of course you can hear traffic with the windows open, but once the windows were shut, it was almost completely sound proofed. there was air conditioning, although we didn't need it in March (best time of year to visit Rome by the way!). Again, we weren't expecting too much for breakfast, but wrong again! There was a wonderful selection of fresh pastries and croissants, as well as cereal, yoghurt and fruit, and although the coffee from the machine was pretty unpleasant, the staff offered to make a cappucino every morning and that was delicious!

When I first arrived I went to the ground floor lobby only to be told that the Dolomiti lobby is one floor up of which I carried my bag. There is an elevator but stops a 1/2 flight above the floor you select so there is some bag carrying and stair climbing involved. As others have stated, it's not close to Rome attractions so you will need to be prepared to fill some transportation needs on your own. It is close to the hop-on hop-off city bus tour which boards next to the train station which is a plus for as long as you want to use it. I found the daytime staff lady to be nicest and helpful as well as the younger gentleman but not necessarily all others. Especially the breakfast lady seemed bossy laying out a whole list of rules to follow for breakfast - where to sit and how to serve yourself etc. I just walked out twice until the third time she just welcomed me and left me alone. On my last day she told me they were full and I again left not wanting to deal with her for a simple bite to eat. No complaints of the room itself which was clean and reasonably sized and had AC.

It was not spectacular breakfast and I would prefer if the milk was colder but we werent there for the food. The staff welcomed us with a smile at all times, and the receptionist's spoke good english and gave us lots of advice on what to do in the city. Bear in mind this is a 3 star hotel, and you get what you expect for a 3 star hotel - and this is probably one of the better three star hotels you will find. It you want luxury dont stay in this district. However, what really made this hotel stay so good for me was the LOCATION. It is 30 seconds from the Castro Pretoria metro stop, and only 5-7mins walk from Termini Train Station. On the Metro line you can get to all the main tourist sites. It is surrounded by lots of low-cost restaurants serving excellent food, there is a supermarket across the road. We felt very safe at all times as the hotel is far enough away from Termini. There is a government building across the road and there were always armed police around so that re-inforced my sense of security.

The accomadations looked brand new, we had a non-smoking room. Breakfast was continental, croisants, pastries, cappucino/caffe lattes, yogurt and fresh fruit any time. Internet access available, very conveinent to metro, out the door to the right about 50 steps, we then went to Termini and switched to the A line. Termini is also close but area is a bit rough at night, men hanging out so we chose the station to the right exiting the hotel. We felt very safe walking in the area around our hotel in the evenings, restaraunts, laundry, grocer. The management was wonderful and always there to greet you with a smile and some kind words. Most everyone spoke enough English to get by. We were close enough to everything to come back to our room freshen up and go right back out. I did read the reviews before I chose this hotel, one talked about the stairs but there was an elvator, small but fine. Also someone wrote about the way the hotel is set up, there are different hotels in the same building but not an issue at all, just walk or ride to your floor, states clearly Dolomiti and someone is always there to greet you, non-issue.

The previous review is right on, very clean, staff very helpful and nice. I spoke no Italian, but got by just fine. One receptionist knows English very very well, and gave us specific and detailed instructions to the airport. Our cost was 85 Euro/night, we shared the cost. We got 2 twin beds, with the shared bath. I never once had to wait for the bathroom, there were two near our room. The shower doesn't come out full force, and the bidet is only cold water. That is the only negative I can think off. Again everything is super clean, YES especially the bathroom. This is a non-smoking hotel, but I did smell smoke a few times while in the hallway. Their website shows everything accurately. Just do be aware again of the stairs, you do have to climb stairs to get to the desk. The elevator stops either one level above or below the room levels. So you always have 2 flights to walk. They do have a cash discount. Like other hotels, air conditioner units are rolled in (need to be requested). The pillows are nice a fluffy acted like down, but not sure. I am allergic to down, but wasn't allergic at all to it. Their windows have two layers for sound proofing.

The bathroom was roomy as well. The bed was small, but comfortable enough. The room had a refrigerator stocked full of soda and alcohol (costly, though, so I didn't partake). I was quite happy with the room overall. Breakfast: The hotel had a decent breakfast (coffee, yogurt, and croissants). There was a computer near the breakfast room for internet access. Front Desk: The front desk staff was helpful and friendly, and I enjoyed talking with them. They spoke mostly Italian - only limited English. I was very happy about this, however, because I wanted the chance to try out my Italian! Food: I went to a wonderful restaurant around the corner and had the best dinner of my entire stay (exit hotel and walk left, then take a left at the first street. You'll see people sitting outside.) There's also a supermarket about 3 blocks away. Location: I chose this hotel because it was close enough to Termini to be convenient for an early morning departure, but far enough away from Termini to be safe and in a decent neighborhood. Because it was to the right of Termini, it was a bit further away from the sites and museums than the other hotels I stayed at (which is probably why it cost less). If you don't mind walking a bit more, then this is a great place to stay. Note: Yes, this hotel was safe, and during the day I felt totally fine walking around. However, I didn't feel as comfortable going out in the evening in this area as a single woman alone (compared to other areas that I stayed in in Rome), as it seemed a bit empty in some stretches. As you get closer to Termini it gets increasingly sketchy. Walking to dinner around the corner was fine, as it was about 8:30pm and only a block or two away. But I wouldn't have walked much further alone. If I had been in a group, however, I would have felt perfectly fine at night.

It was Double delux room with air con - if you stay here in summer you definitely need a room with air con, it's far to hot without.

Also 2 types of cereal, assortment of preserves, cheese, fresh bread rolls, orange juice, coffee or cappucino, tea and assortment of yoghurts. The hotel reception is on the 1st floor of a 5 storey building. the surrounding area is OK - we felt quite safe even late at night - in fact there is some kind of diplomatic building across from the hotel and there are 2 the local police men in a van outside it 24/7 - so its unlikely that you will get mugged near by - all the police have huge guns! We recommend using the subway to get around rome - its really cheap, safe and much kinder to your feet, even the the nuns travel on the subway. There are automated machines to get tickets (which are valid for travel on bus or subway) when you go down. The buses are OK but can get really crowded and hot and very bumpy when travelling along the Roman cobbles. Be careful about getting a taxi when arriving from airport, we met lots of people who had got ripped off. We walked, but if you taxi make sure you agree a price before you set off (should be less than 15 euros from termini to hotel with cases). The Dolomiti was well worth staying at.
