{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Brand New Hotel! We traveled cross country and stayed here on an overnight stay. The hotel was brand new so the rooms were very nice. The hotel was quiet, closely located to restaurants, gas stations, etc. The hotel accepted our reservation with pets (2 dogs) and our experience was great. Would recommend highly. The staff was extremely helpful.", "Date": "Feb 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR686055038", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BRMORGAN"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d642935-r6785778-LaQuinta_Inn-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "642935", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
