The room was pretty clean, a little dinged here and there, but to be expected for a hotel in this price range in LA. Ironing board and iron in the room, frig and hair dryer too. Neighborhood slightly sketch, but not scary or anything, just not the trendy part of Sunset, still a very convenient location--lots of things to do close by.

There was a slightly bad smell in the room that we occasionally noticed. The towels were old and shabby and didn't dry your skin. Soap and combined shampoo/conditioner are in dispensers. As always in motels like this, bring thongs to wear in the shower as you can never be sure that the floor is 100% clean. The location is also average. There are many Thai restaurants in the surrounding area and a dollar store and bakery across the street. There is also a bus stop right out the front.

The rooms were small, and we heard a lot of \"commotion\" from the other rooms around us. This included, a lot of people using their key-less entry to set off their car alarm horns (a lot!), followed by showering in several rooms, and more \"commotion\" (all night long- which we could hear very well from downstairs- probably until 6 am). When I asked for a possible late check out earlier in the evening (on the last night of our 3 night stay), I was told no....then the night shift guy offered me an extra 10 minutes, then said maybe we could work something out for 15 more minutes.... He initially told me I needed to check out at 10:30...30 minutes before the posted 11:00 check out time, that is, until he realized I was an \"actual traveler\" (if you don't know what I'm getting at, I am girl, but not the type that pays for hotels by the hour...pretty offended). I was confused and thought he was joking with me- until later when we heard what was going on in the rooms (all) around us. I finally got him to agree to a 12:00 checkout (but they called at 11:00 the next day to see if we were leaving!). I pointed out that we were flying out of town the next day when I asked for the extended check out time, and the tone of the conversation shifted, I think at that moment he realized he surrounded us with the \"party\" that was to come (which we were not a part), and felt bad. I don't want to presume anything, but I would not suggest staying at this establishment if traveling with family, if you want to get some sleep, or if you plan to stay on a Thursday night (was definitely the worst of the 3)... I'm no stranger to cheaper/bargain motels, but this one actually made me scared to leave my room at night, and gave me nightmares about the activities that might be going on around us. Perhaps we just stayed during a \"special\" night, but it is one we will not forget. If you do stay, try the right side. Also, rooms smaller than pictures make them look. On the plus side, decent cable, free internet, and they have mini fridges. Also, reasonably priced- I guess, a risk you take. Although located on Sunset, quite a ways from the tourist sites- you might want a car (that is, if you can handle driving in the insane LA traffic), we are young and pretty well-traveled, but didn't want to walk at night around the area-not that there was much within walking distance. The Coke machine was completely empty, but it is across the street from a 99 cent store. Shower was decent. The sounds of the people surrounding us really just ruined it for us, and the smells that entered our room...pretty disturbing. Not sure how this place got so many good reviews, must really just depend on the night you're there. Not a relaxing place after a 2,000 mile drive....I have never reviewed a hotel, but I feel it is my duty to tell others of our experience. I just don't want to see a family with children go through what we did. Hopefully, this was a one time experience and is not typical of this establishment.

I wasn't to sure what to think about the motel before I got there, so I just went ahead and made a reservation. So to my suprise, when I pulled up to the motel and found that the area was very decent with plenty of food options, and the motel itself looked nice, my worries faded some. Upon getting checked in and heading to my room, I was once again pleased to find that the room was actually quite nice. I had reserved a king bed room, and the extra ammenities that came along with the room (which I believe are standard for all rooms) were very nice. The room had a fridge, microwave, computer desk with a lamp and all the other standard things. It seemed as though the room had been remodeled somewhat recently, with nice tiling in the desk/sink area, as well as in the bathroom. One thing I was completely blown away by, was the comfort of the bed! For seeming like such a midscale motel, the bed was extremely comforatable. The only one downside really that I would have to say would be the parking. The parking is somewhat limited and they do not have enough spaces for every room. But I was able to get a spot every night, so it wasn't much of a problem. The location of the motel is really nice as well. Close to the freeway, close to all the Hollywood attractions, etc. I've traveled all over the world and have stayed in all sorts of hotels, and I also work in the hotel industry, so I feel I have a pretty good knowledge of a decent hotel when I see one.
