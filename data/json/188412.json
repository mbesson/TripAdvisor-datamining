My bride felt good so we didn't bother booking an \"accessible\" room. In retrospect we should have!!! The lady at the counter(to save her a** I won't write her name) made it a point to make us uncomfortable and feeling cheap. I called the 1-800-travelodge number to book a room as we were going to a company training as we do about once a month for the last 18 months or so with this company but we have been going to that Travelodge for about 8 years now about 3-4 times a year. We got an excellent price compared to usually and were quite content... until we checked in!! The cart was in sorry shape so bringing in our lugage was a rough job. Not sure why but the counter person treated us like dirt and like we didn't even deserve being in a room \"at that price\"! I requested a fridge for my bride's medication when I booked the room and was told by the counter person that at the price we were paying there was no fridge in the room and not to expect one unless we paid for it. I found this weird because at all other times there was no problem and no charge if it was \"for medical reasons\"! However, we managed with ice before and we did again! Had the training not been at that hotel we would have left right there and then. We get to the room and it is ok but more than likely one of the worst of the hotel(I hope so!).Tiles falling off the wall base in the washroom, absolutely no extras and loose plumbing in the shower/tub enclosure(I've mentioned this in previous reviews but they still have not repaired it). There is a coffeemaker however it is not plugged in and not even near a plug so you have to move the tv wall unit or move it to plug it in the bathroom!?! Hey Travelodge: at least install an extension so it can be plugged in where it sits! Another item I've mentioned a few times already is the complete lack of proper lighting! 2 WEAK CFL bulbs in lamps with damaged lampshades are not enough for most baby boomers and unless you go in the bathroom to read at night good luck! The exercise room is clean but a lot of the equipment is in need of repair or very old and decrepit. Unfortunately the pool is still relying on chlorine instead of saltwater and that should be changed asap please Travelodge. On the positive side, the flat screen tv offers an excellent(if somewhat dark) picture and there are many channels to choose from. The heating/ac works very well and the king size bed is totally comfortable. Room was quiet even though planes were flying at eye level from our 3rd floor room. Our conference room was very clean and setup perfectly and all other staff was awesome! Upon checkout, we found counter staff very pleasant and eager to help UNLIKE the staff person at check-in. The Casey's restaurant within the hotel is probably the most \"fun\" of all Casey's we've been to and they have good food at fair prices albeit somewhat slow service. Of special note: it was very bad outside with the snowstorm and the entrance was quite slippery. We saw many people \"slip and save\" but extra carpets would alleviate this problem entirely. Staff tries very hard to keep the area safe with mops and signs but be very careful when it is wet or snowy outside. I rated it average but it is really below average except for the beautiful foyer and the mostly friendly staff(most of the time). Rooms are dated and in need of freshening and sorely in need of proper lighting(most likely to hide the flaws)!

What a mistake we made booking at this place. The shuttle from the airport was late both times even though we called the hotel to request a pickup. The first time it was -20C outside and we didn't have any of our winter clothing on because we were going to the Caribbean. On our way back, our flight came in at 2am so we were VERY tired and just wanted to go to sleep. We and other guests called the hotel a few times to ask about the shuttle and they were very rude. When it finally did show up, the driver didn't even help us with our luggage. Then, when we arrived at the hotel, the very rude and unprofessional female security guard gave us a hassle because we didn't have wristbands on (I guess you needed them because it was New Year's Eve) and asked us if we were even guests at the hotel. Yes lady - we like to walk around the airport hotel strip during the winter with no warm clothing, lugging suitcases in the middle of the night on NYE. Thank you for making us feel so welcome. Then when she did put the wristbands on us, she just about cut circulation off it was so tight. Our travel agent requested a late checkout for us because of our flight times, which was not honoured at the hotel. We were told it was their policy (according to the guy who walked out of the back room, looked at us, and then told us it was their policy) to offer late checkout on New Year's Day. There was nothing posted saying that was the policy and we even offered to pay extra for it. Security was heavy that night and they were being extremely dramatic about it being NYE and all and that they had to keep things under control. I found that extremely ironic because on our way out the next day, we saw the huge sign advertising their \"great rates for walk-ins on NYE!\" If it's going to cause so many problems, don't advertise it at the expense of quiet guests just looking to mind their business and sleep in a little bit during their vacation.

FIX THE BATHROOM PLUMBING ALREADY!! Every tap is loose/hard to operate and the shower head feed from the wall is completely loose.

Had I had a multi-tool I would have tightened the shower water control knob myself in about 1 minute. Everyone who stays there already knows there is a need for updating but why not keep everything up and at least make it look like you are trying?!? In this day and age of consumer awareness what's with the chlorinated pool?Saltwater instead of chlorine is way safer and so much easier for upkeep; it would also give us some kind of indication that you are trying to keep up to date.

Arrived around 11:00 pm. Room was very basic, but seemed clean enough (lighting was dim). Bathroom not horrible, but not great. WAter pressure in the shower was terrible. The worst was the front desk service. We wanted to print our boarding passes before we got to the airport. there is a little computer beside the front desk where you can find your airline and print your passes for free. Nice touch, except our airline was not listed. Every other airline in the world probably was. We were flying Sunwing. Now this is not the hotel's fault, but I stood there at 11:20 at night waiting patiently for the one front desk guy to check in two ladies, which took about 20 minutes, no exaggeration. He never looked at me once, even though I was standing almost right beside him and just needed to ask a quick question. When he was done with the other two ladies, I asked him if he could help me. He responded \"no\". What?? So I asked him if there was someone else around who might know anything about this program. He responded \"no\". Not, \"oh I'm sorry but I'm the only one here\". Just \"no\". So I said, \"how about a manager?\". He said \"there's no manager this late at night\". So I said \"well, can you check in the back if anyone else might be able to help me\". He responded \"it's a new program and we don't know anything about it\". Well, it's in your hotel, you should know something about it. He reluctantly got someone else to come out and look, and she took a brief look at the computer and said \"I don't know, you can try printing them in the business centre downstairs\". How do I do that? Well, I have to go back up to the 7th floor and get my credit card, and then back down to below the lobby level, to print two boarding passes for 50 cents each. This is at almost 11:45 pm and I have to be up at 3:15 am. Needless to say, I didn't do it. While I somewhat understand if someone didn't know the program (although as I mentioned earlier - it's in your hotel, you should know something about it), it was the attitude of the employees that really ticked me off. Just a \"no, can't help you\". Even a \"sorry\" thrown in there would have sounded much better. For the price, you can find much nicer hotels in the area.
