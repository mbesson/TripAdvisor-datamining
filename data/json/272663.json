We went to this hotel in January to take our four dogs to the beach. When we called to make a reservation, the lady on the phone was very pleasant. When we arrived, she was even nicer and very accommodating to both us and the dogs. She said we could give notice at any time if we wanted to stay another day and let us check in very, very early. (We did stay another day) It must be said that I rated five stars for the DOGS. Where else can you go that they happily accept four large dogs? This place was perfect: tile floors, the rooms have a community back yard with screen and glass doors to the patio, literally on Dog Beach, the rooms are simple so there's no worrying about the dogs ruining something in all their frenzy, and the dog wash station they provide is awesome! Shampoo, towels, hoses. Don't come here expecting anything fancy. Bare simple basic for the humans- it really seems like a dog hotel first. But when you get to go to the beach with all your dogs instead of leaving them with a babysitter, it's totally worth the cheesy bedding and squeaky mattress. (Besides, who'd want to put nice bedding out if you know dogs were gonna be all over it?) The dogs had a fantastic time and we have already made another reservation for March.

If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a pet in tow, it is merely an overpriced, rundown beachside motel. If you brought pups along, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an awesome experience. We brought our two dogs and stayed in the downstairs, dog-friendly rooms. The Bad: ancient, creaky spring mattresses, ants (albeit harmless, tiny ones), noise from upstairs, no sign of maid services (we stayed two nights), limited nearby dining options (it is in an aging residential neighborhood), occasional homeless bum sighting. Absurdly dim room lighting. San Diego\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beaches are generally surprisingly cloudy and cold unless you visit during late summer or early fall. The Good: decent fare at the free continental breakfast. The closest dining option is excellent: the Surf Rider Pizza Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (http://www.surfriderpizzacafe.com/) served outstanding, huge veggie Stromboli. The TV set offered about 60 channels. Their free wi-fi was painless. The heater/AC unit drowns out all noise, enabling a decent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The Dog: Instant entertainment/chaos provided by opening your sliding-glass door, which puts you in the common, fenced-in dog run. Neighboring pups are free to visit, and will, whether you want them or not. For whatever reason, dogs almost always get along when no leashes are involved, and ours did fine. Very short walk to neighboring Dog Beach, which allows dogs to be unleashed and frolic in the surf. The water is shallow and the beach is bordered by a tidal basin. There were about twenty dogs there every time we visited, mostly retrievers frantically diving in after thrown balls.

Computer in lobby for guest use. Close and with in walking distance to Ocean Beach boardwalk/attractions, restaurants, etc. Cons - The place is run down, in need of a MAJOR refurbishment and everything is very out dated!! This is by no means a hotel, it's a motel at best. The rooms are small, the beds feel like you're sleeping on springs (probably the worst nights sleep I've ever had), the linen had holes in some of them, i.e. holes in bedspread and blanket, the unit we were in only had a shower stall and no bathtub, the grout in the tile floors either need a massive cleaning or new grout because it's very dirty. The woodwork on the walls is knicked all through out, the ceiling fan in the room we were in only worked if the bathroom light was on which made me think there was some faulty electrical wiring in the place. We did have our dogs with us and the place allows dogs. Those traveling with dogs are put in the first level units and all the first level unit patio doors open to a large enclosed area in the back so everyone's dogs are out there together which is fine. The problem being is that if you don't close your door you will have other people's dogs wandering through your room, which happened to be the case with us. What's worst is that someone else's dog went #2 on one of our beds and another dog (or maybe it was the same one, who knows) lifted it's leg and peed on the other bed. That's when I said we were out of there. It was bad enough they were charging almost $200 a night (including tax and pet fee) when the place isn't even worth even what a Motel 6 charges a night!! We had booked for 5 nights and checked out after 1. There is an outdoor heated pool that looked like it was kept up, although we didn't use it. If you're looking for anything luxurious you won't find this here.

The location was great with the beach right behind the motel; a quiet spot to return to after a day of sight-seeing. We liked to sit on the balcony overlooking the beach to eat our complimentary breakfast, which was nothing fancy, but good, nonetheless. My wife liked the cactus and succulents,all labeled, planted around the parking lot, many of which were in bloom while we were there. The Ocean Villa is \"dog friendly\" but we saw only a couple of dogs and didn't hear any. The only downside, and I really would rather not include this, in case it turns potential guests away, but the motel is very near the the flight path for the San Diego Airport. We heard lots of planes, BUT, NO planes fly after 10pm or before 6:30am. We really appreciated the Ocean Villa as a great place for our family and we will stay there again.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cadded charges to credit card 4 days after leaving\u201d", "Author": "cathartes", "ReviewID": "UR14267627", "Content": "Not open and upfront about what the room will cost - beware of making reservations online!

When I called to ask what the extra charge was, she explained that there was an additional pet fee that I hadn't been charged for originally and that I'd signed something that said I agreed to the pet fee.

It is fabulous...close to the water and 15 minutes or so from almost everything else. It is a small Inn and therfore quiet. Parking is close and ample. We stayed in room 31 which is our favorite. Unfortunately on this trip the heater was not working, the toilet backed up and one of the box springs squeaked every time you moved. The staff was very helpful in providing us with extra blankets and a plunger. Maintenance came the next day and flipped the mattress which helped a little, but not much. He was not able to fix the heater so we were provided with a portable radiator which took care of the chilly night temperatures. One trial with the plunger and that was taken care of as well. We had a very loud party going on next door on New Years Eve. Once again the staff was attentive and dealt with the situation quickly and appropriately. It took sveral contacts from the staff but the excessive noise finally did stop. We stay at the Ocean Villa Inn because it is normally very quiet and located close to the water. We have also been pleased with the staff handling issues should they arise. We have enjoyed 10 years of vacationing at Ocean Beach and hope to enjoy staying at Ocean VIlla Inn for at least another 10. Despite the issues we had a very restful and relaxing stay. We will be returning the first weekend in April and hope that the box spring on the bed by the balcony has been replaced and the heater has been fixed by then.

Behind the pet friendly rooms is a fenced in grass area for you to take your pets out to take care of thier business and the neccesary tools needed to clean up after them too. I would recomend this hotel to anyone who loves dogs. Ocean Villa Inn is walking distance to many restraunts and some of them will actually allow you to bring your dog with you, and alow you to eat on the patio. I only have one suggestion for improvement on this hotel. I would love to see another ramp on the side of the hotel closest to the beach, as to make it easier for disabled persons to get to thier rooms.
