This was my first stay, but I know I will be back. Starting with Henry, who was very pleasant and professional when initially taking my phone reservations and then greeting us upon our arrival, made my wife and I feel like family. Bob was very accommodative with some special requests and went far beyond my expectations in helping me. Richard offered the same professional and friendly attention when I needed immediate assistance, and Carol helped make the check out process a quick and painless process. The restaurant staff at the Marquesa is also top notch. Manager Dave Bell made sure the impeccable service matched the quality of the food. And Bonnie was the best server we ever had.

You can tell from all the previous reviewers that it is a great place to stay, with the best service and beautiful grounds and rooms. There's one aspect of the stay that prevents the Marquesa from being perfect. If you are researching the hotel, you know that it is not inexpensive. When paying a certain price, it is always nice to feel like you are getting something a bit \"extra\", however small it might be. In the case of the Marquesa, I think providing a complimentary breakfast, if only something light, would be such a nice addition to their guest services. You can obtain a continental breakfast for $10, but it seems like a way to charge guests for something extra. Also, it would have been delightful to have some sort of snack offered with the afternoon iced tea. Good food often helps establish strong memories of hotel stays for us, if only a few freshly baked muffins and coffee.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Park Ridge, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cThe Marquesa is our favorite destination\u201d", "Author": "xp76er", "ReviewID": "UR125571741", "Content": "This is our third stay at the Marquesa and the third time we loved it!

We reserved one of the suites at the Marquesa for a night - before going on to Little Palm Island for my wife's 50th getaway. While on the plane I casually checked the reviews on the Marquesa... (yeah, I know... a wee bit late, yes, but when I was scheduling the trip, my wife's father was passing and everything was too nutso, so I simply 'went' with the Amex advice.) So imagine my discomfort when I read a review giving the MARQUESA 3 out of 5 stars... not a good moment. Ahhhh, but when we were taken by cab from the Key West Airport to the 600 Flemming Street address of The Marquesa, my concerns lessened. The staff greeted us with warmth and courtesy, and 'Richard' sat down to complete our arrival papers. Ok, this Richard guy... this is NOT his 1st Rodeo! What a terrific and accomodating gentleman this was. He took my request for dinner reservations, promptly had us reserved at a marvelous seafood bistro, and then accompanied us to the suite. One look at my wife upon entering the suite erased any concerns about that ridiculous 3 star review. Either this was a very old set of reviews, or the 4 people who wrote the reviews lacked any and all cerebral capacity. The room was bright, dang near 'antiseptic' clean, and wonderfully appointed with very comfortable classic furniture in refreshing green and white patterns... yeah, beautifully 'Key West'd'! As soon as he had welcomed us to our suite Richard asked us if we'd enjoy a glass of wine... and he soon returned with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc for my wife and a delightful Pinot Noir for me. Yeah... 3 star \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 uh uh! No way! The Marquesa is wonderfully situated about 1 1/2 blocks from Duval Street, and even better, from Starbucks! It's only a five minute walk down to Mallory Square, through all the kitschy and classy shops, and to the water docks where restaurants abound. The sleep at the Marquesa was blessed, and the mattress and pillows were 5 Star comfort. My wife and I have been fortunate to be able to experience some truly marvelous places, The Point in Saranac Lake, Little Palm Island, Cayo Espanto in Belize, and other amazing spots to rest your soul. While the Marquesa is not what I would call a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122... it IS one beautiful, comfortable, VERY clean, and well cared for little gem in Key West!

The extra price was not too high and we took it. At the end we spent fantastic moments there and it was by far the best place to stay.

My wife and I traveled to Key West with another couple who have been known to have upscale taste. They loved this place. It was clean, quiet and relaxing. They make you feel right at home and are very accomodating with any request. Again it was VERY clean ad quiet. The hotel is 2 blocks off of Duval and centrally located on the island. It was very convienent to walk to Mallory Square or the marina. There is a store right down the street from the hotel that sells everything from wine to beers and nachos. The scenery inside the Marquesa is amazing and the two pools were very clean and well kept. One is heated and the other is not but when the temperature drops from 90 degress to 85 degress at night it is hard to tell which is which. Coffee in the morning and water in the afternoon were readily availab le outside of our rooms. It is the most relaxing place to spend your time. The only concern I have of the hotel is the business office. The computers in this area are very dated and very slow. I would hope that they update these soon. trying to print out boarding passes from the archaic software took an extremely long time. Seems like a very easy fix. Also, the water pressure is very low when taking a shower. They are definitely missing the boat on table side service if for nothing else then drinks and small snacks. We all said we would never leave to eat breakfast or lunch if these were choices of ours. They have a resturant on the premises, so how hard could it be to send around a waitress to ask if we needed a drink or a snack? Again, a wonderful place to stay.

We ended up having one of the best hotel experiences of our lives. Check In: We arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon and were promptly greeted the beautiful lobby. The main building of the hotel is on the National Historic Registry and it has been meticulously restored. Our host at check in spent about 10 minutes orienting us using a map of Key West and then gave us a tour of the property. He then took us to our room (we were upgraded to a suite on the third floor) where we settled in and a few minutes later he arrived back with two glasses of complementary wine and a full ice bucket. There are no elevators allowed in the building because of the Historic status so if stairs are a problem, make sure you book a room on the first floor as they do not mention this when you make your reservation. The Room: Our room was in the Main House of the property. The property is comprised of three or four buildings surrounding a beautiful pool and garden area. The room was immaculate and extremely clean. The bed and bedding were what you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Many rooms on the property have balconies or porches. Ours did not but we were happy to sit outside by the pool and drink the complementary coffee and iced tea that is available throughout the day. There was a full mini bar with prices that were very reasonable considering the caliber of the hotel ($2.50 for bottled/sparkling water, $6 for cocktails). They also offer a continental breakfast for $10/person that they will either deliver to your room or set up for you at a table by the pool. Food in Key West: Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Marquesa: The first night we ate at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Marquesa which is on the first floor of the hotel. I would book this reservation though the hotel as it appeared we were given a better table because we were staying at the hotel. The food , and service were all excellent. With cocktails and a bottle of wine, we ended up spending around $130. This is the highest rated Zagat restaurant in Key West so if you are staying at the hotel, you will not want to miss it. Island Joes Coffee: Excellent coffee shop one block away from the hotel. Coffee is fantastic and they also serve a variety of breakfast options at very reasonable prices. Sarabeth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: We had breakfast here one day and it was very good. They are known for their marmalade and I now understand why. It is only a block away from the hotel. It is a little pricy for breakfast but the quality of the breads and omelet we had was very high. Azur: We ended up going here for lunch one day. It is about 5 blocks east of the hotel. They have lunch specials for only $6. My wife and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide what to get so we ordered 4 lunches\u00ef\ufffd\u0160 The seafood risotto and the gnocchi were some of the best that I have ever had. They also have 2 for 1 mimosas for lunch which were delicious. Half Shell Raw Bar: The hotel recommended this place to us. We ended up going here every afternoon for their $0.50 happy hour oysters. I am not usually a fan of gulf oysters but these were small to medium sized and absolutely delectable. I believe that happy hour runs from 4PM to 7PM. A wide selection of draft beer is available for less than $2 during happy hour and I believe other drinks are half off as well. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss this place. Latitudes: Definitely the highlight of our trip. You have to take a ferry from the Westin near Mallory over to Sunset Key. Latitudes is in the main building of the Westin Guest Cottages resort and it spill outside onto a sandy beach. We had dinner at a very private table set up on wood decking on the beach. Food and service were excellent and the setting was truly remarkable. Not a cheap option by any means but we thought it was definitely worth it. This is probably the most difficult reservation in Key West so make sure you book in advance if you want a table outside. Activities: The only real activity we did (other than eating, drinking, and laying by the pool) was visit the Butterfly conservatory. Only $10 and definitely worth it. Thousands of butterflies of all shapes and sizes flying around you, landing on you, etc. Wow!! Summary: We had an amazing time.

I could not have asked for greater care, attention to detail and communication. The level of professionalism and customer care went beyond my expectations. Check-in was a delight. The gentlman, Richard, who extended welcome on behalf of the Marquesa was professional and gracious. The junior suite (#21) was immaculate and, of course, tasteful in decor. It is utterly amazing that this property maintains immaculate conditions everywhere. The cleaning staff is to be congratulated for their care and attention to detail. Each evening, turn-down service was carefully executed. Ice was replenished, blinds closed, lights turned on, towels replenished and chocolate left on the night table. Again, perfection! The grounds are maintained with supreme care. Those responsible for the grounds are to be congratulated for their excellent work. From orchids to palms, everything was beautiful and reflected the \"paradise\" one equates with the Marquesa. The guests staying at this property were delightful. It was enjoyable to speak with them and learn that they, too, were enjoying the peaceful beauty and respecting the solace. The Marquesa distinguishes itself in myriad ways, not the least of which is the quality of guests it attracts. Interestingly, we (guests) spoke of the level of comfort and beauty that one pays for when choosing the Marquesa. The Marquesa did not disappoint. One morning, I had breakfast served in the room. It was timely, hot, and delicious. We enjoyed dinner at the Marquesa Cafe. The food was perfect, the staff was gracious and the environment - like the rest of the property - immaculately cared for. Iced tea, fresh lemon, water, ice, plastic cups, straws and large plush towels were provided poolside each day. Again, care was taken to maintain the beverages, ice and towels throughout the day. Mary, a lovely lady who works at the property, is gracious and a ever helpful. She typifies the graciousness that is the Marquesa. Mary cares for guests during the day with a gentle welcoming spirit that is appreciated by guests, and obviously valued by the Marquesa. The Marquesa is a quality \"experience\". It is much more than simply a hotel. While the cost is significant to stay at the Marquesa, when measured against the level of care, comfort, cleanliness and peace that one can expect at this property, the benefits outweigh the cost by substantial measure. I travel often. I stay at myriad properties and usually take the time to comment when they are awful or excellent, rarely when they are adequate. The Marquesa is beyond excellent. I enjoyed 5 wonderful days at this lovely property and would encourage any TripAdvisor reader to safely reserve at this property knowing that one can reasonably expect a bit of perfection in paradise!

During that specific week (Fantasy Fest), they had a 60 day cancellation policy, rather than the usual 30 days. End of story: The Marquessa kept my entire deposit. Well, I never saw the 60 day cancellation fine print. More importantly, Marquesa Hotel did not contact me to verify my cancellation and make sure I knew that they intended to keep the deposit. Seems to me this would be standard business practice given the large deposit and amended cancellation policy. This may be a high-end boutique hotel but their business dealings are on the shady side.

The location, just 2 blocks from Duval, is great. It's quiet, yet there is easy access to restaurants and bars. There are lots of great places to eat in Key West. Here are a few we recommend trying: Marquesa Cafe - Great restaurant at the hotel, great food, nice atmosphere, and a great wine list Sarabeth's - We had breakfast here one morning. I had the pink shrimp omlette and my wife had lemon ricotta pancakes. Both were delicious. Definitely try this place, it's right around the corner from Marquese Blue Heaven - We had lunch here, which was really good. It's a pretty funky place with roosters walking around everywhere (they're all over Key West). 915 Duval - This is definitely one to try. It's in a beautiful victorian house with great outdoor seating. We sat on the porch, which was great for people watching, and ordered small plates (tuna tartare was great, and the mussels were out of this world - order them is they're on the menu) Banana Cafe - another breakfast place with a lot of crepes on the menu. We preferred Sarabeth's, but Banana is worth a try. SevenFish - Eat here at all costs - it's fantastic. We made last minute reservations and sat at the bar, and was definitely our favorite Key West restaurant. The grouper was absolutely outstanding as was the penne with mango chutney, crawfish and scallops. Try the sweet potato pie for dessert. Also, the sunsets in Key West are breathtaking. We went to Mallory Square for the \"sunset celebration\" on one night, but spent the other two at the Top Lounge (atop the La Concha hotel). It's a pretty interesting crowd, and the view is really amazing.

We didn't use the pool itself but we went out in the evening and sat poolside. The pool area is beautiful and the landscaping is superb. The only negative with the room itself is noise from the street and doors opening/closing at certain times of day. It's not incredibly noisy because the location is off Duval but I expected less from this level of hotel. They should try to noiseproof the rooms overlooking the streets. As other reviewers noted, breakfast is not included which was dissappointing but there are good brunch places very close by. The location is ideal: two blocks off Duval in a safe area. After we parked, we never had to use the car for the weekend. Note that there are not enough parking spaces for all the rooms so you need a little luck getting a spot. The hotel service was good and the restaurant/tour recommendations were inline with the hotel class. In other words, they were good. We dined at the Cafe Marquesa one night. The food was very good except we had to wait 30 minutes for our table although we made reservations the previous day. However, they took care of us at dinner with a freebie and the service was outstanding. One other improvement is the internet access. They have wireless service but I had trouble connecting due to poor reception. Obviously, I didn't use it that much but you gotta have it. They seem to have a hotel computer you can use though.

Boy, were we impressed with the Marquesa. We originally read about the Marquesa in 2006 and all of the good things on the reviews were true and accurate. The reservation was easy, the pre-stay arrangements were perfect, the room was great, the staff was very nice and helpful (I can't imagine where the bad comments ever came from), the pool area was delightful and the food service in the restaurant and the room service breakfast were great. Our room (107 - Deluxe Queen) was spacious with a lovely separate sitting room area. The room was spotless. The twice a day service was perfect and totally non-intrusive. It's the first hotel that ever called to ask what would be a good time for them to come to do the evening turn down. I had read some comments about the rooms in the main building being noisy because they face the street and we did not find that to be true at all. It was one of the quietest rooms we have ever stayed in. The only thing that you should know before selecting a room in the main building are the stairs. You will have one (or two) long sets of steps to your room (no elevator). But, for us, it was well worth the climb. If steps are a problem, go for the rooms that face the pool. The food service. The raves about the Cafe Marquesa are well justified. We had an excellant dinner there. Food was excellant, the service was very attentive and not rushed in what is clearly a high demand restaurant. No surprises here. The reviews were all good and the experience lived up to it. I do, want to make mention of the in-room breakfast service. I read an earlier post that complained about this and I think it is totally unfounded. The breakfast menu was very nice, the service was timely and pleasant and the prices were more than fair. We have stayed many places around the country and have paid a lot more for inferior breakfasts at other 5 star hotels and resorts. Don't hesitate to go for the in-room breakfast, but don't get lazy because Sarabeth's is only 1 block away and not to be missed. The hotel staff.

Our favorite member of the staff was Mary who spent as much time with us as we needed in mapping out our daily itinerary to shops, galleries, restaurants, sightseeing highlights, bicycling paths, historic homes, and etc. PS.... she even made all the restaurant reservations for us as well as the sunset cheese and wine cruise we enjoyed so much. Although we had a convertible for transportation, we preferred using our rental bicycles because of the Inn's strategic location in Old Key West where all the action was.

Our primary concern from the previous stay had been the condescending, unconcerned attitude of the staff and management. So upon arrival, and learning that our request for one of the rooms in the back (Carriage House) had not been honored, and then met with aloofness, we were crushed, but not surprised. However, after some insistance, we were granted our original request, and our stay from then on was everything we had first loved the Marquesa for. If you can do it, definately book a junior suite \"Carriage House\" room. These are, I believe, rooms 23-27, in the back. they have gorgeous vaulted ceilings, large poster beds, a little front portico, and a great feeling of luxurious charm. Personally, I would be unsatisfied with the other junoir suites at the same price that are not the \"carriage house\" rooms. The pools are great, although because of all of the beautiful tropical landscaping, there is limited sun exposure if a tropical tan is what you are after. Relaxation and tranquility, howerver is yours to enjoy. HUGE bonus... no kids allowed!! One note regarding the heated pool....not so great on a hot early Sept. afternoon but lovely in the evening with a glass of cool Krug champagne! Rooms are great, and room service does not miss a thing. Fresh towels and ice magically appear throught the day and turn down service is never missed. I must say that customer service is a constant hit or miss in the lobby. It ranges from extremely helpful, thoughtful, interested, and thorough to aloof and cold. This continues to astound us. If this one aspect was rectified, the stay would be flawless, in our opinion. Not to be missed in Key West is Seven Fish, a resturant void of character but the absolutely BEST food.

The Hotel is for all ages, we particularly liked how each room ( more of a suite really ) was very spacious & spotlessly clean. Turn down service was obligatory & is only a small sign of the excellent service provided. The hotel has a private garage for parking & is only 5 minutes walk from the main commercial street.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBest of the best\u201d", "Author": "Johnfromparis", "ReviewID": "UR8659626", "Content": "This is the best choice one could make...I booked a Junior Suite after reading the reviews from tripadvisor.

Well...The service was simply perfect, the room was large, 2 TVs,very comfy bed, Housekeeping was great. The pools area feels like you are in the jungle, far away from messy Duval St...which happens to be in walking distance. The minibar is cheap and they keep on bringing you ice in your room when you are not there. The only thing was the concierge...Not that great. KW is small, walk or drive around and you will find your own places...We rented a boat from 2 different places, one was on the marina on the concierge advice (I took the best boat they had which happened to be just OK....) and the next day, after looking on the internet, I rented inside the Hyatt Hotel, from Thunder Boat a really powerful one, much much better....for almost the same price. The other thing that I found kind of weird was that one of the 2 pools is heated !!!

This was our 5th stay. Our first stay was when we married in Key West. The Marquesa has drastically slipped since our last visit two years ago. Our complaints are numerous. While the grounds are as lovely as ever, they have changed one of the pools into a \"heated therapeutic pool\". Who needs a hot pool in Key West? This forced the majority of guests to cram into the other pool. They added a flat screen tv to the room, but removed beautiful artwork and left holes unpatched in the wall. Who needs two tv's in the room, even our junior suite? They added a refrigerator in the bathroom under the sink that appeared to be circa 1970's. One night a leak sprung from the bathroom ceiling that was a result of the air conditioning drip pan overflowing. The next night wasn't much better with the air conditioner making noises like it might break at any time. We paid 400+ for this? The book of menus in the lobby contains menus for restaurants that have closed or moved from their listed locations years ago. Some menus date back to 2003 and older. Finally, we didn't expect anything special for our initial honeymoon at the Marquesa, however, after visiting repeatedly over the past ten years, any gesture would have been appreciated besides the ribbons on our table at the Cafe Marquesa for our over-priced anniversary dinner. We had a much better experience on our first visit to Morgan's Rock in Nicaragua, which we can highly recommend.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cHidden Paradise\u201d", "Author": "Springtown", "ReviewID": "UR8020454", "Content": "My husband and I only had one night in Key West and we are so glad we spent it here.

Very impressed with this hotel. The staff could not be any nicer! A nice touch is indoor parking, but it is small and limited to about 9-10 cars. We arrived about 3:30pm and got the last indoor spot. There is additional parking outside. We had a 'Queen Deluxe' room (#2). It had a comfy queen sized bed, and a fold out queen sized sofa bed that I was told was surprisingly comfortable by the folks who used it. I was expecting the room to be a little larger, but the 4 of us weren't too cramped. The bathroom was very large. Nice 26\" (or so) LCD TV. Private deck overlooking one of the 2 pools with 2 chairs, 2 small tables and a lounger. The landscaping is awesome, lots of palms and tropical foilage. Well maintained, and very nice.The location is very nice. One minute, half block walk to a small but nicely equiped grocery, with a deli and beer/wine, liquor store just a minute further (on Fleming towards Duval). Mallory Square is just about a 10 minute walk... if you don't stop for a drink or shopping. The Cafe Marquesa adjacent, look very elegant, but too upscale for us so we did not eat there. I did look at a menu and entrees were in the $30-$40 neighborhood. We were there mid-week and there were always chairs and loungers available poolside, with fresh large towels provided and always available. The staff were very attentive and always available to help us in any way needed. The $50 per person, per night charge for the 3rd and 4th person was a bit excessive I think, but the same was being charged by other hotels I checked before booking.

We had specific criteria, we didn't want to travel too far, wanted warm weather and a great hotel where we could relax. We decided on the Marquesa Hotel based on reviews here on Tripadvisor and also articles from travel magazines. We have stayed in some beautiful and some historic hotels during our travels (Sagamore, Mohonk Mountain House, Biltmore, RIU, Hotel Palestine, Dromoland Castle, Princeville resort etc) and the Marquesa is most definitely in the top 3. We had suite #5, which was an absolutely stunning room. The doors opened up to a porch where we enjoyed breakfast and a view of one of the pools. The room had a huge bed, vaulted ceiling and the perfect size bathroom and always plenty of towels. It gave me some great ideas for when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to re-do my bedroom!! The pool was great fun, we found the non-heated pool to be most refreshing, always plenty of towels there too. The staff was extremely helpful when we needed them and we barely noticed them when we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We never saw the housekeeping staff but yet our room was made up when we returned from breakfast and our bed turned down and the lights on when we returned from dinner. The management of this hotel knows how to run a hotel. The Marquesa is perfectly located 2 blocks off of Duval. Close enough to walk to shopping and the nighttime action, but far enough away not to be disturbed by the noise.

This was my first time visiting during the peak season. The rate was 450 plus tax for a Jr. Suite. It was great room and amenities are good. They now have flat screen TVs. Internet service is free but spotty in rooms, excellent by the pool. There was a wine reception on Sat evening for the guests--a nice touch. Guests are different when its the high season. It's an older crowd and less diverse. It was spring break and quite a few teens were there with parents. I must say I was initially concerned, but they were all excellent guests and well behaved. A number of guests got complimentary upgrades to suites while I was there. While this is usual hotel practice, in a small property, I wish the staff was more discrete about it. I had fronted the money up front and received no special upgrade other than a check in bottle of Fiji water. The only other thing that bothered me was the snootiness of the front office staff. This is key west, land of the casual--attitude belongs on the mainland. When we checked out, we stayed a few hours in the lobby of the hotel until our flight. The owner came out of the office and asked if we needed help. We told hime we just checked out and were waiting to go to the airport. He shrugged his shoulders and left irritated we were sitting there. Now mind you, we spend 6 nights there and 3000 dollars in his hotel. A thank you and \"I hope you enjoyed your stay\" would have been more appropriate, Not all staff slung attitude. Housekeeping and grounds personel were lovely and very helpful.
