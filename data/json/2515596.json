The most recent, previous stay was in the Primrose building three years ago, and we had a great time then. All pools were open, resort was meticulous, was told in the \"owners update\" meeting that unless we switched to points we wouldn't get to stay in the new buildings. Fast forward to April 20th. Late check-in, after a 5.5 hour drive. Staff was ready and happy to greet us when we showed up. I asked if we would be staying in the same room as before, but they said I hadn't yet been assigned. I asked if I could stay in one of the new buildings close to a pool and they put me in just that! I declined owners updates as I like to play as much poker as possible while in Vegas, and last time I lost half of my chips while trying to finish up... Room was immaculate. No wear and tear at all. We had a view of the western skyline (some unforgettable sunsets during a storm), as well as the new building that is currently having its first floor layed out. Found out the main pool was closed for resurfacing. No big deal, there are three others on the property. We love this place. For a week stay in Vegas, you cannot beat it. We would hit the strip whenever we wanted and be low-key the other times. Southpoint is a great casino for those not interested in the hustle and bustle of those on the strip. The \"free\" shuttle we were used to is now an $8 per person all day shuttle. Where before we would only be able to meet up with it at Excalibur, now they added Southpoint, Aria, and TI. $8 is still a great deal for all day transportation to and from the strip. Cab fare to the strip via the freeway is right around $20. The on-site coffee/convenient store was the same. Lacking luster as far as breakfast is concerned. I have yet to try lunch or dinner. I couldn't seem to get a grill to light up so was forced to use one that was never scrubbed down. My suggestion to the resort would be for them to install wire brushes on each grill that are anchored down. That way I don't have to scrape the previous travelers meal off with the other end of my grilling tools before I get started. That was a very unfortunate thing, I like a clean grill. Overall a great trip. Construction was a bit annoying, especially the blow horns, but it was impressive how quickly they laid the concrete for the new building, maybe in three years I'll stay in that one.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Maria, California", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Timeshare Property\u201d", "Author": "alykay19", "ReviewID": "UR128647185", "Content": "We stayed in the Rosemary Building on the 18th floor and it was very quiet.

We did not have a balcony which would have been nice, but we enjoyed what we did have. We were close to the Las Vegas Outlets and really enjoyed shopping there, plus we were right beside The South Point Casino and got to see movies for just $4 for seniors and enjoy a great buffet.

It was a really nice welcome to a new vacation spot. There was an issue with the room only that it wasn't the location that the desk clerk and I thought that it was, so we asked to be moved and the hotel was quick to accomodate. The staff was polite and things moved smoothly after that point. Now, this part is just a warning and has nothing to do with this resort, as even they can't control nature! lol As the week progressed, we were expecting the weather to be in the 80's and here is where my warning about Las Vegas weather comes in... be ware that it isn't always the case there, especially when you factor in HIGH winds. There were days where the pool had to be shut down for safety reasons, because the pool side furniture blew into the pool over and over again. Also, rather than the 80 degrees that we were expecting, we got 50's and 60's most of the days and 70-80 only one or two of the 8 days and 7 nights that we were there. NOT ideal, but again this had nothing to do with the hotel. If you are allergy prone, one thing that may help you to enjoy your visit better is to bring your allergy medicine with you. One of our children and I lived off of allergy medicine the whole trip. The wind kicked up spores among other things and it really cause a painful, swelling, type of reaction each day. This could be something that only caused an issue for our family, but just in case it is always good to prepare ahead of time. The issues that we had pertaining to the resort, were mainly due to the pool temperature. We called prior to booking our trip to investigate if the pools were heated; would the heat be turned on in the pools while we were there and how many pools were there? The answers that we received were: The pools are kept at 83 degrees; YES the heat would be on in the pool while we were there and there are 5 pools plus other hot tubs there. We were thrilled to hear this and booked our vacation. While at the resort, the pools that we located were ice cold for the first three days. We finally made it to the one pool which was heated on the fourth day. Then, because out of all the pools there having a temp no where near 80 degrees and closer to Freezing, (we later found out through other guests that ALL but this pool were cold), it appeared that every pool seeking guest was packed into the warm pool. When you consider the sun block, oils and skin of everyone melding together into a single soup, that is the cloudy look that the water had. We didn't even want to get into it at all. Now, the upset that we had is that while at the resort we contacted the staff multiple times without any pool temperature change, before the manager got involved and checked the pools. Once this happened we were at the end of our trip and had literally about an hour of laying out by the warm pool which was so packed and gross that we didn't get to go in and a couple of us ended up with colds trying to make do with the Freezing pools. Because the pool had be closed a day and then the other pools were cold, we didn't get any fun pool time. When I brought this to the manager's attention, they did their best to help fix the issue for us and also helped to end our vacation on a better note. For that, we were thankful. As well traveled individuals who frequently vacation and expect our accomodations to be as promised by staff and reviews, we were happy to receive what we consider to be proper customer care by the higher ups. This DID benefit them for the future as we intend to remain customers of their resort and visit them again this summer and potentially bring more family with us. Because this next visit will be at a different time of year, we expect there to be no pool issues and we can only hope that Mother Nature cooperates this time around! :) Some good things: VERY close to a Walmart for less costly food purchase 10 minutes from the strip which is close enough, yet far away for quiet and relaxation 20 minutes from Nellis AFB (If you are military) The commissary is there and you can food shop there and get tickets to places The resort sells discounted tickets as well, however you must pay in cash only and there is an 18% tax charge The Casino next door is South Point and it's convenient and not bad to try a few hands of BJ or play the slots. Also has places to eat, but it's really costly; a bowling ally and a movie theater are also inside. Thinngs to consider with kids: Something that I wasn't expecting is that children seem to be allowed in the casinos. I don't really like to bring them in though because there is SMOKING in every one. It's NOT what you would want your kids around while on a family trip if you aren't a smoker or have a child that is asthmatic. Example: Getting to Circus circus' Adventure dome. Another thing to keep in mind is that most of the shows or kid's entertainment or dinner shows causes you to walk through the casinos that are smoke filled and also have scantily dressed female card dealers or table top dancers all over the place. I mean practically naked in many cases. Example: Getting to the Excalibur dinner show. A place that takes a lot of walking, but NOT through casinos and is child friendly and fun would be to go to the Mandalay Bay Aquarium. Long line, but still Fun! Also, probably for older children the Wax museum was a stand alone place to visit and had plenty of celebs to take pics with. Hope that some of this is helpful. :)", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cStill nice, but getting tired...\u201d", "Author": "Jane9383", "ReviewID": "UR128077485", "Content": "We have been visiting the Grandview since it opened.

We are timeshare owners and traded to this location.We had a one bedroom unit. After reading previous Trip Advisor reviews, we asked about being in the Daisy or Rosemary newer units when called about the reservation and again at check in. Luckily, we were able to get on the 16th floor of the Rosemary. There is an outer door from the hallway. Then, there are two separate units within. The unit had two flat screen televisions (one in living room area and one in the bedroom), granite counters in the kitchen, a nice big shower with clear doors, a seating area between the bathroom's double sinks, a washer/dryer in the unit, and a sleeper sofa. There was a jacuzzi between the bedroom and bathroom. The decor was modern and tastefully done. There was a DVD player, which we didn't use. The unit has a safe, which you will be asked if desired to be used at check in for $10. We called twice during the visit for maintenance issues, and within 15 minutes, the item was corrected. Carlos worked on our first item and was very determined to fix our issue. The next one was a light out in the hallway, which was quietly fixed within the hour. There are 21 floors according to the elevator but no floor 13. LIght housekeeping was done on Tuesday of our stay, the place was tidied and fresh towels were given. The entire week was very quiet, although we knew the building was packed by the parking areas. The nice thing is that there is a two floor parking garage at the end of the building, so we may have had to use a side door and walk a little further but it was well lit and always had space. My husband used the Fitness Center and said it had a variety of equipment. There is a deli/gift shop across from it. I used the Business Center in the main building to check the Internet and print items. There are about 6 or 7 computers in there. The resort is right next to the South Point Casino. Our first night, we just walked over to Steak and Shake. Check out is at 10 a.m. It really is no fuss to check out. You just take out the trash, which has a room with a trash shute down the hall, put linen in the tub, load the dishwasher, and leave keys on the counter. You then call the main number for check out. Some timeshares really make you work to check out! There is security who are regularly seen around the resort. We were called about the timeshare presentation but declined and were not called again. The resort is about 20 minutes from the strip. We rented a car to help get around during the week. The resort's weekly bulletin of activities was posted in all elevators. The three elevators are very quick and quiet. There's wasn't one jam or crowded time the entire week. One thing about the television, in the newer buildings, there is HBO on channels 95-97. In the other buildings, you can order first run movies. By the map the resort provided, we found shopping facilities close by on Silverado Ranch Boulevard. There's a Target, Walmart, banks, Dollar Tree, Marshalls, and other stores as well as fast food restaurants. Most of our week was very windy but did see a few people in the outdoor pool.

It's about 10-15mins to the Strip but all the casinos had free parking so not really a hassle. Minor criticisms:- 1. Not enough parking spaces immediately by the block we were in but a undercover garage nearby. 2. Wifi in room $9 a day. 3. Walls a bit thin, the snorer next door was a nightmare for a couple of nights - can offenders please use snoring strips! Other than that we had a good stay and we weren't in the apartment for much of the time anyway but if you stay on site then there's pretty much everything you need on-site and in the casino next door. If you can't utilise a time-share to its absolute fullest to make it financially worthwhile then don't buy one. They are pushy but that's their job so think very carefully before you do. Also note that to trade in your weeks for the free holidays (if they still offer that) - they don't come out and say it straight but you can only book the resort of your choice 45 days before departure which is a hassle for booking cheaper flights.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPushy Sales / paper thin walls\u201d", "Author": "222JC_222", "ReviewID": "UR126277286", "Content": "- Walls between units are paper thin and you could literally hear full conversations next door. - Window in one unit wouldn't close and had been stuffed with paper towel and taped with masking tape to stop the howling of the wind....needs to be fixed. - \"tidy\" that was done half way through the week was poor.

The resort is next to the South Pointe Casino, which is a huge casino now. Theatres, buffet, dinner/lunch, gaming, poker room, shows, etc are all at South Pointe Casino. The location is far down South Las Vegas Blvd, I'd say about 5 - 6 miles south of Mandalay Bay, but an onramp to I-15 is right here less than 1/2 mile away, so getting to the strip is simple/easy. I love this location because its not near the strip, cause the strip is not car friendly any longer... you can sit in traffic for 20-30 minutes just to go down a mile or two where all the casinos are... The checkin was easy, everyone was nice and friendly. There wasn't a resort fee either for our stay. The cons: paying for wifi service, albeit was about $39.95 for a week.

Once I got to the lobby, I spoke with the supervisor in person, and they did give us a new, brighter room in the Sage Building, which was just as nice. From that point on, everything was great!

We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon and catching a cab from the airport was a breeze. It was approx. $35 for the ride and it took less than 15 minutes. Checking in mid-week was simple. We were given a two-bedroom unit on the 18th floor in the Rosemary building, which is one of the newest buildings. We hitched a ride on a golf cart with all of our luggage, which was nice. The rooms are very nicely appointed, modern and clean. We had a view of the Jasmine building's rooftop, the kiddie pool and the city/mountains to the east - made for beautiful sunrises each morning. The rooms, while good sized, would be a little tight for a family of four if you had just one room. The one bathroom was large, long vanity with double sinks on either end and it was lowered in the middle so you could sit on the available bench and apply your makeup! The shower was nicely sized and hot water was almost instantaneous throughout the unit. My daughter took a bath in the jacuzzi tub one night and loved it. (Note, the tubs, even when filling up are very noisy for your neighbors, be courteous and not run them after 10pm! Our neighbor one night drew a bath at midnight and woke us up out of dead sleep. Sounded like the radio alarm came on, very loudly, on a station with just static!) The first two nights (Wed & Thu) were very quiet, but Fri night was louder as I believe the hotel was close to capacity. Since we had a two-bedroom, we had two kitchens, which we only used to brew tea/coffee each morning! If we were staying a full week, it definitely would have been used more. We did make a trip to Scotty's (the onsite cafe/deli and little store) and bought a carton of milk and waters. Having the South Pointe Casino next door is a plus. My mom and I signed up for their club card on their website prior to arrival and picked up the card at the casino. This card gave us a discount on the buffet, which was decent. We ate the buffet for our first dinner and then ate at the Steak N Shake the next two nights. We used the shuttle service (Ritz Transportation) for our trips to and from the strip. It picks up at the Grandview at the top of the hour and you can get off at the Excalibur, Aria or Treasure Island. It picks up in those same locations (top of the hour at TI, 20 after at Aria and 40 after at Excalibur). It was $8pp for the whole day, they give you a business card with the date and how much you paid on the back as your 'ticket to ride.' We were very confused though when it came to paying for my 7 year-old. The first morning I paid for her, but the night driver who drove us home that evening said I shouldn't have paid for her, that children under 12 are free. Ok. The next morning we got on board and I told the driver (different than the morning before) that I was told by the night driver I shouldn't have paid for my daughter and I asked for credit. He wouldn't give it to me, but said I just needed to pay for myself. On our way home that evening the driver (again, a different man) got upset and said I most definitely needed to pay for my daughter because she takes up a seat and I basically ripped off the company. He went on about this for a good two minutes, making me feel quite angry. Perhaps a written policy displayed in the bus is in order?! Overall, I would stay here again for sure.

Did not give us clean sheets, or empty the trash either. YOU have to do everything yourself. The unit did have a washer and dryer which was helpful. There is no free wi-fi either. You have to pay $10 per day or $25 for 3 days. There is no restaurant onsite except for a deli where you can buy a very limited amount of food or sundries.

One MAJOR DOWNFALL - internet access is ~$50 PER DEVICE for 7 days. I still can not understand why hotels/resorts do not realize how non-customer friendly this is for travellers. Frankly, I would even absorb a slightly higher daily rental rate (or RCI trade value) for free internet, since we had searched for a place with internet access as being one of the MUST haves. I plan much of my vacation online while there, so my netbook/tablet/smartphone are critical to my enjoyment of my vacation as a whole. Many of us, in the hot tub, were complaining/commenting about the same thing. We did fill out the resort suggestion cards with this feedback - but the desk staff said that they hear this constantly and management does not appear to take it seriously.

There are about 6 high rise buildings. We were on the 8th floor in an excellent unit--full kitchen, washer/dryer in unit, large bathroom with whirlpool, 2 TVs, DVD player, king size bed with many pillows. There are two pools, hot tubs and an exercise room. Grandview's location is not a problem because it is just east of the Interstate, less than a mile from the exit. If takes only about 15 minutes to drive to the strip on the Interstate. You are away from the traffic jams and noise of the strip, but can get there easily. There are many dining options in the area and a Walmart Neighborhood Store about 1 mile away. Next door is the South Pointe Casino which also has dining, entertainment and 64 bowling alleys. Our only complaint about this place and it is true of other Vacation Village properties is the fact that unless you are an owner, the wifi for computer use in your unit, is not free. Non owners have to pay a daily rate of about $10, which is less per day if you pay for a longer period. Most other hotels, shopping centers, etc. in the area have free wifi. There are a number of Starbucks, McDonald's, etc. within one mile of the complex where you can get unlimited free wifi. Grandview's charge for this is, in my opinion, a rip off!! They do have about 10 computers to use for free in the activity center--there is a 15 minute limit, but you can use the printer if necessary, especially good for airport check in and printing boarding passes.

I knew when I booked the Grandview that it was not on the strip, but that didn't bother me because I thought that I probably would not want to be right on the strip all of the time. That said, you really do need a car if you stay at the Grandview. There is a shuttle but you are charged a daily fee and you are at their mercy as to time to travel and where you go. You do not want to pay for taxi service to and from the Grandview. We decided after we arrived to go ahead and rent a car which we were able to do right there at the resort and the car rental company came to pick us up to take us get our car. We returned it to the airport when we left. The drive in to the strip did not bother us at all and parking is free at most all the casinos in the self park areas. The temps were too cool for us to enjoy any of the pools but they looked wonderful and were kept very clean. Our condo and the grounds were also beautiful and clean. The photos that you see on line provided by the Grandview of the resort and grounds are truely typical of what you see when you get there. No surprises. We have been to hotels that had beautiful hotel photos and when we got there it was not at all the same as the photos we saw on line. The furniture all needs to be upgraded including the mattresses. It was OK, and we were able to get a decent night's sleep, but compared to other places that we have stayed, the beds and the living room furniture need to be renewed because they were really starting to show their age. Sounds from next door neighbor were almost like they were in our condo at times, but we were not bothered with noise at night. We may have just been lucky on that because we didn't have a neighbor there that stayed the entire week. Everything else was great. The condo itself was beautiful and freshly painted. We had a one bedroom and the bedroom had a jacuzzi tub between the bed and bathroom. The bath had a double vanity all very nice. People were very attentive and helpful. The South Point Casino is literaly next door. We had fun playing there and they even have free craps lessons a couple of days each week. Their tables had a lower minimum than those on the strip which was good for us since we are not big game players but wanted to play just for fun and entertainment. You can play longer for less money. There are also several different resturants at the casino if you want to eat there. We ate there a couple of times during the week but ate either in our condo or on the strip most of the time. Overall, I give the Grandview a B+. New furniture and noise reduction would be my only recommendation. Location was not all that bad. I knew up front we were just a few miles south of the strip.

Our room at the Grandview was excellent, plenty of room, nice TV's, nice clean furniture. Although the pull-out sofa beds are NOT comfortable, recommend bringing a blow-up mattress instead if your planning to sleep on it more than one night. All the rooms had plenty of space for our needs. The pool areas were clean and nice, the work out room a ways from our building but still not that bad of a walk. Every person we dealt with from the front desk, shuttle request, and maid service were excellent, and polite courteous. The only thing I could possibly complain about is when we arrived our room wasn't quite ready so we left our luggage and headed to the strip to go eat while we waited for our room. The front desk was suppose to call us to let us know our room was ready but we never got the call and it was after 7pm when I called so by the time we got checked in our room it was after 8pm which was a little frustrating but not the end of the world. There are a lot of chain restaurants close to the Grandview as well. They also have really cheap breakfast at the South Pointe Coronado Cafe for $1.99 but it is only during certain hours so be sure to check the time. Another nice place to eat thats a little pricier but worth it is the Veloce at the M Casino just down the street from Grandview.

The site has two pools, fitness rooms (one with cardio machine and other with weight machines), game room (which we didn't use).

We were just a family of four, so the units were very spacious. One thing we especially noticed was how solid the floors/ceilings were. Our young boys were able to run around the room without the typical thump-thump you normally hear in other condo hotels.

We took a quick drive to the M Resort for breakfast at Hash House a Go Go (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!) then drove to Hoover Dam, which was only 30 minutes away. The reason for not giving 5 stars: $10 one-time charge to use the in-room safe, wifi Internet fee was per device (we have iPads, iPhones, Kindles, and laptops), cable tv channels were a mess with standard def and high def redundancies that were annoying after a day, and lastly, it was obvious that some of the room details were done a little cheaply (excusable in this economic climate). By this I mean the sink basins in the bathrooms were tiny, the shower floors were fiberglass instead of tile, and the DVD players were horribly low tech.

This resort is located about six miles south of the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign at the south end of the strip. The property is in nice shape and the staff are very attentive. I would compare each unit to the master and living area of the Desert Springs Villas II in space, decoration and newness. Please know that you are not in a golf community however, this resort is built on a very small foot-print and a lot of it is parking lot. This is not a \"sit on your balcony with a beverage and look at the view\" type of place but it is fantastic for Vegas. You will want a car, $8.00 per person per day is a bit much for getting around town (we drove from CA). As for internet, it is expensive, however my husband was able to use the business center and that was sufficient for his daily quick check (I had my phone which worked fine). We were asked upon check in about attending the 90 minute presentation and said \"no thank you\". We did receive a few calls to attend the welcome \"breakfast\", also said \"no thank you\" and were not bothered again for the week. We were in the Daisy tower, I think the second newest, and many of the things prior visitors complained about have been corrected in the new buildings. For example, the windows all have black out drapes over the wood blinds and the kitchen is done in newer finishes. The only thing we felt we would have brought with us from home was a cookie sheet. They had provided a turkey pan (we didn't cook a turkey) so we used that all week to cook and reheat things. We took prior advise and brought an Aero bed for one of our sons and were thankful that we did. We were only able to book a one bedroom unit for this holiday week and the pull out couch would have been tight for both of them. The mid-week tidy service was a nice touch. The facilities are nice as well, they keep one pool and the hot tub heated in the winter and the weather was nice enough to swim. The gym is in two separate rooms with cardio machines in one and weight machines in another. They offer the typical work out equipment, ellipticals, treadmills and bikes. The convenience store is right near the gym, we used it to buy syrup only, they do offer to-go food items and coffee service. Our main goals for the week were to visit some of the places off the strip since we were traveling with our two boys 10 &13. We hiked Red Rock Canyon, did the Dam tour at Hoover Dam, enjoyed a day at the Springs Preserve and Nevada State Museum. As previously mentioned, the South Point casino is a good distraction with many things for the kids to do. They have an arcade, bowling alley, movie theater with all new movies and a few good restaurants all within walking distance. We would stay here again if we visit Vegas, we probably won't since we enjoy traveling to a different place each time. On another note, our other option for the week was The Cliffs at Peace Canyon, which we drove by on the way to Red Rock. In our opinion, it is too far away from everything to consider.

We were assured that they don't have 'high pressure back-up guys'... Yes they do! We had a nice breakfast at the South Point buffet, hosted by our 'non'-pressure guide. He ate quickly which gave him time to milk us with questions while we ate. It was then time to see the new building at the Grandview. After which the pressure started. We were basically told that our current timeshare is worthless and that their's is the best system (Surprise!). Once he was done, the back-up associate arrived with a 'better' (cheaper) plan. After saying no, we were sent to get our prizes and tickets. However they had one more deal for us there (So much for no pressure or back-ups!). We finally escaped with the stuff and managed to enjoy our stay. The accommodations were okay. My wife said that the furniture was old and needed to be replaced. We did have a damaged coffee table and I had a sharp screw break thru the bottom of my heel from the footstool in the bedroom (they replaced both pieces). When I called about my heel, they quickly sent security up to take a report. The security guys also went for a First Aid kit to help clean the wound. I was told that someone would be contacting me about my heel, but that never happened. The best I can say about the place is that its clean (they did a minor room clean-up on Wednesday morning); extra towels were a phone call away; each room has a kitchen, a fridge, stove, dishes, dishwasher, plus a washer & dryer, and 2 TV's. There are several pools, a snack bar/deli store, a 15 minute time limit on their computers (which allows for quickly checking for important emails), (I think they have wi-fi), its located next to South Point, and in close proximity to the freeway, about 7 miles south of the Strip. That was okay though. You either drive north up Las Vegas Blvd or go north on the freeway to get to the Strip. I'd say its a decent place to stay and made access to Red Rock Canyon (to the northwest) fairly easy. In addition to visiting the casinos, we did go to Red Rock Canyon and to the Valley of Fire (which is located to the east, north of Lake Mead). Both are well worth the trip and incredibly beautiful as the sun changes location in the sky (It gets absolutely beautiful near dusk!).

Of course, I would recomend a car to move around, but in case you don't want to bother driving (remember: never ever drink and drive) or you prefer to save the money for other things, they offer a regular shuttle service that runs until night (don't remember exactly the time table, but they were pretty comprehensive).

You also have a washer & dryer, works out great for us because we always stay a week & we can go back home with clean clothes!...the grounds are nice, although, I wish they had more &/or bigger pools. They have some tough competition on that w/ Tahiti Village & their lazy river and also w/Cancun & their water slides. I always stay here because the rooms trump the pools for me. Plus the South Point is next door, that's a big win for them ;-) (Our friends staid @ Tahiti but spent a lot of time @ SP, she said she will be staying here next time because not only did she love their attractions but she liked our room much better). We love having the SP next door! Our 9 year old has so much to do here. They have an arcade, bowling, and a movie theater. They have restaurants too, not the best, but good enough if u don't want to drive or cook. (The buffet is expensive though & if u do try it I recomend u sign up for a players card, @ least that way you get a discount! =) )... There are a few grocery stores near by and a Target & Walmart as well as a few pharmacys. In fact, u can find so much within a 5 mile radius (explore!). The strip is about a 3-5 min drive on the fw, or 5-10 on the street.. I highly recomend this place if u have kids. I can't wait to go back next year, and I know my son can't either.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts, USA", "Title": "\u201cOverall, very good\u201d", "Author": "cmburns47", "ReviewID": "UR119662050", "Content": "Greatly enjoyed the stay at Grandview.

Location of this building was fantastic and I would choose this building again for proximity to the pool, the store and the computer lounge. If you have two families traveling together, the two bedroom set up is the best I have seen, you get two one bedrooms with an adjoining foyer, which means each unit has it's own kitchen, bathroom, living/dining rooms.

There is a washer and dryer, they provide one mini box of laundry soap, so if you are planning more than one load bring your own soap. Well appointed kitchen had everything we needed, place settings for 6. The bed was new in our unit, very comfortable compared to our last stay. There is lots of closet space, even in the living room for anyone using the pull out.

We never waited more than 5 mins for our car from the valet. Parking at the Grandview is free and they had security guards patrol 24 hours a day. Just say no to the presentation (they will tell you it's an information session and offer you show tickets) we saw so many people wasting 1/2 their day to get a voucher, or come to find tickets to the show they want to see aren't available so they settled for something else.

I know it's not one of the newer buildings, but as long as it's clean, we don't really care about granite counter tops, etc. The room, however, was a little disappointing this time. Firstly the shower had some sort of stain in it, looked like someone spit some chew or something in it? My husband reported it, but no one ever came to clean it. When housekeeping called to check if the mid week tidy up was ok, I reported the stain again and they offered to come clean it, but we only had 2 days left, so just left it. We only used the huge tub anyhow, but that wasn't really the point. The other disappointment was with the hide a bed. Not only was it quite uncomfortable (but most hide a beds are), but it was broken, and the TV in the living room didn't work. As we got in quite late the first night, we waited until our second day there to have it fixed. the maintenance men came right away and fixed both and were really good about it, checking everything else in the suite to make sure it worked.

Her parents are timeshare owners so we were invited to the owners\u2019 update and offered free tickets/meal vouchers. At first I was the only one really hesitant (after reading all the reviews on here about the misinformation/lies some people were told). In the end we did get our Lion King tickets (last row, but still great seats and a must-see) and $100 (total for the 4 of us) in meal vouchers. *Side note: We chose to eat at the Luxor (at a fancier restaurant but not outrageous prices called Tender) and we got to see Criss Angel walk in and sit down and eat about 10 feet away from us which was amazing!!!* We were told that all 4 of us HAD to attend, however, when we arrived the 3 of us didn\u2019t have to attend which was quite annoying to find out after the fact. We almost did buy a timeshare though! They got us down to $5,000 for a unit but we still declined as I felt we could not decide on the spot and especially after only being at the resort 1 full day and not seeing what else is out there. ROOM Before arriving I told my future SIL to request one of the new rooms as I heard that the older buildings were not in the greatest shape. They had no problem fulfilling our request and we ended up in the Daisy tower with 2 full suites which shared an entry-way. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous! No complaints whatsoever. We had a full kitchen with granite countertops, nice black appliances, dishwasher, utensils, flat screen tvs, double sinks in the bathroom (also with granite), king size bed, Jacuzzi tub, washer/dryer, pull out sofa, etc. The rooms were also very clean and perfect for our stay. RESORT The overall resort was really nice and everything was pretty easy to find. The staff were very friend and polite and we had no issues. There are 3 pools, however, we only used the main pool. There are 2 pools there \u2013 one heated and one normal pool as well as 2 jacuzzis. No complaints here. I always found seats, was never overcrowded and the water was nice and warm. There is a gym on site which I used twice and was satisfied. I only used the cardio side but my husband used the side with weights and he said it was fine for his needs. There is a restaurant/mini gift shop on the resort by the main pool area and we ate there the first day and were pleasantly surprised. It is a bit expensive so we never went back but they do have burgers, fries and even a really yummy veggie burger! They also offer some souvenirs and basic groceries but I wouldn\u2019t buy any of that here unless you\u2019re stuck. They even have a patio with barbecues that you are able to use and we planned on doing a bbq one night, however, we never got to it but it nice that they offer this. The services offered/available is another story. The major downfall of the resort is that the shuttle was $8 per person, per day, so that ate up a bit of our money during the trip. A few times it was an hour late picking us up from the strip with no explanation or anything and one time it took us almost 2 hours to get home from the strip. The shuttle to the grocery store is free, however, they only give you 45 minutes!! We kind of felt like we were on a game show racing near the end to make sure we didn\u2019t miss the shuttle! Also it didn\u2019t run every day. There was a shuttle running to the old Vegas strip, however, that was also $8 per person but picked you up at 8:00 p.m. and back at midnight, however, we took the city bus from the new strip as it was cheaper and an experience. The shuttle to the malls was also free, however, it dropped you off at 2:30 and didn\u2019t pick you up until 6!!!!! We regret not renting a car. There was an internet lounge that you can use for free, however, the computers are pretty much running on dial-up and log you out every 15 minutes. I only used them to check Facebook, so while it was incredibly slow, I was able to do what I needed to do, however, the people actually using them for business or to print their boarding passes or research anything complained a lot and gave up about 90% of the time. To have wi-fi is about $10/day so in my view it was not worth it and I opted to use the internet lounge. We ate a few times at the resort next door (South Point) which is an amazing resort! Their buffet is amazing and a great price too. We also ate at Shake \u2018n Steak which was really good (and cheap!). The resort also has a casino with looser slots, bowling alley, spa, huge pool, hair salon/barber shop, movie theatre, etc. Definitely make a visit here at least once! In the end we didn\u2019t mind the distance from the strip, just the means of getting there. I liked that we were away from the craziness of Vegas and at a quiet resort, yet had the choice to go to the Strip when we wanted to. It did suck at times that we were so far from everything, such as when we ran out of milk and it would have been nice to have a variety store or Wal-Mart nearby that you could walk to. Overall we had a great time in Vegas and the resort was gorgeous!! A few downfalls of the resort, but nothing is perfect!!

I did do the little sales presentation and yes it was longer than promised, but I took a early morning tour so it did not bother me because I had the rest of the day to do whatever I wanted, besides I got $175 (in exchange for my $20 deposit) in spending in the SouthPoint casino for meals, spa, or bowling. Needless to say food in Vegas is rediculously high so that money was a big budget saver (note they come in $25 certificates and you don't get change so we just ordered extra to take back to the room, no sence in wasting money). So worth a few hours of hearing someone talk. So unless you are weak and vulnerable the sales pitch should not affect you. The food at Southpoint is more than reasonable especially at night when we came back from going out, the prices seemed unreal. $3.95 for steak and eggs. WOW. But back to Grandview, the execise facilties are spacious and had more equipment the the majority of other places I've seen. The cardio room and weight room is separate but it's only across the walk way. They have plenty of gas grills all ready to go. I didn't try the little deli food (why when I ate at Southpoint for free) but I did notice their grocery items were a little pricey but we had a rental car so we just went to the food 4 less and the Walmart which were close. I can go on forever but there is nothing bad to say about the place.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat, relaxing vacation in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "ScubaTrek", "ReviewID": "UR118206453", "Content": "I'll start by saying I am a timeshare owner at Grandview, so I didn't have to deal with the sales pitch. They did invite me to an \"owner's update\" which I declined, and was not asked again. This was our first time actually staying at the Grandview since purchasing our timeshare in 2008. When we had toured in '08 there was construction noise from more buildings going up, but they seem to be in a construction lull right now. There are a couple areas that look like they're being prepped for new buildings, but no actual construction going on right now. Check in was a breeze, and the rooms were big as we had remembered. We had myself, my wife and baby, and mother in law. We booked a 2 bedroom, which is really two one-bedrooms with a shared foyer. The rooms were clean, and kitchens well stocked. There is only a \"tidy\" service on Wednesday instead of daily maid service. I loved the jacuzzi tub. Complaints about the d\u00e9cor are unfounded in my view. My only real complaint is that the TVs are still the old tube type vice the modern flat screen HD TVs, but I hardly watched any TV anyway. Didn't get a chance to use the pool, spa, or fitness center, but all looked very inviting. Although there is no \"room service\" per se, there is an on-property Deli that will deliver to your room, but we didn't try it. Next time. I agree with previous reviews - parking near your building can be difficult, especially at night. There is parking at the west end of the property, as well as a 2-floor parking garage. I did not experience the thin walls that others have complained about. Yes, I could tell when the room above flushed the toilet, but I never heard other people's conversations as some others have noted. We were on the 2nd floor of the Lily building. Grandview is about 7 miles south of the strip. Travelling with a one year old, we liked not being on the strip at night. We did spend a couple nights on the strip with some comped rooms, and definitely more noisy and harder to sleep on the strip. Although there are shuttles available, we had a couple day trips planned so rented a car for the week. Having the car was definitely convenient. And if you go to the strip hotels they all have free parking anyway. We really liked the South Point casino across the street. Food was good, ate at the buffet twice. Slots seemed looser than on the strip, and with smaller maximum bets. (for example, on one of the penny slots I like to play, maximum bet on the strip was $4.50, max bet at South Point was $2.00, so if you assume you're going to loose your slot money, at least you can play longer at South Point. However, also hit a couple big payouts.)

My fiance' and I arrived at the Grandview Las Vegas on 20 Aug 2011. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We signed in without issue, were invited to gain free tickets to a show for a 90 minute presentation, and were given information about all of the amenities of the resort. Our room was wonderful. The bedroom had a large King sized bed that both my fiance' and I agreed was one of the best we'd ever slept in. There was a jacuzzi tub next to the bed with a small privacy wall. We enjoyed and indulged in that as well. There was also plenty of closet and drawer space. There was a fully functional kitchen that was perfect in size for just the two of us. Utensils and dinnerware was available for use. The washer and dryer in the laundry closet was appreciated and used. We also enjoyed the laundry detergent the hotel provided on the first day. In the living room, there was a pull out sofa. I read a couple of reviews that it wasn't that comfortable, but I was fine with it. Though I preferred the bed. The presentation. My fiance' is already a 5 Star Timeshare owner, so we pretty much knew what to expect. The presentation, the amount, etc. etc. The tour was nice. The lady presenting was friendly. We told them no a couple of times explaining we are in the process of planning a wedding and home ownership prep and this is not the time for a large purchase. They still tried to convince, but accepted the \"no\" and we were on out way with the tickets as promised. The amenities. We received a coupon book to the Southpoint Casino next door and were able to use $25 (free to us) on the Casino floor. There were also discounts on the buffet, on beverages, and even a trinket from the gift store. We enjoyed ourselves. The Strip. A lot of people have been complaining about proximity to the strip. I loved where we were. We rented a car the week we were there and were on the Strip just about everyday. Only once did we not visit and that was because we were at the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon that day and were too tired when we got back. We saw the show whose tickets were given in addition to seeing The Lion King (definitely GO). It wasn't that far from the strip and I liked the quiet that I felt after the hustle and bustle of the Strip. Lifesavers. We were at this resort when Hurrican Irene hit and the evening before our flight was to leave that next morning, our flight was cancelled. No flights were going in or out of our home airport and we were scheduled to check out that next morning. Grandview was amazing. They allowed us to use the Internet facilities after hours to see what information we could find out and what arrangements we could make for the next 24 hours. When our attempts were only minimally fruitful, the resort provided us another room at an extremely reasonable and appreciated cost. They even called to make sure we didn't need help with rental information. I cannot remember the name of the woman who helped us so wonderfully (I am so much better with faces-maybe Ms. Judy?), but thank you SO much. All in all, it was a GREAT trip and I'll definitely reurn if ever in that area again. If I can recommend any improvement, it would be free wi-fi in the rooms.

The pools in the resort were great (there are few), we also enjoyed a hot tub-spa. We went often to a neighboring casino South Point, we liked it there, they did not asked for a $10 bid as the smallest amount you put on a table and looked like more down to earth. Also if you want to go to the strip you really better have your car- it's a free parking in a lot of casinos and you are free to go anywere you pleased.

We also went to the Red Rock Canyon- that was great too.

Also be ready to pay about $44 for a person for being able to see the edge of the Canyon- which really surprised us- I sought it should be free for anybody to see, but...).

Would have been nice to have a pool that was a little deeper than 4 feet deep. Staff was pretty much not seen or heard unless you called them. If you plan on going and seeing things you will need a car, cab or a shuttle to get there. I would say a rental car would be the most cost effective if you plan on going anywhere. The only thing really in walking distance is the South Point. They have a lot to do there. Most everything at the Gandview is pretty expensive. A 16oz soda will cost you $2.00 and a two liter a mile and a half down the street will cost you $1.99. As this is a timeshare, they will ask you to see a 90 minute presentation (expect the hard sale and it to be 3 hours long at a minimum). Just say no! I would have to say oversell and under deliver is their motto when they deliver the presentation. They are big on hype, show you marble and nice fancy rooms and then have you stay in a room that does not look like what they showed you. As for resorts, I would only give it a middle of the road. It is more of an island from most everything so the manditory need for transportation drops it down on the score. The 90 minute (3 hour) hard sale drops it down again.

The rooms are not adjoining except for the entryway - for all three doors, you need a key - which made us a bit paranoid about locking ourselves out of a side especially with our 4 children. The good: There was a stack washer-dryer in each side. The kitchen was full and had the necessary appliances. The bathrooms were roomy as were the rooms & living areas. We stayed in building 3 Lily which was right across the main pool area. The main pool area was nice - double pool, one with a nice waterfall. They are not huge but it was comfortable enough as far as being accomodating for the guests. There is also a hot tub. I believe that there was another pool a little ways down from the main one which had a kiddie area - although, I can't speak of it personally but my husband took the kids one day. Elevators were fast. The not-so-great: First off, parking can be an issue. If you are out after 8-9pm, most of the stalls fronting your building will be taken. We had to park quite a ways away from our unit most nights. There is covered parking at the far end of the property but most of it is outdoors. The rooms are decorated in what I call a 70's style. I haven't seen that much formica in awhile, especially in a new property. The tubs have jacuzzi jets but are outside of the bathroom itself next to the bed so there is little privacy. The water and jets can be easily heard from the room next door - we heard theirs, I'm sure they heard ours. The showers have no spout and the showerheads are not that strong. There are double sinks though. The beds in the bedrooms are adequate but the linens, again, appeared very outdated. The sofa beds have VERY thin mattresses and as sofas, are very uncomfortable. The TV's are HUGE - but not in the good way - they are the old style with the large back to them. There are TV's in the bedrooms and TV's in the living area with a DVD player. However, the remotes worked sporadically at best and most times, we had to walk up to the TV to change the channel/volume. The pitch: We got one when we checked-in. My husband said we were not interested - pressed him a bit, but not too much. We got a call 2 times later - again, not interested but they weren't pushy. Not bad. One thing that I did not like or appreciate - since we had both sides of the one entryway we kept our doors open and used the entryway door as our main door whiile we were inside. One day, without knocking, an male employee just opened the entryway door and hollered \"Oh, are you guys leaving? This is supposed to be vacant later today.\" There is a reasonable expectation of privacy when you are a guest at a hotel and while it may have been a mistake on his part, knocking and giving us time to actually answer the door would have been a lot more courteous.

Like others, when we weren't receptive to the high pressure tactics, we were sent to talk to a series of other sales staff. Each subsequent seller was both more insistent, and more condescending. The last guy we talked to was downright insulting, basically telling us we were stupid for passing up the \"golden opportunity\" he was trying to ram down our throats. At this point I'd had more than enough, and I advised Mr. Charm that we were through. I collected our 50 dollars In gaming vouchers and we left.

The laundry unit allows you to travel light, but remember to bring your favorite detergent. All Grandview rooms are mini-suites (note, there may be larger units that I'm not aware of). The following made/makes a stay here a more enjoyable experience: 1. There is/was a Television in both the main room, and the bedroom. 2. Separate from the bathroom, there is a bath tub that, in essence is part of the bedroom, allowing others to use of the toilet and shower without losing privacy. 3.

There's a children's pool with the mushrooms and then a building over there's a refrigerated pool and a heated one as well, and I don't mean a jacuzzi- they had those as well. Parking can get crowded, so there's a tower, which is covered and in that Vegas heat, you may want that. Parking is free at all the casinos so rent a car and drive to the strip.

There are two negative points I can think of with Grandview and they are the transport to the strip and the internet, which is why it did not receive five stars. It will cost you $8 per person per day to take the shuttle to the strip, which over a week runs to $112 per couple! As an owner I am very disappointed as I asked our seller if there were shuttles and he assured me there were and they were at no cost. What would it take to reduce the ludicrous amount of staff on at the reception (at one point there were 12 members of staff) and get get a few drivers in instead to drive a coach? They do run free shuttles to the small Wal-Mart and Outlet Centre so it is possible. The internet really needs to be addressed as well.

While the property has some good points, on balance we were disappointed and would not choose to stay there again. We actually liked Grandview's location far south of the strip and next door to South Point Casino which is handy for gaming, dining, seeing a movie or bowling at its 70 lane center. A car is an absolute necessity to get around unless you want to just stay at Grandview and walk to the casino next door. Grandview is comprised of several nondescript looking high rise buildings. Architecturally they are as appealing as public housing. Check in was fast and pleasant. At the end of check-in you are directed to an area close by for your \"information packet\" which just as easily could have been distributed to you by the check-in clerk. But the purpose of moving one to this area is to be assaulted by a predatory time share salesperson, offering you a bottle of wine and $100 to attend a Saturday sales presentation. We quickly passed on these so called freebies which seemed to anger the salesperson who got kind of snotty. Stay away from them and do yourself a favor! You don't need the $ that bad and certainly do not want to buy in here with so many better options in Las Vegas available. At the check in area there is also a room called the \"members' lounge\" which has the warmth and charm of a waiting area of an unemployment office. There are several computer terminals available, some of which were not operable. They were also very slow and there was always a wait to use the working ones. The units themselves are nicely furnished and equipped with a jacuzzi, full kitchen with utensils, washer/dryer, decent amenities, comfortable beds, but very uncomfortable pillows. A bad inexcusable feature were the closet hangers. These are the kind that do not hang on the bar, but have to be inserted in plastic hooks some of which were broken. I hate these things - they are cheap and tacky and clothes fall off them too easily. Plain wire hangers would be an improvement. Another problem was the noise made by the jacuzzi from either the unit above or below us. The noise was deafening and woke us from a sound sleep. Finally, what really annoyed us was that one of the two elevators in our building (Jasmine-8) was out for all but one of the days we were there. This resulted in long waits. What made it worse was that were were only on the second floor and could go down the stairs to the outside. But there was no access to the staircases from either the outside or the inside to walk up one flight. Awful design. Sometimes there were 20 or more people waiting for one elevator serving a 12 story building. This was not a minor point, but a real nuisance. There were too many issues with Grandview to really recommend it to other travelers. We found the Cliffs at Peace Canyon to be far superior, but farther from the strip. We still enjoyed our short vacation and love visiting LV. We hiked for a day at Red Rocks National Conservation area just west of Summerlin, which is not to be missed!", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIf you already own a timeshare and want to stay in Vegas, this is the place\u201d", "Author": "purrmate", "ReviewID": "UR105324517", "Content": "My husband, my two grown daughters, and my son-in-law spent a week celebrating the Passover holiday.

We stayed here during the first week of a 2 week vacation in Vegas, checked in Apr 3rd through Apr. 10th. We were plesantly surprised to discover that the 2 bedroom units are actually 2-1 bedroom units with matching floor plans that split off a shared enterence. When you enter the door from the hall you then have a common area that has 2 more card key locked doors leading to each unit. This work well since this allowed both couples to have a full unit that included full kitchens, bathrooms, washer/dryers and living areas. When we were in the unit we could keep our doors open for easy passage back and forth while the main door to the hallway was securely shut with key card access. The units were very clean and provided everything we need to be comfortable. The bedrooms are large and had a tub just off to the side with bathroom access from the bedroom and a 2nd door off the kitchen/living area. The bathroom had dual sinks, a stand up shower and flush in a very large bathroom. We liked that the tub was set up between the bathroom and open to the bedroom. This way if my wife wanted to soak in the large tub watching the bedroom TV she could, yet others could still use the washroom or take a shower without disturbing each other. We had no issue with noise from other units, I'm not sure if the fact we were Daisy building may have been a factor as the building seemed to be a newer one on the property. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view of the mountains. We also overlooked the area they were in the process of completing another pool area that looked like it would be designed for kids to use. We used the pool area 1 day while there and it was very lovely. One of the pools was cold and being from Eastern Canada we understand cold water from the Bay of Fundy but this pool seemed too cold for our liking. It was okay once you got past the initial shock but still was too cold for our preference. The 2nd pool in the pool area was heated but it tended to be full which I think is due to the other pool being so cold. I would suggest having both pools heated in the area. We loved that South Point Casino was directly across the street and you would easliy walk there from the resort. In less than 5 mins you could walk from your room to the Casino floor. South Point also offers so much even for families, like the movie theater, bowling alley, even the spa would be a good choice if someone was looking for some pampering. My wife booked a spa treatment for our wedding day, and being a guest of the Grandview, they gave her a 10% discount which was an added bonus. My best man and I even took advantage of getting a straight shave from John the barber at South Point. The choices of places to eat at South Point are great and pretty reasonable for prices. Also the location of the resort is a little off the main part of the srtip, but being on Las Vegas Blvd your were only 5-10 min drive to reach places like Mandalay Bay & Luxor, and a few more minutes you would be in the heart of the Strip. We liked that we could visit the strip quite easliy but could get away from the craziness and have some peace and quiet. You do need a car to fully enjoy the area, but the location of the resort meant very easy access to I15 and other routes you would take to see places like the Valley of Fire or Hoover Dam/Grand Canyon trips. The resort did offer Shuttle service but it did cost around $8 a person for a round trip. Alot of other resorts closer to the strip offer free shuttle service. I believe the shuttle service is run by another company and not the resort directly but I did not use the shuttle since we had a car rental for the week. I would recommend to the resort to consider offering some sort of free shuttle service to guests. This IMO would make this resort more attractive to people that don't want to rent a car. If they did offer a free shuttle service they would only need to have drop off and pickup at a couple of places on the strip. If this type of shuttle service was available then I could see my wife and I staying there more often (then again we loved the resort and will place Grandview at the top our lists to stay anyways).

It wasn't until I was directed to the lady who wanted me to sign up for the timeshare breakfast presentation when I received a chilly response. I politely declined and she became curt and unfriendly. Ironically, I own five other timeshares affiliated with the same company who owns the Grandview and told her this but she was still cold about my disinterest in THEIR timeshare property. The units here are the exact floor plan of my timeshares in Florida and look to be a less impressive version. While I got a newer unit and had no maintenance issues or stains on furniture, it looked to me like the furniture came from one of those Furniture Outlet places. The furniture in my Florida units LOOK much nicer and show more taste. But then that's just a minor issue. The drawers under the TV were installed haphazardly and crooked so drawers couldn't be pulled out. The small kitchen was adequate for two people and clean. There's a small washer/dryer in the unit and a big shower and jacuzzi tub, which I enjoyed very much. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that the walls are thin enough that one hears noises from units above and to the side. This being Las Vegas, many people don't even go to bed until 1 or 2 am and wake people like me up when they come in. Two things are extremely unacceptable here. They use a third-party company for internet service and you have to pay $9.95 a day. As someone who's already invested thousands of dollars in the properties of this company I find that to be insulting. You can get internet access at a Motel 6 for $2.99! This property is also a long ways from the center of the Strip and you have to drive yourself there unless you want to go next door to South Pointe Casino and pay $8 for their shuttle. This is also an insult. At their sister property in Las Vegas (where I own two units) they provide FREE shuttle service to the Strip. I am so happy I invested there and not here. I also forgot to mention that while the units at Grandview are a mirror of those in Florida, they do not have balconies, like the ones in Florida. Their sister property in western Las Vegas does have a nice balcony with each unit and during visits like this one (where it's 75-80 degrees) it's nice to dine or sit on a balcony. Grandview is also just too big. It's a series of high rise buildings (and looks like a yuppie ghetto) and it takes a long time to walk anywhere. I stayed at Summer Bay timeshares in Las Vegas where they transported you to their sizeable property at the drop of a hat. At Grandview they also had golf carts for that, but one could never find anyone who would drive you....and the last thing you want to do in Las Vegas is wait around. There are many timeshare properties in Las Vegas and I have traded to spend time at most of them. I wanted to try Grandview because they were pushing it so hard at the sister property. I am very disappointed in it and won't stay here again. In terms of function and comfort, just about every other timeshare property I've stayed at (seven so far) is much better. It'd be in your best interest to check them out first.

Vegas itself is over built and the entertainment very expensive. We saw the Beatles show at the Mirage, that was great. We received tickets from our children as gifts. I think you can dicount tickets on the Strip. We had a great time in Vegas seeing friends who have recently moved there. The best payoffs we got was from the Mirage Casino.

This hotel is about a 10 minute drive to the Strip and you will need to find a way to get there. We rented a car and any casino on the Strip will allow you to park for free. The awesome thing about this resort however is that there is this Casino called South Point right across the street and we thought it was the best one down there. South Point has everything!! Great restaurants, Movies, the Casino, Bowling and a couple of stores. The last day and a half we spent mainly at South Point. One other thing we liked about the Grandview was the fact they had shuttles to shop. If you have a spouse/partner BEWARE!! The prices at the mall are amazing. The only negative thing I have to say about South Point was there wasn't really a great concierge service. If you want tickets to a show you need to go through the timeshare presentation.

I rented one at Fox at it's just a short drive from the hotel, plus they don't pay airport taxes so the total price was much cheaper!) I stayed in a one-bedroom room on the 16th floor in the Daisy building. The unit was very clean (and I am picky) and was decorated hotel-modern. There were two tvs, a fully equipped kitchen, laundry in the unit, a nice sized bathroom and a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom. The workout room is divided into two spaces one room that focuses on cardio with bikes, treadmills and elliptical machines (4 of each) and a weight room. I used the room off hours and basically had the room to myself! There is a decent casino (South Point) literally next door with a great movie theater, Seattle's Best Coffee shop, bowling lanes, spa, restaurants and plenty of gambling. The Grandview will give you a coupon book when you check in. As a side note: I am not the gambling type so I drove to Hoover Dam one day and Red Rock Canyon the next. Both are well-worth the effort. In Las Vegas I visited the Atomic Museum, also worth it. The best meal I had was at Sensi in the Bellagio - it wasn't cheap but it was worth it!

In his defense he did say it was on 1.00 machines. The tour took up 4 hours before we were back on the street; the salesperson, Suzette was very nice; the usual timeshare crap by everyone else--the price cut to a quarter of the original by the end if you bought today. The real outrage was using the voucher at Casino Royale. When we got there they gave us 5 $100 vouchers to play on a bank of old slots, all the same slot machine, that they told us you couldn't take any winnings out of unless you hit a jackpot. This was probably next to impossible; it was obvious as the wheels came up that they had all been doctored--you could see the tape splices on the reels. I have had more hits on ANY quarter machine at ANY hotel in Vegas than the two of us did on these frauds. Casino Royale should be ashamed of itself for partnering with such a scheme, and The Grandview for perpetrating such a scheme. And shame on me for falling for a tactic like this.

It is about 8 miles from Mandalay Bay, the most southern hotel on the strip. We managed by using the RTC public transit system, but it often took 45-60mins to get to the strip. When you arrive at the airport locate Ritz Shuttle service, you can pay $14 pp for round trip airport transportation to the Grandview. Cab ride would cost $25-30 each way. We looked into the resort shuttle, it has 3 stops on the strip and a schedule of times. Cost is $8 per person each way, kind of expensive and it took about 30 mins to get to the strip and an hour to get back with all the stops. We ended up using the local bus system, across the street at South Point is a bus stop for the 117 which goes to South transfer Terminal and you can catch the express to the Strip. Remember the 117 will be in bay 9 and the strip bus is in bay 14. All day pass is $7 per person, or a 3-day pass is $20. The South Point offers great affordable dining options! The also have an amazing spa, be sure to check it out. Happy hour drinks are $2! Pool was open, very nice, hot tub too. Depending on the building you are in, it's a bit of a walk to the pool. We had groceries delivered to our room by Vons, they were in our room when we arrived! At check in you will get a list of free activities, we took at free craps lesson at South Point. DO NOT get tempted by the timeshare presentation, they will book you at check in and we got suckered, it was horrible! They dangle offers for show tickets, not worth it. We ended up taking 4 $25 gift certificates for South Point, still not worth wasting a morning. The room was good, adequate kitchen, washer/dryer were handy. The sharred entrance for two rooms (unless you have a 2 bedroom) was annoying, we could hear the couple on the other side coming and going.

As this was our second time at the resort, check-in was fast. because we didn't require the introduction to the resort (ends with an offer of discount show tickets in exchange for a timeshare presentation). We found the folks to be very cordial with no pressure to attend the presentation. As others have mentioned, the rooms are large, well equipped and clean. It is right across the street from the South Point casino which is a great facility. We ate breakfast at the Coronado Cafe at the casino most days (best coffee ever and quite reasonably priced compared to similar casino restaurants on the strip). We also ate Italian at Don Vitos (excellent) and Mexican at Baja Miguel's (good and very reasonably priced) at South Point. Although the resort has scheduled shuttle service to the strip, outlet mall, grocery store and Fremont Street, we rented a car to have the freedom to move around as we pleased. Las Vegas is a very easy city to navigate around and Grandview is conveniently located to the I15 interstate which bisects the city from south to north. From the Grandview to the strip hotels is just a few minutes using the interstate. Even if you travel up Las Vegas Boulevard to the strip its only about 15 minutes to the south end. All the strip casinos have large, free self parking garages that are easy to get in and out of. With a car, we were able to tour Red Rock Canyon (must do) and tour around Lake Las Vegas and Lake Mead. There was ample free parking at the resort. One of the benefits of staying off the strip is that prices at restaurants and stores are less expensive than on the strip. South Point Casino has a little store with a great selection of wines and liquors at very good prices (even cheaper than the grocery store). We were able to drive about 10 minutes to get to the Trip Advisor #1 rated restaurant \"Off the Strip - Just Real Food\". If you have a car it really is worth the short trip from the Grandview and also very reasonably priced. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Grandview. We didn't take advantage of the recreational facilities or tours but we found it to be a great spot to stay off the strip expecially if you have a vehicle. The only negative was that while we were there a cold weather system blew in from the northwest. We were on the top floor and there was allot of wind noise and a bit of a cold draft via our bedroom window that made things a little uncomfortable.

So we were able to drive back and forth, and the GPS in the car really came in handy, too. We even drove to the Hoover Dam (45 minute drive) for the short tour of about two hours, and then drove across the new bridge there that connects Arizona and Nevada. Then we took the scenic route along Lake Mead up to the Valley of Fire--spectacular! Amazing sights and rock formations, and the lake and desert views on the way were really something. It is so unlike our native Pennsylvania. I highly recommend this trip if you have a car; it makes a nice day trip. Anyway, back to Grandview. The week we were there it was a little cool, so even though the pools were open, we only used the outdoor hot tubs, but that was fun. The pool area is beautiful, with two levels and a rock waterfall in between, with lots of lounge chairs, music piped in and room to spread out. The condos were very nice. We actually got a two bedroom, which was two separate condos with a common foyer entry, so we had two kitchens, two baths, two living rooms, etc., in addition to the two bedrooms! More than we needed for sure! But the extra bathroom came in handy when we were both getting dressed to go out to dinner, etc. The furnishings were of very good quality, as were the appliances, although our one freezer just wouldn't produce much ice. Not a big deal. There were TVs in both the bedrooms and the living room, with DVD player, too. We did not partake of any of the activities, but they had a calendar of events every day with some interesting tours available. If we didn't have our own car we probably would have used the shuttle. We did go over to South Point Casino, which was nice but not quite up to the luxurious casino hotels on the Strip. All in all, I would definitely recommend the Grandview. We are long time timeshare owners, and so we politely declined the initial \"breakfast\" meeting invitation offered right at check-in, which was fast and efficient, and we were never bothered the rest of the week. I find after reading all the reviews on TA that most of the dissatisfied people who write have gotten sucked into the timeshare presentation, and then find they can't say no, and so get stuck taking a two or three hour tour. Been there, done that! I am of the thinking that my vacation time is just too precious to waste listening to a commissioned sales person's spiel about timeshare ownership. Obviously, as owners of two weeks at other resorts, we did at one time many years ago succumb to the timeshare presentation and actually bought, and we've never regretted it for a minute! That's how we exchange to nice resorts like the Grandview!", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for Families\u201d", "Author": "jyd85", "ReviewID": "UR88529830", "Content": "My wife and I choose this hotel because of the Reviews.

It is located about ten minutes south of the strip and is a straight shot down Las Vegas Blvd. We stayed for five nights and it was like renting a little apartment in Vegas. We traveled with three children, ages 15, 3, and 1. We stocked up the kitchen with items for breakfast and lunch and only ate out at dinner, saving a ton of money. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and feel at home. I can not even begin to express the wonderful feelings having a washer/dryer in the unit, especially with two small children. My husband and I took the bedroom with our little one in her pack and play, my older two slept on the fold out couch in the living room. During the day we went out and did family activities and at night my husband and I took the shuttle to the strip. I felt very safe having my oldest watch the younger children while my husband and I went out, I would not have felt nearly as comfortable in one of the big hotels on the strip. The shuttle was 8.00 per person for the night, but well worth it to have a safe ride back to the resort and a taxi is much more expensive. The last shuttle returning to the resort was at the Excalibur at 1am, so not too early at all. They did have someone come tiddy up during the middle of the stay, but this is not a hotel so do not expect maid service daily. We really did treat this as our own little apartment and it did feel very much like home. The local stores such as Walmart and various grocery stores are less than five minutes away, and you can save a ton of money by stocking up the kitchen and also purchasing anything you may have forgotten (like sunscreen) from Walmart versus over priced gas stations or the 7-11. We stayed in the Daisy tower, which is the newest, and it was beautiful. The decor is very upscale and comfortable. The DVD player in the room was great for keeping the children occupied. The pool was also very fun and a lovely place to lay around for an afternoon or two. My husband and I did go on the \"tour\" for tickets to the Tournament of Kings and also $50.00 in chips at the Excalibur. We are timeshare owners at another resort, so we know what to expect and are pretty much professionals and saying no. As long as you have thick skin and understand they are just doing their job, its worth the 90mins. They will promise you the world, but we all know about ocean front property in Arizona ;) Overall it was a great stay.

I had to attend a conference at Mandalay Bay and instead of paying the outrageous prices for a hotel room we decided to stay at the Grandview Resort. Luckily it is only 6 miles from Mandalay Bay which is essentially the southern part of the strip. This means that if you want to venture into the heart of the strip it is a little further. I've heard that the resort provides a shuttle that you can purchase for the day but since we rented a car for the week on priceline for under $200 we never used it. We stayed in the Daisy building which was extrememly nice. Modern decor, granite countertops, flatscreen televisions in both the bedroom and the living room, and a large bathroom with both a shower and jetted tub. It is a small walk to the pool but we didn't mind it, and I'll tell you why. Parking can be a nightmare here. They do have a parking garage but it is at the end of the resort..........and right next to the Daisy building! Being Vegas we would never come home before 11pm and there is not nearly enough parking spaces for the number of rooms they have, hence the need for a parking garage. So we figured it was the lesser of two evils to be closer to the parking garage than the pool. We would rather have a short walk when we come home after a late night than a short walk to the pool. But alas, only our opinion. The room itself was very clean and they provided you with many items I wish we knew so that we didn't pick them up at the store. We stopped at the grocery store before checking in. They give you several coffee filters, a package of coffee, dishwasher soap, and one load of laundry detergent. They don't give nearly enough shampoo and conditioner so I would pack more of that as well as body soap. For the ladies, they do have a hairdryer so you can leave yours at home. The full kitchen has all the silverware, pots and pans, and cooking utensils that you need including a microwave and full fridge, as well as a dishwasher. Not too much more I can mention about the kitchen. The king bed in the bedroom is extremely comfortable, and I looked forward to falling asleep between the sheets every evening knowing that I will be getting a good night's rest. The pull-out bed in the living room couch does have a thin pad and so not as comfortable for those sleeping there. Checking in was fairly simple but beware if you don't want to take a tour. After hearing some of the other reviews here we decided not to take the tour and save ourselves from a possible headache. After you check in they direct you to the place to get your parking pass. This is also the place they try to get you free or discounted show tickets in exchange for a resort tour. If you don't want it then just politely refuse and ask for your parking pass. They will try to pressure you a little but if you stand firm then they will just give you your pass and walk away. This is also the place we got a coupon book for the Southpoint Casino next door and VIP passes for nightclubs. Make sure to pick up some of those because they're free! We saw two shows there, Matsuri at the Imperial Palace and Blue Man Group at the Venetian. Matsuri is what I would call a stripped down Cirque du Soleil show. All the performers are Asian and seating is done by tables. Our family got a front row table and had an amazing view! It's basically a show of dancing, feats of strength, agility, and balance. Not as big a production as some of the other shows in Vegas but a good one none the less. My 7 year old nephew was even called up to help perform a trick. I'm sure it's just a gimmick to get you to buy a photo or two (which we did!) but he did have a good time and you can't put a price on that. All this for only $45 bucks a ticket, but we did find a discount online. The second show we saw was the Blue Man Group. To tell you the truth, I wasn't as impressed by this show. I may have had higher expectations but it basically boils down to 3 bald men painted blue making some music with PVC pipes and their band as well as making a mess with paint. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable to watch but I did get bored more than a few times. I just don't think it was worth the $80 bucks we shelled out for each ticket, and this was discounted online! All in all it was a great place to stay and we really didn't mind being a little further from the strip. I'm sure there are some people who would love to stay in the strip, and we would too, but I just couldn't justify spending all that money for one of the strip resorts. I'd rather save that for a good meal, shows, or GAMBLING! They do have a free business center where you can look up stuff to do and print boarding passes but you only get 20 minutes so beware of your time. We almost got timed out buying our show tickets. If you want wireless you have to pay for it but if you have a smartphone look to see if you can tether it to your laptop. Luckily we could with our phone and could play on the internet in our room.

There is only 1 bedroom per unit and a sleeper sofa in the living room. So just wanted to point that out for anyone looking to stay here and save you any inconvience. Secondly this is a condo resort so there is no onsight restaurant only a deli. The South Point casino is within walking distance and has everything you could want, restaurants, bowling, bingo, casino, spa and 16 screen theater but...it is the only game in town within WALKING distance. We spent a lot of time there. Plenty of penny slots and great ice cream! :) Aproximately 1 mile down Silverado there is a Walmart grocery store and many places to eat. The Del Taco on the corner of Silverado Blvd. and Las Blvd. had $.39 cent tacos! We found that to be so funny because for $3.90 we got 10 tacos! and they were good. Another tip is that on Las Vegas Blvd. going towards the strip on the right is the Las Vegas Blvd. Outlet Mall. Now you may tend to not notice it because they are doing construction on the outside and all you see is a lot of scaffolding and the mall is indoors. It's worth it to go in there. There are a lot of stores inside and I would imagine in the summer it would be great to get out of the heat while shopping as opposed to some of the outlet Mall elsewhere. Also, NOT inside the Outlet Mall but rather outside of it in another little plaza is a Disney Outlet store. I found some great souvenier bargins in there if you're interested. So in short my review of the Grandview is very positive. It IS about 8 miles from the strip so you will need a car and I would recommend to family and friends to stay here!:)", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort\u201d", "Author": "Gizzie", "ReviewID": "UR82537574", "Content": "We stayed at the Grandview the first week of October. It's a little further from the strip than I anticipated, but we had a car, so wasn't a problem. We loved being off the strip, yet having South Pointe right beside us. Best of both worlds really, I could take the car and shop (location is close to the outlet mall), while my husband went next door to gamble. Or if we wanted to gamble and drink, just had to walk across the street. South Pointe is a really nice casino - lots of great places to eat, movie theatre, etc. When checking in, we were assigned the Jasmine building, but upon looking at the suite, asked to be moved - wanted to be closer to the main pool and South Pointe. We were then moved to the Sage building, and although older, we really liked the location. We found the staff very friendly and helpful, and we were not approached with the time share spiel at all. There were alot of timeshare people touring though. Room was very nice, large and clean, we didn't hear any outside noise, other than when the cleaning staff was next door. Bed was comfy and the bathtub was huge! The pool area was very nice, we spent almost every night for an hour or so outside, swimming or in the hot tub. (yes, only the 'top' pool is heated - not sure why they all aren't?) The trees were all nicely lit up, made for a nice atmosphere. The weekend was much busier than during the week, but we never had problems finding parking spaces.

I think this is on the lower end of a RCI Gold Crown Category. Following are the reason why: (1) The refrigerator was not making ice..the maintenance crew had to replace the ice making machine..but it took him 2-3 iterations to fix it. (2) The sofa bed had a crooked leg. This made the torso higher than the head when one sleeps (3) We stayed for 1 week but the cleaning crew was only complimentary for 1 day per week and that too Tidy cleaning...we had to ask for new towels and linens from the cleaning lady...this is not expected from a Gold Crown..even Motel 6 provides everyday cleaning and new towels everyday. The resort personnel were very helpful, nice and prompt in responding to any request. However, the key is that there should not be a scenario to even make those basic requests. (4) The pools are very good. But it will be nice if there were some resort hosted activities at the pool. eg: Water volleyball, some fun kids games, etc. (5) The kitchen was well equipped. But the utensils were not non-stick. If you are fond of cooking, then this could be a pain. (6) The pool had non-stop supply of towels. So that was a very good feature. (7) We had a jacuzzi in our room. So this was good. (8) No free internet. (9) Good rate for the amenities provided. So I shall definitely rate it as a hidden gem. The items mentioned above are minor but when a resort is rated as a Gold Crown, these are minor details which needs to be taken into account. I will again stay at this resort.

Each unit is 800 s/f and beautifully decorated and spacious. We were a bit nervous that the resort is too far down the strip, but after our stay here, I wouldn't have it any other way, for any stay longer than a couple days. Two -Three days in a Vegas hotel is fine, but for long stays, having your own condo/kitchen cannot be beat. The resort offers a shuttle for $8 a day and runs from 8am -1:30am. If you are late nighters like we were, a taxi ride will cost you about $25 each way to downtown-Fremont Street. A little less to the center city strip area. Not a bad deal at all! The pool area is very nice and has music playing all day. There is a non-alcohol, deli/restaurant poolside that will also will deliver to your room. Virgin Pina Coloda's are a must! :) The South Point Casino is right across the street and offers great gambling at half of what the strip's minimum table bets are. The Oyster bar restaurant is amazing and offers 1 1/2 pounds of Alaskan King Crab legs for $16.99! They also have the largest shrimp you have ever seen...from Thailand! We ate there 3 of 5 nights!

He tried to tell us that if we don\u2019t want the unit after we buy that we can just sell it and get all of our money back. I told him that he can\u2019t guarantee that since he can\u2019t control the market. He got upset and started to get snippy. He said that he knows I\u2019m more intelligent than that and tried to show me some graph that he was drawing to show how the housing market never goes all the way down. (Yeah, right). Once he finally told us the price, $19,990, we told him that we were not ready to make this decision on the spot. Their finance guy came over trying to get us to buy. He asked what our jobs were and my husband told him he was in the military. So the finance guy said that he could offer us a military rate that would drop it to $13,000. He told us our payments would only be $323 with their financing which is based off of 17%!! We still did not want to buy so he offered to reduce the price again and give us 5 weeks a year. The new price was $9,990. We told him no because we refused to pay that much interest, wanted to talk to our bank, and were not prepared to make this decision. The sales associate then informed us that if we didn\u2019t buy that day we would miss out and would never get this rate again. (So much for no pressure, huh?) He then turned 180 degrees and became very rude once he realized that there was NO way we were going to buy that day. We were escorted out to this other guy to take a short survey. He then said that he could reduce the price to a little over $5,000. We still said no. After all this, we were put in this room to wait for our names to be called so we could collect our tickets that were promised to us. We were told this whole thing would only take 2 hours. We were going on the 4th hour. We look around and there are a lot of people just standing around and all we want to do is leave. My husband got up to ask someone when we would be getting out of here. To my amazement, the guy started shouting at my husband saying that they are doing the best they can and to go sit down. It was VERY unprofessional. When we finally got out of there and loaded up onto the shuttle, we were not the only ones that felt frustrated and pressured. Everyone else on the shuttle had the same complaints. Also, to my surprise, apparently everyone got the \u201cmilitary discount.\u201d There was no such thing as a military discount. It was more of a \u201coh, no! You didn\u2019t buy on the first price discount.\u201d Also, on a side note, they were not upfront about all the costs. They said that there is a yearly \u201cmaintenance fee\u201d of $677. What they don\u2019t tell you is that this price can go up over time. Also, you are not guaranteed a week when you want to transfer to a different resort. Plus, you have to pay to switch weeks and resorts. On top of that, you are still making your monthly payment for a property you can only visit once a year\u2026.this is a waste of money!

We had a 2 BR unit, so we had plenty of room. We stayed in the Iris Building, which we liked because it had its own pool, and there were very few people ever in the pool. We checked out the main pool at the Sage building, and found it to be crowded, and lots of timeshare tours walking thru quite often. We did attend the time share presentation in order to get some gambling/meal coupons for Southpoint Casino, which is right across a street with no traffic, a short walk. The entire time spent was about 3 hours. The presentation may only take 90 minutes, but by the time you check out with the other management, it totals about 3 hours, so if you don't want to spend 3 hours, better skip it. We drove to Hoover Dam, stopped at the Hacienda Casino one day, and my mom, 85, hit a jackpot for $1250. She was quite happy. We drove to the strip often, mostly taking I-15, which made it a breeze to get to any casino you wanted. Yes, we rented a car. Don't know how much you would enjoy staying at the Grandview without a car. We visited several casinos, they are each beautifully decorated, so even if you don't gamble, check out the Venetian, Caesar's Palace, and the Paris, our favorites. We had the buffet on Monday night at the Silverton Casino, off of I-15, and if you are over 55, it is only $5. Because it was Memorial Day, everyone was only $5. The Management at the Grandview went out of their way to please. There were always several people at the front desk for assistance. We did not request a handicapped unit, but Joe, the manager, sent us to look at a couple of them, and offered to move us, if we needed to change. We stayed with our original unit, as we liked the Iris Building. Joe, also loaned us a small step stool for the week, so that my mom could get in and out of the minivan that we had rented. Joe made sure that his staff provided excellent customer service. We saw Cher, she is great, as you would expect. Also went to see Barry Manilow on the last night we were there, as we took a red eye back to the East, leaving on Saturday night. That worked out beautifully. Our rental was from Sunday to Sunday. By leaving on Saturday night, we spend the whole day at the pool, went to the show at night, and then off to the airport, and slept on the plane home. Think about that for your next trip. Great meals were at the Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris, the Silverton Buffet on Mondays, the M seafood buffet (close to the Grandview), and an especially great restaurant is the Casa Di Amore. They provide a complimentary limo service, which picked us up at the Grandview. Food was delicious, wait staff was excellent, and they had live music--a fellow singing and playing keyboard, and an 89 year old violinist who played extraordinarily. They took requests, and you could sit and listen to them all night.

It was a disastrous week, as the car broke down again and we had to shovel out some big bucks to get it fixed, but staying at the Grandview was the highlight of our vacation. The Southpointe is right next door, which is really convenient. My husband and I prefer to stay on the strip if it's just the two of us, but this place was ideal when you have kids with you. The baby loved her first swim in the pool. The walls were not paper thin, though I did request the Daisy building, which I highly recommend.

It's quieter, and you can relax by the pool a lot more. There's more room, since it's a suite, not just a hotel room. here's the breakdown... There are 10 buildings in the complex, some are older than others. We were in the Primrose building. The decor theme is \"desert sunset\". Some people think the decor looks dated, I just think that it looks too matchy-matchy and hotel-ish. I wouldn't decorate my house like that, but when I'm on vacation I don't really care if the curtains are my favorite colour or not. Suite A and B are exactly the same. Each have a full kitchen (stove and oven, fridge, toaster, coffee-maker, all the pots, pans, plates, glasses that you'll need), a pull-out couch that turns into a queen bed in the living room (where you'll also find a TV and DVD player), and a bedroom with a king bed and a jet tub. The washroom has a large shower stall and two sinks. There are also washer and dryer sets in each suite, in a closet by the dining room (which seats 4). You have plenty of towels, and we got small toiletries when we checked in. This reminds me- after check-in, when we went to get our parking pass, we were asked if we wanted to attend a \"presentation\" and get cash or show tickets in exchange. We knew they would try to sell us timeshare, but we wanted to see Ka (excellent show, and by attending the presentation we got tickets), and so we went. It took just over an hour. We had breakfast while we were told the details (we weren't interested), and when they figured out that we weren't going to buy anything they just walked off. I thought it was a bit rude of them, but it's not like I wanted to make the experience longer. Of course, you have the option of declining the presentation completely. We knew what we were getting ourselves into, and it was worth it for us. Internet is available in the rooms, but it's $50 for the week. I didn't want internet anyways, I like to be detached from technology when I'm on vacation. However, if you need to check emails from time to time, keep in mind that there is an internet lounge in the lobby (free), and if you go to IHOP (it's open 24/7) they also have free WiFi. We liked to go there for breakfast or late night dining, and would check whatever we needed on our iPods while we were there. I recommend a car to fully enjoy the area. There is a shuttle that can take you places, but it's $16 per person per day, so when you do the math, it might end up cheaper and more convenient (the shuttle stops running around midnight). Cabs are very expensive around that area, so I'd try to stay away from them as much as I could. There is also a casino called South Point across the street. We went there because they have many restaurants (some open even in the middle of the night), and we got a coupon book from Grandview for $20 free slot play, free wine with dinner, etc. On nights where you don't feel like going all the way to the strip, South Point is a good place to kill some time. We didn't have any issues with the staff, they were all efficient and helpful. Overall, it was a good vacation and I am going to keep going to the Grandview every time I go to Vegas. Oh... I forgot to mention that they're planning on building 8 more buildings, so if you decide to go, double-check to make sure construction won't be an issue (noise and all that stuff).

It's clean, very comfortable, within 15 minute drive of the Strip and within steps to a lovely Casino across the road (South Pointe) and 10 minutes from the Airport.

As for the people who complain about the timeshare sellers - just say NO thank you and walk away. If they follow up with phone calls, just say NO thank you and put the phone down! We only had one complaint - one evening there was a knock on our inner door. A young couple and a baby were in our vestibule looking for some friends. They had only knocked on the door because they could hear voices inside. I asked them how they had got into our vestibule as the key card to our suite is only supposed to open the main door and our inner door. Apparently the check in clerk had coded their key card to our rooms. I immediately 'phoned down to reception to complain and asked for an explanation, bearing in mind that the couple could easily have opened our door and walked straight into our unit. The clerk at first insisted that the person must have been maid service or a maintenance person. I told him that I knew the difference between a young couple with baby and maid service/maintenance. No explanation was offered and the clerk could not have been more bored or uncaring. On checking out, my husband again mentioned the \"unexpected visitors\" to our suite and asked to speak to the person in charge of the front desk. This lady (sorry, have forgotten your name) apologized and said she couldn't understand how this error had occured. My husband told her that when I had 'phoned the front desk no-one had cared and no apology had been received from anyone!

We thought that since the average cost of Blue Man Group tickets were about $140, it would be worth our time to spend 2 hours to listen to what they had to say. We even had to put down a $40 deposit with the promise of getting $20 back plus the tickets. We drove there, and I'm glad we did. We found that there was little to no parking, with no clear building descriptions laid out for people driving in for the presentation on their own, so we found a parking place and walked - all over, until we found where we were to be. After being introduced to our personal attendant, we were whisked over to a room with others and closed in while we viewed a video and listened to the benefits of owning a timeshare.

We told her again that we couldn't do anything and she dropped the price. Then she brought a nicely dressed facts and figures guy over who tried to convince us of the benefits and we again declined. He then tried to divide the timeshare into one room instead of two and do it for half price. Our same argument applied and he tried to lower the amount and timeshare offers again. By this time, my hubby was getting annoyed at the continuous offers and told them \"no means no.\" They then said thank you and told us they would let us out. As we went through to another room, the attendant then \"recognized\" someone that she worked with and introduced us. The new guy then proceeded to ask us closing exit interview questions, but then asked us if we could afford \"this?\" Upon our next no, he then offered us another deal to purchase into foreclosure units at bargain basement prices. Again, we said no. Then he moved us into another room, where we waited our turn to be allowed to leave. Finally, they called our name, verified our tickets and gave us $20 of our $40 back - 4 1/2 hours later! We were thinking about the rooms and offers they made to us and were considering how we might be able to do it for the future. Later that night, we attended the Blue Man Group at the Venetian (awesome show.) And, while waiting for it to start, we had a conversation with the couple next to us. They went for the same presentation the day before. We compared notes and found that they received better incentives for seeing the presentation than we did - and their tickets were even free! They too had the same experiences and ended up finding the Jockey Club next to City Center. The plans were apparently, better and the got a much better timeshare deal for their money. The rooms may not be as nicely updated as the Grandview, but they are right there, in the middle of the action and have more points and offers for much less money. Now, we have more to think about. Please be aware of how long this presentation is and how much your time is worth - is it worth it for he tickets they offer?", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern NJ", "Title": "\u201cFor Us, This Way The Way To Go!\u201d", "Author": "MexicaliRose_1", "ReviewID": "UR62412079", "Content": "We stayed at the Grandview in mid-March 2010. I think if you are going to stay in Las Vegas for a week, this timeshare resort is perfect! You were out of the hustle and bustle of the major hotel area, but also right next to South Point if you wanted to go to a casino. If you are horse people, it\u2019s good to know that South Point has an equine arena, with various events going on. For me, that was definitely a plus! During our stay, they had a Quarter Horse Competition. They were going to have Bull Riding competition there later in the month also. Our building (Daisy) was recently renovated, and was designated as a \u201csmoking\u201d building; a good idea to keep the smoking units together. The living quarters were quite large, very clean, and well equipped with everything you would need for a 7 night stay. We stocked the full size refrigerator with snacks, and usually made a hot breakfast each day. It was great to lounge around the \u201capartment\u201d during the morning, and not have to feel pressed to get dressed to go out for breakfast. The unit was large enough so we weren't in each other's space, like we would in a hotel room. We had a great view of the Strip, which really didn\u2019t seem like 7 miles away, but was. Yes, I think you would need a car, but they offer shuttle services to the Strip and Supermarket. Parking was never an issue for us, and we usually returned to the resort well after midnight. One negative point, the units are a little loud. The floors are tiled, and when the people above you move their chairs in the dining room, the sound reverberates throughout the whole unit. I tried very hard not to drag the chairs, so not to disturb the people below me. Also the Jacuzzi was very loud when filling up. One morning the people above me filled up theirs, and I thought it was my BF filling up ours! Oh yes, and don't work the appliances if you are trying to sleep...both the dishwasher and washing machine were pretty noisy too! Check in and check out was a breeze, although 10:00 am check out is a little early, and they threaten to charge you over $100.00 for a late check out. But there is a lot of cleaning involved with the units, so I can understand the policy. We were asked to attend the presentation during check in, with the incentive of getting free show tickets, but we declined. We were called once again in our room, declined once more, and were never approached again. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at Grandview.

We were given a one bedroom suite on the 16th floor in the new Daisy Bldg. When we entered we were in AWE at how beautiful everything was. The bathroom was beautiful, mosiac tile in the shower a full size jetted hot tub and a sit area in front of the mirror. Every kitchen had all matching Whirlpool appliances, and granite counter tops. The kitchen had every utensil, plate, pot, pan and down to a ice cream scooper is available to you. It was like being at home. We did our laundry and even cleaned our bathrooms ourselves because we felt so comfortable. Staff as other visitors were courteous and smiling. The only thing that my husband and I didn't like was paying for the internet service. We couldn't understand why you can stay at the Hilton, Wyndam, or Hyatt and get free Wi Fi but have to pay here.

We got $175 in $25 certificates to use for food or bowling at the South Point Resort directly across the street. South Point has maybe 6 restaurants and most of them have pretty tasty food. We had prime rib and General Tsao's Chicken at the Cafe, both dishes were very good. Our favorite was the lunch special at the Mexican restaurant: $8.99 each for a Margarita, soup, beans, rice, and two entrees. We even splurged on a shrimp stuffed avocado. Everything was delicious and it only cost us a little more than our $25 coupon. We also tried the Italian restaurant; the crusty rolls were fabulous but the entrees were bland. The Grand View is in a great location; close enough to the Strip, Walmart, Sam's Club and many, many other shopping and grocery stores. I'd visit the Grand View again. Highlight of the trip: Red Rock Canyon visitor center and scenic drive. The visitor center was remodeled in 2009. It is a beautiful facility incorporating fanciful contemporary art into the informational displays. The drive is 13 miles but we spent 3 hours climbing the rocks before the first mile marker.

The people on the other side of our bedroom were a family - and they weren't loud.. we could hear the father snore, the daughter come in and happily sing \"Wake up daddy\" - we could even hear he and his wife discussing where they would all go to lunch that day. I learned all the kids names too - and they really were speaking in normal tones. As a result, we weren't comfortable moving in our space a we were scared to wake up one of the kids... so we tried to stay as quiet and unassuming as possible.

The demographic here tended to skew to the middle-aged and older folks. Yes, quiet is nice in Vegas sometimes too. Prior to arrival, my companion was worried about whether or not this was going to be a 5-star resort. She was quite satisfied with the entire facility. My first time staying \"off the Strip\" and I was initially quite concerned about being this far out. But the Grandview -- a deeded timeshare resort -- was an exceptional experience. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (but unless you are really really really interested in buying into their \"points\" vacation system, avoid attending one of their breakfast or lunch presentations -- supposed to take 90 minutes, in exchange for some half-price show tickets -- and wound up taking nearly 3 hrs. with high pressure sales tactics). Stayed in the newest building. Great 1-BR unit, complete with kitchen, sleeper sofa, flat screen TVs in both living area & bedroom, Jacuzzi in the BR, etc. Free internet was available in the computer center off the main lobby, but if you want 24-hr. access to Wi-Fi you need to pay a fee (which seems silly here and elsewhere). Pool area was great. Exercise facility was first rate. Even an on-premise deli was very good. Cab stand was available at the South Point Hotel & Casino next door (huge!). Grandview daily ran a free shuttle to area malls and grocery store; you could also put in a reservation for a free shuttle to the airport upon departure. There was also a separate shuttle service ($8/person/day) which ran to 3 locations on the Strip (Excalibur, Aria, and Treasure Island) for hourly drop off/pick up from about 8 a.m. to last pick up @ 1:40 a.m. Never need a car unless you want to travel out of town for sightseeing, and even then there are tour options as well. All in all, the Grandview was a great place to stay. If you want to be in the heart of the Strip, this obviously isn't the place for you, nor is it if you want 24-hr. access to bars, casinos and restaurants -- but with the South Point Hotel & Casino across the street, you basically can have all that too, if you want it. Bottom line: we were happy campers at the Grandview. Just avoid the sales presentation! You can buy half-price show tix several places on the strip without having to sit through 1-3 hrs of a sales pitch. But would I stay here again? You bet!

(I've had similar experiences on Trip Advisor after reading the reviews of our chosen resort and then being very depressed BEFORE even starting our vacation). The resorts and service have NEVER been as bad as people here describe them. This is just another one of those instances... We came in on Friday of NASCAR weekend and we weren't the only fans staying at Grandview. Even with the extra people, I found check in to be fast and efficient and the computer room not overflowing with people. The staff was extremely courteous and friendly and wanted to make the process as easy as possible. After check in, we were sent to the Guest Services counter to get our parking pass and packet. Yes, it is also the time they try to sign you up for the dreaded \"Presentation\" that everyone talks about. We've been owners in Mexico since 1993, so we have learned the ins and outs of Timeshare Presentations. You always check \"before\" to see what they are offering and you ask questions so you are not surprised at the end. They offered $100 cash to spend anywhere, discounted show tickets to 2 shows, or $175 to spend at South Pointe Casino. They charged us a $20 \"Refundable\" fee to sign up and this was part of the money you received in the end, so $80 cash or $155 at South Pointe. After the weekend of NASCAR and everything else we had planned, we decided on Monday to cancel our presentation scheduled for Tues. AM. We had absolutely no problem cancelling OR getting our $20 bill back. And I told them I was pleased with our accomodations and that I would go back home and tell everyone about their resort. That made them smile. The resort itself was very nice. The rooms were clean, comfortable, very spacious, with a big kitchen and full size refrigerator and a stacked washer/dryer combo. There was also a dishwasher with plenty of detergent packets. Housekeeping came once during the week (as planned) and called us that morning to ask if we were comfortable, happy and if we needed anything when they came to clean. We had asked for extra soap and clean towels the day before and they were there in minutes with more than enough of each, also took our dirty towels. Even though they only come once a week, you can certainly call anytime if you need anything. I agree with the ones that say they're happy NOT having someone knocking at 8:30am EVERYDAY to clean the room. The surroundings were very clean and I saw workers cleaning the hallways, elevators, outside areas, etc. EVERY day. We stayed in the SAGE building which got some of the worst reviews here on TA. It does seem to be the oldest building being closest to the registration building and also being labeled as Building #1. We stayed on the 6th floor in a two bedroom unit (which is actually 2 separate 1 bedroom units) and had the rooms closest to the elevator. Our friends joined us on Sunday and stayed in the other 1 bdrm unit. We never heard them, or the people on the other side of us, except maybe occasional water running which wasn't that bothersome. So it was pretty quiet most of the time...no slamming doors, no screaming kids, no loud tv's...very comfortable. The SAGE building could use some upgrading which looks like is happening based on reviews here and moving of furniture from some rooms that I saw while there, but for the most part we were very satisfied with this resort. As long as we have a comfortable bed, clean bathroom and kitchen (if applicable), and enough room, we are very happy. Needless to say...we were very happy with our stay here. For those pretentious nit-pickers that complain about every little thing in these reviews, maybe you'd be better off taking your grandiose demeanor and your extravagant needs down to one of the major Resort/Casinos on the strip and ask for the \"High Roller\" room.

The living area is well lit, making it easy on our tired eyes to read at night \u2013 although we don\u2019t spend much time there with the Southpoint Casino next door. The Grandview staff does a number of things well. Check-in and check-out is a breeze. Friendly and helpful staff members greeted us whenever we entered the resort administrative building, which has a room full of computers for guests to use as well as morning coffee. The welcome package contains maps showing the location of casinos on the strip as well as stores and restaurants near the resort. Housekeepers change towels at midweek and replenish bath supplies. Clean pool and exercise towels are available, self-service, whenever needed. The exercise room is open from 5:00 AM until midnight, but is too small for the expanding resort. The resort has plans for another activities center that hopefully include an exercise facility. We have taken the \u201cowners\u201d timeshare presentation both times. The presentations are low-pressure compared to some others we\u2019ve taken and the resort offers discounted show tickets in return. Be advised, though, that the marketers get a commission for you to attend the presentation but the salespeople get a commission only if they sell. Any timeshare presentation will involve pressure. We would recommend a rental car because Grandview is located a few miles south of the strip. You can get to I15, which runs north and south, by making a left onto Silverado Ranch Blvd (the first intersection as you head north on Las Vegas Blvd). Making a right on Silverado Ranch will take you to grocery stores, restaurants, Target, drug stores, etc. Trader Joe\u2019s has a good selection of easy to prepare meals as well as wine tasting Saturday afternoon.

So after putting 25 bucks down as something of a penalty payment if we didn't actually show up at 1pm the next day we left it at that. Next day a big black bus showed up to pick us up just as I was locking all of my credit cards in the trunk of the car. Away we went on a 10 mile jaunt down to Green Valley for a free lunch and to take the tour. The lunchroom must have sat close to a hundred people and was quite full and noisy. A nice fellow from Romania took us on the tour which consumed all of the 3 hours. Then after that came the inevitable arm twisting on making the sale which took another 2 1/2 hours. Finally it was getting close to 6pm and the place was emptying out fast. The horse trading went on and on and the deal got sweeter and sweeter. Making the point moot, I said it didn't matter what they offered us since all of my credit cards were locked in the car downtown. I felt sorry for the Romanian guy since he had been really nice and was speechless that I would be so foolish as to not bring any credit cards. I said that we'd have to come back the following week which met with loud cries of protest. My wife works at H&R Block and was kind of taking sides with the Romanian arguing that we were buying at the best possible time ever. By this point I had lost all patience with the process and was ready to leave when my wife reached in her purse and pulled out her credit card. The resulting paperwork took another hour to process and finally that night we arrived back at the Nugget at 8pm, the Romanian had to drive us back since the bus drivers had all since gone home. Our \"hundred bucks\" turned out to be a chit for special gambling chips at the Nugget. They had to be played on the tables and the only way to convert them into cash was to win back their value with regular chips which I did to the tune of $200. Now it's a year later and we are off to spend a week in our timeshare. I've been reading mixed reviews on TripAdvisor about the Grandview but I've gotta see it for myself good or bad. Shortly before we left we discovered that our computer tech guy also owns there and highly recommended it as well as offering a few little tips. We arrived near midnight and were promptly checked in to the 20th floor of the Daisy building. Wow. What a shock. Everything was just as it was presented on the tour with a lovely view north up I-15 and the South Point thrown in. Although I didn't use the exercise facilities and pool area, my wife did and it was marvelous. The weather was great, she got to sun herself next to the pool listening to the waterfalls and relaxing in the hot tubs. There is a good selection of TV channels in the rooms and all too soon, the week flew by and we had to leave. So now to conclude with the pros and cons. Pros: This is only our first stay at any timeshare resort but from what we saw and heard from other residents in other buildings, the comments were all positive. Proximity to the South Point is very good and it is a full service casino with plenty to do for the gambler and non gambler alike. We felt that the lack of housekeeping was of little consequence. It was nice not to have someone pounding on the door every morning at 8:30. If we needed anything, it would have been provided. My wife was quite happy to do the minimal amount of tidying and really enjoyed using the washer and dryer since we were on a 15 day trip. We weren't pressured to do another timeshare presentation. The welcome girl called our room wondering if we would like to participate in a free breakfast and presentation, I simply declined and that was it. Ironically, one of the salesmen stopped me in the parking lot while he was escorting a couple of \"suckers\" around the property to ask what I thought of the place and I unhesitatingly answered in the positive. Kind of awkward for a hard bitten old timeshare skeptic! Cons:The hotel is located 5.6 miles south on LV Blvd. from Mandalay Bay. We had a rental car through RCI so went grocery shopping at WalMart on Silverado Ranch Rd. There is certainly no shortage of shopping options located within 2 miles of the resort. For those without the rental car option there are posters up in the elevators announcing the grocery shopping bus tours and the buses seem to run on a regular basis. Our access to the car precluded our use of the on site transport, however I even noticed a city bus stopping in the parking lot at the South Point where there is an established route. So there are options for getting around without a car. The WiFi situation was something that I enquired about on our tour. While the Romanian guy readily ascertained that there was indeed wifi, he failed to note that it wasn't free wifi. The computer room in the reception building is better than nothing, but with only 8 terminals it is woefully inadequate for the number of residents on the property now let alone when the newest building opens soon and the next one is built. There was a bit of noise from adjoining rooms, however it was negligible. We have found that staying on higher floors tends to be more quiet. One odd little thing was the stingy amount of flatware in the suites. One last thing, it costs $175 to re-locate your week. Our assigned week is in June and since we live in Canada would have very little reason to be in Vegas in June, so we are going to look into changing to Feb. I still have a few lingering doubts about the investment value of timeshares. Perhaps over time I'll favourably re-adjust my views. As for this property it was more or less everything it was presented to be and I can honestly say from our experience that it was likely the best experience we have ever had in Vegas. My advice would be if you don't want the hassle of presentations, sales pitches, etc., firmly tell the person who approaches you on the street with free goodies that you are NOT interested, I did it for years.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cOMG,WOW\u201d", "Author": "KeishaWebb", "ReviewID": "UR53908340", "Content": "My friends and i agree we love this home away from home at the grandview.

Master bedroom had a king bed, smaller TV and no DVD player. Master Bath had a nice jacuzzi tub, separate from the actual bathroom, fairly big walk-in shower and dual sinks. According to the sales folks, 6 buildings are completed with 2 more coming. They have 2 thousand units now, and I'm guessing with the other 2 buildings, they will add another 300 or so rooms. Access is very easy, as it is south on LV boulevard, about 5 miles or so from the Mandalay Bay. Or, you can access it from I-15 as well. It's located right next to the South Point Casino. The only real complaint I had was that the walls seem to be very thin. I consistently heard running water and chairs being moved in the other units around us. We didn't take part in the timeshare lockdown, but on one of our walks around the complex, I did see the sales center where the models were, and they were nothing like the unit we had. I'm not sure if this is how they are planning to remodel in the future, but I thought of the classic 'bait and switch technique' \"Take a look at this beautiful model unit. Nice furniture, (2) 42\" plasma screen TV's, etc.\" And oh, by the way, this is NOT the unit you will actually be getting if you buy here. LOL So, in conclusion, I probably would not stay here again unless it was the same type scenario.

We were given a handicapped room (did not ask for one) on the 3rd floor of the Daisy Tower which had a view of a garbage dumpster and sounds to match. No fresh air in the room which smelled of disinfectant and damp carpeting. Do not pay more than $50 a night and you will have nothing to complain about. The decor is absolutely frightening. Red, White and Black. Stripes, Diamonds, Plaids, Checks all mixed together to make you queasy. Drapes do not match carpet and windows do not open. Air conditioning LOUD and sporadic. Only one small bathroom sink (I cannot imagine what people do who come here with children or more than 2 people). The faucet is the kind they use at Gas Station restrooms -where you have to press it for the water to come on and when it does you had better use it fast before it shuts off. There is no way to regulate the water temperature. I ended up using the kitchen sink to wash my face. If you have an extra mirror - bring it so that someone can use that sink. The cabinets were very cheap - everything about this place made me cringe as I felt like it was built in the 1980's and yet IT WAS JUST COMPLETED! I think they may have salvaged a lot of the materials from hotels that were blown up over the years. Terrible sound proofing - no security. I felt trapped. If you think you are getting a deal, think again- the extra room in the living room is not really suitable for sleeping - there is no closet space or shelving in there. I don't think I would be as annoyed if the reviews were more accurate - one person actually insinuated this place was on a par with a five star property on the strip. There is NO SECURITY - light in the entryway was out. PLEASE do not make the same mistake. This is a zoo with time share sales pitches and people looking confused everywhere.

The hotel was very clean and so were the rooms. The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable. The jacuzzi in the room was so nice too!! Really appreciated the washing machine and dryer, we were only supplied with one tiny box of detergent...it's so nice being able to do some laundry while on vacation. The rooms all have kitchens, I loved that. We definitely saved some money by making breakfast in the morning. The pools were very nice and clean. There were plenty of chairs at the pool...we have been to some hotels where it is a nightmare trying to find two chairs after ten am. I only wish we had more time to spend relaxing there. It was nice that this hotel is so close to South Point since there is no casino at Grandview. Also gives you a little bit more for food and restaurant options. We didn't even really eat at the Grandview so I cant really comment on the restaurants. Actually, my husband bought us some food from \"the deli,\" it was okay. We mostly ate on the strip. We rented a car for the week so the distance from the Grandview to the strip didn't really matter. The cons... Nothing horrible. The pillows were actually horrible. They were all lumpy and just really uncomfortable. And the jacuzzi hours sucked. The hours were from 8am-10pm. Who is in their room during these hours? So we didn't get to enjoy the jacuzzi that much. One more thing was housekeeping, from what I understood they would only clean your room after you have been there for a few days...I thought that was odd just because I like getting housekeeping everyday. We booked a show through the hotel and they made us pay cash which was a little inconvenient, don't understand why we couldn't pay with a credit card. The distance from the strip isn't a bad thing, just be prepared to spend $30ish a way on cab rides to and from the strip if you don't rent a car. All in all, it was a great experience. I definitely would stay there again but would recommend to rent a car to anyone that does stay at this hotel.

We were told 90 minutes we were there to listen to this sales pitch for 3 hours. The resort has a free shuttle bus that takes you to the market and to other places through out the week. The resort also have an outside company shuttle bus called Ritz Transportation that takes you to the strip for $8.00 a day. The shuttle bus also picks you up and drops you off from the airport to the resort for $8.00 per person that beats paying for the expensive cabs. I would recomend this resort just don't take the timeshare tour presentation too long.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "Title": "\u201cPros and Cons...\u201d", "Author": "AlohaKatie99", "ReviewID": "UR37491835", "Content": "We have been at the Grandview for a couple of days now and stay through Saturday.

They have a bowling alley and movie theatre and a very nice spa. However, it appears that the Grandview condos were put up quickly and a few finishing issues had not been resolved in our unit. First, several pegs were missing underneath the kitchen cabinet shelves so that the first time we went to grab a glass, all of the dishes nearly slid out onto the floor! The entertainment center doors had never been properly screwed in, so they didn't work. At least one of the faucets had been installed wrong so it didn't turn right. There were other things that I can't remember. All in all, they were small issues, but they should still fix those things. Secondly, the pool area was nice, but they only played really boring music. Lastly, they don't have free WI-FI and that is a dealbreaker for me. You can pay for it for like $40 for the week, but that's ridiculous. Yes, they have internet, but it's in the main building, so you'd have to trudge over there every morning - NO THANKS!

The Grandview was a little further south from the strip by about 8 miles on Las Vegas Boulevard but well worth our stay. With two kids in tow, we wanted something a little more laid back and thought it was a great location.The resort was large with multiple buildings and a couple more under construction across the parking lot from our building--though we really didn't hear any of the usual construction noise since the work was mostly interior. The buildings closer to the front are the \"older\" ones and I was told that they're gradually being updated. Having arrived at 4 am after driving through the night from Southern Idaho, we lucked out by being situated in one of the newer buildings (Building 4 \"Daisy\") and next to the parking terrace. TIP: call ahead and request a non-smoking room if you need one, especially if you anticipate a late arrival or you could get stuck with what they have available. The unit was great. It was a 1-bedroom but it felt nice and large. The room had a great pullout couch/sectional with a chaise. The interior had a thoughtful designer feel with nice furnishings and granite countertops. There's a jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom and the bed was just perfect for us (if you don't like hard-as-a-rock firm beds). The bathroom is REALLY spacious with a makeup table in between the two sinks and a large 48\" corner shower. Complimentary soap and shampoo along with the usual laundry soap, dishwasher soap, and paper products. There is midweek \"Tidy Service\" to change your towels, make your bed with the same linen, wipe down counters and provide you additional comp sundries if needed. TIP: If you run out of the comp soaps, they will charge you a nominal fee if you ask for more but the housekeeping carts are never far away, sooo -- you get the idea. The amenities are pretty good. Currently, there are 4 or 6 swimming pools open and multiple jacuzzis open til midnight. The main one with the waterfall is in the middle of the resort complex along with the large excercise room (a must for me), nice barbecue area (at a 114\u00ba heat??), convenience store (buy flipflops, the concrete is HOT!) and activities center (Free facials on Wednesdays). The business center is in the registration building and there are many courtesy computers for guest use but the room is rarely empty during the day. I paid $50 for 7-day wi-fi connection in my unit (sorry, it isn't free). Now I know others complained about the minimal resort activities but the South Point Hotel and Casino is a quick hop across the street and has more than plenty to entertain both young and old. TIP: Skip the icky pizza from the resort convenience store and head across the street to South Point's Del Mar Deli just inside the casino entrance for your breakfast, lunch, snacks, and to-die-for pastries and bring it back for a pool-side meal. Our other favorite? Try the Big Sur Oyster Bar for dinner. The casino also has a huge movie complex with 16 theaters, large bowling alley, arcade, spa, scheduled shows and your usual number of restaurants. Still awake after midnight? Try bowling for a buck and fill your belly afterwards at the casino's Coronado Cafe with their graveyard breakfast specials that average $3 dollars--6 bucks if you want steak and eggs and it is HUGE! TIP: Loved the penny slots. If you're a gamer just for fun, the penny slots just might entertain you. They're looser (according to a local) and we won a combined total of $100 from just a $20 start between my husband and myself. It paid for a couple of dinners and movies. The resort also offers courtesy shuttle trips to the grocery store, Las Vegas Outlet and Town Center Mall, a few other resort/casinos including Mandalay Bay and Fremont Street. There's a schedule that you will receive with your welcome packet. If you do not drive to LV or plan to rent a car, I suggest you look that schedule over upon arrival and call the front desk to reserve your number of seats because there's only one shuttle per destination. Yes, I suppose it could be an inconvenience but we found that we simply scheduled our plans around our reservation with the courtesy shuttle and used Ritz Transportation at $8/pp on unlimited rides per day to and from the strip. If you plan on making multiple day trips to the strip, this is probably a big drawback to the resort services offered but it still beats a cab ride. Last, I want to say that if you don't want to join the timeshare sales people for the usual dog and pony show, just tell them kindly, no when they first call you. Yes, we were called once more after that but respectfully declined again. They even slipped a couple of notes under our door with their teaser promos but we simply threw them away. I'll admit that when you step into the front lobby most days, it feels like a giant pool of barracudas with their prey in tow but the few \"guest service\" staff that spoke to us were quite nice. I am a timeshare owner and I expect this with virtually every resort we've visited and have even encountered our share of those that tend to be predatory in their tactics but I think they do eventually leave you alone. FINAL TIP: If you haven't tried the website restaurant.com yet, check it out. You pay only $10 for a $25 gift certificate. There are a lot of restaurants that participate on the strip and surrounding areas (and even in your home area probably). Meals on the casino restaurants are great but expensive. Google \"restaurant.com discount coupon\" and save even more. We loaded up on gift certificates this week when the website offered an 80% discount on your total order (promo just ended but replaced by a 40% off discount through couponmom.com or fatwallet.com).

We would go back! There are about 7 or 8 high rise buildings looking out over the desert and mountains- one building is currently under construction (right next to our building - but never a noise issue). Landscaping is very pretty, the buildings themselves are new and attractive. It's an easy drive to all the Vegas attractions, and we found it nice to escape the noise and bustle after a long day, especially with children. Parking was sometimes a challenge after everyone came in to the property at night - but no big deal. The SouthPoint Hotel and Casino is right next door - it is a new large full-service facility with bowling alleys, movie theaters, casino, shows, and a world class equestrian center. Las Vegas' newest full scale hotel/casino, called M, is also less than 2 miles further south - the last building on the strip - and it is incredible - very sophisticated and our favorite property we visited in all of Vegas. The Grandview units are large, attractive, nicely equipped, and very clean. We stayed in the Jasmine building with our 3 kids (ages 13,10,6) and had a 2 bedroom unit - which is really 2 one-bedroom units with a common foyer entry - so you get 2 full kitchens, 2 dens, 2 full baths, and 2 bedrooms - spacious and great for parents being able to stay up after the kids go to sleep. Completely sound proof - never heard another guest. Flat screens, great appliances, garden tubs, and handsomely appointed. Our building had its own small pool, and we also walked across the parking lot to another set of buildings where there are 2 large pools. Like I said, the action on the strip itself is a quick straight drive up the blvd. - about 4 miles - or you can get on I15 and loop behind the strip to save time in traffic. There are groceries, restaurants, a Walmart, etc. within a mile of the property. We rented a car, but Grandview also offers a shuttle. Check-in and check-out was easy and pleasant, and there was no pressure to attend timeshare presentations after a simple no thank you. We did not need to contact the staff for anything while there, so I can't speak to service other than to say our units were immaculate and everyone we encountered was helpful and polite. Things in Vegas with kids that we loved-----Valley of Fire (preferred it over Red Rock Canyon), Hoover Dam, Adventuredome (although CircusCircus is showing its age and does not feel clean - the amusement park was nice), Tournament of Kings dinner show, the Bellagio fountains, the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat of Seigfried and Roy, the roller coasters, and July 4th fireworks and dinner at the beautiful M resort. Other than our side trips to see the desert west, Cirque de Soleil's Ka was probably the highlight of our vacation - awesome! Go to tix4tonite (6 locations on the strip) for discounted tickets on many shows and dinners. Not so impressed with - the Sahara (smokey and dirty), Bonnie Springs Ranch (sweetly hokey but not worth the time), the Caesars Palace Atlantis Fountain show - but loved the Forum Shops, the Sirens of TI show - free and very well done, but way too sexy for kids. Food - best buffet, by far, was at the Wynn - and a beautiful property to see. Best burger place - Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay. Best upscale meal - the Italian restaurant at M.

Addressing previous comments: * Poor sound-proofing. Yes, this is true. But its overstated. Request an end unit (see tips below) and you'll be fine. * Poor parking. New garage is open. Parking space is plentiful. Here are our my suggestions for making the most of the resort: * Request one of the new buildings (21 floors). We stayed in the newest, Daisy. The condos were impeccable. * Request a unit number 1. Like 701, 801, 901,etc. These are the corner units so you only share common walls with one neighbor. We stayed in 901. * Rent a car. You absolutely need one. * Say no to the Timeshare presentation request at check in, and then unplug your room phone. You'll be left in peace for the rest of the stay. Criticisms: * Gym is outdated and poorly equiped for anyone who regularly exercises. * Smoking areas are immediately outside main entraces to the condo buildings. You have to walk between the smoking benches to enter the buildings. * Wireless signal strength in new building (Daisy) is extremely weak.

I liked the points and extras they offered and ended up purchasing a timeshare here. We're planning to go to Europe and only owned 1 week, so with this purchase we're able to invest our money towards future trips instead of the money being gone after one visit to Paris and Italy. After one year since we've been there, we think it was a good deal/investment. Now we can go on vacation 3-4 times a year without throwing our money away. Only negative was that construction workers were very loud so we never slept in. They need to add dark shades/curtains in bedrooms, too! We're planning on returning to this resort in Aug.

We weren't looking to stay on the Vegas strip this time so that is one of the reasons we were fine with choosing the Grandview. We stayed in the 'Daisy' building which is their newest building right now. I guess they are planning to put up 13 more buildings in the next several years. They have a new parking garage next to the Daisy building so we never had a problem with finding a spot to park when we'd come back late at night. Anyways, the room was really nice, very modern & clean. The only noise we could hear through the walls was when our neighbors used the jacuzzi tub. However they have a courtesy sign next to the tub asking not to use the tub before 8am and after 10pm. So other than than we didn't hear anything. It looked like the maids came around everyday as well. We had a nice view of the Southpoint Casino right across the street. We really liked the Southpoint Casino, it was pretty big, very nice, and had a 24 hour restaurant which was very convenient. Anyways, back to Grandview. I was a little worried about some of the previous posts I'd read on Tripadvisor regarding being hassled with their timeshare presentations. They asked us once when we got their and since they said they'd give us $100 and/or show tickets for going to their 2 hour presentation we signed up for it. The presentation started at 10am and we got out of their at 12pm. Then they gave us our $100 and we were on our way. So if you have a couple hours to spare then this is pretty harmless and you can get some good show tickets or cash. We also did the Tahiti Village timeshare presentation which was 3 hours, however we got 2 Cirque Du Soleil show tickets as well as 2 tickets to the Madam Tussauds celebrity wax museum. So all in all we spent 5 hours for 2 different presentations and saved around $300 so it was worth if for us since we were on a tight budget. We also visited the Green Valley Ranch and ate at the Original House of Pancakes their, in which the food was really good! My husband had the Irish Omelet which was fantastic! They bake their omelets instead of frying them. Anyways, the GVR was nice, I'd probably recommend checking it out at least once. We also drove down to the new 'M' casino. This place is immaculate inside! So modern and swanky, just very nice! I heard they have a fabulous buffet, but I we didn't eat their. They took our $80 bucks on the slots in less than a 1/2 hour so we split. We heard it was a billion dollar casino, in which my hubby and I chuckled a little over that when we stepped on the front grassy area and saw that it was astro-turf. Oh well. Another thing we were trying to find was a casino that had Spanish 21 blackjack tables. I must have called around to 20+ casino's and none of them had it anymore. The Excalibur had 1 table but didn't have the match the dealer side bet option which is basically the only reason my hubby and I love to play that game. Also, we rented our car through Savmor which their name used to be under ACE. They were the cheapest we found and they never had a line like all the other places we saw. So I'd recommend them. So all in all I would definitely recommend staying at the Grandview, but you will want to rent a car if you plan on going further than the South point casino.

We were put in the Jasmine building in room 502B. This stay was part of a 22 night tour and was our last 4 nights in Vegas (our third time here). I booked the Grandview as it was something different from the usual Vegas hotel experience (having stayed previously at the Tropicana/ Ceasers/ Planet Hollywood and Signature), the rest of Vegas was very expensive for these nights and the fact that it had a full kitchen inc washer/ dryer was a big plus. We were aware how far it was from the strip (10 - 15 mins drive in moderate traffic) and that you really need a car to stay here. This didn't bother us and the fact that you can cross a small road to get to SouthPoint in under 5 mins walk is a great plus. The parking was not. Now, I had read that the parking was an issue and thought i'll take the chance. If you park before about 8.30pm at night you won't have any issues - after this you've got about a 10 min walk back to your building. It doesn't sound like much (especially after some of the walks we've had from hotel car parks i.e. Planet Hollywood) but you would think that someone would have factored in the number of rooms + off strip location = most rooms will have 1 car and have appropriate number of spaces available. But sadly no and it is a major pain, especially at 2am when you've come back from a show and are tired. Check in: We arrived 4 hours earlier than set check in time and were told we could have our room right away, the process overall was a bit lengthy but we were happy. We were then told we had to go to someone else to pick up our parking pass. Thankfully many people have mentioned previously this is where they pounce on you, trying to get you to go to the timeshare presentation. I politely declined this but the woman was very pushy and took a while to take the hint. The room itself was immaculately clean and had a good number of plates/ dishes etc. The decor is a bit blah and the paintings on the walls pretty awful but overall we were quite happy with both the bed and living areas. Also, as I mentioned we were away for 22 days so having a washer/ dryer was a great benefit before we headed off to LA and probably what swung us to book this place. So overall the bedroom/ kitchen and bathroom were very pleasant and we had no issues. The pool area was nice enough, pretty basic but clean with a nice view out to the new M Resort across the desert. The main issue we had was the noise. First of all we noticed that we were at the back of the Jasmine building which faces onto a new building being constructed, but when we arrived there was little noise. At 6am the next morning (after being out until 2am) we woke up to beeping/ crashing and clanking - general LOUD construction noise. I was unimpressed. Then came the noise from above and to the sides of us. Someone coughed in the next room, it felt like they were in our room. The people above us were obviously having a game of musical chairs - as they moved them so much (on tile floors) that we could hear every little creak. Also, each room has a jacuzzi, with a sign stating not to use before 8am or after 10pm, evidently there are a lot of people out there who can't read, as the noise from the jacuzzi itself and the water running through the pipes was unbelievable. We were glad only to be here for 4 nights and if the rest of Vegas hadn't been so expensive for the rest of our stay I think we would have moved. It's all just quite a shame as the complex isn't bad, it's very clean and the rooms are nice but it's been ruined due to the poor construction of the rooms and general layout.

First, because of an all day fiasco at the airport(unrelated to this review) we arrived at The Grandview at 1am on Saturday April 11th to find that there were no, I mean NO available parking spaces. When people on here said the parking was bad, I way underestimated the problem. It was raining and cold so my husband let me out at our building and went to park...over at Southpoint I think. I waited for him so we went to the room together. I have stayed at some amazing timeshare resorts, but was keeping an open mind since I have never been to Vegas. We were on the 9th floor of the Jasmine building. Upon entering the unit I thought everything was okay, a little small compared to others I have been to, but that was okay. I just wanted to get out of my wheelchair that I had been in since 7am Friday morning. Well, a good nights sleep was not to be had since there was NO WAY to even get into the bed. It was taller than me in my wheelchair so I couldn't transfer and so high that my husband could not lift me either. I called the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do and the manager would be in at 8am. So the first night in Vegas I spent my night in my wheelchair. On the next day I got no resolution with the manager on duty and decided to call RCI to see if we could be relocated to another resort. Only one could be found available in all of Las Vegas that said they had an accessible unit, so we went to see it. Again, RCI was lied to by the other resort. The doors were not even wide enough to get in the room! We went back to The Grandview where I spent yet another night in my wheelchair. On Easter Sunday the general manager of the resort was there and I got the opportunity to speak to him by phone. All he would say is that they were ADA compliant. I told him that wasn't true because the bed was not accessible and he just said that it was and he had never had any complaints from people in wheelchairs before, which we later found out was another lie. Anyways, my husband told him that he was taking the bed off the frame by any means possible so that the bed would be lower and so I could get some rest. This GM was very disrespectful to me as a guest at his resort. We did get the frame off the bed and it made it lower, but still a little high. Also, I had noticed in the kitchen that all of the lower cabinets were empty. I could not reach a cup, plate or bowl there. When I brought this up while talking to the GM he said that if I would have requested it before I got there they would have moved it down. Maybe he should think about the fact that this was supposed to be a wheelchair accessible unit..........shouldn't access to dishes be a given? Then, the final straw was the roll in shower. It was very small. Although I do understand the need of a disabled person to be able to roll into a shower, usually there is some sort of slope to keep the water inside and help direct waterflow to the drain. Not here! It was all flat. So guess what happened when my husband was helping me out of the shower.....he slipped and I injured my foot trying to get back in my chair. I will say that Vegas is a pretty place with all the mountains and beautiful sunrises, but the people there are not generally friendly to the disabled and have an \"I don't care\" attitude. The positives(which have nothing to do with The Grandview) are: The folks at Treasure Island are incredible! The valet had my wheelchair put together before my husband reached the trunk to retrieve it, and it is not an easy chair to figure out. Also, when one of my wheels popped off right outside TI, we went in and within 5 minutes, 3 men from the engineering department were fixing my wheel and got me going again. Thank you Treasure Island! At the Mirage, we saw the Secret Garden and the dolphins and it was a wonderful afternoon.

Staff was friendly and efficient. There was a separate check-in desk for owners, but we did not have to wait at all. Location The resort is located several miles south of The Strip. Depending on your purpose for visiting Las Vegas, that is either a major plus or minus. It is away from the congesting of the casinos. There is Southpoint Casino next door. But you do need a car to get other places, like grocery stores. We planned on and visited Hoover Dam, Death Valley and Red Rock Canyon, so the location was great for our purposes. It is also right next to I-15 so access to the highway is quick and easy. There is a free shuttle from the resort to/from Excalibur. It leaves and picks on every 2-3 hours. But you have to make reservations for specific times and space on the shuttle is limited. Not very convenient unless you know you are going to spend a set number of hours at The Strip. But if you have a car, parking at the casinos is available for free. Accommodation The resort is made up of several 12-story high-rise buildings. Several taller building are nearly finished. Parking was a bit tight although a parking deck is under construction. The suite design is a bit unusual. Two suites share a small locked foyer. After you unlock the foyer door, you have to use your key again to open your assigned suite. Not sure the benefit of this design over the traditional connecting door between suites. Our neighbor cooked a lot so we got to smell their food which gets trapped in that foyer. We never had a problem, but I can foresee a noisy neighbor coming in late, making a lot of noise in that foyer before entering their own suite. The room itself was very nice. Spacious. Furnishing are up-to-date and comfortable. Cabinets were made of particle board with laminate but adequate. We did not find any problems in the room. Walls are a little thin so we could near people talking from time to time. But because the resort is off The Strip, it probably kept the party crowd away, so we were never really bothered by noise. Wi-fi speed was excellent in the room but there is a fee ($10/day or $50/week). There is free computer use at the main office, but I understand that it can get a bit crowded. And there is no privacy--good to do quick email check or print boarding passes. There is a safe in the room. They ask if you are planning to use it when checking in, so they can charge you $10. We declined because we had not planned to use it. But my son, decided to check it out. We were not charged for its use, so I suppose it is on the honor system. Resort & Amenities There are 2 nice pools, one heated. In April, water was very cold in the unheated pool. Also 2 hot tubs. Poolside towel were provided. A deli is located by the pool for groceries and snacks. There is also an exercise room. Several gas grills are available, if you are so inclined. Timeshare Sales I read many negative reviews about Grandview's timeshare sales pitch so I was a bit weary when I checked-in. I already own lots of timeshare so I was not interested. They politely offered a 90 minute presentation upon check-in which we declined. They did not push it any further and never called our room to try to get us to attend. Only other sales pitch was that we got an \"invitation\" flier for free stuff if we attend a sales presentation. I suppose the nightmare begins when they do get you trapped. But if you really are not interested in purchasing any timeshare, don't bother going to the presentation just to save $50-100 on tickets. Probably not worth the headaches because it is the sales person's job to sell, sell, and sell! Summary All in all, we enjoyed our stay at Grandview.

That said, the rooms are very nice, comfortable and quiet. The two bedroom suites are mirror image one bedroom lockout units, actually a very good idea, and quite functional. If you're traveling with friends or family, each party has significant privacy if desired. Unless you have a pool side unit, forget about a view unless you enjoy parking lots and buildings...and a glimpse of the mountains in the very distant background. The main pool area is large, with many lounges and an unlimited supply of very nice pool towels. Again though, everywhere you get the feeling of austerity. There is a small snack shop and grill adjacent to the main pool area (but they only serve soft drinks). Almost forgot, wireless internet is available in your room for a \"hefty\" $9.95 per day (small weekly discount available), too much $$$ in my opinion. I looked at this as a BIG negative, since you have to pay even in the lobby area. Important note, the elevators are very fast...we experienced no long waits during our stay. We're not fans of high rise condos in general, but this one worked out quite well for us. It is located quite a ways south of the Strip on Las Vegas Blvd., BUT the Strip is very easily accessed via I-15, so location was not a problem for us. Besides, there is a large \"kid friendly\" casino (SouthPoint) located right next door. Besides having all the usual adult amenities, this casino has a multiplex movie theater, a huge bowling alley, a video arcade and a reasonably priced snack shop for affordable casual eating. It also has the usual offering of restaurants, from a Deli, a Buffet, etc., on up to the very pricey places we generally shy away from. One thing you should be aware of...it is a timeshare and you will be offered the opportunity to take a sales tour (yeah, I know, what a surprise!). This comes right at check in, when you go to get your parking pass. We actually took the tour and got $100 cash two show tickets for 20 bucks, not bad all-in-all.

On the morning of the third day, we spoke with hotel staff and were told that it was probably due to the fact that the hotel room had been vacant for quite a while and it was probably standing water in the pipes. They suggested that we run the taps which we had been doing the whole time that we had been there. It was so bad that I could not sleep in the bedroom at night and we bought room deodorizer to try and get rid of it. When we mentioned it during our checkout, we were given a small credit on our bill and were told that one of the managers would call us the next day.

Of course when I arrived and informed the staff that I was an owner they directed me to the \"VIP\" check in, the hostess was pleasant and tried to offer me some tickets if we \"toured\" the resort and I politely declined. During our stay there was no phone calls or pressure to attend one of their seminars which was a pleasant surprise since I have been to other time share resorts and they bombard you with calls from the moment you arrive but no, not here not at the Grandview. We were put in the Jasmine building which is what I was going to request for anyway since I had read that the building was the newest one. We were put in the 11th floor overlooking the construction of their newest building, which concerned me at first but since this was a long weekend (February 13-17) there was no construction going on as I was assured when I checked in. It was a great room, very very clean, the bed (a king-sized bed) was VERY comfy and cozy. The jacuzzi was a great treat especially after walking all day on the Strip or after our return from a beautiful day the Grand Canyon (we drove, highly recommend). The only one minor complaint is that the walls are thin so if you plan on partying you need to either be considerate of the other guests or you need to take your partying back to the strip.

Even at this stage, there was an abnormal amount of questions regarding our income, occupations etc which did unnerve us. We were told on the coach on the way over that we were going to have our own individual tour guides for the duration of the \"tour\" and we were under no obligation to buy anything. When we entered the property we were shortly called by our \" Tour Guide\". He showed us to some \"free\" breakfast where he waited impatiently for us to grab some food/drinks. He then led us to a table where we proceeded to sit for approx three hours and listen to a spiel on time sharing. We were annoyed as we were totally disillusioned by the whole thing. He claimed there was no obligation to buy but this was so far from the truth. Throughout his rant, he was extremely pushy and ignorant. He ignored and dismissed all of our questions and when we said no, he continued to push and push us, whilst at the same time insulting our lifestyle of which he knew nothing about. His starting asking price was $41,000 which he could not seem to understand when we explained that this was a huge amount of money and there was no way we could make a decision like this investment in the space of a few hours. We were pushed into a corner and it was absolutely horrible. It felt like we were targeted for superfiical reasons and in his mind, we were a sure thing. We both have a lot of patience and when we complimented the whole idea, informing him for the fifth or so time that were saving for a house as we are just married and there was no way we could afford this investment at this time, he turned nasty. At this time I insisted I didn't want to hear anymore. He then proceeded to bring over the manager who continued. I was fuming, although funnily enough the price was brought down to $13, 999 with again the crippling interest rate of 17.6%. Again we claimed we were not interested and got up to leave. Whilst collecting the free gifts, another attempt was made. This time it was brought down to $5000. I felt the whole experience was horrible. The sales manager was manipulative and sly and I would definitely warn people against going on this \"tour\". All we could think of was that some poor people get sucked into buying the shares at the original price of $41,000, which is just daylight robbery. The whole thing appears to be a SCAM!!!

The resort offered shuttle service to get to the Strip, which is only 5 miles away. We rented a car so we could shop (malls and groceries, including Wal-Mart market nearby) and didn\u2019t have trouble with parking. Check In We arrived at the resort at noon yet they had our suite ready for us. I asked for a room with a view and they gave us one facing the Strip (which is 5 miles away). We were directed to another person to get our parking pass. That person asked if we were interested in seeing a show. I said yes - she then said they would provide us with two tickets for the show we wanted for only $20 (the tickets would have cost us about $250) plus 2 $25 certificates for gambling. I told them emphatically that, if this was a timeshare presentation, we were NOT interested as we already have a timeshare. She insisted they just wanted to show us around the facility in hopes we'd tell our friends to come to their resort. We met for lunch (which was sandwiches, dessert and beverages) the next afternoon. It was supposed to take 90 minutes but took 3 hours! The young lady who took us around was very nice and we were very upfront with her about NOT being interested in purchasing another timeshare (although I will admit, that, had we NOT already owned one, we would have made the purchase). She said she understood but still wanted to show us around. Afterwards, it was the same as with any timeshare presentation - you say NO, they get their manager. After we said NO for the 3rd time, they said okay and directed to a man to give us our tickets. When we sat down with him, he gave us ANOTHER pitch! This is where my husband almost lost it! He said we just want our tickets! He directed us to another room where there were several \"We All Said No\" couples also waiting for their tickets. We finally got to someone, told them what date and show we wanted to see and had to wait for 15 minutes for confirmation that our tickets were available for that day. After approval, we were told to show up early that day to make sure we got the tickets we wanted (Criss Angel at the Luxor at 7PM on Tuesday). We got to the Luxor at noon on Tuesday and they told us no tickets were available. We had to go for Thursday and the tickets were for the furthest row of the theater (and we couldn't pay the difference to get better seats!) We took the tickets and certificates. Dining We were tired when we arrived so decided to try room service from Scotty\u2019s Bean, which was on-site. We ordered chicken wings \u2013 got 4 for $5.00 and they weren\u2019t fully cooked. We ended up spending $40 for 8 wings, a cheeseburger with fries and small salad and a Cobb salad and some smoothies (which were DELICIOUS!). For most dining after that, we opted for the South Point- very good restaurants with reasonable rates. Overall We would definitely stay here again! We just would make sure we didn't attend the presentation!", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pueblo, CO", "Title": "\u201cPerfect accomodation\u201d", "Author": "nanPueblo_CO", "ReviewID": "UR21501985", "Content": "A week at the Grandview was given to us as a gift to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary.

We were given a 2 Bed A-B unit. The 2 units that make up a 2 Bed \u201cA-B unit are the equivalent of two 1 Bedroom units. Each unit is huge with a TV in the living room and another in the Bedroom. Large Jacuzzi Tub, large shower and a 2-sink bathroom. Oodles of closet space and lost of drawers. The Grandview was equal to or exceeded all of our expectations. Check-In: When we arrived at Grandview, we discovered that Check-In was a breeze. (Don\u2019t forget to pickup the \u201cPARKING PERMIT\u2019 during check in.) We were in the \u201cJasmine\u201d building which is the newest building of the 5 or 6 buildings that make up Grandview. There are two more buildings under construction. Maintenance: On Sunday morning, we had a problem with the TV reception in the \u201cA\u201d unit on the Living Room TV, and called Maintenance. A man was at the door within 10 minutes and worked on the problem. Even though he had to make a few trips for parts he was determined. We left for our day\u2019s activities before he had completed his repairs, but gave him permission to enter and make his repairs. We left around 11 AM and returned around 9 PM and discovered that not only did the Living Room TV not work, but neither did the TV in the Bedroom, and the Bedroom Lights did not work. I again called Maintenance and again a man was there in short order. He worked on the electricity and called in another man to assist. It took them about an hour, but when they left the TV\u2019s in the Living Room, Bedroom, and all the Lights were working properly. On Monday morning around 8 AM another crew showed up to make the repairs. We advised them the repairs were made the night before. My thoughts are that Grandview responds promptly. Our electrical problem was out of the ordinary but they stayed on it until it was repaired properly and everything operated normally. We had no further problems of any kind. Parking I had read bad reviews of the Grandview regarding inadequate parking. Our experience was that there was not a parking problem. I reasoned that it was because we were in the end building, next to the new buildings under construction. All of the paving and parking areas are completed, but security fences block some of them off. We found that around our building there were always vacant parking spots, regardless of the time of day. I imagine that if I were staying in one of the buildings in the middle of the complex that there could be parking issues. Room service In the information packets we were given at check-in, we were informed that on the 4th day there would be room service. We were gone on the fourth day during the daytime, and it was obvious that there had been some cleaning, (garbage baskets, dishwasher, new towels, etc.) but the bedding was not changed. We rather expected that the bedding to be changed sometime during the week, but this was not the case. We ended up washing them in the Washer/Dryer in our unit. NO Pressure to attend sales meeting: During Check-In we were asked to attend a free breakfast to explain the future plans for Grandview. We were told this was not a sales presentation, but rather to have us come back to Grandview on our next visit to Las Vegas. We told them that we would decide later as for right now we just wanted to get settled. There was a flyer stuck in our door one day offering a free breakfast to attend an information session, but we never acknowledged it. There was NO pressure for us to attend anything of any kind whatsoever", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cGood stay!\u201d", "Author": "kitty_devile", "ReviewID": "UR21298742", "Content": "My husband and I got married in Vegas and decided to stay here for a week while we were in town.

If we were new visitors to Las Vegas, than staying on the strip would be the place to be...you want to be right in the middle of the action.

If you havent been to Grandview....DO NOT GO! The free gifts and \"sucker packages\" arent worth the headache, disrespect and overall attitude you will deal with from their staff and sales people. Remember people, there is NO SUCH THING as a free lunch! My husband and I were approached during our recent trip to Las Vegas by a very sweet lady offering free shows, dining credit or free gaming she explained that if we were willing to spend 2-3 hours touring a timeshare opportunity, we would, upon complimention be handsomely rewareded with upto $175.00 in free gaming, dining, or show credits...all we had to do was hand over $40.00 bucks cash and board a shuttle... Upon arriving at the Grandview Sales Center, we were ushered into a small room for a \"short\" presentation. They started off explaining that Grandview DID NOT participate in \"high pressure sales\" and that we were all under no pressure to purchase the timeshare...they were simply \"educating\" us for our own good. Although many things that the sales staff showed us made sense...my husband and I opted to not make an impulse purchase and enter into debt without spending time talking it over and looking further into things. Like many people, my husband and I never considered buying into a timeshare before arriving at Grandview...and weren't prepared to plop down $33,000 on a whim after spending only a brief amount of time on the actual property. Our decision was final...in our minds, at least. However, in complete contridiction to what they intially said, the Grandview Sales staff did not take \"NO\" for an answer. We tried, several times, to explain that we liked what was offered, however, we arent impluse purchase people...and wanted to mull it over. That we were not comfortable saying \"Yes, we'll pay $874.00 a month for the next three years....\". They kept pushing and pushing. Finally, after explaining no less than 4 times that we were not buying a timeshare \"RIGHT NOW\" we were ushered into a final room which is where things got really out of hand.... Up until this point, I can go along with the whole thing. The staff was doing their job, and I was standing my ground...they remained friendly and ergo I was doing my best to stay sweet and explain our position the best I could.... The last man we met, however, was the rudest most imcompetent man I have ever come in contact with. While he pitched us one last time, I went to say something...he stopped, looked at me and said \"Are you interupting me?\" I was flabberghasted. Interupted him? I was telling him no...and because thats not what he wanted to hear, he got [-] and offended me in such a way that words will never do it justice. My husband, who is genuinely a kind man and has the patience of a saint, really bristled at this out of line comment. The sales man asked \"if he had ruffled my feathers\" to which my husband said \"this is over...we're leaving\". As you can probably imagine, it was shocking, embarassing, and absolutely uncalled for. When you're considering or being asked to make a huge purchase (which I would absolutely consider a timeshare with a price tag in excess of $30,000 to be)...I think that you should be treated with kid gloves. On top of the incident above, when I tried to explain to him that we just purchased a house, and a car...we went on say that \"I understand, you don't have the money\"....which was an assumption on his part...and a wrong one to boot. Just because I choose not to spend money with him there doesn't mean I don't have it to spend elsewhere... Walking out of Grandview I was sick to my stomach. And I can promise you, if I decide to purchase a timeshare for my family...it will not be thru Grandview....", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "luvmyz", "ReviewID": "UR17876362", "Content": "We stayed at the Grandview 7/5/08 - 7/12/08 Our room was in the Iris Building.

Long story short, we liked what we saw and I returned May 30-June 6 with my mother and aunt to check out what we bought into. We arrived in Vegas around midnight and upon check in, it turned out that it was in my husbands name (although I had booked the reservation). They asked if they could contact him, which would have been 3 AM at home! The night manager was able to look up our ownership and everything was OK, except that the clerk helping me commented that my \"husband\" should really add me on....I OWN IT AS MUCH AS HIM!!! A little discriminatory, I thought. On to our room, it was exactly as the model suite had been. We had a ground floor room in Sage, at our request. Very close to the front desk, the pool, and the walkway to South Pointe. We were supplied with all of the amenities of home, which was great. I found the bed clean and comfortable, the apartment clean and well furnished, and the tub in the bedroom is a nice touch. My only complaint is the floors were dirty...I am not sure that it was the ceramic, I suspect it was the carpet, which looked in need of a good cleaning, or even replacement. I loved having a washer and dryer in my room, I went home with a suitcase of clean clothes! We didn't take great advantage of the kitchen, but if I was to return with my husband and children, I am sure that I would. Housekeeping came in mid week and changed the towels and garbage, you can have daily housekeeping at a charge. I found the pool area beautiful, and not packed like the strip hotel pools. My hope is that as they continue to build, they also build additional pool areas, because pools this size will not accomodate the projected growth of Grandview. I have read that parking is an issue, we didn't have a car, so I can't comment. I did inquire though, for future visits, and the gentleman at the desk that day told me that a parking garage is being built at the back of the property in the near future. We used the bus system (did not know about the South Point shuttle), and for $5 a day it is unlimited. Being so far from the strip, it is 45 mins - 1 hour to reach the strip. South Point - WONDERFUL. I left money in many strip casinos that week, but loved South Point. We could come home at a decent time and walk across the street to enjoy slots or bingo. They also have movies and bowling, which is great for families. I enjoyed both the lunch and dinner buffets, and also ate at the Coronado Cafe and the Sandwich shop, and all was good.

It was very, very clean and had every product you would need including dishwasher soap, razors, coffee etc... All included in the room price. It was fully furnished. All the comforts of home. It was a very comfortable home type atmosphere. It never felt like a hotel. The South Point Casino is next door and for my money its one of the best in Las Vegas. The pit bosses still actually comp the players! The Grandview is for a certain type of Vegas person. You cannot want to be on the \"Strip\". If thats the kind of action you want, go there because its definitely not at the Grandview. For those of us that try and avoid the \"Strip\" it is ideal. Very peaceful and very relaxing. You need a rental car to get around but I think a rental car is desirable anyway, particulariy if you want to go to the outlet mall, avoid taxi fares or go to the dam. We always make a pilgramage to the \"Strip\" once or twice and need the rental for that too. Its a great value. Just don' t expect a 5 star hotel. You will have to do a few things for yourself.... like carry your luggage from the parking lot to your room. However, once settled in, you will love it so long as you are not a \"strip\" junkie.

We couldn't believe we found a brand new, one bedroom, nicely furnished, clean, spacious, modern condo for just $70 a night. We are used to staying on the strip (Ceasar's, Bellagio) but now that we know about Grandview, I think we'd stay there from now on. Despite other reviews that described difficulties at check in, we had no problems. Per others' reviews, we were prepared to have to sit in on the timeshare schpiel, but no one ever approached us about that. We even got the free parking pass with no problem. We checked in within 10 minutes and got a room immediately. Positives: big space, modern furnishings, clean, big glass shower, two sinks and lots of bathroom storage space, jetted tub, washer and dryer with detergent, full kitchen, full living room with dining table, king-size bed in separate bedroom. Also, we found the casino across the street, South Point, to be terrific! It's got a great deli with fresh bagels, hot grill and fresh pizzas, open early a.m. to 10-11pm. And, jaded as we are about expensive tables on the strip, South Point had $5 tables all the time, plus no crowds, and it's brand new and clean (the croupiers were a little rough under the collar, but it provided lots of color to our gambling). That casino also has a bowling alley, movie theater. Negatives: all the reviewers who spoke of the hot tubs being used in the middle of the night were absolutely right: sure enough, our first night at around 3 a.m., we were woken up by banging, clanking and sounds of water and jets from one of our neighbors using their hot tub. The walls are very thin, and obviously, no one obeys the signs requesting hot tub use only from 10 am - 8 pm. Also, the bed was not the most comfortable, but not terrible; the sheets and blankets are polyester. No one came in to clean daily, so either ask for more bath towels at check in or use the 4 you're given sparingly. Last negative: parking. Arriving back at the hotel around 11pm-12am, you'd find zero parking spots. Cars were nudged into any space they could find. Another warning: there's a whole new condo building under construction now, so once that's populated, the parking will really be a nightmare. There are also pools and scheduled activities/parties, but we didn't get to attend those. We liked this place because it gave us a relaxing, quiet and very comfortable feeling away from the hubub and crowds (and prices) on the strip.

Yes there is normal wear on some of the furniture but none of it looked ratty. It was quite nice. We had all the amenities needed. Only had to ask for more towels. Knew from reading this before hand that parking could be a problem, but we found plenty in the back of the building so never had an issue. Also from reading previous reviews we were aware that running the water in the jacuzzi is loud, it is!. and that moving the dining room chairs across the floor can be pretty noisy. Being on the top floor because we smoke, we had no problems with any noise above us and were careful to just lift the chair or move it quietly so as not to cause to much noise for anyone below us. I was worried that the blinds in the bedroom would not be dark enough for us to fall asleep at night, but we were always so tired that it did not matter! Renting a car is a good idea, and we had no problems driving up or down the strip. I just was not too happy with the poor lighting on the south strip at night. Never have had good night vision and it was a challenge at times to figure out the right lane would suddenly become a right turn only lane! I would say that if you are a first timer to Vegas, staying on the strip is a real treat. But having been before it did not bother us and we actually did spend more time at the SouthPoint. Although not the fanciest casino, it is not too bad. Ate quick sandwiches at the Del Mar Deli which were very good. The desert selection looked very yummy as well. Also had a couple of meals at the Cafe Coronado there and the food was quite good. Excellent Chinese food there! We had the lunch buffet at the Bellagio. I think the buffet at Paris is better.

We were offered the timeshare tour at Grandview and decided not to do it...no pressure. All timeshares try to get you to tour their facility..they are in the business of selling units. This was our first timeshare stay in the US....we usually go to St. Maarten or Aruba. We were surprised that no one came into the room the entire week. You could call to get a change of towels or wash your own. Each unit has a washer and dryer.

The villas are very nice...we did a timeshare exchange within RCI to book this place and it is rated a Gold Crown resort-and i think it is a doing a pretty good job of that...although we also own a Westin timeshare that is really what i would consider 5 star! Overall our experience was good but there were a few things that could have made it even better... -children's activities list was not updated and there was confusion day to day as to what was going on and when -the resort claims to have an RCI office on site and they do have a space with an RCI sign on it but no one from RCI was ever there (not a big deal if you are not an RCI member but i was hoping to get to talk to someone just to ask some questions) -the complaints about parking on some of the other reviews were not experienced by us...we actually found no problem with the parking -there was construction going on right next to us-while this did not affect us during the weekends, mon-fri, we were awakened to the sounds of construction. -this is really picky i know but their towels were awful-they kinted all over the place...very annoying when you wear anything black! -the livingroom curtains has the \"hotel\" shades so that even when it is daylight you can make it feel like night...for some reason, they didn't put these in for the bedroom and alot of light comes through-because all they have are blinds in the room...we were facing the I-15 freeway and there is a huge neon sign advertising the casino next door that we just could't block the light....it was fine for me but my husband needs complete darkness to sleep!

The buffets at the South point Casino next door are pretty good for the price...although i doubt you would want to go more than twice! :) The resort does try to get you to come in for a timeshare presentation and when we declined they were fine about it....they tried one more time but that was it. The pool area is nice and for this time of year it accomodated everyone that wanted to be there...as it gets warmer--i think it may seem a little small. it would have been nice if the little market next to the pool would allow you to put things on your room bill-same thing with the kids activities...they all want you to pay separately...just need to make sure you always have money with you!

There is simply not enough resort parking for the guests who have cars to park. They know this and have started a major expansion for their guests.

My son wandered around and found a cart, pushed it towards the entrance door of our building, we saw no helpful disabibilty type ramps on the way. We rode the elevator up to the 7th floor, checked out our facilities for our week long stay. Clean enough, no problems. We noticed that the shower stall step which is low enough to get in/out of but we also saw that there is no safety type of grab bar (a violation of the ADA), no type of sitting stools in the stall, no shelves to hold shampoo, hair conditioner, shaving equipment, or soap. Everything has to be placed on the floor. Thank God, the floor wasn\u2019t slippery when wet. Later that evening, my son and his future wife had to take a cab back to the airport to rent a van for transporting all of us for the week long stay. The first night, he had to park the van in front of the lobby where we checked in because there were no parking spots anywhere near our building. The next morning we noticed just about three parking spaces for the handicapped in the doorway of our building. I am the only person attending that brought along my handicap display card from Wisconsin. There are approximately 12 floors with at least 10 or more rooms on each floor per building, with five such buildings. The construction noise was apparent because they are in the midst of expanding for more buildings on the grounds. We were given a guest card upon check-in to be placed on our rented vehicle windshield for security purposes. On one day alone, I counted at least six vehicles, taking up valuable parking spaces for paying guests at the resort. I was with the Wedding party most of the time in the van, my wife, son and future daughter-in-law never got a handicap space all the time we were there. During our week stay we had the opportunity to speak with other guests we had invited to my son\u2019s Wedding. At least seven other families and some individuals stayed at the same location and in different buildings. Everyone of them had the same type of comments concerning the shower stalls, noise, the lack of handicap parking spots in the facilities. Many of us had seen the abuse of automobiles, trucks and vans without the guest cards on the dashboards throughout the week. Where\u2019s the security? Unauthorized vehicles should have been towed away to make room for those paying guests. Some of the employees were very nice people and offered help whenever we requested. I feel that there is a need for the lack of safety measures to be looked at and disabled parking spots should be increased in number. As I stated, I never did see any type of ramp for wheelchairs on the grounds. After calling RCI on 3/7/08 to register my comments, I got the name of the contact person who is Tamara Valerio \u2013 Administrator of the resort. I called her on 3/8/08 at just about 10:15 a.m. \u2013 CST. As of yet \u2013 3/9/08 at 11::00 a.m.- I have received no reply.

I am a Starwood owner and I guess I have been spoiled by the Heavenly Beds that they have at their properties. Parking was fine each night we arrived back to our room and most nights we got back to the resort not earlier than 10 pm.

That is the positive side of things.Upon check in they make you go to a 2nd staff member(salesperson) for a \"parking pass.\" Here they try to get you to sign up for the time share breakfast presentation under the ruse they will give you 1/2 off tickets to certain shows. When I told her we were set for our show tickets she turned nasty and rude to me. We were out to Las Vegas with our 2 young children to visit friends and the area. Every night we returned to our building there was not 1 parking space in the ENTIRE complex of approx. 6 high-rise buildings. My husband would have to drop me and my sleeping kids off at our building and walk in approx. 1/4 mile from the closest parking spot. My kids were upset and crying that he had to walk so far and alone in the dark. I truly believe they are too worried about selling time shares than accomodating the guests that they have. The location of this resort makes it nearly a necessity to have a car to get anywhere. The resort takes an occasional trip to 1 specified place daily, but no shuttle other than that. I also phoned in ahead to make sure the pool was heated as i was told it was. When my excited kids got to the pool, it was frigid, dirty and had tree branches lying in the bottom of it. My best part of our entire trip was when we left the resort for 2 days and drove to San Diego and stayed in wonderful accomodations. The staff here just stared at everyone when you went in to complain about the parking situation. It was every single night, not just one exceptionally busy time. Our unit also overlooked the construction site where even more building is taking place where they can't accomodate parking. Upon checkout, no one asks you how your stay was-they truly don't want to know. I did read the reviews ahead ot time and should have listened- I figured how bad could it be for free?

Last time we stayed in The Cliffs at Peace Canyon via an RCI exchange, this time we figured we'd try its newer sister resort, Grandview at Las Vegas. We were not disappointed. Check in was quite easy. However, we weren't impressed with the immediate attempt to get you to attend a presentation. With our situation, we had gotten there later, we were tired from the flights, we were hungry and had grocery shopping ahead of us yet (so we would have something in the condo to eat the next morning), our luggage didn't make the connection and hadn't arrived yet, and we had a screaming, exhausted baby to boot. They should really wait at least a day until people are settled in properly to try their pitch. It's only courteous. They try to lure you in with a free bottle of wine. Take it at your own risk. They're pretty good once you say no; they don't twist your arm like most places do. Even if you're owners at another resort, they'll still try to upgrade you somehow from what you already own. It doesn't matter to them one way or another. The condo itself was very nice. The TV didn't work properly; they were on it. The DVD player didn't read our DVD's at all; they got us a new one in 15 minutes. They have a crew of people around the resort with walkie-talkies, like cops on the beat, that respond to problem calls around the clock. Now THAT'S service! The other problems we experienced were minor. There is not exactly a lack of parking. Rather, it's just other guests parking in front of your building. At night when you get back from your activities, you may have to drive a little further from your building to find parking, and then walk a little, be it through the pool area or wherever to get between the buildings to get to your building. There is still enough parking for everyone, it's just spread out everywhere. We thought the kitchen could have used more utensils - if you have a larger family, you will not have enough bowls, plates, utensils, etc. to get you through the day without having to hand wash them once (and we go on vacation to try to get away from doing that if at all possible). And there were no balconies on these buildings. We missed having a balcony. This is a big thing that the Cliffs at Peace Canyon has over this place. The accounts of the units and pictures are accurate - this is a very nice place to stay. South Point next door is very handy - the buffets were half the price than anything you'll find on the Strip, and they were better (made the Grand Buffet at the MGM a total rip-off! Stay off the Strip if you want value for your dining!!). And yes, we were very impressed with our daughter on her very first trip. She travelled very well and sat through the shows extremely well. She even looked like she was enjoying them!! I generally wouldn't recommend bringing young kids to Vegas, but if you do, there are many shows and attractions that they will enjoy.

Check in was a breeze with no hassle about the time share presentation ( It probably helped that we checked in at midnight).

The room itself was clean and well appointed, great big tub for two, double shower and tasteful decoration. As for noise from neighboring units, there was none. We did the time share presentation midweek and it was worth it for the freebies. They do a hard sell so be prepared but be polite. Transportation turned out to be no big deal, we caught a CLS shuttle at the airport for eight bucks a piece round trip and made it to the Grandview in 15 minutes. We set out the next day on the CAT, Vegas' mass transit system. Caught the 117 between Grandview and South Point and rode to the South Transfer Station. It takes about 45 minutes to get there but there are ample opportunities along the way to pick up groceries, liquor and it stops at the Vegas Outlet Mall. From the transfer station it's a short ride on the Deuce, the double decker busses, to the strip. We traversed the entire strip from Mandalay Bay to Fremont Street over the course of the week. The Deuce stops at every attraction along the way and a five dollar day pass covers all mass transit throughout the city. We used the CAT system to hit the Zappos outlet on Maryland and rode that route to the downtown station to catch the Deuce back again. We ended up catching the bus to the airport which is a ten minute ride on the109 from the south transit station.

In general, it was a great place to stay. The resort is composed of several high-rise towers (about 13 stories high). Most of the the rooms are lockout connecting rooms, so if you are two families, you can stay next to each other. At the time we stayed there, there were 4 towers in operation, and another was being built. I understand more are to be built in the future. We stayed in room 708A of the Sage building, which overlooked the pool area and which is the closest building to the main desk building. While some people have commented on paper thin walls, we did not hear anything from any nearby rooms. However, because of the tiled floors in the dining and kitchen areas, the movement of chairs on the floor above us could be heard at times, and was rather loud. But since we spent most of the time outside the resort, it was not a real problem for us. I would recommend taking along one of those white noise generators for sleeping - we have one an take it with us on every trip; it completely blocks out all external noises and allows us to get a good night's sleep. The resort is relatively new and clean. We were very pleased with our accommodation. The staff were friendly, but not that helpful when it came to assisting with outside events.. for example, we had wanted to see 'the bone yard', which required advance reservations, and the staff refused to get involved for us. There appeared to be a lot of staff in the main lobby, however, most were sales people, aggressively trying to sell us a unit. And I do mean aggressively! If you have no intention of buying, avoid them at all costs. Vegas, like other real estate in the country, is on the downswing, thanks in part the subprime mortgage crisis. While there is a lot of expansion in Vegas, property values are low right now, and it is difficult to unload a timeshare there. Speaking of expansion, my GPS was practically useless there.. many of the newly developed areas were not on my GPS maps. Gives you an idea how fast Vegas is growing. The living room has a large TV, although it is a CRT, not the newer flat panel screens. Same in the bedroom. Lots of cable channels to choose from. The kitchen is well equipped with all the expected appliances and utensils. There is even a garburator in the sink. The resort supplied complimentary coffee for our coffee machine. The main bedroom is also large, with a good firm queen size bed, and lots of storage space. Just off the bedroom, and between the washroom, is a Jacuzzi tub. Lots of hot water was available. The washroom is large, with two wash sinks and lots of counter top space. Also storage drawers and cupboards under the sinks. A hairdryer is included on the wall. The shower stall was large, almost twice the size of a normal shower stall, and had glass walls and door. All lights in the unit were compact fluorescents that even worked in 3-level intensity. Unfortunately, the worst lit room was the kitchen, which has rather dim pot lamps in the ceiling. Each unit has individual heating and air-conditioning controls. And each unit also has a clothes washer and dryer \u2013 very handy! Although we were told the resort was fully occupied for the week, we saw very few people. The temperatures were low.. about 2C at night, and 10C during the day - so it was definitively not the type of weather to sit out by the pool. They did have two hot tubs outside in the pool area, but the water was more luke warm than hot. We chose to use the hot tub in the room instead. At poolside, there is a small deli/convenience store, which is open most of the day. There is also an indoor gym/workout room next to the deli, however I have nothing to say about it since we did not use it. The resort is located about 6 miles south of the main strip. A car is highly recommended. They did have a shuttle bus that could take you up to the strip, but it cost about $8 per person per day,. There is also a city bus that runs down to the resort area, but you need to transfer to another bus once you get to the strip area. There is also a shuttle running to and from the strip from the SouthPoint Casino across the street. Speaking of car rentals, there is a new central car rental area for the airport, and it is run very efficiently. A common shuttle bus runs from it to the airport and back. All the major car rental companies are in the same building, which is located south of the airport away from the heavy traffic of the strip. Renting a car there and driving down to the Grandview is just a few minutes. Between the airport and the Grandview on Las Vegas Boulevard, there are a number of places to eat, as well as a large Food For Less store for groceries and other items, as well as a well stocked Discount Liquor store. There is a Las Vegas information building directly across the street from the new car rental building. However, it appeared to have very little 'information', and seemed to be more of a sales agent building to get you to buy timeshares. Anytime they ask if you are married or how long you are in town, beware! Our friends came up the answer, \"Yes, we are married, but not to each other.\" That seemed to turn off the sales agents! The best information building I found in Vegas is across the street from the Convention Centre (at Paradise and Convention Drive), located on the west side under the walkway over Paradise. The whole area around the Grandview is newly built up, including the large SouthPoint Casino/Hotel directly across the street. It is about a one minute walk from the Grandview.. great for gambling and loading up on the free drinks, since you don't have to drive back. And being a casino off the main strip, the minimum bet on most tables is just $5.. not 15 or 25 like many of the large casinos on the strip. The SouthPoint also has a great breakfast and dinner buffet at very reasonable prices. While the Grandview advertises wireless internet in every room, there is a charge, and it is not cheap. About $8 a day, or $50 for the week. They do have free internet terminals in the activity room off the main lobby, but there are only 3 terminals and they tend to be rather busy most of the time, despite a timer on each one that limits usage to 20 minutes per session. There are also a couple of Ethernet jacks in this room, so you can bring your notebook down there and connect for free (bring an Ethernet cable with you!) The resort complex appears to be fairly secure; at night the buildings are well lit and locked down, and your need your room key to enter the building. I saw security personnel patrolling the grounds. Despite this, I saw one incident of a car break-in one morning - the car window was smashed and the police were taking a statement from the owner. I decided to not keep my GPS or anything of value in the car overnight. In summary, we found our stay at the Grandview very pleasant. It was away from the main strip, yet close enough for us to get to easily.

They are all newer buildings with very nice one bedroom apartments. The units are in pairs and can be combined into two bedroom units for larger families. The weird thing is that there is one hallway door, then two doors inside a small foyer, each one leading to a unit. If you're utilizing both units, you can leave the inside doors open and only open and close the door to the hallway. However, if you're alone or a small family and are only using one unit as I always do, you have to open two doors with your key to get into your unit each time and it gets old, especially if you're carrying things. The units themselves are large, quiet and clean with brand new furnishings and appliances, nice sized kitchen, and a large jetted tub off the bedroom. The king size beds are firm and comfortable, although the foam pillows are so thick that your neck might hurt in the morning. Maid service is typical for a timeshare - once per week with a midweek towel replacement and trash emptying. Haven't used the pool or hot tub, but I've heard other guests say they were clean and the hot tub was nice and hot. The small food/refreshment store isn't open very late, but it's adequate. I recommend going to the Food 4 Less just a bit north on Las Vegas Blvd. and stocking up your kitchen. Two tips: first, when checking in, they send you to a another counter for your parking pass and to try to sign you up for a sales pitch.

Also sadly we could smell cigarette smoke on our non-smoking floor. Our neighbors next door were smoking in their room daily & the smoke was seaping into our room.

While this property is basically an RCI timeshare it is offered on many of the standard travel sites and can be booked just like any other hotel. Which makes me wonder why anyone would pay a large up front price for a timeshare unit and then have the annual maintenance fees only to be locked into the timeshare restrictions of dates and durations of visits? Anyhow the bottom line is that I sort of like this place and I think most people that stay here will also if they are prepared to deal with the location which is about six miles south of the main strip action. The rooms are really the best part of the resort. Each one bedroom unit is a well equipped apartment, in fact they are larger than some one bedroom apartments that I am familiar with in Southern California. Each unit has a well equipped kitchen, a washer and dryer in the unit, a king bed in the bedroom and a queen sized sofa bed in the living room. There is a large bathroom with a shower and a Jacuzzi just off the bedroom. The two bedroom units are an exact duplication of the one bedroom units with all the same equipment and amenities. In fact they are completely separate units with separate entries which is ideal for two couples, but may provide too much isolation for parents wanting to keep a close reign on smaller children \u2013 teenagers would love it. There are also two large screen TVs in each unit with a DVD player attached to the living room set. The resort has a selection of DVDs that they lend out at no charge to the guests. There are two nice pools (one heated) and a small deli on site. There is no restaurant; however, there are several options at the South Point casino right next door as well as another restaurant, the Boulevard Grille, across the street. They now have wireless in all the buildings, but I consider it very expensive. They want $10 per day, $25 for 3 days and $50 for the week. They do still have the public computers in the lobby which I was able to use about anytime that I wanted although others have mentioned having a problem with access to these. They no longer have FREE wireless in the lobby as they did in the past. Most people will probably want to rent a car; however, we did not and got along just fine by allowing the extra time required for public transportation. If you drive in from California the new exit ramp from I-15 is now open and is very convenient to The Grandview. Cab fare from the airport will cost you about $25. There is a shuttle service (CLS) that we used for the trip back that will take you to the airport for $8 per person. You have to schedule it 24 hours in advance and allow a couple of hours before your flight and this works out great. We saw several people use this throughout the week. They were right on time and only made one more stop prior to going to the airport. Took us about 25 minutes total. During our stay we used the South Strip Trolley which picks up right at the Grandview and you can transfer to the Main Strip Trolley at Mandalay Bay. This requires planning and allowing extra time as they are not always on schedule, but we got along fine. They have a strange fare schedule that requires you to buy a Day Pass for use between 8:30AM and 5:00PM and a Night Pass to use between 5:00PM and midnight which is sort of screwy if you want to go to the Strip at 3 PM and come back at 8 PM you have to buy 2 passes. But they are only $4.25 each and they allow you unlimited use of the trolleys on all the routes during the time that they are valid. They do have one way passes, but they are only for one trip and do not provide transfers to other trolleys. Along with the transportation issue there are a couple of other things that you might want to consider about The Grandview. For instance, there is still construction going on not only at Grandview, but also at the casino next door, South Point. This can be noisy, in some locations although during both of our stays we have been fairly close to the construction area and have not been disturbed too much by it. You just have to take your chances and asked to be moved if it is a problem for you. Also some reviews have complained about the exterior lighting being a problem in illuminating the units at night. Again this hasn\u2019t bothered us mainly due to the location of the units that we have stayed in. It appears that the exterior lights that are the culprits are mounted just below the 4th floor and the 4th and 5th floor rooms probably get the worst of it. The buildings do look nice all lit up, but give us a break and turn off the decorative exterior lights at 11PM. There were several planned activities every day, mainly for the kids. While I am a strong proponent of NOT taking kids to Vegas, if you insist then this is a good place. You are away from the strip and there seems to be enough activities to keep the youngest ones entertained. Teenagers will be hopping the trolley to the strip anyway so don\u2019t worry about them they will make there own entertainment. For the smaller children there is also information on child care facilities in the area. So if the kids have to come this resort should work out better than most as you have a lot of room and there are things for them to do either supervised by you or someone you hire. One other thing that we really liked about the Grandview was with the South Point casino right next door we had lots of dining and gambling choices without the hustle and bustle of the strip; so a couple of days we didn\u2019t even leave the area. We ate at the buffet which was not outstanding, but a good variety and inexpensive. The Silverado steakhouse also serves a good meal at about half the price that you would pay on the strip. It was really nice to have your own casino with lots of friendly people and machines that would take your money and you could walk back to your room in 5 minutes \u2013 it takes me longer than that in some of the mega resorts on the strip when your room is in the same building. The bottom line is if you don\u2019t have to be in the heart of the action on the strip and want a large comfortable place with lots of amenities and a friendly staff the Grandview should suit your needs just fine.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "maria817", "ReviewID": "UR10617894", "Content": "We own a 1 bedroom unit at the Grandview and I must say it's worth every penny.

The decor is very nice and it comes with a full kitchen and a dining room and living room. We really like the jetted tub. It has a washer and dryer, too.

They were a bit concerned about the pullout bed but they found it to be supportive and comfortable. We never really heard any of the noise that most people did complain about. We actually thought we didnt have any neighbors but we did see them a few times in the hall and they had a small child with them and grandparents. If you are concerned about the noise just bring a pair of earplugs to sleep with, we did but never used them. Renting a car is a must, and much easier to get around than we thought. All the casinos have valet parking which is quick and free and saves your feet. Just tip $2-$3 when your car is brought back safe and sound. The fastest way to the strip is ti just take the I-15 around the back of the casinos and then just turn on to the connecting street that you want. On the Memorial day long weekend it only took us 5-7 minutes to the strip and about 10-15 to downtown. The southpoint casino is very nice next door. It has lower limits and is less crowded than the strip casinos. Dont miss the graveyard specials at the restaurant there. My wife took in a hot stone massage at the spa there and was quite pleased. Anyway, we have stayed at the Bellagio, Mirage, MGM, and Ny Ny before and this stay was just as good. The full kitchen allowed us to keep some leftovers and make breakfast or have drinks or snacks available. The key to making this stay as good as the strip is the renting of a car, fast and easy to the strip and can relax away from it if you want.

We never bothered with any timeshare tours; in fact, we never even came into contact with any staff except at check-in. We got to choose the newest tower (Iris building) and had a unit on the 12th floor. The lady who checked us in said if we weren't happy with the room, we could gladly check into another one without a problem. We never did move as again, we didn't experience any of that crazy noise that was mentioned in some reviews. Yes, walls may be a little thin but given that the parking lot was always so full, the building was still so quiet even though we always bumped into a lot of people in the elevators. And speaking of elevators, even though there were only 2, the longest we ever had to wait for one was a minute. The washer/dryer is perfect and the pool was a nice place to cool off in that hot oven weather. If there was a fitness center, we didn't try it. You can bring your laptop and sit in the lobby while you surf the net or you can use the free PC's they have in their internet room. If you do decide to stay here, as many have mentioned, it is quite a ways to the Strip so rent a car if the Strip is more your thing. Otherwise, South Point is perfect for your gambling, bowling, arcade, movies, eating needs -- all of that just a few steps away!

The unit was roomy and we loved the big jacuzzi tub. It was so nice to be able to see mountains from our window (we live in Manhattan and are used to seeing traffic and buildings). The bed was comfy and we didn't have any problems with noise. The barbeque area outside was great, we used it a lot, although it seemed like there could have been more outside space given the intended size of the resort. The pools were fine. For the first few days only one was open and so it was pretty crowded and noisy, but after the other one opened all the adults sort of gravitated towards one pool and the children were in the other, so that worked out well. The casino across the street was great! It is really RIGHT across the street, I thought we were going to have to cross Las Vegas Blvd. to get to it, but it's just across a small side road. It was fun to go over there and not have to go all the way to the strip. The only problem we really had with the resort was our own fault, we went to the timeshare presentation. It was over TWO hours and the guy trying to sell to us was overly aggressive and insulting. We received good tickets for enduring the presentation, but honestly, it was such a waste of time and a negative experience that I don't think it was worth it. My advice would be to avoid putting yourself through this. A couple other little things, first, you had to pay cash for everything, at the front desk and at the deli by the pool, which was annoying, but I guess to be expected since it's not a hotel. The room furniture was SUPER heavy and not the most comfortable to actually use. The table was a big round sheet of glass that wasn't connected to the base and I was constantly afraid of breaking it. The staff was odd. They were really friendly most of the time, but there were a couple of times when it was difficult to deal with them. We were trying to find out about the trolley and we asked someone at the front desk about it, he laughed and then said, yeah, I'd get a cab. Umm, okay, thanks buddy. I had to repeatedly ask him until he finally, grudgingly, gave me a schedule.

We were never told about going on a tour and since we were owners at one of their resorts in Florida, we were not required to take one - however, we had to fight with the \"customer service\" people there about it, who claimed they would charge us for the room if we did not take a tour. They eventually figured it out and we did not go & did not pay. We arrived on a VERY windy night and after taking a great while checking in (after paying $25 for a cab since there is no airport shuttle), the person who checked us in did not correctly access our entrance cards, so after hauling all our luggage ourselves to an entirely different building, against the wind, we got to the building and couldn't get in. One of us had to go back to get correct access to the cards. The rooms were nice, not the most comfy furntiture, but it sufficed. The lighting in the bathroom stinks and there were no shelves in the shower for shampoo or anything. The jacuzzi tub was nice, but very loud. We had questions about transportation and were assured no problems before our arrival. Trying to get information from any of the people at the front desk was a complete joke. None of them have a clue about anything! When I called to ask about the Trolley schedule, a lady asked me if I had the schedule. DUH! It is supposed to run every 30 minutes but it doesn't & instead of being picked up at the front, the Trolley stop is in front of a different building without shelter & in the middle of a parking lot. The bus only runs out there once per hour, & although there are plenty of bus stops getting to it from the strip, there aren't any for a long way going towards the strip. We did a LOT of walking. If you think you don't need a car - you're wrong! We ended up renting one on the 3rd day we were there. They boast how convenient that is as the front desk - just call and they'll be there. We requested a rental and were told it would be there at 10:00 AM. Well, they forgot to call, so at 11:00, someone was there to pick us up to take us to a rental place. We got back with the car at 3:00 PM - totally wasting half a day. Rent one from the airport and all will be fine! The people at the front desk didn't even know about restaurants in the next casino or where a grocery store was. FYI - there is a 7-11 and some other little grocery store about 1 mile north, & a larger one further north & only one restaurant is open next door late. The buffet there was fabulous though (the Southpoint Casino) - so much to choose from & cheaper than those on the strip. If you stay at the Grandview - it is nice and they certainly leave you alone because there is no service there, but be prepared with your own transportation.

If this casino were not here, I would not have enjoyed the stay at all. CONS: 1) With the tile floors comes noise from dining chairs next to, above and below the room. 2) Not alot of insulation between rooms. Could hear people on both sides when talking on phones. Could hear water running, but that's not a really big deal. 3) Muzak in lobby and around pool is SO loud! I don't understand why... 4) Shuttle situation is poor! This is perhaps the worst part of the place. There is a grocery shuttle 1 time per day and they only let 1 person per room go unless there is room. There is no shuttle from airport. It is approximately $20 from the Grandview to Mandalay Bay, so getting the trolley pass is best bet. HOWEVER, the trolley is supposed to run on the 1/2 hour, but was late almost every time we took it. Sometimes people had waited an hour to get it. A place of this caliber and price should have shuttles to the grocery store more than once a day (and at noon, at that!) and should have some other options. IF YOU GO: Rent a car...if nothing else, just to get you around the grocery store, outlet center and to the strip. However the lot is totally full and then some in the evenings. Cab from airport is about $20-25. Bring a fan or something for white noise if you are a light sleeper. Overall, I give my trip a 7.

Night time in the units are a different story. The walls are paper thin and you can hear every little step the neighbors next to you are doing. In our case, we had a crying child. The curtains are fairly thin, so all the security lights from outside shined right into our windows. We also had the most uncomfortable bed ever. We actually found that the pull out bed was more comfortable. Although, this may just be an opinion. As far as the unit's amenities, I was quite upset to find that there was no ashtrays (even though we're not smokers), no batteries in the remotes, no coffee pot, and the washing machine and blender were broken. Even with several calls to the front desk, the only thing that was resolved was a coffee pot arriving days later by a gentleman that didn't speak English and couldn't answer any other questions I had. There was a very strange setup with the dressers as well. We found ourselves hanging things in the family/living room next to the television because the entertainment unit is also part of a 6-drawer dresser and closet...very bizarre if you ask me. There is only one place to get food on site - it is a little cafe next to the pool. The food there was horrible...absolutely horrible. I ordered a sandwich one day - terrible. Later in the week, I was SO hungry, I broke down, went over there, and ordered a salad. Who can screw up a salad? They can...trust me. Even the front desk recommended not going there. We didn't feel being on the strip was necessary, but to get there, you should get a car. Although trolleys are supplied pretty frequently, we didn't use them. Cabs are pretty expensive to get to the main strip - mainly because of heavy traffic. However, even renting a car found us looking for places to park - which most hotels have free valet. However, right next door is 'South Coast'. They have unbelievable restaurants and personnel (although somewhat expensive). All their slots were between a penny and quarter slots. Their high roller room was between $1 and $20 slots. I don't know about you, but this hit my budget just perfectly. The last thing I can say about this place was how I couldn't get internet in the rooms. They say you can, but I had to go down the front desk area to get any sort of signal. I was so cramped, I actually ended up spilling my soda on my laptop and ended up having to use their computers anyway. Please make sure you don't need to do any sort of work that involves anything sort of concentration or lengthy attention because the computers are set to restart every 15 minutes along with the fact that you have tours going on every 20 seconds. It was quite disturbing to hear 'And this is our internet room, but who works on vacation' 500 times in a matter of a few minutes...not to mention the fact that I basically became a tour staple.

There are two small pools with more than enough chairs for sunbathing. On Mondays there is a welcome meeting with free juice, coffee, and breakfast goodies. The internet room was usually always full, but people respected the 15 minute limit on the computers. The shuttle was great, there really was no need to rent a car. Even though there are two shuttles as it gets later into the night, we found that they were full and people went to wait in line almost 1/2 hour ahead of time. This was frustrating but it is very easy to pick up a cab to bring you back. Always keep some extra money handy in case this problem occurs. On a tight budget, we bought our tickets to shows at the 1/2 price ticket store. The first one on the strip is in a giant coke bottle. We went to a magic show and to the show called Splash. Splash was a good variety show and highly recommended. Check out was easy, and we booked a cab to bring us to the airport and he was already waiting for us with his trunk open when we got to the lobby. Cab fare to/from the airport is about $22. All in all, a great find, a bit further away from all the hustle and bustle, but in a relaxing and new setting which will definitely be buzzing with business very shortly.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "georgia", "Title": "\u201cI FELL IN LOVE\u201d", "Author": "trinarose", "ReviewID": "UR5604969", "Content": "I just LOVED,LOVED,LOVED, my stay at the GRANDVIEW AT LAS VEGAS.

I wanted to originally stay closer to the action but knew I was renting a car so I booked Grandview. I was pleased! I read a lot of the reviews on TA and I was unsure if I was going to ever get any sleep since a lot of reviews talked about the construction noise. I heard nothing. We stayed on the 5th floor in the Sage Building. The room was very clean except for the carpet which had a few stains but I only looked at them 1 time while I was there. The couch however is HARD AS A ROCK so be prepared. Our internet worked fine and for printing I went over to the computer room and used the free computers there. No one ever called or approached us about any timeshare presentations. I bet it was because we already had a timeshare with RCI. I will say though that we stayed in NYC using our points and were hounded everyday to attend a presentation. The room like I said was very clean and the kitchen was nice so we did not have to eat out for every meal. The bed was comfortable and the AC worked great! One tip with the sleeping, in the bedroom there are only blinds no curtains so the sun shines in which is a drag. Luckily I read that information from another review writer so I asked for another blanket and hung the blanket over the window with some binder clips I brought with me. LOL! It worked like a charm and we slept like Kings!! I will give you another tip which other reviewers were so right about. The noise from other rooms, I swear there has to be no insulation between the floors of these rooms as I heard the neighbor above us every time they got up from the kitchen table. I was prepared for that while we were sleeping as I brought a fan to drown out all of that noise. There are no ceiling fans so if you like a fan...take one with you. Any time we needed towels I just called and they were brought over within 20 mins with the exception of 1 time that they never came but I had enough anyways. The parking is tough at night. You can never park close to your building. As far as the strip, yes it was about a 7-8 min drive but as long as you have a car you have nothing to worry about. Valet the car at one of the central casinos and you are in the heart of it all. I would recommend Grandview as it was a good experience overall and I would stay there again. We went to see the show KA and it was pretty good. You have to keep up or you can not tell what is going on. As far as food... we went to Mesa Grill which is the Bobby Flay restaurant in Caesar\u2019s it was wonderful. Roy's off the strip was amazing as well! We also went to Envy to dine which was in the Renaissance Hotel which is just off the strip, which was so fantastic as well!!! Besides being hot as haydee\u2019s in July my 31st birthday was a great time!!", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGrand Time at the Grandview\u201d", "Author": "CGV222", "ReviewID": "UR5529995", "Content": "I stayed at the Grandview with my family in May of 2006.

The staff were all very friendly. The Grandview is on the extreme South end of the Strip so we rented a car and it worked out quite well. We liked being able to go the the Strip and then be able to get away from it when we were ready. Righ next door is the newly built South Coast Casino the has all tha gambling you want as well as cheap meals. The walk in shower is huge and our only complaint (and it's a minor one) is there are no shelves or anywhere to set anything in the shower.

So, I thought I was getting a great deal because I was able to get a suite for $129.00 a night over the weekend which is unheard of in Vegas. Thursday night I had stayed at the Venetian and then came to the Grandview in the afternoon. I am not a timeshare owner, simply stayed as a guest through an orbitz reservation. I found it quite suprising to find a timeshare on there renting out like a hotel, but I think I understand why now. - Check-in was great, I checked in early at 2pm and they accomidated me without delay and got me in the room, sent me over to the timeshare area where I decided to sign up for the \"lecture\" and get a free stay in the future. I regret to say this was the highligh of my stay. - Decoration: I do not know who did the decorating but the paint is horrible. It is this dark mustard color and there are no curtains around the windows or any other decorations. I felt like i was at a motel 6 or something. When we entered the room it was nice and clean. - The Pool: Around 3pm we decided to go down to the pool. Before going down we phoned the front desk to inquire whether or not we needed to bring towels and we were informed there were towels down there. When we arrived no towels to be found. When we asked a nice lady who was taking around Otter Pops to all the guests in the pool we were told you had to come down by 2pm to get a towel because the man with the towels leaves after that. That is quite inconvienent since the pool is open from 8am-12midnight. It was quite a ways back to our room so we decided to forget the towels. The pools were rather small and shallow, deepest part 4ft. But lets address the real problem the WATER. The water was as salty as the ocean from all the body sweat and not a trace of chlorine. We were so discusted we decided to get out and return to our room to shower. - The Room:The walls are VERY thin and if you are a light sleeper like myself forget getting in a nap during the day. Also the beds were quite hard and the pillows uncomfortable. It would also be nice if the toilet were more private. Other than those problems no complaints with the room itself - The Timeshare: So we went to the timeshare presentation which for anyone who has gone to one you know how it is. After we explained that we were not interested in purchasing the timeshare for various reasons, mostly we just weren't impressed with the property, they cont. to try to win us over by lowering the price to less than $5000, which I will come back to later. - Problems: there are only 2 elevators in each tower one of the 2 in our tower broke so there was one elevator for 12 floors of guests and no stairs to be found anywhere. Supposedly there are 2 shuttles to go two and fro the strip, one of which broke down so now you could only go once an hour instead of every 30 minutes and most of the time it ran 10-30 late some more like once every 90 minutes. A cab ride will cost you about $20. The handicap doors came off the hindge and was not accessable. Well as I said before I did attend the timeshare presentation and did receive an invite to come back and stay for free for 2 nights. I will be forfieting this offer as I do not wish to return to this resort even for free As for those thinking about purchasing this Timeshare, please, PLEASE try it out to make sure this is what you want. As for myself, there were too many things that were quite suspicious: 1. offered like a regular hotel through the internet 2. Sales must be hurting if they will lower the price by half in order to make a sale after prviously telling you the resort is selling so well they only have 8 units left that they can offer. 3. This is a brand new resort and equipment should not be breaking so soon 4. If they cannot transport people efficently to and from the strip they will loose a lot of business from people. Again to each his/her own, but for me this place is definetly a disappointment to timeshares.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, IN", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice...Too Far from the Strip\u201d", "Author": "tikibuilt", "ReviewID": "UR5381077", "Content": "The wife and I went out for a quick, three night stay at the Grandview in June.

It was a little dragged out for us, we sit through those from time to time and this one went for 2.5hrs. The comp wasn't that good either, we had to pay $20 to get the Carrot Top show tickets.

My biggest complaints were: the distance from the strip (5 miles from Mandalay Bay), the lack of wireless in the room and the horrible parking. As much as it is nice to be away from the crowds around the strip, it is very far away from anything. You definitely need a car to get to and fro. They do have a shuttle but we didn't want to get stuck late after the bus stopped running or be faced with a full bus and have to take a taxi back to the hotel. We stayed Memorial Day weekend and the strip was a zoo. Friends at a strip hotel complained about the noise there. I was happy to return to the very quiet Grandview. The parking is terrible. They didn't plan enough spots and it's hard to find a spot near the building. It wasn\u2019t just the holiday weekend as I ended up back there for a day 2 weeks later and the parking was no better. It may be petty but you would think that in new construction you would put wifi in the rooms. There was wifi in the hotel lobby (which didn't work one day) and a computer room off the lobby but I would rather not check email or do business in a crowded room like a lobby which always seemed to be teeming with loud and bubbly timeshare salespeople and their prey. The positives: QUIET! No casino. If you want a casino there is a big casino hotel right next door. The buffet here is good and cheap (no, not an oxymoron) Big rooms. Comfortable bed. Great glass shower. Even better Jacuzzi tub. Typically well equipped timeshare kitchen and in-room laundry. The pool looked nice but we didn\u2019t use it.

There was also a complimentary shuttle that I took to the Tropicana one day with no problems. The internet room was popular and each guest was limited to use for 15 min.
