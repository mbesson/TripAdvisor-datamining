We arrived there and it was a nightmare. The rooms were dark and did not smell good. Also the neighborhood was scary!....so I decided to call this place because I had previously worked for a Comfort Inn in San Mateo, CA. From the moment I spoke to the front desk girl, I had a feeling this place was going to be better. I persuaded my dad to cancel our reservation at Motel 6 and we drove to this place and we loved this place from the moment we entered the parking lot. We paid $89 instead of $50 but it was worth it. This place was a life saver.

As I was near the main road and not the freeway, I heard less noise and had a comfortable sleep. Although the nightmare began when I checked out, they had taken my payment through on the night I left, as they do, my flight was 6 or 7 in the morning and I had left quite early, on arrival to the airport I looked through my bag and discovered that I had left my Ipod back at the hotel. When I had called the desk clerk and told him about my problem, he did not seem so bothered, refused to co-operate by saying he could not leave the desk for 2 mins. I finally asked a friend to pick it up for me in the afternoon and send it by mail for me, on arrival they had informed her that they would not give it to her on the grounds that I did not pay for my last night there. They had not informed me of this information and gave my friend grief about this, refusing to give my personal belongings and holding it as a down payment.

Checking in, the young lady was really nice and gave me everything I needed. The room was small, and suited my needs. The fridge in the room did not work, though... and I'm not really sure the A/C worked very well either. Over all, though, it wasn't bad. In walking about the grounds, I noticed that some of the area looked a bit run down. The blinds in the housekeeping area were mangled, and quite visible for any of the guests walking by. That wasn't terribly attractive. The grounds were clean and pleasant, but \"tight\" because of the small space. Everything seems a bit cramped, including the walkways. This hotel is literally wedged between to 101 freeway and Ventura Blvd -- and that means lots of road noise. This really is the type of place you go when you just need a place to sleep -- so if noise bothers you, bring earplugs. For me, though, the worst of the experience was the next morning. While I was getting dressed, the phone kept ringing and ringing. I picked it up a few times to find a dial tone. This continued for about 30 minutes... random ringing. When I mentioned it to the guy at the front desk, he was pretty rude about it, blowing me off. He said, \"All calls come though here, lady, and there haven't been any. Are you sure you aren't hearing things?\" Yeah, that went over well. It's a good thing I was on my out and didn't want to deal with it. Breakfast was okay. Apparently, they've recently expanded their breakfast buffet to include hot bacon and eggs. The bacon was fine... but the eggs? YUCK! They are cooked from discs of salty yellow goo. Blech. The price was okay, considering that most rooms in this area (during summer) tend to be pretty high, but I've certainly been in much nicer hotels for less. However, it's a nice place and the rooms are clean and have just about anything you'd need (hairdryer, iron/ironing board. microwave, fridge (if it works), etc. The free breakfast was okay, but avoid the nuked egg patties.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corvallis, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cunprofessional staff with a horrible attitude.\u201d", "Author": "lindalou555", "ReviewID": "UR87944968", "Content": "Durring our stay I will say that the rooms were very clean.

Positives (or Neutral) : * Unusually firm mattress * Refrigerator in room next size up from tiny * Microwave in room * Swimming pool that's larger than what you'd expect in such a small motel. * Although the room is small, the decor is neutral and pleasant. * My partner found the breakfast acceptable. It included: 2 kinds of cereal, waffles, muffins, toast, 2 kinds of juice, and coffee. And now the negatives which greatly outweighed the positives for me: * Dirty bathroom with many hairs on the floor. Yuck. * Shower water temperature varied wildly from hot to cold. * No cold water in the bathroom faucet. My partner and I had to quickly wash our hands before the water completely warmed up, or we would have been scalded. A child could have easily been scalded. * VERY LOUD. We were in room 210, two rooms away from the Dennys which shares the parking lot. I was kept up in the middle of the night (3:30 to after 4 am) by people blasting car radio and having loud conversations in the parking lot.
