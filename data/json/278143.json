We were trying to balance our trip with higher end hotels in places where we were staying more nights and cheaper, more basic lodgings when only a one night stay was required. First off, yes, this hotel is in the middle of a race track. That didn't bother us. We never heard any noise or had any race-day complications. The grounds are decent, about what you would expect from basic accommodations. The turtle pool and outdoor areas were quaint. Our main issue was with the housekeeping staff. We placed a do not disturb sign on the door even though we intended to depart for a drive back to San Juan at about 8-9am. At approximately 6am, there was loud banging on our door. Due to the hour, we thought it must have been some sort of mistake, and we tried to ignore it given we had placed the do not disturb sign. The banging stopped, only to resume again about an hour later. My husband got up to see what the problem was, and spoke with a handy person who was about to start mowing the lawn, explaining that we did not need anything and it was hours until check-out. At this point, we were awake so I headed to the shower as he went to check out breakfast options. During my shower, I could hear constant, repetitive bangs on the door as if someone was using a battering ram to try to gain entrance to the room. Upon my husband's return, we literally grabbed our things and fled. I finished my make-up in the car because we were certain that we would be given no peace for the rest of the time we were there. Upon checking out, the person at the front desk stated that housekeeping had been trying to get in touch with us because they weren't sure whether we had ever checked in or not. This seemed strange to us since we had placed the sign on the door and we had clearly spoken to staff the day before and the person mowing the lawn earlier that morning. It also seemed strange that someone from the front desk would not have simply called the room with the working phone. We were practically the only guests at the hotel that night. There were maybe 2 other cars in the lot both when we arrived and when we departed. During our entire stay, walking around the courtyard and the pool, we never saw another guest. Our best guess was that housekeeping wanted into the one room they would have to clean so that they could move on with their day. This made our stay nearly intolerable. The room itself was basic. Fairly clean. No major problems. But we would not go back due to the lack of hospitality of some of the staff.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, California", "Title": "\u201cTried again, disappointed\u201d", "Author": "DandDTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR117716715", "Content": "I was on a five-day cross-island trip with my oldest daughter, and chose to stay here because I was familiar with the hotel, having stayed here the year before on a similar trip with my younger daughter. (I used Choice Hotel points for this stay, as I had the year before.) I had read negative reviews before the first stay and felt that stay was better than expected, so I gave it a three. However, this time I had reasonable expectations - and was let down. Three items: 1) no hot water; 2) broken shower head: 3) no TV remote in room. When I told the front desk in the evening there was no hot water, they said it was being fixed soon. There was still no hot water for morning showers; I told the front desk, and they said it had been fixed; maybe the temperature I got was as warm as it gets. Since I wasn't in the shower that long, the broken shower head wasn't as big of an issue if I had wanted to take a nice, long shower. Strange, but last year there was no TV remote in the room. Since the front desk was closed when I noticed, one of the night security guards brought me one. Two pluses - guest laundry that worked; good breakfast. The only downside to the breakfast was a dog that hung outside the room, trying to get in when guests went in or out. The front desk didn't hand out cans of Off as they did last year, but that was OK, since there was only one mosquito in the room - and I think I killed it! There was a race going on, but you couldn't tell from inside our room on the garden side of the hotel. While I used points for this stay, next time I will try another hotel in town - and use either points or cash. One nice thing about this hotel is the garden area - which has a turtle pond and setting for photos.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGet away\u201d", "Author": "bigrig207", "ReviewID": "UR116590866", "Content": "The hotel is right in the middle of a race track.

It is a short 5 minute drive into Ponce where there is everything your heart could desire.

The Hotel Rates might be attractive, cheap, but is a dumpster! You get what you pay for I guess. My husband, 5 year old son and I stayed at this hotel from Dec.31, 2007 through January 2, 2008. First of all, this hotel is located in a town that is the hottest in temperature all year long in Puerto Rico. During our stay it was above 90 F daily, with tons of mosquitoes flying all around you and chewing you up at the same time. The room they gave had a clog bath tub, mildew all over the bathroom. We informed the hotel about this situation and it was until the night before we left, at 10:00 pm that they moved us to another room after the toilet also clogged and the AC was not working at all. After 11:00 pm there is nobody at the front desk in case you need help with anything. There is only one security guard in the entire hotel doing rounds during the entire night, nobody else. We got chew up by bed bugs as well, in both rooms we stayed. The continental breakfast they give is terrible, compare to other hotels. When there is not enough people in the room where they served it they don't turn the AC on so anybody that is having breakfast there have to get ready to sweat, because you have no other option. I mind, and this are only few things that had happened to us during our stay. If I describe everything I will never finish this review.
