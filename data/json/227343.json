The place has become a tourist mecca with all the commercial trappings that you would expect. But, when you are staying at the Hyatt Beach House Resort, you have the closest thing I can imagine of what it used to be like. The room's size and furnishings are superb. The suite is well insulated for sound and the kitchen is fully stocked for cooking (you really want to do that while you're on vacation???) as well as for margarita making! The building arrangement allows each suite to have a scenic view. Having a heated pool, hot tub, small beach, and Tiki bar all within reach of each other allows you to spend hours relaxing on site. The only down-side is the close proximity to US Route 1 which seems to have traffic flowing 22 hours a day.

I find myself down there every night, but during the day one needs a nice beach. That is where this resort starts. A private beach, something quite rare on Key West. The Beach goes right into the pool area, which is again very relaxing. Ask for buildings A or F, but do not be disappointed with the others(we stayed in B12 and B23). Also ask for the third level, as the view is better. I traveled with my in-laws and we had two couple and two singles in the party. We ended up getting two units and each couple had the suite, while each single stayed in the guest queen room. The room isn't huge, but are adequate. The kitchens worked well for breakfasts, lunches, and one dinner. The most underrated part of the place is the screened in porch. I don't know if either party actually closed the patio doors at night, because you didn't worry about critters. The master suite is huge, nice whirlpool and shower.

This was our second trip to Key West in recent years and included our children ages 17 and 14. On our previous trip to Key West, we stayed at the Hyatt Windward Point which is located about a mile and a half from the Hyatt Beach House. Upon checking in, our location was in the D wing which is nearest the resort office. The view from the screen patio was rather limited as we could basically see the back of the office and the walkway leading to the pool. After unpacking our bags, we noticed that the unit had not been properly cleaned before our arrival. We made a couple of visits to the front desk to bring this to their attention and they offered us a room in the A wing, which had a much better view as it was closer to the sand and water. I would say the rooms at the resort are just average, but the grounds are very nice if you are looking to relax near the pool and the sand. The area rug in our unit was fairly dirty, and it was apparent that the tile flooring had not been thouroughly cleaned in quite some time. That being said, we enjoyed eating meals on the screen porch and the beds were fairly comfortable. It was also nice having a washer and dryer in the unit. A few comparisons based on our previous stay at Windward Pointe. If you are looking for a nicer room, I would give Windward Pointe the edge. If you are looking for relaxation near the pool, I would give the Beach House the nod. The pool area at Windward Pointe is nice, but the traffic from A1A runs right next to the pool area. The only sand at Windward Pointe is confined to the beach volleyball court and there is a sea wall on the other side of A1A. The man-made beach at the Beach House was located between the water and the pool. It covers a large area and you are able to walk directly from the sand into the pool. The lounge chairs on the beach were incredibly comfortable and there was no traffic noise. There was also less air traffic to contend with at the Beach House. Windward Pointe is located next to the airport. There wasn't a lot of activity at the resort, but that was fine with us. We were able to drive 5-10 minutes to Duval St. if we wanted to check out the shops and restaurants. One note if you head downtown -- take some change with you. We received a $25 parking ticket at 11:33 P.M. Key West apparently monitors its meters until midnight. The Hyatt Beach House is a great place to stay if you are looking for some relaxation away from the craziness of Duval St. and downtown Key West. If you are traveling to Key West to experience the bar scene, you will likely wish to be located closer to the Duval St. area.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Round Rock, Texas", "Title": "\u201cbest resort we ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "maxyin", "ReviewID": "UR122148095", "Content": "We stayed three nights at this location in Dec 2011.

The room was clean upon check - in, something we sometimes have an issue with in Key West. The staff was friendly and helpful. We brought a kayak with us and they even help us secure the kayak. We thought they had a kayak rack, but they no longer have the rack. They locked the kayak up for us in a store room. We eventually purchases a bicyle lock and locked it to bike rack. We did use the kayak, it was easily launched from their small beach. It is shallow and perfect for kayaking, they are surronded by mangroves and it was great to kayak in the mornings. They also have a dock and our son went fishing several times right from the dock. Several people caught snapper from the dock and the fishing seemed decent. There is also a Tiki Hut with water sport rentals and also a bar with food. You can also store, dock and launch a small boat. The hotel does have trailer parking for small to mid-sized boats. It did not appear to have any specific policy for docking of boats. The room was a 1100 square foot, 2 bedrrom, 2 bath unit. It had an enclosed balcony that was very pleasant to have breakfast and to enjoy reading a book. I was missing a few items in the kitchen, a non-stick frying pan and then a deep baking dish for a turkey. They front desk brought all items to our room with a quick phone call. This is a self catering location, they did a mid-week clean with a towel and sheet change. They do have daily housekeeping for a fee, but it is really not needed. The only thing I wish they had on site is a work out room. You can use the one at the Hyatt hotel downtown, but it also is very small and not really worth the trouble of going down there. We did not have much trouble driving down to Duval or to the marina for dinner or excursions. You can also rent bikes for the day or the entire week. This would also be an accpetable means of travel.

There are 3 main (chain) grocery stores on the island all within 1mile of each other,Public,Albertsons and Winn Dixie.We shopped mainly at Albertson's as the prices were close to our prices at home.Beer and wine are available there and there is a liquor store 2 doors down for anything they don't have.These are located 1-2 miles from the resort. The one thing we would not do again is Lloyds Bicycle trip,pretty boring and rode for over 2 hrs with no offer of a water,and the price of $35 is way too much.At best should be a $20/pp trip. As for beaches,there are not many,2 near the airport have nice sand but were supposed to be closed to swimmers due to bacteria(noticed a few people in water but not many).We did go to Fort Zachary Taylor state park(admission $2/pp) and it was quite nice.We would wear water socks if we went back as the sand is very coarse and it is rocky for about 2-3 feet into the water.It seemed like this is where most of the locals went.We did try to snorkel but visibilty was poor on the day we were there.Very nice picnic and shady areas here great for families.

The small pier was a great place to view gorgeous sunsets. The pool was very relaxing, but extremely shallow. We probably should know by now not to assume a sofa bed will be decent, and this one was worthless with a saggy, springy, torn mattress. I am a stickler for cleanliness, considering the property was over 200. per night, and the floor was dirty with long hairs all over it. It took 2 attempts to get housekeeping to bring a working vacuum and the idea of them not having vacuumed properly in the 1st place gave me the creeps.

We ultimately picked Beach House for the man-made beach, being directly on the water and lagoon style pool. Although the rooms are slightly dated, the property was quaint and intimate and kept the authentic feeling of \"old key west\". Although their is no real beach, you can swim in the bay right off of the dock and you have a beautiful view at sunset. The manmade beach with the comfy beach beds were a nice treat and the zero entry pool was a hit with kids. The grills are all propane and maintained very well - although we never used them, we saw several families cooking dinner while watching the sun set. Although the property claims wireless internet, it is extremely slow, so plan on being hardwired if you need to do any work. Our ethernet cable was broken in our room and they did not have a replacement, but it wasn't a major problem considering we were on vacation and didn't really need internet access. Our A/C did break the last night and hotel management moved us to another room while still allowing us to keep all of our stuff in our original room since we were moving out in the morning. The property is about 15 minutes from Duvall but with a young daughter, we appreciated being able to get away from the crowds in the evenings. If traveling with small children, get off of Duval before 7pm. We did tour the other two properties. Wynward Pointe is the newest and although the interiors are much nicer, it felt a little sterile - we could have been anywhere. They do have a great ocean view but you have to cross the road to get to the ocean and even then it is not a \"beach\". You would have to bike or drive about 2 miles down to get to Smathers Beach. The other property, Sunset Harbour, was the original Hyatt Vacation club - and although the location is perfect for adults wanting to enjoy the town, shopping, bars and dining, the property is extremely antiquated. We did visit the Hyatt hotel at the Marina and it was beautiful. Definitely go by for a drink at happy hour (2 for 1) and dinner at Shor was very nice (beautiful sunset). If my husband and I were traveling by ourselves, we would probably stay at this property (staying within the Hyatt family) - however with children - staying at Beach House with the full kitchen, only 72 units, and great pool is the way to go.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSnobby staff, old buildings, loud grounds, no maintenance, out of the way timeshare\u201d", "Author": "Wanderlustprof", "ReviewID": "UR115199644", "Content": "Imagine if you will, arriving at your hotel to find a staff that is too busy to actually care for guests.

There were two drawbacks: One was that the front desk clerks were not very personable and seemed inconvenienced whenever we asked a question, although they were civil. The other drawback is the hotel is very far away from Duval Street, so you have to have a car to enjoy the restaurants and other attractions on the South end of the island. The young lady (originally from Ukraine) that tends the Tiki bar makes up for the attitude of the front desk clerks. No matter who in our party of 8 (male or female) asked her for anything ranging from a fresh pool towel to a frozen drink, she left us smiling.

Painters worked every day to touch up and the pool and hot tub couldn't be better maintained. We were fortunate to have been given a 3rd floor room in building A (first one near the water, which has a great view of the bay and good sunset views)(if you have a Hyatt reward status card, flash that at sign-in as it seems to be a help). Try for an upper floor room for the water views. There is a small 'beach bar' where you can get beers, wine and weak mixed drinks (we were told it's because of the type of liquor license they have), so best to bring your own grog to the pool. There is a sandy area that leads to the 'beach' (a small patch leading to the bay). If you've never come to Key West (like us) you'll be surprised at how little real beach area there is on this island. So dont think \"aruba\" when you think KW beaches. They try to preserve whatever beach front they have by leaving the mangroves in place to prevent beach erosion. Therefore there are lots of plantings on this property; the pix on their web site are accurate representations. You'll spend your time in and by the pool. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Rooms are large with a huge master bath (we had a 2-bedroom and slept 5 including the pull-out sofa). Older TVs (DVDs are not blue ray) so come prepared with older DVDs. Free wireless internet has a great strong signal. Security is good, and as in any place, stash your stuff in the in-room safe (its big enough for 2 laptops plus handbags etc) and you wont be inviting problems. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Tuesdays are Margarita Party day with free drinks. Ample lounge chair supply (we were here during spring break and never had a problem getting 4 chairs together). No water sports at this location, so you'll need to contract with one of the many places closer to town for jet skis etc. which people used to get back here by water. Yes this is out of town, but there aren't too many really nice timeshares in town and believe me, after 3 days on Duval Street you'll be ready to escape the craziness. It takes about 10 minutes to drive to town with no traffic. Parking is ample at this resort but not in town. So when you drive to town just cruise up and down Southard or Fleming Streets (around Elizabeth) looking for parking spaces open to all (some are for residents only). You'll park 5 or 6 blocks off of Duval but you won't pay anything and it's a 5-10 minute walk to Duval or the Front street area. Since the resort is on Rt 1. it's simple to go north to Marathon (about 45 minutes) and other keys for a visit. Downsides to this place is that it doesn't have a 'convenience shop' where you can buy crisis items like milk or PAM. But the Publix and Albertsons are about a 3-5 minutes drive. There's no onsite restaurnat or snack bar and there is no onsite fitness center. If you want a morning paper be sure you get to the honor box before 8AM because the earlly risers snatch them up fast!

I can't say enough positive things about the Hyatt Beach House Resort. Everyone was very friendly as soon as we walked in the door. We were able to check in early, thankfully, since we'd been traveling for such a long time. The condo was large enough for my husband & I, and our 3 kids ( ages 4, 10, & 13 ). The kitchen area was well stocked ( a grocery store just down the street ). The rooms were clean. Housekeeping was quick to bring us any extras we required. The BBQ area was great for preparing the main course for dinners. Having a washer/dryer in the room was perfect! We liked the location as well. We are just far enough from Duval St. and the downtown so that we had peace and quiet. However, we were only a short drive from all of the attractions Key West has to offer. A lot of people complain about the \"beach area\" not really being a beach. If you ask me, it's just right when you have young children to tend to. There's plenty of sand for making castles, & you don't have to worry about the possible hazards of having young children at the ocean. Best of all, the pool is perfect for kids of all ages. I was able to sit in the water, comfortably, with my 4 year old while she splashed around. Both of us felt very safe with this set up. My older kids were in the \"deep\" end and I was close enough to keep an eye on them as well. (They have beach towels available too. Less to pack! ) My only wish is that the vacation lasted longer! Key West is by far the best place to just sit back an RELAX and Hyatt Beach House Resort is the perfect place to hang you hat while in the Keys!", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay but bored on the island.\u201d", "Author": "BeachLovers07", "ReviewID": "UR67227828", "Content": "Went to the Hyatt Beach House Resort in Key West May 2010. We rented a convertible in Miami, drove through the keys, which was fun, and arrived at the resort. It's a great place to stay if you are looking for peace and quiet and not much to do. It's a low-key relaxing resort that's super small and doesn't offer much to do. If that's what you are looking for, than this is the place for you. There's nothing to criticize really about the resort, other than the small tv's and furniture in the rooms (very used). There was also no swim bar or restaurant on site. Each room offers a screened deck, which is GREAT. We used this every night/morning. We also enjoyed the huge jacuzzi tubs in the master bedroom and grilled a lot of fresh fish/peelneat shrimp from the local store. As far as Key West is concerned, we weren't that impressed. The nice part about the island is no matter where you stay, everything is convenient due to the size of the island. However, I would stay close to Duval St. if I had the choice just due to the fact that this is the only thing to really do on the island. Duval St. offers nice shopping and great restaurants. But the beaches/water were a huge disappointment and there's seriously nothing to do here unless you like to fish, which there are a ton of charter's to do so. I wouldn't pay the $200 to snorkel here either. One of the locals who ran a snorkel charter said if you've snorkeled the Virgin Islands, this would be a waste of money, which we have. If you have traveled to several beaches all over the Caribbean, you'd be disappointed coming here. Save your money and hit the Virgin Islands...WAY better, nicer, more to do, greater scenery, and the beaches are amazing, as is the sailing, snorkeling, etc. Key West doesn't offer much. Wouldn't go back unless all I want to do is sit around or drink all week.

Not as nice as some of the other Hyatts, say the Windward Point, or Aspen, but it is clean and quite comfortable. The furnishings and beds were very nice and comfortable. All the amenities you need are there. We asked for and got a high chair and later found out if we even wanted an ice tea maker we could get one of those too. But, the NOISE. We have a second floor unit. Every time the sliding door to the patio above or below was opened you heard it. When the pocket door on the bathroom was closed, and the light/ fan turned on, you hear it. When the guy upstairs uses the bathroom you hear it. When the jacuzzi tub is turned on, you hear it.

The trees need to be kept trimmed. Other than that it's a nice room. The property itself is a bit lacking as well. You can tell that because the Windward Point is the sales center that's where the money goes. Lots of shady chairs with umbrellas, a pergola with shade cloth, a very nice snack bar, and music all at the pool. At the Beach House shade is lacking. More umbrellas are needed. Not all of us are sun lovers but we do like to sit by the pool. And a pergola over the sand where the kids like to play. It was so hot my grandson cried when he stepped on the hot sand. No music at the Beach House and the chickie hut seemed to be an after thought. I'd also think twice before purchasing the shuttle pass. We paid for a full week, $125.

Another complain,Internet is a RIP OFF, I paid $30 for 4 days and the server went down every 20 mins. I called the \"I-Hotel\" internet provider at least 10 times over the 4 days and they kept saying the issue was on the Hotel side, not on their side. The guys at the hotel had no idea what i was talking about but said they would speak with the \"internet guy\". Few hours after Internet worked. Each time I had to call and report the issue, I didnt complain too much but on the 4th day I asked to have extra time to make up for the time I paid and could not use, they said they could not do that. I spoke with another customer in the hotel and he said he had the same issue. Think twice before you consider to pay for internet here.

We bought a two bedroom unit (sleeps six) when it was still being developed around ten years ago and purchased the Premium week of Christmas. We had three kids and vacations can get pretty pricey so it seemed like a great idea. We looked forward to our trip for about the first five years. After that we have actually forfeited our week and have let the points expire (there goes about a grand) because it is such a hassle to go through the machinations of rescheduling anything that makes sense. The hoops you have to jump through to reschedule any week but your own and the Resorts International nightmare maze is just not to be believed. After the initial purchase costs were finally paid (somewhere in the neighborhood of 20k and that took till my kids all grew up), the yearly maintenance fee has grown to become ridiculous (approx. $1000.00). Yet the rooms are worn, the appliances and furniture are only replaced if something is unusable and it doesn't look like there will be modern upgrades to be incorporated any time soon. As an insulting addition they offer wireless Internet as a \"convenience\" to the guests, however they don't bother to mention the exorbitant rate they CHARGE (something like an additional $10 dollars a day per computer) anyplace on their website and only post it in the signage where you can connect. However, the Mc Donald's in Key West offers it for free, so figure that one out. Consequently, the place is really showing its age (where is the maintenance fee going??) and in dire need of repair along with some major improvements. I would have been better off burying my money in a hole. I honestly must say it was the most naive financial decision I have ever made and I must have been overcome by the sunshine fumes and the margaritas that year. Good luck trying to sell this \"Lifetime Deedable Investment\" and get even half of your money back. Never again, never. Do I still stay there? Yes, on occasion since we have family in Florida (though we live up North now) but honestly we try to avoid it whenever possible and hope the stars align so that we can go someplace else in the network.

It is a great place to stay if you want a \"home away from home\"--two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, dining area, living room, nice screened porch with wicker furniture (glass table and four chairs for dining, wicker couch and table and rocking chair). The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, glassware, silverware, pots, pans, towels, pot holders, paper towel, dish soap, dishwasher detergent...the list goes on. Very comfortable dining area and living room spaces. The second bedroom was great for our 16 year old daughter--gave her space with a TV, which she loved. My 13 year old son slept on the queen sleeper sofa, with his own TV in the living room area. We had the huge master bed/bathroom, which had a great glassed in shower, double sinks, jacuzzi tub, separate toilet area, good closet. Drawer space in each bedroom was not an issue with a built-in set of four drawers per room. Each room also has an apartment-sized washer/dryer combo, which was a great convenience--it was nice to go home with clean clothes, even supplied with two individual-wash sized containers of Tide! The pool is shallow (not more than 4 feet deep) but very nice for families with small children, which a nice sandy area with sand toys for the kids to play in, plenty of comfortable beach chairs and cabana-style double chaises with pads. There are picnic tables with grills available to grill food (the front desk is helpful to provide grilling tools, charcoal, lighter fluid and matches in a shed where the grills are). Don't go to Key West expecting gorgeous, sand beaches because that is not what the Keys are about. Higgs, Smathers and the other beaches along the southern side of the island are sandy and nice with very calm, warm water--parking can be expensive. We went to Fort Zachary Taylor State Park, where there is a nice beach with breakwaters that are great for snorkeling--has a nice snack bar with chair, umbrella and other types of rentals, plus plenty of shaded picnic tables--nice place to spend a day for less than $10 per car with 4 people. The waterfront area is a \"waterfront area\" not especially a beach but a great place to sit on the dock and watch the sunset. Although it is sandy and there is a nice dock to fish from with water equipment rentals, there is a big sign warning people about the current in front of the property. The property sits on the corner of the Gulf and a channel that has a strong current and not a safe place to swim or snorkel--nice for kayaking, jet skis, etc. The concierge in the front lobby was very helpful in booking trips and activities and with moped rentals--definitely a great, less expensive way of getting around when parking is $10-12 per day down by Duval Street. Our kids loved skooting around the island on the mopeds for the week--we just parked our car in the parking provided under the buildings that was free and shaded at the hotel. I know there have been notes about the cleanliness of this hotel however, we found it clean with the exception of the tile floor-it was not 100% clean but tile floors with heavy traffic will get dirty, even if they are clean and maintained. Overall, we would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to couples or families that are looking for a condo-type atmosphere, in a quieter area that is very comfortable and well-maintained.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cParadise for a week\u201d", "Author": "margaritagirlToronto", "ReviewID": "UR7474842", "Content": "We had a girlfriends gettaway in Key West for a week.

It is in an excellent location for a quiet relaxing and enjoyable stay. Away from the hustle and bustle of Duval St. but close enough to get to the action when you want it. We had a double suite - very spacious and luxurious and decor is inviting. Outside verandah is a wonderful touch - breakfast on the patio in the early morning sun, listening to the birds and gentle rustle of the palms as they sway in the tropical breeze. Beautiful. Pool is shallow, but very enjoyable, hot tub great for meeting new friends. Tiki bar on the grounds is run by outside staff and closed up shop too early - 5 pm each day exc.Wed. closed at 4. The resort is beautifully landscaped and well taken care of. But, the floors in the suites and the refridgerator could have used a little more care in cleaning....feet were filthy 10 mins. after you showered and the fridge was dingy on the inside. Daily maid service is available at $50.00 more per day. We were on tight budget and did it ourselves. Linen change for everyone on Wednesdays. The resort is a great place for families with young children. The shallow pool is good for them. Teenagers it would be too boring. There should be more entertainment poolside provided....one afternoon for an hour we had a local steelband performer we enjoyed very much. But it was over too soon. Key West was a lot of fun - many things to do - we didn't get it all in. We took the ferry trip to the Dry Tortugas. Interesting place, but not a whole days worth. Yankee Freedom 2 charged too much I think. $129.00 US for what I feel $70.00 was more appropriate. Spring migration was underway so there were a lot of photo ops for birdwatchers and butterfly lovers alike. Snorkelling offshore we didn't see very much coral life.

We were VERY excited when we landed the Hyatt Beach House Resort and we're looking forward to the \"Hyatt Experience\". I expected the Hyatt to be a bit nicer than other Marriott timeshare properties we had stayed at.....Not so. First, the resort is located as far away as you can possibly get from Old Town Key West, while still being on the island. It's about 3.5 miles away, and is located off U.S. 1. There are lots of strip mall shopping centers nearby and lots of places to buy necessities, pizza and chain-type restaurants. It would be helpful if the Hyatt operated a shuttle to the Old Town area, but inexplicably they do not. It would save $5-$15 in daily parking fees among other things. When we checked in, we noticed that there is a MAJOR construction project going on next store, unrelated to the Hyatt property. Since our unit was on that side and we have a 1 and 3 year old, I asked to be relocated to a unit away from the construction. The receptionist said this wouldn't be possible since we booked through Interval International and the rooms for I.I. are allocated near the construction. Nice service! So after further conversation, the receptionist consulted with her manager. He/she denied our request to be moved. (note that after 3 days staying here, it appears the property is only 40% occupied!) It's impossible for me to believe that relocating us would have been any issue, despite the fact that I am Hyatt Gold. That's the \"Hyatt Experience\". The units are not that great. We booked a 2 Bedroom. The main living area is very narrrow and has a kitchen area built along one wall. The floor is tile and was very dirty as evidenced by the color of our children's feet after a few minutes of play. There is a bedroom and bath at the front of the unit and a master bedroom with bath at the rear. The Master Bedroom has a shower and hot tub en suite, and a W.C. It's pretty nice. Each unit includes a large screened-in porch which is really nice as well. It has a table with 4 chairs, rattan couch and rocking chair. The disappointing thing about the unit is how small and narrow the main living area is. I've seen New York City apartments with more space. We had problems with the toilets in both bathrooms which I fixed. We also had the water shut off for about 1 hour one morning when we wanted to shower. Apparently the construction next store caused a problem with one of the water mains and the City had to temporarily shut the supply off. The pool is absolutely beautiful and varies in depth from 0' to 4'. It's ideal for young kids. There is also a hot tub. The exterior of the resort is pretty, well landscaped and nicely maintained. Despite the 'brochure pictures' you may have seen, THERE IS NO BEACH. Based on the resort pictures we looked at before booking the trip, this is seriously misleading, bordering on false advertising. Sure enough, the construction kicked in at 7am every morning and lasted through 5pm every afternoon. The banging sounds weren't that terrible, more isolated to when our kids normally take their afternoon nap, go figure. Well I take that back. I am listening to a jack hammer as I type this. If you've stayed at Marriott timeshare resorts, they're a cut above the Hyatt Beach House resort.

Another annoyance was that you had to pay for wireless internet access ($10/day), which is pretty ridiculus for a $275/night room.

It's a great place for a group of people/family to stay and spend some time in between enjoying Key West.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cgreat facility, indifferent service\u201d", "Author": "roller7301", "ReviewID": "UR3754996", "Content": "Just returned from a stay at the Hyatt Beach House. The actual unit was very nice and offered pretty views. But it was really not any more special than the many condos in the Key West area. The pool was tiny, crowded and the pool water was unbelievably hot. On day #2, the landscapers put down cow manure in the middle of the day around the pool landscaping. It stunk to high heaven! The general consensus with the guests in the pool was - quite a distance from downtown (good & bad) but rude, indifferent staff really should be fired. On Day #3, the cleaning crew left my room door open when they were done (we were out). Best if you just want the extra space for a family and don't mind lots of driving to get where you need to go.", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Beach House!\u201d", "Author": "stoverny", "ReviewID": "UR3536196", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from our first stay at the Beach House. We were very impressed. The units are large 2-BR units, nicely furnished with full kitchens including a dishwasher, fridge/freezer, washer/dryer, and all needed silverware and pots/pans/etc. There are ceiling fans in the living room, each bedroom, and on the screened in deck (nice!). There are 2 bathrooms, including a lovely master bath with a jacuzzi and separate glass shower. Units are a very nice size for 4 adults, although I think more than that might feel a little cramped. Pool was great, nice size, beautifully landscaped, and in my opinion probably the nicest pool on Key West (at least of the ones I've seen, including the other 3 Hyatts on the island). Parking is provided directly underneath each building. It was a quick 5-10 minute drive to Old Town by car, and we never had any problems parking when we drove downtown (we used the Hilton garage near Mallory Square, and also there's a convenient lot at the end of Margaret Street near the marina). The lots were never crowded, but this was relatively off-season, so I can't say what parking would be like in high season. But driving and paying the 2 or 3 dollars an hour to park was much easier for us than taking a city bus or the Bone Island Shuttle. Key West is a fun town, especially if you like getting out on the water. We took a great dolphin/snorkel trip with Sheri at Wild About Dolphins, would definitely do it again. Beach House is removed from the craziness of Duval Street and Mallory Square, and that suited us just fine. A lovely place to stay and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saugerties, NY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Accomodations\u201d", "Author": "twinzmom", "ReviewID": "UR3502179", "Content": "We just got back from Key West and the Hyatt was the absolute best thing about our stay.
