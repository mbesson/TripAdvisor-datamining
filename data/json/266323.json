The bride had suggested this motel and another in the general vicinity. Mind you, the bride is living back east and only made the lodging suggestions based on locale. To give you an idea of the area, we noticed a large population of transients on Rosecrans within several blocks of the hotel. Thankfully there were none on the actual hotel property, but plenty could be seen at the Winchells right across the street. We arrived at the hotel and checked in at 8pm with no problems. One nice thing about it being such a small hotel, you park right in front of the rooms. The downside of it being such a small hotel, you can hear the cars pull up at all hours of the night. It literally sounds like someone is pulling into your room. The door and windows are not soundproof. Right off the bat you notice that the room is very small. There are only three drawers to store clothes in, despite the room being setup for 4 people. The closet is a little aclove, but was large enough considering we only had one set of clothes for each person that needed to be hung up. The bathroom was little more than a converted closet. You had to shove the door against the toilet in order to get into the bathroom. The sink countertop hung over the toilet so you had to lean forward to sit down. There was no ventilation inside the bathroom so you have to open the window to keep smells from getting into the rest of the hotel room. Upon opening the window, I noticed that the low-rent apartments next door could look right down into the bathroom. The only good thing about the whole room is that fact that the showerhead is a full flow massage unit. You are gonna need it because the main mattress is hard as a rock. I took my own pillow to make sure I would comfortable, and I still woke up with a sore back. Oh, did I mention that there is NO SOUNDPROOFING between the top and bottom floor. If you absolutely must stay at this motel, get a room on the 2nd floor. My wife and I were awakened at 2am by the people upstairs. It sounded like they were wearing lead shoes and throwing their luggage around the room. I would most definitely not recommend this hotel to my friends. I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy. For $140 a night, I expect more than this little fleabag motel has to offer. It's not like there is a shortage of hotels in San Diego.

We booked the Snooze and Cruise rate, which included the room, breakfast, transportation to and from the cruise terminal, as well as parking on the days we were on the ship. Parking is at a premium in San Diego, so this was a really nice perk. We were cruising with a group, which included a travel agent, and she booked everyone else at a different hotel because she had heard bad things about the Comfort Inn. We were not at all disappointed in our stay, though! Both nights we requested two beds and got them. The first night we were in a first floor corner room - odd shape but rather large. We had the two beds, plus a couch, a desk, safe, ironing board. The bathroom was kind of small, but that was okay with us. My only complaint about this room was that it was hot. To be fair, it had been 95 degrees in San Diego that day, which never happens, so it stands to reason that the room was warm. It didn't seem that the air blew well, and the room was warm even after the A/C had been on for several hours. I ended up opening a window, and was able to fall asleep after awhile. Breakfast is great, complete with a belgian waffle maker. This was a nice surprise, and more than sufficient. Ground transport to the cruise terminal was awesome. It was not Super Shuttle, but a local service very similar to Super Shuttle. We were picked up early, and dropped off right on the cruise terminal pier. When we got back, we called the company to be picked up, and were asked for a reservation number. I didn't realize we had been given one and it had been written on the envelope that contained our vouchers, although it is very possible that we were told this when the vouchers were given to us and I just didn't realize it. Even with this, we were on a van and on the way to the hotel within 10 minutes of making our call. My car was right where we had left it, with no signs of any kind of foul play. We were given a different, smaller room post-cruise, but it was more than adequate. The room was again warm, but cooled down quite quickly once the A/C was turned on. Much better than the day we arrived, probably due to cooler weather and a smaller room. Very comfortable. The hotel advertises WiFi, but I was never able to get my laptop to connect. I am running Vista, and I am sure there is a setting somewhere in the operating system that was causing the problem. Their tech support was not able to resolve the issue, so I had to do without Internet. The hotel staff were very nice, helpful and courteous. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. The hotel is an older porperty, and the architecture of the building reflects that. Don't let that scare you away - the property has been renovated and is more updated behind closed doors than the outward look of the building may lead you to believe. The location is awesome, right on the corner of Scott Street and Harbor Drive. Rosecrans Street borders the other side of the property. There is a really nice shopping area not too far away, but I cannot remember the name of it. We never went there, though I wanted to check it out. Winchell's is right across the street, with other fast food type places up and down Rosecrans. The hotel is right across Harbor Drive from the sport fishing pier and lots of seafood restaurants. Straight down Harbor Drive is the cruise terminal; the maritime museum, which includes the Midway and the Star of India; just a little further down Harbor Drive is Seaport Village. The airport is close-by, but I never once heard a plane taking off. We may have heard one or two Navy planes taking off/landing on North Island, but nothing that bothered us in any way.

I did hear some neighboring noise, but it was negligible especially with the heater /air conditioner on. The staff was very friendly, helpful and courteous. When we needed our toilet plunged they came right away and when we needed more toothpaste and toilet paper they promply gave it to us.

Dont expect a 5 star hotel. I don't know if they changed things after the last reviews, but it was a decent place. The room was a bit small, but not ridiculously tiny, the bathroom was very small. Everything was clean, the bed was made properly, and everything worked. They had air conditioning and a mini fridge. The guy at the front desk was very friendly and even gave us restaurant recommendations and a card for a free appetizer. The location was decent and not sketchy - we walked about 3 blocks at night to the restaurant and saw no shady people.

Our room was overcrowded with furniture as the room was small. It did seem to be clean, however. The bathroom was a joke. Even though it was clean it was so small you could walk in, but had to back out. It was app. 4' x 4'. The shower was an additional 3' x 3' at one side of the bathroom. Can we say, cramped? Also, I had been thinking how nice it would be to have one of those really nice Belgian waffles that you find in so many of the other Comfort Inns. You know, the ones you make yourself? Very nice. However, when we got to the breakfast room, not only were we surprised at how small the room was - there were no waffles in site!!! In fact, the fruit bowl was nearly empty - the hard boiled eggs were \"extreme\" hard boild eggs, very tough and rubbery. No bananas for our cereal. Basically, a disappointment. The next morning (yes, we actually stayed there two nights!!!) we found a Mimi's Cafe and paid for breakfast (what can I say, I needed my Belgian waffle!). The motel appeared to be a 50's remodel, outside painted light blue, which was our first red flag. Tiny swimming pool - second red flag. Very small registration office. I just don't know - the list goes on. If it hadn't been for the fact that we were in San Diego and did a lot of the fun things you can do there, this trip would have been a bust.

Also, the noise was a huge issue. Sounded like elephants were walking above me, yet I am sure it was typical walking from the people upstairs.
