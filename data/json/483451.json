When we arrived, we couldn't believe our eyes, there is a skip outsiade and workmen everywhere, the windows on the first floor were being replaced, and all the glass was outside on the drive. The parking was a good mile away. When we went inside, no one was at the reception desk (if you could call it that) then a lady arrived and when we asked if it was a hotel she just looked at us and shouted up the stairs. The owner then came down, I really wasn't convinced it was a hotel, only until he confirmed my reservation. We looked at the room and decided to cancel our stay. The owner just said what do you expect with a discounted price!!!!!!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best budget hotels in Shepherds Bush.\u201d", "Author": "tony h", "ReviewID": "UR124607347", "Content": "I have stayed in quite a few budget hotels in the Shepherds Bush and this one is probably the best.

Stayed at the Abbey Hotel Sept 2011. The only hotel I have ever stayed at that did not have tea and coffee facilities (manager used current renovations as excuse - go figure). TV did not work, pillows were more like sacks, and the bathroom was closet like although new, and the phone could not be used to access outside lines (despite this listed as a feature along with tea/coffee facilities). Staff were friendly although more out of apology than anything. Hotel should be renamed \"Shabby Hotel\". Definitely not of three star standard as reputed. At 76 pounds per night it was a rip off.

I appreciate that it's a budget hotel but it really was bad! To start with the parking is a good 35 minute walk away(not mentioned on the website.) The women who works there was really rude and unhelpful. The whole place is filthy, I had to sleep fully dressed from fear of getting bitten, not sure if the bathroom had ever been cleaned. The breakfast was really bad... There was some cold toast which i think had been toasted several days before using a cigarette lighter, there was a very small glass of juice and a croissant. The table cloth looked like it was about to walk off! It was quite comical really.

Location very good for the BBC studios and excellent shopping centre opposite. However, when we got up in the morning there was no water. Was told there was a little but there wasnt. Then was told it would be an hour until water came back (which meant 8am) and then was told 12 midday. So because we had to be out of room by 11 we asked could we wait till water came on, NO!!! So i then asked for a refund, NO!!! Although there was no water, we were given 2 glasses of water to clean our teeth with!!!!!! How did that happen then cos she told us she didnt have any bottled water when we asked. Ok, these things happen, but you would at least expect an apology!!!!!!!!

The hotel is close to (at least) three underground stations, so there's never a problem getting around. Sure, there's a little noise from the traffic, but hey - you're in London, what do you expect?

The Breakfast was basic but not bad, considering the price it was more than what we were expecting. The Location of the Hotel is simply perfect, exactly across the street to westfield, and 10 min by tube to oxford street (Marble Arch). The Hotel area is very safe at night with many restaurants and pubs which cater for all budgets. Nearby the hotel there is also a market, sheperd's bush market where you can find good deals. The rooms are basic and not very big but good enough once again considering the price.
