Check in easy, the reception staff spoke reasonable English. The room (on 5th floor) was not particularly big but it was tastefully decorated and comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small and looked a bit outdated, but overall we were pleased. The room was at the back of the hotel looking out onto a side street which was reasonably quiet. The first couple of nights we both kept waking up, but I think this was because of the difference in air between Munich and Rome. The room ws cleaned every day and no complaints about that. The big selling point is the roof terrace where you have breakfast and there was a nice overall view of Rome. If you actually want an outside table, it\u00b4s best to get there early. Area around the hotel not so touristy, but it was worth lookin into the shops as the people were quite friendly. Lots of choice for eating- at least three pizzerias immediately around the hotel- tried the Bar Washington and it was good value. a bit further away (turn left from Hotel, walk for five minutes) we found a basic but good Indian place. Overall a nice base to explore Rome. It was a bit early in the year, but Rome was still pretty crowded. One day we decided to go to the beach, so we took the train to Anzio.

It's a simple but ample selection of cereals, croissants, breads, eggs, bacon, cold meats, cheese, yoghurt etc. The hotel is only about 10mins walk from the Termini and easy to get around from this point. There are some nice restaurants also around the Hotel. But I must admit..the Roof Garden is really 'something else'!! So beautiful.

Well while the porter was dropping off our luggage I went into the bathroom to wash my hands and the handle on the faucet came off in my hands... water was shooting out everywhere... of course then they had to move us to another room..

You never know when your travel agent recommends a place if it will be up to standards, but thankfully, the hotel was. (Note on getting there from the airport: You can take the train to the Termini station about 3 blocks away, as recommended by our travel agent, for about 14 Euro but will have to lug your suitcases over cobblestone and busy streets and sidewalks. We took a \"white taxi\" from the airport that was supposed to be only 40 Euros, as all the signs said, but we ended up having to negotiate 50. Don't know if we got taken, or misunderstood the people in the booth at the airport that it was \"around\" 40. Otherwise, we went directly there and I would still do the taxi.) Hotel is in a great location. Close to the Colisseum (we took the metro although you could probably walk it in 20 minutes or so) and metro stops that take you to all the sights. Safe neighborhood, but the front is crowded with cars during the day. Good, varied (included) breakfast on the very nice rooftop restaurant. Staff very knowledgeable, efficient and helpful, but not necessarily friendly by American standards. Room was decent size and had a nice balcony, and air conditioning which seemed more than sufficient. We turned it off at night. The bed was very comfortable and seemed to be a king size. Nice clean fairly big bathroom. Towels a little sparse, but serviceable. Sufficient toiletries; only one pillow per person. Nice TV, in room bar refrigerator. Good closet space. Lots of nice reasonable places to eat around there. As others have said Est Est restaurant next door was fine (not great, but more than adequate). Very comfortable and we would stay there again. Didn't have any trouble with pickpockets, but don't fall for the people lying on the street begging for money, and watch out for them. Watch out for folks wanting to take your picture. At the Colisseum, some guys dressed in roman soldier outfits sort of cornered us in what we thought was a friendly way, and took our picture with our camera and then demanded 10 Euro amd tried to act like he wouldn't give us back our camera, We snatched the camera back and gave him a 2 Euro coin. It wasn't as bad as it sounds, but if they had been really bad guys, we would have lost our camera. We saw them taking pictures of other people which is why we weren't alarmed at first.

It kept the room comfortable but was not capable of making the room feel cold; maybe that is what some guests are expecting. I did notice that it was switched off in the early hours of the morning ....but at that time it was not required. The city of Rome was grubbier than I remember from an earlier trip in 1986. Much of the town is covered in graffiti ....poverty abounds with many eastern Europeans lying prostrate in the streets or outside churches, begging. Many Rome cafes and restaurants appear to have managed to perfect the art of tea making to such a high art-form that they now charge 4 to 5 euros a cup. I have never seen prices like it! While entering a metro train I had my pocket \u2018dipped\u2019 by a woman carrying a baby on her chest. I was pushed from behind and caught her hand in my trouser pocket.

Air-conditioning was turned-off by the hotel between 4 to 6 am. Big bathroom. Empty \"kleenex\" box was refilled after the 3rd day of stay. Closest metro(subway) is Republica and only about 5/10 minutes walk. Shopping along Via Nationale (by the Republica station) is decent if you are not looking for brand name goods. Brand name goods near the Spanish Steps. Very close to the Terninni, 10 minute walk. Train to the airport one-way is 14 euro. From the airport, you have to go outside the departure level and take the escalator up to the train station. If you have a larger group, you may try the car service counter facing the arrival gate. Paid 60 euro the night that we picked up our daughter from the airport in a fairly new Mercedes Benz. The driver, Max, showed us some night scenery too. Saw more than a thousand people lining up to get tickets for some kind of exhibition 1:30 in the morning. I was picked-pocket the morning that we left for the train station. 2 women, a young teenage girl and a baby. They literally grabbed my arms. I was not aware until I tried to buy the train ticket. Luckily it was only a few hundred euro cash - but it was in my front jean pocket. You must take the tour to go to the Vatican and the Colosseo in order to avoid the 2 hour wait. Also visited the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, ruins next to the Colosseo, Piazza Navona, Vittorio Emmanuele,..etc. The hotel front desk has a map showing all the tourist attractions.

The bathroom was washed thoroughly daily and sparkled! The shower had immediately hot water and good pressure. Like most of Europe it is a hand held shower mounted and adjustable which was fine. The partition to prevent water going everywhere was moveable to allow baths. This was fine with me. The room was large with hardwood floor which was clean and nice. Our room had an entrance vestibule between the bedroom and the bathroom, where the closet was located. In the closet was a safe, large enough for our laptop. The bed was firm and good. I have a history of back pain in certain hotel beds and I thought the bed slept great. The old large Italian windows and shutters were great for getting light and a breeze. Inside the older external windows was a totally new, modern window which totally shut out back alley noise and light. The breakfast buffet was superb. They had the best bacon I have ever eaten. I dont recall the particulars but the hours were ample. I found the hotel location near the Termini train station to be a major benefit. If you are returning to the airport or to other locales in Italy you are 3 blocks away. Also the intersection of the 2 underground lines is at Termini as well. As for the staff, they helped us when we needed assistance which was not very often. I did not consider this aloof.

I don't know what's the building regulations are like in Italy. But, we were in a double room in 3rd floor of a 7 story building. But the building outside our room window is barely 3 feet away, blocking the whole sun light. Hence we couldn't get up in the morning without the wake up call, though that's manageable; there was no way of hanging in the room any time after 9am, which was annoying. (2) Though it said, room is air-conditioned, they stop air-condition every day between 10am and 12noon. If you happened to stay in the room during that time, it gets really unpleasant due to hot temperature this time of the year in Italy. (3) Though they have the roof top garden, their menu is no better than a standard Italian restaurant, but much higher. (4) Breakfast really annoyed me as there was no toast( instead they had pre-packed long life snack tests sold similar to Tescos). There is no Croissant, replaced with soup breads, which is so hard.

Great wine bar near Piazza Novonno is the Cul De Sac Bar. 1000 bottles of wine, also great wine bar near Colleseum, Carvour 313. Romans were very laid back and very helpful. Roof Top Garden at Hotel is nice for breakfast and late night bar (open til 12) Desk clerks were not very friendly. Hotel was clean and great for travelers. Breakfast was sufficient to get you going in the morning. No fruit or anything healthy. Eat gelatto every day, you will not regret it.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, UK", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel for a city break\u201d", "Author": "popadoodle99", "ReviewID": "UR42906614", "Content": "I was a bit worried about the previous reviews of this hotel, but we had absolutely no problems with it.

We got a phenominal deal and that's why I didn't complain about any of the following issues: Despite being 60 degrees during the day and much cooler in the evening, the room was very hot at night. We left the window open and then were kept awake by the street noise. Even if it was temperature controlled and we were able to keep the windows closed, we would have been kept awake by the adjacent rooms. It sounded like there was no walls between us. The staff were friendly enough. Definitely did not go out of their way to be helpful. Our flight going there was cancelled the first day and I called the travel agency to see if we could bump our whole trip one day, as it was a short trip to begin with. They assured me I could do that. When I got to the hotel, the gentleman at the desk told me in a very curt manner that we missed our first day and would not be accommodated. After talking to the travel agency and having them fax them something it was taken care of, but these were all things I had to take care of instead of them making a simple phone call. The breakfast was okay. The scrambled eggs were obviously artificial eggs, which would not have bothered me had they been cooked all the way. Anyone should know that scrambled eggs shouldn't be runny. But they had plenty of croissants and breads and other various pastries. The one thing that really irked me was that they charged BY THE MINUTE for internet access. The room was very small, but clean. Our bed was actually two twin beds pushed together, which I found odd. The next hotel we stayed at in Florence had the same, so maybe that's acceptable there. As I was digging myself out of the crack between the beds at about 3 am, I was a little annoyed. When I looked under the bed to find a shoe, I realized there wasn't even a box spring. The mattresses were on a sort of stand. We had to put our key into a slot to turn the lights on in the room, which the front desk failed to tell us. My boyfriend, an electrical engineer, played with the ciruitbreaker for about 20 minutes before finally going down to the desk. All of these minor things added up to a not so pleasant experience.

It cost us more than any hotel we stayed in and was absolutely awful. It is poorly maintained and looks like it has never been renovated. We had to change rooms 3 times for a two night stay. We checked in during the late afternoon on 5/14 and left our room almost immediately to explore the city. When we arrived back at our hotel for the first time after checking in that evening, we realized our toilet was not functioning. We contacted the front desk. A man was sent up and all he had with him was air freshner. We showed him how the toilet would not flush so he radioed someone and then told us that the earliest it could be fixed or looked at would be 8 a.m. the next morning! We called back to the front desk and were told there were no available rooms we could be moved to. We were told we would be contacted in 30 minutes with a status update of whether they could repair the toilet that evening. It was 10:30 at night and all I wanted to do was relax in my room and go to sleep. We called back 30 minutes later because were not contacted with a status update.I guess they hoped we wouldn't call back and care we didn't have a working toilet. Then, when we called back in 30 minutes, they offered us a room with two twin beds. It was definitely not what we wanted. We had a double and if anything we shouldn't be downgraded to a room with two twin beds but given a room of higher quality if they couldn't give us a double. Why had they not offered us this other room 30 minutes prior anyway? They obviously were lying to us initially and didn't offer the other room until we followed up with them on the status. So, we decided to pack up our stuff and move to that room so we could have a working toilet. By the time they gave us the key and we moved all our stuff it was almost midnight! and we were absolutely exhausted. In addition, the A/C was not working in the 2nd room we moved in to. It seemed to work in the first room but didn't work in the twin room they put us in. We later learned that the A/C is turned on only from 3 p.m. to midnight. That explains why it didn't work in room two since we didn't get to that room until midnight! What kind of place is this? And, if this was the case, why were we not told this when we checked in. Evidently, they think it is cool in their rooms from midnight to 3 p.m. It's not even summer yet so I can't imagine how uncomfortable the rooms will be when the temperature gets hotter. We were told that we could check with the front desk in the morning to see if the toilet had been fixed in our original room or if there was a double bedded room available. So, my boyfriend checked the next morning and was told they could move us to another room that had a king size bed. We packed up our stuff for the third time!!! and moved to this room. Finally, we think we are going to have a decent room. The bathroom was a bit different, the room was a bit larger and the floor was wood and not carpet but it wasn't that much nicer than the double bedded room or the twin bedded room. I couldn't imagine paying more for that room! We tried to turn the A/C on to cool off the room prior to getting showered and starting our day and realized it was not working. We didn't know about the limited A/C at that time. My bf and I were so disgusted at this point and angry that we had wasted so much of our limited time in Rome dealing with problems at this hotel we paid a lot of money for. By the time, we were able to get all our stuff moved, eat breakfast, shower and leave the hotel to sightsee, it was noon! and we were leaving the next morning. So much for getting our money's worth for the 48 hour open bus tour we had paid for and seeing the sights we had planned to visit! When we got back to our room that evening, we were determined to get an hour or two of air conditioning before it shut off for the night. My boyfriend had to switch on a button with a bobby pin to get the A/C to work!!! for the few hours it did. I woke up sweating in the middle of the night and we opened up the hotel window (which had a broken latch) to get some cool air.

Overall, we would very much recommend the Hotel Diana and would definitely stay here again - just make sure you request a room that you will be happy with.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, average hotel\u201d", "Author": "amshadow1", "ReviewID": "UR5828392", "Content": "We stayed here May 22-25, 2006. We arrived by train and were able to walk to the hotel instead of having to catch a cab, which was nice. The hotel is also in walking distance to the Roman Forum, great restaurants, and lots of shopping-a big plus. Upon seeing the lobby I was hopeful that our room would be decent, but when we opened our door I was disappointed. The room was clearly one that had not yet been renovated. It was very small, the decor was old and ugly, and the wallpaper was in bad shape. The shower was tiny and no matter what we did it flooded the entire bathroom everyday. We had a room facing the street which I thought would be noisy, but it really wasn't that bad because the noisy air conditioning unit drowned out any street noise. The free daily breakfast was average at best, I mean the food was edible but there wasn't much selection. But at least it was one less meal we had to pay for. I will say that most of the staff were very nice and the rooftop garden was spectacular! I wouldn't mind trying this hotel again if I could stay in a renovated room. BEWARE- the air is turned off in the whole building from 8am to noon everyday so make sure to be ready and out of your room before then if you go in the hotter months. It would have been nice if we had been informed of this upon check-in so that we could have been prepared. Instead we thought our unit was broken the next morning, and after messing with it for awhile we called the front desk who told us that they shut it off.", "Date": "September 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Alison/family", "ReviewID": "UR5596904", "Content": "Our stay was very nice.

Bear in mind it is centrally located in Rome were hotels are among the most expensive in Europe. We stayed twice at Diana in June and had 2 different rooms, one were quite new, rather spacious (again this is Rome) and clean indeed with a good selection of soaps etc in the bathroom. The next time we had a huge room (even had a walk in closet). Again very clean with both tub and shower. One of my wife and my own reason to stay was that we heard that they had a lovely terrace. And it was. The food from the grill was not that impressive but was average Rome restaurant quality and not pricey at all. And when you can nip to a glass of cold white and look at the St.Peters Church at nighttime at the same place I'm not going to complain. There were several signs at the hotel excusing refurbishing, but we never heard or saw anything that disturbed us. And there are no rooms with any view of interest. Anyone easily disturbed of noises at nighttime might find that rooms facing the street can be less attractive, but to be honest, you better expect noise living in central Rome. Aircondition worked perfectly and staff was helpful. A really good touristhotel.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seven Hills, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAvoid courtyard rooms\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5335596", "Content": "Our room was on the the \"courtyard\" with a view of some of the ugliest scaffolding we ever saw. Some of the other rooms may have been better but we were unable to change rooms although we tried. The room was clean but otherwise it was like staying in a large closet because very little light or outside air penetrated through the scaffolding which was supposed to be a courtyard. Be aware as we saw no activity going during our 3-day stay and suspect that the scaffolds are a permanent feature. In addition the air conditioning is not turned on until the evening and I suspect turned off long before morning. This was a problem as we were planning to take a little nap after a long oversea flight. The room was extremely stuffy because no outside air could circulate given its location. This was during a period when the weather was rather cool too. Breakfast was not particularly good and we did not have the courage to try the scrambled eggs which sat out during the entire breakfast period. The location is very convenient to the termini train station but a fair walk to major attractions. A great location for access to public transportion because the subway and most busses go through the termini. The front desk desk personnel are very helpful (except about changing rooms) On the whole we would rate this hotel as so-so. There is nothing seriously wrong with this hotel (if you are not claustrophobic), nor is there anything outstanding. We did not like our room at all, but suspect that the rooms do not get any worse than the one we had. If you are planning on extensive use of public transportation, its location is great. If you were planning on leisurely strolls to various attractions, this is not the best location.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cHerd Them In and Out!\u201d", "Author": "csthacker", "ReviewID": "UR5330416", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there for 4 nights. The lobby area is clean and attractive. There is a small bar area open for drinks in the evening. The breakfast is poor by American standards, but fairly normal by Italian standards. If you are a big breakfast eater, Italy is not for you. Our room was VERY small, but clean and quiet. The bed was as hard as a rock and I actually got a bruise on my side from sleeping in it. The bath was spacious, and half the size of the bedroom, but it does not have a shower. There is a hand held shower attachment (standard is a lot of Europe), but the problem at the Diana is that if you are over 5'5\" the shower attachment will not go above your head! The rooftop restaurant was closed, so there was no food at the hotel after breakfast. The front desk staff was rather curt and was not much help when we needed assitance with a travel mix up. Perhaps the problem is that the Diana is clearly a \"herd them in and out\" kind of hotel. They cater to large tour groups who come and go enmass. Very sterile environment. The best part of the Diana is its proximity to the train station. It is VERY easy to take the subway, and if you need to leave the city by train you really couldn't get any closer. But beware, the subway in Rome does not go to the old city. The closest you can can get is the Colleseum or the Spanish Steps.

We were a little weary of the location, after asking friends who had been to Rome before us, but we were delighted at the location of the hotel. We felt safe. Most of the front desk employees were nice. We stayed at Diana at the beginning and the end of our trip. Our first room was nice, two twin beds, very clean, cool ceiling and a great veranda. We overlooked the alley, which we found to be the best bet. The second time we checked in, we were put into a room that smelled , had 1 queen bed and 1 twin bed squeezed into the room. You could not even walk to the bathroom without climbing over the bed. This room overlooked the street and was overly noisy. I live in Chicago and the \"L\" runs close to my home and this room was worse. When I asked at the front desk to have a room that overlooked the alley, the gentlemen was not nice, not happy to accomadate my request. I spent most of the night tossing and turning due to the noise. When I got up to use the bathroom, I hit my leg on the desk and cut myself very badly. I still have a scar month later. The next day, I went and ask the front desk about moving rooms, and this emplyee had no problem accomadating me. He moved us to the cutest room on the 5 floor overlooking the alley. The room had beautiful hard wood floors. The only other thing I was disappointed about was the roof top garden bar was not open yet. But we were in Rome during the off season. Still a little too cold. The breakfast was great. And helped our budget out alot.
