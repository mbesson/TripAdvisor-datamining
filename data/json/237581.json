The day before we left I asked him \"what was the easiest way to get to Anne Frank house.?\" He replied \"you haven't paid yet\" I said I wasn't checking out until tomorrow and he said I should've paid when I checked in. No one told me or asked for payment at check-in. When I offered him my credit card (which my confirmation clearly said was acceptable in this hotel) he shoved it back at me saying \"Cash\". As I didn't have 390 euros in cash I explained to him he'd have to wait. Fortunately I found an ATM which gave me enough to pay him cash. The room only had one useless pillow per person, I asked for another two pillows but unsurprisingly didn't get them.

This hotel is extremely well located, and the price is right for what you get. But the staff is quite horrible. When I arrived it was raining, and it was a cold day. I tried to check inn and I was received for this awful guy in the reception desk, who ask for my passport and my booking number. When he did he asked me to pay in advance for the room. I showed him my dutch credit card, and he mentioned they received cash only. I was surprised because I wasn't notified by this situation when I booked. He told me I had only 10 minutes to pay because there was a waiting list. I offered to pay for 2 nights in advanced because I didn't carry with me all that money and It was raining and that as soon the rain stopped I could go for the money. And he didn't accept my offering. It was all or nothing. So I walked 4 blocks to withdraw the money, at night, with a heavy rain and 4 blocks again to return. But that's not all, this guy was not alone, the rest of his ugly family was there.... The basic rooms for one persons, are quite small, like 6 steps long and 4 width. They are clean, with a nice view of the street. The room can be considered the best part, it is clean, and brand new. It has a hairdryer machine, and a shower cabin. The room also has a small chair, and a tabl that can be used as a desk. The bed is small, it is small than a personal bed. However this bed size is quite common in europe. There is a small breakfast offered between 7.30 and 9.30, but beware, if you arrived late, they won't allowed you to take anything, and it is forbidden to take a piece of bread with you to your room. The breakfast has some yogurt, bread, marmalade, milk, some apples and coffee. The hotel is well located, it is at 5 minutes walking to laidsesplain, Rembrantdplein, the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum. There is a tram stop at 4 blocks that takes you to central station. This hotel is run by a family, they lived in the same building, so I could see the father, the mother, and another female person I couldn't identified. All of them are walking through the hotel making recommendations to the guests. For example, don't make noise when walking, or when going through the stairs... well how it is possible not to make noise if the stairs are made of wood? All the doors are noisy, but the administrator will ask you not to. When having breakfast, the father will be behind you counting how many pieces of bread you take, or the marmalade you grab, they are always watching. The only friendly person is the dutch woman who clean the tables. My conclusion: If you are traveling for many days don't stay here to long, o it if you need to do something in the area, nothing else. The staff is ugly, all this family who runs the hotel is rude, disorganized and bad motivated. This family business could be better if they stop administering the hotel and they let other friendly person starts administering. They are a completely mess.

He answered all the questions I had about restaurants, sites, local habits, etc. and I had some every day. The included breakfast consisted of hard boiled eggs, cold cereals, fruit, cheeses, meats, breads, juices, milk and coffee. Enough variety for the three days we stayed there. The room just had enough room around the bed to get in and out and the bathroom was snug, but everything was clean.

When you will call the room service, they will keep on saying that waiter has gone to your room and he will be there in another 5 minutes, but waiter will never turn up. 4. Also for dinner, you need to reach the restaurant precisely at 8:30 PM or there would be no seating available and in next lot, the food would have gone cold that of course one does not enjoy. 5. Never ever book any bus from this hotel. They will tell you about excellent bus and will provide the most cheap and dirty bus in the town. They charged us for super deluxe bus and provided the bus in which seats were broken. There were no shockers in the bus and some people (drunk) were lying in the passage of the bus. It was nightmare traveling from manali to Delhi. For your information, MUKUL BUS SERVICE is the third class bus service. They charge you high and provide the low quality, dirty buses. Summary: Use this hotel just for stay. Avoid booking for bus, touring, food, taxi, cars etc. from this hotel. Managers are not at all helpful. They are best at giving you different explanations all the time and even ignore you some times.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cMixed Bag\u201d", "Author": "sophiezo", "ReviewID": "UR22358386", "Content": "The single room was the size of a cell.

LOCATION The location is very handy - you can walk to the museum district and there are loads of restaurants within a few minutes walk, and the neighborhood feels safe. The central station was about a 10 minute tram ride away. COMFORT The first night when we were in the triple room, the bed was pretty comfortable for a hotel bed. The second night, the bed was ridiculous, like a half-deflated airbed. So it will depend if you are lucky or not how comfy your bed is. The first night in the triple our bathroom and shower were very cramped. The bathroom in the double was much better, still small, but you could move in there.

It's in a leafy quiet street only 5 minutes walk from the Leidesplein, a busy square full of tables and chairs and surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars. It's also close to the trams, and a 5-10 minute walk from the Van Gogh museum. We walked to the Anne Frank House too which - if we hadn't stopped for shops, beers, lunch, a walk round the park, sun-basking and to take silly photos, would have been about a 30 minute walk, the other side of the city centre. The room was nice. Although small, it was clean, tidy, the tv worked, and the beds were possibly THE most comfortable I have ever slept in! The street was nice and quiet at night, even with the window open. The en suite bathroom was bright and spotless and looked absolutely brand new! Superb. Hair-dryer included. It had a shower, loo, basin & 2 towels per person. If I stayed there again I think I'd opt for a shared bathroom. We saw it across the hall and it was exactly the same as the en suite. I guess our room would have been a lot bigger without the bathroom and it would've saved a few pounds. We used both anyway to save time... The breakfast was really excellent - as much as you can eat, from different cereals, breads/toast, spreads, cheeses, boiled eggs, cold meats, juice, tea, coffee, fruit... and the restaurant was beautifully presented, with fresh flowers on all the tables. Brekky is 7.30-9.30. The lift is apparently new - and very small. If you are claustrophobic take the stairs! My only grumbles would be that the staff didn't seem too happy. I don't think either of them smiled the whole time we were there (although that might be because we woke them up at 2am when we couldn't get the key to work in the outside door! We were trying the wrong door...). Also, we thought there would be lockers to put our bags in after we checked out until we we'd had to go for our flight, but the only option was to leave them in reception with the owner keeping an eye on them... They were fine, however. Last grumble, no tea & coffee-making facilities in the rooms. I know this isn't important when it's free downstairs, but it's nice to have one while to you get ready!

I think that visitors have to go in knowing that this is a two-star hotel (i.e. no room service, etc. essentially a clean, comfortable place to stay) to be able to enjoy the amenities the hotel has to offer. The hotel is fairly small, and taken care of by an accordingly small though very kind and accomodating staff. Not sure how many floors there are in the place, maybe three or four including the ground floor, but there are about three rooms per floor. Our triple room was about 15-17 m2 containing two single beds and a queen, so it comfortably accomodated three people, and could do four if the queen is shared. The room had the essential private bathroom, television (which in Amsterdam means all kinds of international stations, though it might have been cable, I'm not sure...) closet, mirror, table and chairs, and a safe. Not the Ritz by far, but very comfortable, cozy, and clean. The bathroom is according fairly standard and small, equipped with complimentary soap and towels and things, and the shower (at least in our room) is very much integrated into the bathroom meaning that there is no curtain. Just have to make sure you don't point the removable showerhead everywhere in order to keep the rest of the bathroom dry. The stairs in the place are indeed very steep, though by what I could tell from the rest of Amsterdam, it's not all that rare and is a space-saving mechanism. So I would probably not advise this particular hotel to anyone who might have physical difficulties or disabilities, or who otherwise might have problems traversing steep stairs. A sit-down buffet breakfast is included in the room price, and again it's not a five-star meal, but it's complete and free! (well, included...) Coffee, teas, juices, cereals, bread and cold cuts, etc. Quite nice... Geography-wise, it's not in the center of the city, so it does take a little walking, but Amsterdam is relatively very dense so traveling (either by walking or taking the trams and buses) from the hotel to nearly any other point in Amsterdam is quite easy. In fact, it's sort of the best of both worlds in that it's in a quite residential street, but walking distance to more commercial areas. And it's about a 20-25 minute tram ride from Central Station. What I really enjoyed about the hotel is that my friends and I were originally planning on staying in a hostel, and in the end when we divided the price of our triple room, it ended up being about the same price per person as a hostel would have been, and we had tons more at our disposible than we ever would have had in a hostel (private bathroom, private ROOM, breakfast included, towels, general cleanliness, etc.) So in all, we had a great stay -- definitely recommended!", "Date": "February 19, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Jupiter Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d237581-Reviews-Jupiter_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$79 - $256*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2e Helmersstraat 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1054 CJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237581", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c9/3d/c93de38571371ac94fd38898ed653bdb1large.jpg"}}
