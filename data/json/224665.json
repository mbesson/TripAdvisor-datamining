The furniture was quite scratched and there was a blank wall with extension cords going to lamps - it looks like there should be a chair or table or something to furnish the wall. I don't think we had a queen sized bed but it was very comfy - with a big duvet. The bathroom is terrific - big, modern, clean. Having a little kitchen counter, glasses, bottle opener was great. We had a complementary breakfast in Sinclairs and had invited friends to join us. The continental breakfast buffet is very good - lovely little croissants and pains au chocolat, fruit, cereal.

But taking their amazing staff into account and the rating sky rockets into a shining super 4!! Location: Right in the middle of the old part of Montreal and all it has to offer? Just off the man party street thankfully. Hotel: Newly renovated medium sized boutique hotel in prime location of old Montreal.\u00c2\u00a0 Staff: I can't thnk of a single employee that didn't do their utmost to make our stay the best it could be! They are warm, friendly, efficient and just lovely people! Room: We were in a suite (123) which was very spacious, bright, quiet, high ceilings, separate shower/bathtub, his and her sinks, quiet and efficient AC, a lot of storage, 2 TVs, crazy good water pressure/heat,\u00c2\u00a0 The bed could have been larger (queen), but the bed linen were nice and pillows comfortable Easy to make room completely dark! Some rooms apparently have fireplaces too! Both electric and wood depending on room. Nice detail! There are both courtyard rooms and rooms with a street view. So if you crave extra silence go for the courtyard one! AC: Fast, efficient and blissfully quiet! Food: The breakfast has a very small, but perfectly fine, selection. Service is friendly and quick In room dining was ok. A little bit slow, order inaccurate and we were charged to items we had not ordered both times Internet: They charge for it (the premium one!), but not crazily so. Easy to login, and stay logged in + it's rather fast. Regular Internet is free :) Amenities:\u00c2\u00a0 L'Occitane, kind of basic, but perfectly ok. Small selection Minibar: They provide you with an empty fridge (1 wine bottle doesn't count). Now this is both good and bad as its nice not to have to head outside and stock up the first thing you do. But it's great to have somewhere to store your own stuff on the other hand. There are a lot of little convenient stores around, so it's not a giant trek to find beverages/snacks to buy Plus they can stock it for you upon request Animals: They are an animal friendly hotel! Babysitting: They do offer this and Marie from the company they use was wonderful!! We had her come over 2 nights and I could not have been happier.

It is also a short walk to a metro station which gives access to the malls on St Catherine and Chinatown for cheap feeds.

However they could offer us the Deluxe suite at a discounted price, which we were happy with. At a small additional fee we had a big room with a big bath and more comfortable bed in a more secluded part of the premise. All the staff at the reception, concierge, bell desk and housekeeping were always helpful and friendly. We have never been impressed with the breakfast menu because it is always the same items served and on a few occasions the pastries were stale and the fruits were very old. The floor staff were sometimes unattentive. We never considered dining in their restaurant fearing the lack of service based on our breakfast experiences. Not dining at their restaurant was never an issue for us as there are many exceptional restaurants nearby.

It is reasonably priced, conveniently located (just off Rue St. Paul Ouest), clean, safe and spacious. All rooms are suites. The staff is not as personable as those at Le Petit Hotel just up the street but you can get excellent advice from the concierge. Having made the Le Petit Hotel comparison I should point out that this is a much larger hotel with many more rooms and a greater volume of guests. Included in the price I paid was a free cold breakfast consisting of fresh fruit, toast, breads, coffee, croissants, etc... I liked the croissants and the fruit was fresh and tasty for the most part but the coffee was not to my liking at all, so much so that I just couldn't drink something that tasted like hotel chain Folgers. There is also a large dining room with a restaurant that received excellent reviews from those with whom I spoke. I wasn't staying long so I didn't get a chance to dine here. Thus I cannot comment on the restaurant dining. The hotel lobby is quite spacious and interesting. There's an outdoor patio area that looks very attractive but I was here in winter. I would probably return to sample the fare and to dine in such an appealing setting in warmer weather. This establishment promotes itself as a \"boutique hotel\" and I'm not quite sure I would agree. Yes, there are some aspects that do resemble some of the finer boutique hotels I've stayed at (The Hudson in NYC, The Delano in Miami Beach, etc...) but this one is not in the same class in my mind. The bathroom would certainly be considered of \"boutique\" rating but less so the furnishings, carpeting, inadequate and poor lighting and the overall decor which seemed tired and longing for better days. I will say that otherwise the room was spacious, well furnished, comfortable and included a small kitchenette. The bed provided a solid mattress and afforded a sound sleep, something which I value highly. Would I return to this hotel and/or recommend it to others? Yes.

Recently renovated, it shines with a stylish decor of red and black, punched up with bold designs accented by dark wood and stainless steel. We got a wonderful room that was spacious, located in the back away from street and elevator noise, and was blissfully quiet. It also came with a kitchenette, a balcony, and an electric fireplace. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious with a soaking tub and separate shower. The staff is attentive and personable. And its location is top notch - its entrance is half a block away from the Notre Dame Basilica and an easy walk to the old port area. What's missing? Well, its restaurant is a bit of a head snap. It has the same bold red and black colors and a gorgeous ceiling of sculpted wood. It is located below ground and you look up and out to the sidewalk through windows framed by wrought iron trellises. Despite the little flowers carved into the grillwork, the restaurant feels a bit like an underground prison, especially in the daytime when it is light out and it feels cold and dark inside. The layout is reminiscent of a school cafeteria with rectangular tables lined up in a straight line down the middle and interspersed along the wall directly under the sidewalk. A long red banquette runs the length of that wall and looks uncomfortable at best. Maybe it's better at night when it's dark outside so you don't know what you're missing. The kitchenette is a great convenience. It comes equipped with all the basics you need to cook. But, the microwave is tucked into an upper cabinet above the cooktop and high above your head. You risk spilling something hot on your face anytime you take heated food out of the microwave. The breakfast buffet is continental and no better than it needs to be - three kinds of croissants, a basket of sliced bread, two meats (a salami, a ham), three types of sliced melon, a bowl of plain yogurt, two cerreals, juice and coffee. The coffee tastes watery, disappointing in a French hotel/restaurant. Finally, and this is probably a quirk of mine, I am not partial to fragranced lobbies and rooms. Le Saint-Suplice fragrances the lobby to create an aura of spa and serenity.

This is our favourite (and only for the past years) place to stay in Montreal, with good reason! We arrived at Saint-Sulpice during one of the most violent lightning and rain storms we've seen. As our Taxi arrived at the door, we were met by two, brave, gentlemen who whisked us into the lobby and retrieved our luggage...with big smiles and \"Welcome\"s. Our suite was perfect. Everything was in order, as we expect. The only thing we needed to request was additional coffee packs as we do enjoy a few in the morning to get going. It was done, immediately. This is no surprise as we have, always, found each member of the staff to be service minded. As another example of this care, I am Lactose intolerant and the mere mention of this to Josie-Anne at the breakfast buffet was met with an offer to prepare a special breakfast for me. Not a moment's hesitation! Given the weather that day, we asked the Concierge on duty (Etienne Bellemare) for a recommendation. I had a craving for Lamb and my wife, as ever, wanted seafood. Etienne directed us to Modavie, a place we had passed many time but did not look in. It was a perfect recommendation. In the past he had done the same for us several times. Continuity of staff has proven to be a bonus. Maxim at reception, there for us for years, is another proof of the hotel's desire to keep the best. With thanks to General Manager, M. Di Re, we arrived to find our anniversary being marked by a very nice bottle of wine! Despite the rain, a perfect start to our renewing our love of Old Montreal. We have travelled, and stayed, in a great number of hotels, inns and Bed and Breakfasts across North America, Australia and New Zealand, and most of Europe. All in all, we have had some very pleasant experiences, everywhere. Yet, a return to \"our hotel\" in Le Saint Sulpice is one we are always keen to enjoy: Pleasant, warm, friendly and like a second home. As retired folks who seek all of these things whenever possible, knowing that they will, always, be there for us at Saint Sulpice is a reward in itself.

Having a toddler it was important to stay in a hotel with a separate bedroom as well as kitchen facilities. I would definately reccommend Le Saint-Sulpice for this! Great spacious, clean rooms with fabulous facilities. We got one with a terrace and had dinner outside most nights. The location of the hotel is also fantastic. Right in the old town of Montreal with cobbled streets, restaurants and a childrens playground at the old Port. There is also a fantastic childrens day nursery with spa facilities for parents about a 20 minute walk down Rue Notre Dame called Parentheses Montreal. A MUST for anyone with kids! The only dissappointment was the hotel restaurant where we had breakfast each morning. Since we stayed for 6 nights it shouldn't have been a surprise that we wanted a high-chair each morning but unfortunately we had to ask every day and they would have to go and fetch a usually soaking wet chair (left out in the rain all night!) which they would then dry and give to us for the baby. We would have to beg for coffee and butter for our toast - usually got it after about 3 requests. Also, the breakfast was the same for all 6 days! Not even a change of yoghurt choice or fruit.Not what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel. We also ordered room service (which comes from the hotel restaurant). We ordered chicken for our daughter which was undercooked when it arrived. Since she was so hungry we didnt send it back but microwaved it to ensure it was fully cooked. It was also overcharged on the room service bill. When we complainted to the restaurant manager he refused to belive it had been undercooked and said that the chicken they use sometimes looks rose coloured when cooked and then went into detailed explanations about their cooking techniques! For $22 I'd expect fully cooked chicken!

It now seems committed to a dizzying spiral into seediness. The worst first: the breakfast service is breathtakingly bad. You cannot get coffee. We had to get up and beg the hostess to send somebody to serve us a small, weak first cup. A second cup is a mad dream. The buffet has good baked goods, cheese, good ham, cereal and yogurt, and bowls of fruit which deteriorated from nice fruit salad at first to watermelon our last day. Perversely inconvenient use of the attractive garden/lobby space, with the waiting-to-be-seated line mingling awkwardly with the buffet line, the routes from tables to buffet blocked off for no apparent reason with big planters so you have to weave between close tables and laden (but coffeeless) servers to get to the buffet. One day we were made to wait seven minutes for a table to be set although there were many empty tables and few diners. Another day we were refused service when we arrived ten minutes before the end of breakfast hours. The coffee issue would be less desperate if you could get coffee in your room. There is a very fancy coffee pod machine in your room. The machines and pods are for sale. You get 3 thimble-sized pods and a piece of paper saying the first 3 are free, all others (more in fridge) $2.50 each. Per day or per stay? There was no documentation stating terms the second day, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dare use any more (it would have taken at least 9 to caffeinate all 3 of us adequately). We chose the St-S because it has suites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but coffee (espresso sized) cups, toiletries, towels etc are all for 2 (of the 3 free thimbles, one was decaf so doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count); first day no bathrobes, second day, 2 not 3 bathrobes showed up. Of course we could have called Housekeeping but (1) this should not be necessary and (2) occasional lapses into insolence at front desk did not make us eager to talk to hotel personnel. There are bottles of water in the room and more (2) brought (waking us from desperately needed, hard-won nap) ostentatiously delivered in the afternoon but nothing to say what they might cost. So much has changed so recently at the St-S. that the Guest Manual has an Errata sheet, but some disparities are still not covered in the errata. Fridge is said to be stocked and a price list on counter but there was just one bottle of wine and coffee thimbles, nothing else, in fridge, and no price list. There were a bottle of champagne, 2 glasses, and a card about $49 on the counter. So general atmosphere of commercialism and dangerous money-grabbing booby traps throughout room, causing anxiety, defensiveness, and hostility to the hotel. Warm water in ice bucket when we arrived, so overall cleanliness suspect. Since spa has disappeared, hotel now offers guests use of gym nearby. This gym is small, crowded, and unpleasant. It was not clear whether guests could or could not use a second, reportedly nice gym farther away\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhotel itself can't seem to keep up with the massive negative changes, different staff say different things. Room has nice upholstered furniture but wood pieces are nicked, battered and unpolished, seedy looking (they won't spring for a bottle of Old English??). My mattress might have been OK for some; I needed firmer. Bedroom window handle missing, toilet paper holder loose. The hotel is quick to tell you the bedroom is fully private and bath has separate entrances, but they have installed lightly frosted GLASS PANELS around the sink facing the bedroom. So if you turn on lights in the night it disturbs folks in bedroom, and folks in bedroom have to make effort not to notice sink activities. (The whole worldwide transparent-bathrooms-in-hotels thing: let's have a show of hands, how many like transparent bathrooms??) A gigantic fake fireplace protrudes annoyingly into the room (esp. awkward in relation to Murphy bed, which we could have called them to raise and lower every day but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). There is said to be a device to operate the fireplace somewhere but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. It was summer, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care, but just one more stupid oversight on the part of the hotel. AC satisfactory but very loud. One tea light for the signature red candle, no refills. Wonder how much we would be charged for a second tea light. Attitude: The St. S. is very hard to get to by car at present because of constructions blocks in combination with one-way streets. This is not hotel's fault, but when we arrived and said we had had a hard time, the front desk informed us that no, it's very easy. The next day a veteran Montreal cab driver arrived 20 minutes late driving the wrong way up the street and almost in tears with frustration because he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a way there. Worse: the Guest Manual says there's a nice bar in the lobby where you can meet a friend, have a drink before setting out, etc etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the things people do in hotel bars. So, 2 of our party (20-somethings, admittedly overpolite and underdressed, but quite presentable) went down for a drink. They were told no, you can't just have a drink, this is a full-service restaurant (Bagatelle. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there.). Eventually they were allowed to sit at a side table. They asked for the wine list. The waitress said No. They asked her to suggest some wines. She brought them a glass of chilled red wine that tasted strongly of vinegar, presumably how it was supposed to taste but exotic and obviously not what young people barely past the white Zinfandel stage wanted, and a glass of nice white. I joined them and we had a total of 5 glasses. The bill was $76, the excess owing to the bizarre red. Maybe not that far out of line for a hotel bar, but clearly involving active hostility from the waitress. The young people insisted on tipping her anyway. Positives: Great location. Very quiet. Front desk efficient, quick to make restaurant reservation, call taxi, though they may sneer at you. Not good enough.

The hotel has a terrific location in the center of the old city, and seems proud of its boutique hotel status, but the level of service just isn't on the level of other boutique hotels at all. The rooms are clean and large, decor seemed new although fairly unsophisticated. Suite had everything we needed, including a large rooftop terrace, so accomisations were comfortable. After arriving, I called downstairs to ask if I could get some things pressed, and the front desk told me housekeeping was closed but why didn't I find the ironing board and do it myself? Then we got ready to go to the gym (advertised in hotel brochure as 24 hour), and were told it was closed (it was 7 pm on a Friday). Later that evening, I called the front desk and asked if they had nail polish remover and I got silence, followed by \"we don't have anything like THAT\". Hmmmm, ok, so I just stayed at the Mercer in NYC where they'll run out to the grocery for you at 2am if you need anything, and I know that's exceptional service, but really? Is nail polish remover that bizarre a request from a traveler in a \"4 star\" (what does that rating mean, anyway?) hotel? Day 2, we returned from our day at 5pm to find housekeeping making up our room (5pm), and then my husband headed down to the gym and guess what? It was closed-\"closed on weekends\" they told him. Aren't weekends when most people GO to the gym?! There were other little things, like the guy who took my breakfast order and had to keep asking someone in the background if they had what I was ordering, as well as really slow Internet service. All in all, I think the hotel needs to visit some of it's competition to see what good service involves.

We chose to stay at Le Saint-Supice instead of other hotels after calling the hotel and talking with the receptionist, who was enthusiastic and claimed to be a really dog friendly hotel. We were excited about our booking and had high expectations (we usually choose to stay at the W or Kimpton hotels when we want a dog friendly place but wanted to try this place after reading such great reviews). Upon arriving i was a little turned off by the receptionists lack of life. She was cold and showed no emotion, however, she did tell us we had been upgraded to a suite. We were excited. But upon entering you could tell that we were in the dog section. The room smelled of bleach and cleaning product. Something we NEVER experience at other high end hotels. It really irked me since we do have such a well behaved pup who doesn't bark, chew on things, go indoors plus we are responsible pet owners. Also, isnt that what the pet deposit for? Fast forward to the next day when we leave our hotel around 11 to explore the city. We came back at 3:30 to find an employee and cleaning lady in our room with our pup. No big deal, i guess the cleaning lady was scared of dogs (then why is she working on the pet friendly floor?!) However, i was turned off that the room was not cleaned during the prime rest, get ready before dinner time. My partner and I had to leave the room since our room was just starting to be cleaned. However, before doing so we put something in the safe. I turned around and saw her staring at us punch in our code. It was awkward... i tried to close the door to obstruct but it wasn't happening since two people were there. She was just staring... she didn't even turn around or continue cleaning when we made eye contact. My partner I left and were walking down the street with our pup, when i awkwardly brought it up. He acknowledged it too... so he went back to the hotel and had to ask her to leave the room so he could put a new code into the safe. This is completely unacceptable from a hotel staff. In no way should a guest feel unsafe about leaving possessions in their room. Besides our room should have been cleaned by then and we should not have even had to deal with that awkwardness. Also, the first night we were there we had a turn down service. The second just water left by the door, probably because of our dog Theo. Which again, don't offer a service and then not provide it because of a pet. St. Sulpice could be a nice hotel. It has the bones and location to do so. However, for the price I feel the staff needs to step it up a notch. Doormen and staff should greet you and get to know guests by name. Dog owners should not be treated like second class guests.

The S Le Restaurant specializes in steaks, seafood and delicacies of the region and inside is stylishly elegant, but during the summer months the terrace with wicker chairs, water fountains, flowers and foliage is a most romantic place to lunch or dine for locals and hotel guests alike. Montreal is a city of diversity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be it the multi-national communities, the varied, ethnic cuisines, fascinating neighbourhoods and marvellous mix of people. Everywhere you go the eye alights on interesting architecture (keep a lookout for outdoor spiral staircases along Laval Street), historical buildings, and a myriad of eateries. Of course, shopping the elegant chi-chi boutiques for designer clothes is also an important part of this vibrant city.

My only major concern is the unfortunate noise level from the street. Even when people were conversing at normal volumes outside e.g. doorman giving directions to a cab, we would easily hear it in our room. This was not a problem as this type of occurrence happened during day or evening hours. However, it was much worse when late night revelers were walking past our hotel on their way home. I was woken up at least 6 times during the night, with each passing group and I am a very sound sleeper. I would stay in this hotel again but ONLY in a room that did not front the street. I think the hotel would be best served by investing in some sound proof windows as if I were offered my room again, I would have to decline.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, MA", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "Tishphotog", "ReviewID": "UR88853267", "Content": "Beautiful architecture and decor, helpful front desk and bellmen, nice room, great location in old town, good value.

Place is nice but not spectacular, for the amt of $, if you can get another hotel w/a WARM breakfast take it. Their breakfast is a choice of 3 cereals, 3 types of cold pastries, dried fruit and yogurt). The concierges: Maxim, Etienne and Alan were very informative. Housekeeper Guadalupe was very sweet. Overall nice stay, but not something to rage about. Next time, I'll try a different place. Definitely recommend you check out the room, even under the sheets, before accepting it. Also, on the Friday nite that we were there the downstairs bar hosted a very loud party which went on until the wee morning hours. I was awoken at 4 am by people smoking and laughing loudly in the outside terrace. If business travel is what you are after, you may want to opt for a quieter place. Although the staff were very apologetic to the hotel guests the next morning, that wasn't going to replace the sleep everyone had lost the nite before. It should be noted that the entire hotel only has ONE pc for internet access and it's in the lobby next to the valet, no privacy and sometimes you have to queue up to use it. Last note: The murphy bed is located next to the kitchenette. I am a light sleeper and was awoken on the 2nd nite by a dripping noise that resembled Chinese torture.

One thing that was dissappointing were the hidden charges that were not at all explained up front. I immediately had a hold put on my credit card without any explanation beforehand. I also was unaware until checkout that I was being charged for internet use. I was offered and given the Wi-Fi information without mention of cost and therefore used the internet more than I would have had I known I was being charged. I also had to pay $1.00 for each local call I made. Again, had I known this was the case I would have used my cell phone which would have had a cheaper rate even with it being an international call. I was also informed prior to my stay by Hotels.com that the parking rates were $15.00 per day, only to find out it was actually $25.00 per day. Another disappointment was the \"continental breakfast\" I ordered through room service. The description made it sound plentiful and worth the $16 charge. However, it was one plate with a few pieces of overly ripe melon, a miniature muffin, two miniature croissants and a small dannon yogurt. It definitely makes more sense to go around the corner to the quaint little cafe that will charge you half that price for a full breakfast. (Also, just a tip, don't; even ask for the mini bar key - go to a convenience store and pick up all the drinks and snacks your heart desires as even a can of coca cola costs $3.50) Again, the staff were very polite, especially the maintenance staff and door men.

I asked the desk about this and they said it was standard procedure and it would be reversed when I check out, which is fine but I should have been advised this was the case at check in and was not. Then I asked the concierge about day trips to Quebec city and was advised the tour operator only does 2 trips a week at this time of year and the dates did not suit me due to the conference but he gave me the tourist brochure anyway. When I read it later the brochure clearly stated daily tours till end of October, I checked on-line and yes this was the case so approached a different concierge the following day who fed me the 2 trips a week response. I had to show him the brochure and explain that I had checked on line before he called the tour operator and I was booked in on the day I wanted. i got the same sense of indifference from the restaurant staff the 1 night I ate there as I wasnt prepared to go back.

We purposefully seek out dog friendly hotels so as not to annoy other patrons. Our dog has travelled with us extensively and this is the first time we've had a problem. When making our reservation, I explicitly let the hotel know that we would have him with us. Unbeknownst to us, they have a \"dog\" floor (the 1st). Well, we were placed on the 3rd floor and it was a disaster from the get go. As soon as leaving for dinner at 9pm the first night, we were called because the dog was barking. We immediately returned home to calm him (first night and all...). This pattern repeated itself throughout the weekend (2pm in the afternoon, noon, 3pm). Now each subsequent time we returned the dog was NOT barking. We waited outside the room for 20 mins each time...no barking. The geriatric American couple next door apparently had decided to spend the entirety of their vacation holed up in the bland corporate hotel rooms the Saint-Sulpice offers, and they had ZERO tolerance for even 10 mins of barking (when the maid would walk in,etc). We offered to change rooms, but the hotel could not accommodate. The frequent calls from the hotel and their demands for us to return were ruining our vacation. We went to the front desk to try to sort something out, and the concierge proceeded to tell us that we would have to either SIT in the room at all hours with the dog OR take him with us everywhere. Only after prodding did he finally admit that the 1st floor was the dog floor and that they had failed to place us in such a room (incidentally, we walked the first floor...FULL of barking dogs). The concierge was rude, condescending, and dismissive. I explained to him that if the hotel had told us that they were dog friendly if and only if 1) the dog NEVER barked and 2) if he did, the couple would be expected to stay in the room with the dog the ENTIRE time, that we never would've reserved a room here. The situation was incredibly frustrating because the hotel blamed us for their mistake. Each time we returned, the dog was NOT barking. Each time they called, we rushed home. Had they simply had us on the 1st floor, with the rest of dog rooms, all of this could've been avoided. Instead, they were utterly inflexible. The only service staff member of any merit was Matthew---the late night concierge. Overall, old Montreal is full of gluttonous American tourists. It's more akin to Epcot Europe than anything resembling an authentic \"old world\" experience.

Several lighting fixtures didn't work - would have been a nuisance if I were a business traveler. Location is great, central. Front of house staff was great - helpful, pleasant and cheerful. Wife had problem with noise emanating from the courtyard and/or street at late hours - she's a very light sleeper but if you are as well, you may wish to ask about noise issues for your specific room. Only real beef I had was really slow service for the breakfast buffet, having to get up to get ourselves, coffee, coffee cups, cutlery, condiments. You would think that staff seeing your predicament would come to rescue, but they appeared clueless (and quite young and not well-trained). Rule #1 is get the coffee out hot and quick ands then keep checking back regularly. The staff needs extra training and a senior food 'n bev person on-site to get this operation in gear. And maybe an extra set of hands at peak service times. At the prices being charged there is really no excuse for this level of service. None. I couldn't get the wi-fi to work either. On the plus side, my wife asked for a room fan the second night to drown out the outside noise and staff gladly obliged.

The living area and bathroom were excessively large and the bedroom was too small. - wi-fi completely unusable in the room. - Room service did not promptly collect dirty dishes in hallway - The bed quality does not live up to room price. The king bed wasn't horrible but it was not good either. After reading reviews prior to our trip I learned that this 4 star hotel actually uses Murphy beds in some rooms. I called the hotel and requested normal bed, which they agreed to assign. The good news was that the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bad news was the non-Murphy bed wasn't that great either. - They over-do the air freshener in the rooms (perhaps because they allow pets?). Bottom line - this is a fine hotel and most of the negatives were not all that bad. We got a pretty good price on the room (under $200/night) so I could overlook some of the issues. I would have been disappointed if I had paid in the $250+ range. Based on recent management comments, it appears they are working towards addressing the two biggest problems, the beds and the wi-fi. Other thoughts: - We found the best restaurants to be in the Plateau area while the ones in Old Montreal were generally overpriced and very average quality. While the metro is only 2-3 blocks away from Le Saint-Sulpice, the blocks seem long in 90 degree heat (probably longer in freezing weather). If you don't want to spend $ on cabs throughout your stay you may want to consider locations that have easy access to the Plateau area. - We picked up a 3 day museum and metro pass at the tourist information center for $50/each....a great value and we didn't have to worry about paying fares and admission everywhere we went.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgood but not great\u201d", "Author": "educationtogo", "ReviewID": "UR72328364", "Content": "Like many of the other reviewers of this hotel, I appreciated the location, the courtyard restaurant, the valet parking and the staff, especially the concierge.

We had two very hungry young kids and we wanted a convenient French restaurant in the neighborhood. The concierge circled a place on the map which was illegible and finally when we found the place (after 20 minutes of walking around), the restaurant told us that we could not come in with small children because it is a bar/club. So we ended up finding our own place. Nevertheless, we didn't ask the concierge for further advice. Secondly, parking is ridiculously expensive. It cost us $32 a night to park our minivan. We found out at the end of our stay that the garage down the street charges $15 a night. Too bad, we didn't know about that earlier. Aside from the above issues, we had a great stay.

Cruising the channels I couldn't find it and was scrambling to figure out what station it might be on. Not knowing the stations in Canada, I called down to the front desk. The desk immediately sent some one up( someone into sports) and they went through all the channels with me and when we couldn't find it, he then used the internet to verify what station it should've been on(which it wasn;t) after apologizing for something that was beyond his control, I thanked him and proceeded to stew about not being able to watch. Ten minutes later, he comes back up and had found a canadian site streaming the game online. I promptly found the site and ended up happily watching the game.

I went to Montreal with my 9 year-old son and mother in September 2009. We booked this hotel through Expedia.com and got a suite on the top floor for $210 per night, including taxes. The suite was huge and beautiful. The bathroom had a huge oval tub and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. Seriously, the bathroom was the size of 2-3 normal bathrooms. There was a separated bedroom with a queen size bed, vanity area, and bathrobes. The bedroom had french doors to the living room which had a fireplace, tv, sleeper sofa, and a few chairs, plus a writing desk. Off to one side was a kitchenette that had a microwave, fridge and all the stuff you need to cook. One of the things I really loved though was a huge wall of windows that you could open and walk out onto a tiny balcony. We ate out on the patio one night and you could see the river. I liked the location a lot because its 2 blocks to everything, but you somehow feel this part of the Old Town is just a little quieter. This hotel is literally right next to Notre Dame Cathedral, which I didn't realize until we got there. If you are in Montreal on a weekend, some of the hotels can be really noisy due to the bars below and open windows, so I liked that it wasn't so noisy. The hotel came with a free breakfast, which was a nice little buffet with pastries, fruit, yogurt, and some meats, plus the waiter gave you juice, coffee, and water. Only 2 persons were covered, so we had to pay extra for my son, which wasn't a problem. The property itself is a boutique type hotel with a small rear garden (I think the restaurant may serve lunch there?), a wine cellar/breakfast area, and there was also a free business center. Or business closet (literally it was a tiny room), but whatever -- there was a computer I could use for free to print out my boarding passes. I brought my laptop with me, so I also had free wi-fi in my room. I wasn't that thrilled with the connection speed though, so I didn't use my laptop very much. The only downside to this place is there is no pool or exercise facility, and they don't give you passes to go elsewhere like many hotels in this price range.

Careful of those doggy rooms as they told me they are not a restricted set of rooms in the hotel. So if your room looks it, it probably had Rover as a guest for a recent night's stay. We later got two rooms that were more than adequate and bordered on 'luxo, but without premium TV channels I wondered how luxo it really was. The internet connection did not work well on wireless in my room and they desk clerk quickly came up with ethernet cables (no deposit - thank you) so that we were up and connected in no time. I found the amenities to be quite nice and only noticed one major design flaw. There was a frosted glass window between the bathroom and the sleeping area. So when this old guy got up to use the loo in the middle of the night he risked waking up his partner as she wash suddenly awash in the warm glow of the bathroom lighting. She didn't wake, but a light sleeper might have done so. The next morning we found our favorite newspaper (not a local one) outside our room. That continued until the weekend when it abrupt;y stopped. The front desk reported the had not gotten delivery. I found the staff to be most helpful and friendly, Prior reviews have commented on this in a negative way but I found nothing to criticize. They even gave me some secret hints as to where to park my car on the street for free in this otherwise cramped and expensive parking area of town. The valet parking seemed o.k but was not in my budget. We did not eat at the restaurant although we walked through it several times as a shortcut to get out of the hotel onto the next street. The breakfast buffet looked tired and unappealing to me. In the evening, the restaurant was fairly empty and a very tired trio played exceptionally tired music with a consistently tiresome beat. Even if the food were great (and I have no idea) , the music would have driven me away. I had the sense this restaurant could be a great place with a little work. I heartily recommend the St. Sulpice with the above caveats. Do try to get it at a substantial discount to the rack rates. The discounts are out there and that's what the place is worth, not the heavy prices they advertise. And don't worry if the desk clerk knows you are budget minded. They won't treat you any differently than those who pay twice as much as you.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful space and great location\u201d", "Author": "southernbychoice37", "ReviewID": "UR48396434", "Content": "This was our first visit to Montreal and we chose Le Saint Sulpice based on the glowing tripadvisor reviews.

Neither of us have ever been to Montreal before. We were both very pleased with our experience at Le Saint Sulpice. It is a block away from one of the main streets in Old Montreal, Rue Saint Paul, and is located on the same block as Notre Dame Basilica. There are also a ton of restaurants, cafes, shops, and galleries within walking distance. The hotel was very clean and had a modern, contemporary feel. Our suite had a cozy apartment feel, but was spacious. The bathrooms had both a shower stall & very large tub. The staff was very hospitable, especially the concierge. Everyone was extremely friendly, helpful, and fluent in both French & English. We didn't eat at the restaurant within the hotel with exception of breakfast which was included in our package. It was a hot breakfast but didn't vary from day to day (no big deal). The only complaint, which is trivial, was scheduling spa services. One of the main reasons why I booked this hotel was the spa located within the hotel. However, the massage therapists had to be contacted by the front desk personnel in order to make the appointment, and it took at least 3 requests to the front desk before they were able to confirm an appointment for me. It was a minor hassle, but I definitely had to be persistent. There is one other thing that I wanted to note. It did not necessarily bother me, but I found it unusual...on 2 of the 3 days of our stay, a staff member entered our hotel room unannounced mid-day to drop off bottles of water. I appreciated the bottles of water, but the woman entered the room w/o knocking both days. On one of the days, my husband and I were napping, so I was a little startled when I heard another voice in the room suddenly. So, if you plan on considering Le Saint Sulpice (and I strongly recommend it), just be forewarned. Just another recommendation regardless of where you decide to stay, definitely make it a point to eat at the Bonaparte restaurant. It is only a block away from the hotel and it is well worth it!

The hotel is ok, all suites and the staff are great. The concierge was especially outstanding (Etienne) and the others were very accommodating, helpful and friendly. No eyerolls, or other obnoxious behavior.Our room had obviously had someone smoking in it before we moved in and they were never able to remove the odor. The carpet was not very clean, no slippers furnished by the hotel and the very nice bathrobes were very rough feeling and so were the towels. The bathroom was small, with no separate shower and tub as the advertising had led us to believe. The furnishings in all that space devoted to LR and Kitchen was sparsely furnished and not very comfortable to lounge in at night. The TV was a flat screen but no HD cable so lousy picture. Bed was a Queen (No Kings in the hotel) and not very comfortable for two tall people. Breakfast was not included in our rate, as Expedia had led us to expect (\"Oh, it's your anniversary? We'll ask the hotel to include breakfast-they usually do\") None of that and the hotel swears that they NEVER include breakfast in Expedia bookings. Breakfast was more than $30 for two. Our guidebook discouraged the use of the hotel restaurant so we never ate there for dinner. Montreal is full of outstanding restaurants, though most are New York pricey, given the current rate of exchange (C1.06 for a US 1.00). Their business center is way too small (only 1 PC) but what they have is excellent. Just may require considerable wait time to check your email. Great internet speed and a first class printer. We would look at other hotels in the same part of town, which include breakfast in the rate but if you get a \"deal\" the St. Sulpice is okay.

On our last morning, there were only cereals, toast and some stale fruit to choose from. The service is smiley but a bit aloof. It takes an effort to flag a waiter for a second cup of coffee. The beds are very uncomfortable and we came away with serious back and neck aches. In sum, this is more a 3 star hotel rather than the luxury 4+ star establishment it touts itself to be.

It is a lovely hotel situated in Old Montreal. We arrived quite late on a Sunday night in March, and our car was quickly unloaded and we were settled in our suite within minutes. The beautiful entrance and lobby of the hotel was quite large, with several different seating areas scattered throughout the area. One of the groupings was extra special with a cozy fireplace. All the rooms at the hotel, are basicaly suites. They are a generous size and very comfortable and homey, well designed and nicely decorated. You can tell a lot of thought went into making their guests as content as possible. The entrance to our suite was a good size. It had a place for our boots and shoes and the usual type closet. What made it really stand out, was the entrance also had a little table with two chairs which I really liked and thought was such a nice touch. It was different to have a sitting area in the entrance and it was one of the things I liked most about our suite. Once we walked past the entrance, we noticed a small counter top stove and a little fridge and all the necessary cooking accessories (in an overhead cabinet) we would need if we decided to cook in our room. The livingroom was quite pretty, it had a sofa and a comfty leather chair, a few accent tables and lamps and an electric fireplace across from the sofa. Also, in the liviingroom area there was a desk with a chair where you could sit and make phone calls or use your computer. Next to the desk there was a set of patio doors opening onto a balcony. For obvious reasons we didn't even open the doors, unless we wanted to have a mountain of snow in our room! I am sure in the summer it would be wonderful! The suites have a separate bedroom with french doors, which I felt really added to the character of the space. There were two large television sets (not flat screen, not that it mattered to us, but I know it is important to some travellers that is why I mention it), one in the livingroom and one on the bedroom. There are a few features that made this hotel stand out. The first that I found so useful was the two closets in the bedroom. It was so handy that we could have our own closet , and it made it so much easier to unpack and everything was then at our fingertips. The bedroom also had a dresser with large drawers, that again served a very useful purpose. It was great to have a portable telephone in the bedroom. Actually, come to think of it this was the first hotel we ever stayed in that had portable phones. The powder room was quite large, well lit, super clean, with a big shower, big bathtub, lovely sink area and a full length mirror on the back of the door. One of the walls had a few small, built in glass shelves, where we put our incidentals. There were bathrobes provided, a hairdryer and wonderful L'Occitane products that were restocked daily. I didn't really like the towels....when I go to a hotel I find white towels look so crisp and clean and the towels here were beige. I realize it may seem petty, but it is just a personal preference. Colour aside, I have very sensitive skin and I found the towels, were a little on the ruff side. I am quite sure they were high quality towels, however I did want to mention it as I know it is that kind of information that I find helpful when reading reviews. If we stay here again I would bring a towel from home. And really I should have brought my own to begin with, it completely slipped my mind. I do want to make it clear though, If you don't have sensitive skin you will be fine with the towels. The only complaint, was one morning there was no hot water. I realize this can happen anywhere, but since we were not informed about the problem, we found out the hard way. A simple note under the door, or a message left on the telephone would have been greatly appreciated. And when I called down to ask if there was something wrong with the hot water, I found the reception could have been a little nicer. The hot water was off most of the day, by the next morning it was working again. The following day we were left a note of apology in our room with 4 chocolates. If we would have been told about the problem, I probably wouldn't even be mentioning it right now. A little customer relations when problems such as that arise, I find goes a long way. We found the hotel staff for the most part very professional, the concierge desk and valets were very helpful and friendly, and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job and even left us little notes in our room thanking us for the tip we left her, which I thought was so nice. Because of the terrific amount of snow while we were in the city, we could not take advantage of the great location of the hotel. If the weather would have co-operated we could have walked to many places. We did walk to the Basilica and to a few restaurants nearby. I am certain in the warmer months it would be an ideal location. The area surrounding the hotel seemed very quaint, and a few times we saw horse drawn carriages going by the hotel. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Saint-Sulpice and we would not hesitate to go back. I would like to thank fellow Trip Advisor member JDP112456 for suggesting this hotel, and in turn I feel comfortable recommending this hotel to other travellers.

Here is my opinion of this hotel. The location was very good. It is in the heart of Old Montreal. All of the tourist attractions in this area are within walking distance. The metro station Place d'Arms is also within walking distance and it is very easy to navigate the metro system. The church is next door. (Note: if you want to see the church you have to pay to enter, unless you are attending mass. I found this a bit ridiculous. I have never paid to enter a church anywhere in the world.) The hotel is clean and modern. The room we had was very spacious. The bathroom had the biggest shower I have ever seen. It also had a huge sunken bathtub. So I guess the choice to stay here was a good one. But, although the concierge was helpful, I thought the staff was a bit brisk.I do not know how to explain it. We needed the sofa bed turned down b/c we traveled with our children. I have stayed in other hotels with sofa beds and when the room is made up in the moring the sofa is put back together and then at night turned down once again. Here it stayed a bed the whole time therefore taking seating and general space away. At night housekeeping comes by with complimentary water, but that's it the room is not freshened up again. Also the last day we were there we left the room at 8:00 am and returnted after 3:00 and the room had not been cleaned. The hotel was not full so I do not know what happened.

One, we were travelling with a dog, and Saint Sulpice accepts dogs; two, the location in the heart of old Montreal; and three, it was billed as a luxury four star hotel. The room we were assigned was on the fifth floor and looked out onto the street. It was undoubtedly a \"dog\" room, as the carpet was dirty and full of stains. I would definitely recommend asking for a room overlooking the inner courtyard, and this side of the hotel is extremely dark, and because it overlooks the street, it was very noisy at nightime, particularly between midnight and 2 AM, when the bars are closing. Because we were there on the weekend, when we stepped out on Saturday, and again on Sunday, there was vomit on the sidewalk, a little ways down from the hotel, which I only narrowly avoided stepping into. This mess was still there a few hours later when we returned from lunch. The room itself is very large, with a separate bedroom and also has a tiny kitchenette. The room had evidence of the previous person, with grime on the sink and a dirty table. The outside door was covered with dust. The most difficult part of the room was how gloomy it was, we left all of the lights on all of the time, and it still felt extremely dark. We ordered room service our first night and had guinea fowl and shrimp. The guiney fowl was tough and tasteless, and the shrimp dish was so salty it was inedible. Heavily salted dishes are often a sign of the use of powdered stocks, so anyone allergic to MSG should avoid this food, as I had a bad reaction to it. We had tremendous difficulty getting our room cleaned. It simply didn't happen the first day there (although we were out from 12-3). On the second day, I called and requested a specific time to have it cleaned, which it was. On the third day, I called and asked to have it cleaned while we were out, and was told that it would not be possible to ask for a specific time for cleaning, although their literature suggests that one can do this. Sure enough, when we returned after being out for 3 hours in the afternoon, the room still wasn't cleaned, with no evidence of the housekeeping cart even being on our floor. We called down again, and again had to make arrangements to leave the room for an hour and a half, and when we returned at five, it had finally been cleaned. We asked for a new hairdryer as the one in our room wasn't working, but it was never replaced. We appeared to be the only people on the fifth floor, perhaps this is why we were forgotten. Although the hotel web site suggests the hotel has a dedicated concierge, when we went down to the front desk to ask the concierge a question, it was the same young man who checked us in. While he was very sweet, he wasn't very informative. We asked him if there were any outdoor restaurants where our dog would be allowed, and he replied that there had been a huge \"crackdown\" on dogs on patios, and there were no restaurants that accepted dogs. This turned out not to be true, as when we went around and asked, there were several outdoor restaurants that accepted dogs. The breakfast itself was included with the room and was a continental style buffet, with a four dollar surcharge for the hot items. We ate there once, and it was pretty awful. The bacon was rancid (I've never had rancid bacon, so it must have been very old), and the bread was dried out brown and white wonder bread. At 9:30 there was only one slice of brown bread left, and it was not refilled during the time I was there. I guess I was expecting a bit more than economy hotel type food. The coffee was tepid and served with milk instead of cream. The service was surly, at best, and it took forever to get a bill. There is a very sweet little breakfast place around the corner, I would recommend avoiding the restaurant at all costs. I spoke French the entire time I was there, thus we were not given indifferent service because we wen't making the effort to use the language. We asked for a room with a balcony, and although the hotel was quite empty, we were not accomodated, no doubt due to the fact we were travelling with a dog, and there are only a few doggie rooms. There appears to be a shortage of staff, perhaps because we were travelling in the off season. If you are travelling with a dog, there is wonderful green space just steps away from this hotel, down by the water. Otherwise, I would not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Advice\u201d", "Author": "couple-age50", "ReviewID": "UR8220276", "Content": "Simply put..... an outstanding hotel and stay in Vieux-Montreal.

A few specific points: The restaurant is very nice - we had a good meal and were able to have dessert in the room which was nice; while the fold-away beds are a novelty, we didn't really see the point with such huge hotel rooms; the rooms are very dimly lit despite several lamps dotted around - one good light wouldn't go amiss; housekeeping was a bit variable - maybe depending on who made up the room; and the fact that the hotel allows dogs means that you occasionally hear a bark coming from the corridor or the room next door!

Our stay at this hotel did not get off to a promising start. The confirmation e-mail we received from the hotel stated that we would get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a room with fireplace OR balcony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (well, a balcony in early March, in Montreal...??). The lady at reception had a little bit of an attitude (later on she asked me to show some ID in order to make a new keycard, because my old one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work anymore; by that time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been at the hotel for 4 days and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d only seen me walking in and out about a hundred times\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6!); I should add that she was the ONLY person we found a bit unfriendly, the GUYS were all great! Anyway, she immediately told us that no rooms with a fireplace were available at all (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry, but we have 91% occupancy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). At this my husband got a bit annoyed, and she started click-clacking on her computer for a while; in the end she said that a room with a fireplace would become available the next day. However, she stressed that that room would be exactly the same as the room we would get in the first place, the only difference being that it had a wood-burning fireplace. We decided to check out the new room the next morning, and decide then. The room we got on the first night was quite large (a real suite) and very clean. And it did in fact have a gas fireplace though not a wood-burning one. However, it was a bit long and narrow, and, more importantly, it was VERY hot; it appeared that the thermostat wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, so we had no way to lower the heat. The next day we went to check out the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room; the lady at reception once again stressed that apart from the fireplace this room was exactly the same. However, this room proved to be HUGE, much larger than our old one, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, all (like everything else in the hotel) very clean and in immaculate condition. Also, it was cool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thermostat functioning just fine here. So our decision was an easy one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we moved immediately. I should also note that the Hotel St. Sulpice was absolutely quiet; no sound to be heard either from the street or from inside the hotel. The only exception was, in our new room, the sound of (we thought) some heating installation just above our head (we were on the 6th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c top- floor of the hotel) which we could hear \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhooshing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and clunking. But we very quickly got used to this, and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us at all. Apart from our somewhat shaky start, I have nothing but positives to report about this hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, very very quiet, excellent housekeeping. We had a wonderful housekeeper in fact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very cheerful lady from Ghana who showed up at 9 in the morning. So our room had been done by the time we finished breakfast! The restaurant was excellent, and the bar (while perhaps a tad on the small side) very cosy, with friendly barkeepers. Nice complimentary breakfast, we had the continental one but it was more than adequate. And again, friendly and quick service both at breakfast and at dinner. Fantastic location, within 5 minutes walking distance from lots of restaurants, bars, art galleries etc. etc. But in spite of all this the hotel itself was very quiet, as said. So on the whole we had a very very positive experience at this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much recommended! We also checked out several other hotels in Old Montreal; I would like to give my impressions below. Please note that we did NOT stay at these places, so these are just our first impressions! Auberge Bonaparte. We did not stay here but an acquaintance of ours, who was in Montreal at the same time, did. He was extremely positive about the hotel. We had dinner at the restaurant, and it was excellent. Great atmosphere in the lobby too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c staff appeared very friendly. On the whole, the hotel seemed somewhat less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcupscale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than St. Sulpice, but of course it was quite a bit cheaper too! Hotel Nelligan. Looked like an absolute winner to us! This is the place we would like to try next time we are in Montreal. Like St. Sulpice the lobby is spacious, but the atmosphere is warmer. Large bar with (unusually) lots of different draft beers. Fantastic layout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we loved the courtyard and the easy chairs. Excellent service, too. Dinner at the restaurant (Verses) is certainly the best we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had while in Montreal. Hotel XIe siecle. Checked this out briefly. It looked very nice: basic, unpretentious and very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbookish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Lots of books in the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people reading, working at their laptops, etc. Our sort of place for sure. Le St. James. We had an excellent cup of coffee here. Wow, what a place! This has got to be one of Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most expensive hotels, and it shows. A beautiful building, perfectly kept and furnishing, extremely polite and friendly waiters, all silver coffee service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everything just perfect and VERY chic. If we would have just a little more money (or if the hotel has some packages at a reduced price) we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to stay here. Auberge du Vieux Port. Again, checked it out briefly. Great location, right on the water on one side, and on one of Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most touristy streets (but nice) on the other side. The hotel itself looked fairly basic and unpretentious, with a small but friendly- and cosy-looking lobby. Definitely worth a try! Hotel des Armes. Actually, we didn't really check out this hotel. We did attempt to have dinner at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, Suite 701. But after have waited near the entrance for five minutes or so, and having been totally ignored by the waiters who were occupied with the few guests, we left. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the atmosphere, and also we found it significant that on evening when just about all restaurants were quite full, this one was almost empty.

But, I think it really depends what you are looking for, and what your preference is. For my wife and I, we didn't realize until staying at st. sulpice that we prefer a cozy (but good size) hotel room over a suite hotel room with kitchenette, and living area space. I think these rooms are ideal for people who have a family, or have friends over to enjoy a drink before a night on the town. If thats the case, st. sulpice can't be beat. As for the location, it's ideal for old montreal, but it's still a 20 minute walk or so up to saint catherine. There are many other hotels which are located more in the middle (10 minutes to old montreal, 10 minutes to downtown). But again, if staying in Old Montreal is your thing, the location can't be beat. Another thing which I noticed on tripadvisor were the comments about the murphy bed. I agree, there is simply no need for it, and it's not all that comfortable. The room is big enough, I won't need to put the bed back into the wall to save space? Also, the shower 'wall' which you can see the shadows from the living room just doesn't make alot of sense. I'm into chic and trendy things, but I found this unnecessary. So, I don't want to be too hard on st. sulpice (I did give it 4) because although it's not exactly what my wife and I were looking for, it could be ideal for others.", "Date": "November 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWedding proposal blessed by the Sulpice gods\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4103110", "Content": "I've recently stayed at the St-Sulpice as I wanted a special place to do my wedding proposal.

It is a very nice hotel in Old Montreal. Basically, all the past reviews are true. The service is excellent and the hotel is good. CONCIERGE: As it was our 26th anniversary, I had called the concierge to have a nice bottle of Champagne waiting and I wanted a CD player. Both were there. I also had him make dinner reservations for us- he made them at Modavie, a short walk away. I did it all by email. ROOM: Stayed in the room with the Murphy Bed. (We weren't offered an upgrade, which I was hoping for.) About that Murphy Bed: I don't understand the need for it. Why not a regular bed? AND, yes, it was NOT comfortable. Very hard and thin. Neither my husband or I slept well. That glass wall/panel from the bathroom was sort of strange. The bathroom light would light up the bed room. We didn't like that. Fireplace- UGLY electric fireplace. While it may add some ambiance to the room maybe in the winter, it took up MUCH space. And was VERY UGLY. Furniture was comfortable. My husband loved the leather chair. I actually slept on the sofa our 3rd night because my back couldn't take the bed another night. I didn't open it up- just slept on top of it. The kitchenette was cute and looked efficient. We didn't use it- just the refridgerator. AC was good- no problems. We had a nightly turndown- nice touch. Daily paper- English. The bathroom (except that glass wall) is simply STUNNING. The soaking tub was to die for! Toiletries okay- BTW- the \"better\" rooms get L'Occitane. I felt a little insulted- I was paying ALOT of $$ too! (took some L'Occitane shampoo from the housekeeper cart though- shame on me....) There was virtually no noise from the street when the windows were shut. That was nice because it is in a very busy neighborhood. Robes were soft and comfy. BREAKFAST: It was okay. It is included with most room rate packages. Astounding $18 dollars if you pay separately! It is cold continental but for $2 more you can have steam table eggs & bacon. They used THE SAME pastries everyday though! Every morning there was less pastry selection and they were clearly from the day before. NOT a nice touch. They should just buy less each time so they can refresh daily. Service in restaurant (breakfast) was excellent. We didn't eat any other meals there. VALET: Some of the nicest guys I've met! Very friendly AND efficient. Don't lament the cost- there is pretty much no where to park on your own, so just pay it and grin & bear it. MINIBAR: Like any other, SUPER expensive. We never use them. BUT CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY- we were charged for something we didn't use. We were checking our bill daily on the TV. No problem. When we told them, they apologized and promptly took it off. It is in a very convenient location. Walking distance to everything in Old Montreal. Very beautiful, especially while we were there. You are TAXED to death in Montreal/Quebec. Keep that in mind when you figure out gratuities. We got about $44 US back when we crossed the border. Gas is cheaper there- at least when we were there. Who knows now what with how rapidly the price is going up. MONTREAL DRIVERS: CAUTION-CAUTION-CAUTION-CAUTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And people say Massachusetts drivers are BAD. Need I say anything more? We ate at Modavie- good Jazz band and good food The Keg- very good and reasonable priced Can't remember where else....sorry. It was an outside restaurant that was very good- right near Modavie.

We came to the very lovely city of Montreal for the Cirque du Soleil water show at the FINA Water Olympics. Le Saint Sulpice easy exceeded our expectations in several respects. We left quite pleased with our stay and very willing to return. Le Saint Sulpice is a boutique hotel located in Old Montreal (le Vieux-Montr\u00c3\u00a9al). The Old Montreal district is appropriately lively with a great many shops, restaurants, and public spaces. The streets were quite busy until very late in the evening. We had dinner at a great French/Italian fusion restaurant located just a few blocks from the hotel. The restaurant was recommended by the concierge who also made our reservations. The hotel staff were very professional and helpful. Everyone was friendly and perfectly bilingual. We picked up a few basic words of French which seem to have been appreciated. The hotel staff provided culinary recommendations as well as directions around the city. They carefully marked each destination on our map and explained how to use the Metro which was useful. We would never have been able to get home from the FINA opening ceremonies without the subway. Via the Metro it was facile. The hotel is located right next to a famous Montreal church, the Notre-Dame Basilica. The church was then showing \"Saint Peter and the Vatican: The Legacy of the Popes\" a fascinating exhibit of Papal art going back to the very beginnings of the church. Indeed, the exhibit was more about the history of the church than the many artistic wonders of the Papacy (of which their were many). The hotel is quite new (three years old, I think) although the building might be from an earlier period. The rooms are quite spacious and organized as suites (at least ours was). Each of the rooms and the common areas are nicely decorated. However, I am not the right person to comment on the architectural nuances. However, one nice touch was a translucent mirror wall between the bedroom and the bathroom. You couldn't see into the bathroom. However, if the bathroom lights were on, the bedroom was partially illuminated. Our suite included a queen bed that was very comfortable. During our stay, the weather in Montreal was balmy with highs around 28/29 Centigrade (middles 80s in Fahrenheit). After a long day walking around Montreal including climbing Mount Royal, our room, cooled to perfection was a welcome respite. The hotel includes an indoor/outdoor restaurant that looked very nice. However, we never had an opportunity to try it. Montreal has at least one other entertainment district, in addition to Old Montreal. We found a great many nice restaurants around Crescent street located below Mount Royal. This area is a reasonable walk from the hotel, although after a full day including Jazz until 1 AM, we did take a cab home. Interestingly enough, the Jazz club (Upstairs) was pointed out to us by the Montreal police who were quite friendly and helpful. My only modest critique of Le Saint Sulpice is that the shower water pressure was somewhat lower than expected. The hotel was perfectly clean although we never saw the stuff who kept it that way. Overall, Le Saint Sulpice was a great choice in a city with many hotels. Notably, it wasn't particularly expensive in spite of the many amenities and services offered.

Our decision to stay here was mostly based on the positive reviews that were posted on this site, and I honestly can't say one bad thing about it (well, except for the free buffet breakfast included with our room rate. It was mediocre, but free, so we weren't complaining). We arrived around 1:30 AM and were greeted with a friendly smile. The air conditioner wasn't working properly in our room, so after 3 attempts to fix the problem, we were moved (and upgraded) the very next day. The rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable. We found the staff to be very helpful. We lost our travel book on the flight, so we relied heavily on the concierge for dinner suggestions. We can honestly say that every restaurant that was recommended (and many that we stumbled across on our own) were excellent. The \"okay\" ones were still above average. We found the location of the hotel to be perfect. Old Port was a couple blocks away. Place Jacques-Cartier is a must see (located in the Old Port area). It is mainly a pedestrian street loaded with quaint cafes and restaurants. Rue Saint-Paul borders the hotel and is also load with fantastic restaurants and coffee shops. Chinatown is a couple blocks from the hotel. If you like good chinese food and don't need all the fluff of a fancy place, check out Beijing Restaurant. The decor is nothing fancy, but the food is great. Another great area we discovered downtown is The Latin Quarter (located off Rue St. Denis). There are a lot of cafes (not really fancy restaurants). We stumbled across Rue Prince Arthur (a cute cobble stone pedestrian St.), which also had outdoor cafes. Jazzfest was going on downtown during our stay and was amazing. It was a quick trip via metro, or a nice 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. Downtown is definitely a must see, but I definitely recommend staying in Old Montreal. It is a little quieter and more charming than downtown, but is still close to the hustle and bustle of the city. In closing, I definitely recommend Le Saint Sulpice if you are looking for a hotel that is conveniently located, quiet, charming, spacious and comfortable. We will definitely stay there again if we ever return to Montreal!", "Date": "July 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLike having a Condo in a Great Location with a friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3635916", "Content": "We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for 3 nights.

We had a standard one-bedroom suite, which was beautifully decorated with modern furnishings. The room had one of the largest bathrooms I have ever seen in a hotel room; it provided more than enough room for two people to get ready to go out for dinner. Our room also had a very comfortable leather smoking chair that was great for reading. The hotel is in a great location in the old port of Montreal; it is on the west side of the old port, so it is far enough from the really touristy part of the district. Also, it is about a five minute walk to the nearest subway station, which makes it very convenient for exploring Montreal. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. At check-in, the original room we were assigned to smelled of cigarette smoke (even though it was on a non-smoking floor); we were promptly moved to a new room. We forgot our umbrella and coats in the car (valet parking), and the bellhop went to retrieve them for us. One should keep in mind that we stayed on a weekday night, and the hotel did not seem all that busy.

This was not an issue for me, whereas my wife had her ATM card, and we had access to our $. However, the staff became extremely rude, and were calling my room constantly, demanding I come down to the front desk and pay for my room in advance for the day, every day. They absolutely added insult to injury, whereas my stay which is usually a pleasureable one turned into a real 'hassle' because of my lack of having my credit card. Finally, on the 3rd day, Monday, my bank sent a replacement card to the hotel. I packed our luggage, went down to the desk, and promptly checked out! It was unfortunate that the staff did not look into their records to see that I was a frequent guest at their hotel, who did not deserve to be treated this way.
