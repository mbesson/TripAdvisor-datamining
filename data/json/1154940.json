Except for one serious failing. Sound proofing between bedrooms! The service at reception, in the breakfast room and the maid service was unbeatable. The hotel was clean and well run. Parking in an underground car park was a welcome bonus. The restaurant next door which was under the same management was also worth visiting. Good food, reasonable pricing and friendly service.

We stayed in a double room which was adequate in size but the decor was very cheap which matched the furniture. The bathroom was fine although the outer frame of the shower required plenty of cleaning. The lighting in the room was very dim - there's a mini bar in the room but no tea or coffee making facilities. There free wifi internet. There is no in house dining so the hotel staff provide a eating voucher depending on what your stay preference is, we had room / breakfast so a voucher was provided in the morning to eat in the bar/cafe next door called Dadaumpa. The breakfast is basic but fine, we ate pasta for lunch one time which was nice but not outstanding ,the bar is open early to late ,but the downside is when you want to go to bed at night you can hear the music but its not that loud that you cannot get to sleep. Overall it's ok for somewhere to lay your head - if you're not intending to spend a lot of time in the room.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kish Island, Iran", "Title": "\u201cFew bedrooms, not a hotel but clean and TOO FAR from ROME\u201d", "Author": "Emad_Ladonni", "ReviewID": "UR95091124", "Content": "This is not a hotel, it's only pair of rooms, the rooms are clean, but small and not a good view.

You have to take 2 buses and a metro line to reach to the center of ROME. you need more than an hour to reach the city tourist attraction. of course the public transportation is very good and cheap but you need the time.

The surrounding is bad, in particular during the night, except if somebody likes to have viados and prostitutes just around the corner, and very far from Rome downtown.

It might seem like a bargain, but its not.\u201d", "Author": "shareandenjoy", "ReviewID": "UR49981433", "Content": "If you are thinking this hotel offers good value for money, you could not be more deluded. The simple truth is that by paying an extra \u00a3100 per night/room for an hotel much closer to the city centre, not only will your money be very well spent, but it will be much more convenient too. Once you have deducted what you will spend on taxis, the difference is not so much overall. The Hotel itself is clean, tidy and well presented, but the rooms are tiny. Two people can not occupy the same area of the nine by nine foot square space, most of which is taken up by the regular sized double bed anyway. If you are light sleeper stay somewhere else. The walls are paper thin, so the same applies to honeymooners! The person keeping you awake through loud snoring is in fact in the next room, could be above or below too. The windows may as well be boarded up, as there is no view worth seeing from them. Unless you like the very noisy and busy main road to the front, or the industrial estates the side and rear. I can assure you your heart will sink the moment you arrive a the roadside, there is no path either outside the Bright. If a bandit in a taxi tells you there is a suppliment to pay after eight in the evening, he is lying. You may haggle of course, but best to use a White cab with the meter running instead. The bus service from the hotel (508) runs at irregular times and does not go directly to the city, but stops at the train terminus. Now you must now endure the grubbiest stations and trains. Do not use after ten in the evening or alone. You have been warned. The taxis will charge about \u00a325 euro from Rome, you will probably have to give directions, as most look rather blank at the mention of the Bright. It's only eight kilometers outside the city centre, but somewhere most don't ever go. Food at the hotel is provided by be establishment next door. Breakfast is adequate. As with everything here it is grossly overpriced. Generally at least twice you might actually think it is worth. Ironically the best value food is inside Vatican city! All very sensibly priced, even the entry fee \u00a312 is very good value considering all you get to see. Go Wednesday morning and you will see his holiness 'live' addressing the masses in the square. Now is a good time to get in line. Ignore everyone selling tours at so called special rates and VIP entry etc. They are lying. It's only ten euros for an audio guide once inside.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Bright", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1154940-Reviews-Hotel_Bright-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$80 - $140*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Prenestina 940</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00155</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1154940", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0c/88/0c88cd7403d31bc40b40d011a2f2e7485large.jpg"}}
