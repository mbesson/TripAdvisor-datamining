I loved where the hotel was located; close to everything, with a short walk or a quick metro ride but it was the neighborhood that gave it a true Roman feel. I have been to Roma many times before and have family here so I am familiar with it. When we ventured into more touristy areas, I appreciated our location even more. Every reommendation that Clementina gave was exactly what I wanted and her suggestions during our stay were always helpful. All staff members were kind and helpful and the hotel was immaculately clean. I also loved getting a freshly made cappucino every morning and my son loved his cornetti with Nutella. Upon our departure heading to theb airport for our next stop, they packed two breakfasts to go for us which was quite thoughtful.

To be fair, this hotel has its good points and its bad points - some of which are within the control of the hotel and some aren't but I still would have preferred to know everything before choosing to stay here. I hope my review will help others make a more informed decision. Location: This is completely subjective. It is within walking distance of a lot of the sites but far from others. The neighbourhood is quite residential and you can find some nice restaurants nearby. Also, if you are arriving or leaving by train, Termini is very close by. The area is safe and is very quiet at night - could be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. Staff: For the most part, they are very good and very helpful. One staff member I found was rather rude. She was usually on at night and would often just shrug when she was asked something or, in one instance, she told me I was crazy - see note about the rooms. Rooms: Clean and comfortable but housekeeping could have been a little more particular. For example, on our second night my son got some chocolate on his sheets. It was quite a visible smear and the sheets were not changed - the bed was just made up. I knew it was chocolate but it could have been something else...if you know what I mean. I would have expected the sheets to be changed. Internet access: This is a huge problem and one that needs to be addressed before the hotel can advertise that they have free wifi in the rooms. They do...sometimes. We were in a corner room and the internet disconnected on a fairly regular basis...when we could even log on. When we told the night reception woman that there was a problem with the internet in our rooms she said that they know. In the corner rooms the reception is bad...what can she do? I asked if maybe she could have a technician look at it which resulted in her saying that I was crazy and that this wasn't an emergency. I could just bring my laptop down to the lobby if I wanted to use the internet. Which is what I did. While I was in the lobby I heard her talking to another gentleman (not sure who he was) but the word \"internet\" came up often as they both glanced in my direction. I thought this was very unprofessional. If they know that there is a problem with the internet, why don't they fix it instead of claiming to have wifi in the rooms when it doesn't reach the corner rooms. While we were in the lobby we ran into a couple from England who were also frustrated by the sketchy internet service. Elevator This was another thing that I wasn't aware of. The elevator holds three people, maximum, but it looks more like one person who doesn't exhale. Being very claustrophobic this was a problem..and we were on the 4th floor with each level being two staircases. Not the hotel's fault but had I known I would have requested a lower floor. When I inquired the \"lovely\" woman on reception told me it was not possible to change rooms because they were completely full. Before I could say a word she quickly added, \"If you don't believe me walk around the hotel and see for yourself!\" She was very rude and her comments were completely uncalled for. Breakfast Very good - both hot and cold options. Plenty to choose from and a very nice breakfast area. All in all an average hotel. I would not go back there. There are many better options. The last time we were in Rome we stayed at Hotel Sonya and I'm sorry I didn't go back there but I wanted to try a new place for a new experience.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "melmich", "ReviewID": "UR126030187", "Content": "My husband & I have just returned from a 3 night stay which I booked as a surprise for his 50th birthday.

We were pleasantly surprised by the close proximity of the hotel to Termini Station (about a 12-minute walk). There were plenty of great restaurants within close proximity to the hotel (although it is a challenge to find a bad meal in Italy!). Bus 64 has a stop that is a few minutes walk away from the hotel and provides transportation near the popular landmarks (e.g., Trevi Fountain, Pantheon), but it is very crowded and after using it twice, we decided to walk.

Recommended to a local restaurant, literally 5 mins walk away (Ristorante Tema: excellent !). More general notes: the Colloseum's own guided tour (5 euros) on top of entrance fee was just right. 45 mins of interesting information without \"overload\". You are fast-tracked to a ticket booth inside the Colloseum if you take up this option. This was via Colloseum staff, not the numerous \"touts\" outside. Also, the climb to the top of St Peter's dome was a tremendous experience. 5 Euros if you climb all 551 steps; 7 euros if you go part way in a lift (leaving only 330 steps to climb !!!). The grotto below St Peter's houses the tombs of many late popes (John Paul II; St Peter etc) but was not obviously signposted inside the Basillica and was, therefore, very crowd free when we visited.

Our room (202) was a nice size with a wardrobe, tv and free safe and we found the bed to be very comfortable. As we arrived late, about 11.30pm, we were both in desperate need for some water and so raided the minibar. For a hotel minibar in the middle of Rome it struck us as very reasonably priced! The bathroom had a lovely, if slightly cosy, shower and was large although poorly laid out. There wasn't actually sufficient room to sit on the toilet properly because of it's proximity to the shower and bidet so you had to sit sideways. Whilst we found this amusing rather than a reason to moan, I'm sure it would irritate some people. The room and bathroom were both really clean and our towels were changed daily. I also really appreciated the 'vanity kit' which aside from the usual shower gel contained things I always forget and need like a nail file! Breakfast in the hotel was good with a nice continental buffet selection but what really struck me was how polite and attentive the breakfast staff were, they do a wonderful job. My only slight criticism would be that for the size of the hotel the breakfast area is small and it was somewhat problematic on the Sunday morning when a lot of people turned up for breakfast at around 9.30 and there weren't enough tables, we had to wait around 20 minutes. However, it was nice that the staff then didn't start clearing breakfast away at 10 like they were meant to and let the people who'd had to wait for their table continue breakfast at a leisurely pace. You could also get free tea and coffee in the lobby all day should you want it. We also found most of the hotel staff friendly, and the lady, whose name I unfortunately forget, who was always around to help in the mornings in the lobby particularly so. She recommended us a nice restaurant and was helpful in telling us how to get to the Vatican by public tranport and also how to get to the rugby game at the Stadio Olimpico. All of the major sights are walkable from the hotel, we opted to take the metro to the Vatican because of the ice and snow but walked to the colosseum and forum in about 10 minutes at a leisurely pace and the Trevi fountain, Spanish steps and Panthenon is about 15-20.

The Termini station is also within walking distance. We went back to the hotel around noon for check-in after a short walk from the Colosseum and were told our luggage had been brought to our room. That was a nice touch and delighted, we went into our room, (room size is big by Italian standard and very clean) and a minute after, a Christmas card and chocolates were sent to our room.

The breakfast buffet offered most things you could wish for (fruit, eggs, bacon, pastries, bread, etc.), and of course excellent Italian coffee. The service both in the restaurant and the front desk was also excellent. The receptionist was happy to recommend restaurants close to the hotel, and on both occasions these restaurants had great food. It is also worth mentioning that there are an abundance of both restaurants and bars close to the hotel. The only two negatives we found were the location and construction noise. Although close to the central Termini train station, we found that there is quite a walk to most other things (perhaps with the exception of Forum, but it's still a 10-15min walk), and since there's not many attractions close to the hotel be prepared for A LOT of walking or taxi rides. The other thing we found that impacted our overall impression was the construction site across the street from our room which began making noise EARLY on weekdays.

We also took my sister in law with us for the 5 day stay. We booked two double rooms and on arrival we were upgraded for our room for a suite/roof terrace room 502 which was a nice touch. The other room for my sister in law was also excellent/large 4TH FLOOR but she wanted to stay on the same floor as ourselves. ROOM/SUITE 502 - smaller room 510 - 5TH FLOOR: We spoke to Massimo on reception who booked us in - he was able to find a room on the same floor- this room was slightly smaller but very adequate and she was happy with it. (Room 510 She wanted to stay on the same floor as us and we were all very grateful the Hotel was able to accommodate this change at short notice). I had emailed prior to our stay Salvatore Sansone, manager who stated and responded via email we would receive a bottle of proscetto for my partners birthday - but this didnt materialise. But this was no hardship at all - we had, the upgrade and we were buying wine at a near by supermarket to the left of the entrance and across the road to Saint Maria Maggiore - this didnt spoil our stay. There are signs for the Spar by the Tourist Information opposite the Saint Maria Maggiore Church ..but across the Piazza was this other supermarket where we purchased our \"Vino\" and bruschetta to have on our roof terrace etc Both rooms had room safes, our room coffee facilities, aircon, tv, enough wardrobe space, our room had a shower over a bath; my sister in laws room had a power shower (The room safes - which were not huge but you could fit valuables in and were a great asset/room facility in most hotels nowadays NB...on booking in ask for the room safe key, otherwise return to reception to collect it). The roof terrace was a great added bonus, we used to sit on the terrace a glass of wine and some bruschetta etc. The room did at first appear \"musty\" after our first day as some guests stated but i think this is due to the air con or the room being secured all day - we opened the windows/patio and the smell was gone...no problem to us. We were out all day after breakfast anyway and returned late at night - it didnt appear to be a dirty smell - but you have to remember this is an old building in the city of Rome, but a very charming one for that and very good value for money. The room was not dirty in any aspect - cleaned daily by the maids, coffee making facilities in our room ie suite but not in the other room my sister in law was in (NB but there is coffee making facilities in the room 502 if your room does not have coffee facilities - at the main reception/also tv/internet computer area - there if you want to drink coffee whilst on the main computer etc) Tea/coffee items were replenished daily, you have a small fridge and usual beers and soft drinks at a Hotel set price The bathroom washing/shower items were replenished every day when used. There is a wall mounted hairdryers in the bathrooms were adequate but some ladies may feel they would rather take there own ones with them. My partner used the Hotel one but took a while to get used to it and in her opinion lacked a bit of \"power\" but she used it - just took a bit longer to get ready thats all. (NB No great hardship and no criticism of the Hotel because as the manager states in previous reviews it is the \"same type of hairdryer\" that other hotels have and hotels we have stayed in before have - no hardship, it saved on carrying a haridryer in our hand luggage). STAFF: All the staff on reception were very professional, courteous and knowledgeable - unfortunately i do not know all their names. (NB Maybe name badges for staff to wear Reception/dining staff/maids would assist for + or - feedback? As other hotels do) BUT we didnt have any negative treatment by any staff member while we stayed there Only person name i got to know was on asking the staff member his name - who booked us in on reception - he was called Massimo on reception He was excellent, was able to rejig the room for my sister in law and was very knowledgeable and professional. He was NOT IMPERSONAL as some guests say the reception were - i found all the reception staff to be professional and courteous when you needed something or advice. Not in your face but happy to help when asked something I asked Massimo on different occassions/days the following..he was the one on duty when i needed to ask reception staff some questions and i found the other staff professional as well :- Q: where nearest supermarket was, Q: best means to get to vatican ie metro at the termini, Q: best local restaurants to use in the vicinity(see other reviews re restaurants) Q: directions to the Coliseum and Forums which are nearby Q: City sightseeing bus near to at the termini...we used the Roma Open top bus and was excellent for two day price and buses came every 15-20mins and was on a larger route to seeing the sights than their competitors. He/Massimo was very professional and imparted his knowledge to me - adding the information on to a map at reception for us to take away MAIDS/DINING STAFF: Were also very professional and polite and were always clearing away tables for other guests to arrive..breakfast is from 0700-1000hrs and usual continental breakfast with scrambled eggs as a cooked choice. There was no complaints at all re breakfasts, our 3 party was able to find various things to eat for various eating desires, from vegetarian, fruits, croissants, cakes, cheeses, cold meats, yoghurts, toast and jam. Fruit juices, coffee and tea etc Very well done -Hotel Raffaello for a varied selection for breakfast! Thankyou the 3 x female Dining staff we seen and the chef - as stated i cant name them due to not knowing there names/no name badges Maids were cleaning our room daily and the \"blonde hair\" italian woman who also did work on some days in the dining rooms/ as a maid the next day during our stay were all/always polite, professional and saying \"morning\" good day when we bumped into them etc. Thank you all as well. BUS ROMA/ROME OPEN TOUR - CITY OPEN TOP BUS TOURS: http://www.romeguide.it/romeopentour/romeopentoureng.htm Hotel Raffaello only had a leaflet for the Green Line tours in the reception but we found the Roma open tour - City bus tours to be the best value/timescales, seeing the most sights/route of the bus ie We spoke to an independent Tourist Information Bus rep by an umbrella stand opposite the Termini who explained independantly the tour companies...he was impartial and helped us get the best city sightseeing bus company which in my opinion was Roma Open Tour - open top bus tours.... not the others ie Green line ( NB U do get a lot of people trying to sell you/get the Green line bus tours/other bus companies on most corners but we were glad we chose the Roma Open Tour /Roma tours due to buses coming every 15-20mins and it covers the all main sites/routes (some bus tours didnt on set days) - if you have any mobility problems buses on Roma Open Tour come every 15-20mins ie to take the full route from Termini to all the routes/sites and back to the Termini takes 2hours- stops for 10 mins at the Vatican facing St Peters and then at Termini for 10 to 15 mins..they park all tour buses on the left of the junction of Via Cavour/Termini - opposite the Termini...then the bus heads off down Via Cavour towards Saint Maria Maggiore .. see website link/reviews for ROME OPEN TOUR bus company; http://www.romeguide.it/romeopentour/romeopentoureng.htm 26 Euros for 48 hr bus ticket (NB if staying at Hotel Raffaello- nearest Roma Open Tour bus stop and some others is on THE ROAD THAT LEADS UP TO AND OPPOSITE the Saint Maria Maggiore church on the right handside - think the road was called Via Paolina that is the one way road that leads to the Piazza Saint Maria Maggiore - before the tourist Information hut- you will see the bus sign \"Roma Open Tours \" by a Trinket shop We stayed November 2011 and it was very hot 20 plus degrees when we stayed..it was a bit cold till about 1000/1100hrs then it went very hot/we had 5 days of sunny days which was great ...we were amazed re the temperature at this time - We had packed for extreme cold UK weather! So this was a great bonus eating ice cream at Trajans column in the sun, sitting on the steps facing it! Lol SISTER HOTEL ROOF TERRACE -ALBERGO DEL SENATO HOTEL - FACING THE PANTHEON: Only regret was, i wanted to take my partner to the Albergo Del Senato Sister hotel of the Hotel Raffaello for a drink on the roof terrace for her birthday and then a birthday meal nearby but Salvatore Sensane/manager emailed me to confirm that the roof terrace at this sister hotel in November was closed - ie email confirmed \" I regret to inform you that the bar of the Albergo del Senato (our sister hotel ) is open only in summertime but we will try to find an alternative\". This was a shame BUT was not the hotels fault, it was the date of my partners birthday ie November - Cant change that date ha ha - we wanted to enjoy a drink at the roof terrace facing the Pantheon lit up at night and during the summer they do offer you tickets to use the roof terrace bar at the sister hotel - so just ask if staying during this time You must visit the Saint Maria Maggiore Church nearby- amazing interiors and church artefacts, one of the Papacy churches etc Capuchin Crypt- is very interesting worth a visit cost 1 euro but only takes 10 mins - NO PHOTOS can be taken but you can purchase for 50 cents postcards of the sights there Vatican Museum/St Peters - last sunday of each month you can gain access for free for the Vatican museum and the St Peters Basilica - but be aware get to the destination before 0900hrs, we waited in line for 1 hour, only opens at 0900hrs and the Vatican museum was a must - didnt get to St Peters by the time we got out of the Museum but our next visit to Rome we will be heading there first, reason to return (in the queues - there are persons trying to get you out of the queues saying it is 3 hrs wait to get in to the Vatican/ St Peters Basillica and offer at a cost for a private tour, but we were there on my partners birthday and the we wanted to mark it by going to the vatican..this day was coincidentally the free day and birthdate/birthday so we went then - we waited only 1 hour. Speaking to other people who left the queues with these private tours still had to queue up and still had to wait and of course pay on the free day for the private tour! Vatican museum/ Sistine chapel was amazing - but the usual idiots were trying to take pictures of the sistine chapel when security were trying to tell people not to and having to run over to stop them- this i found disrespectful. It is a working church chapel/holy place so please please please obey the signs/instructions by staff. We did see security and plain clothes staff pulling up and stopping visitors from taking photos in the sistine chapel and again unfortunately people talking loudly in the chapel instead of being quiet and respectful IRISH PUBS IN ROME WE FREQUENTED: Didnt like the Irish pub Druids Den, off via urbana Via Urbana/Via Panisperna - nearest to Hotel Raffaello (NB : EVEN THOUGH PART OF THE SISTER PUB OF THE - FIDDLERS ELBOW) FIDDLERS ELBOW IRISH PUB: http://www.thefiddlerselbow.com/fiddlers_rome/rome_eng/welcome.htm But we all but loved the Fiddlers Elbow Irish pub off from St Maria Maggiore again near to the hotel, they have an irish music on a wednesday night..from around 2200 hrs to 2230hrs - get there early for a seat \"busy\" - a mixture of tourists and Italian frequent this pub - on a thursday they have an open mic and more music Scottish female barmaid at the Fiddlers Elbow was great as well as the Italian bar staff at this venue (ROME RESTAURANTS WE FREQUENTED - SEE OTHER REVIEWS IN DUE COURSE): HOTEL RAFFAELLO - CONCLUSION: I could mention other aspects of our stay but want to give a honest and truthful experience of our stay in Hotel Raffaello.I feel i have given an open opinion of this hotel/facilities. (If person(s) wish further answers you can ask me via email) The Hotel is in an up and coming area surrounded by Restaurants/Bars - various building on Via Urbana are being renovated It is prime location for the Termini/City bus tours nearby, easy access to the Sites ie Coliseum/Old Rome within walking distance, nice restaurants/irish bar- Fiddlers Elbow and music. and access to the metro for the Vatican via the Termini which is on other side of Rome/river - only about 6 stops via Line A to OTTAVIANO metro stop which leads down to the Vatican/ St Peters after a ten minute walk...........from St Peters walking also accessible to Castel Saint Angelo Via Della Concilliazione - twenty minute walk from St Peters( or get the Roma BUS TOUR which stops facing St PetersBasilica) There are some \"down and outs\" begging for money streets off the Hotel BUT they are also throughout Rome and do not appear to be all Italian - put this aside because most European cities Dublin, Paris, Barcelona have similar begging - a polite \"No Grazie\" worked during our stay etc This is no fault of the Hotel Would i stay at this Hotel again- we usually do not stay at the same Hotel BUT if as and when i want to return to Rome; i would stay at this hotel or the sister hotel at the Pantheon We chose this hotel because it ticked all the boxes we wanted near to sites, access to termini and bus shuttle from the airport one way 8 euros, good facilities and varied breakfasts for all our parties meal requirements We had a memorable stay and staff at this hotel were excellent and professional Thankyou all the staff at Hotel Raffaello!", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NZ", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel Good location\u201d", "Author": "bigrock01", "ReviewID": "UR121303070", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay here.(Family of 4) Quiet street with plenty of eating choices close by.

There was a heating unit in the room but that works only for 2-3 hours in the early morning and late evenings. (something like 6-9 am and 7-10 pm). Also, in our room, the radiator knob was turned off and since the first day we were not aware of the timings, we could not heat the room. We got to know how it works when we enquired after breakfast the next day. So we missed that morning heating as well. But from then on the room was cozy. Free wi-fi is available and access can be easily gained by asking the reception for the login/password. One thing that put me off was the toilet was stinky and definitely not sanitised. I did speak to the reception about this but they did not seem to take the criticism well. They gave a response saying rooms will be cleaned whenever we leave. I did request for them to specifically disinfect the toilet seat, but this didnt happen. I did not complain again. We had asked for a dental kit but the hotel does not have any additional guest kits. We had basic toiletries like shower gel, shampoo, soap and we also had a vanity kit & shower caps. Breakfast was fine, nothing remarkable but nothing to complain about either. We did ask for fried eggs (which were not on the menu) and got a rather rude response from one of the waitress. Though the other waitress was extremely polite.

We got used to it after being in the room for a while, but it was incredibly overwhelming each time we walked in. - There was a large window, but it looked onto a brick wall...literally. No natural light at all. - The shower (no tub, which other rooms seem to have) is so tiny it seemed like a joke. My husband and I are not tiny people, but we couldn't even comfortably turn in the shower. Despite the bathroom being a decent size, it was a teeny tiny corner shower, which had jets that took up more room and we couldn't even use. When we were checking out the gentleman at the front desk made a point of saying, in a snarky tone, that we booked through expedia (we had actually booked through hotels.com). I'm not sure if this had something to do with us getting a lesser room. This said, by no means did we get any huge bargain. Pros: - Very close to Termini and reasonable cab fare from Centro Storico - Area is good - restaurants, shops, galleries, etc - Hotel/room seems to have been renovated recently - Good breakfast - meats, cheeses, sweet roles, cereal, yogurt, etc - Access to roofdeck of sister hotel across from Pantheon", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in heart of Roma!\u201d", "Author": "kaycee2117", "ReviewID": "UR119207491", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at Raffaello Hotel in mid September.

Be sure to try Tema, La Vecca and Vecchio Roma. We also took a day trip to Vatican City and it is just a 10 min ride after you get on at Termini station. We were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get around Rome. This city is so beautiful and every attraction took our breath away. Cons: the gentleman at the front desk who checked us in did not offer us a Safe key or tell us about a safe at all so we had to go back downstairs to retrieve this (no big deal); the air con turns off automatically when you leave the room so after a long hot day, you come back to a stuffy room (understandable as it is a waste of energy when you are not in the room), there is limited WIFI and internet although they do give you a card with some few time on it.

Our room was on the 1st floor so we didn't have to use the lift & as I didn't see any of the other rooms, I can only comment on ours. It was not large, but perfectly formed with good quality furniture, a king size bed & overlooking a quiet side street - very little noise as it had modern double glazed window. Flat screen television with many channels & a great air conditioning unit which was very controllable & quiet - absolutely necessary as it was 29'c when we were there. The bathroom was large, modern & spotlessly clean. Several people have mentioned the small showers - yes they are small but it's modern & worked very efficiently & I managed perfectly well at 6ft 4ins & 14 stone! The breakfast has been mentioned in several reviews & it really is exceptionally good with a great variety of choice to suit everyone - even lovely scrambled egg. The 2 ladies looking after the breakfast room are pleasant & efficient, clearing the tables as soon as they are vacated & replenishing the breakfast buffet as soon as something ran out. A really, really important thing for us was the coffee machine & kettle in the small lounge. It meant that my wife could have a cup of tea, which is absolutely essential to her well being (!), & I could enjoy a really good coffee. A well run hotel is always down to the man in charge & the Raffaello is run by the Director, Salvatore Sansome who was always around & always willing to help & the rest of the staff seem to follow his lead, always pleasant, nothing too much trouble & looking as if they actually enjoyed the job. Very reassuring to stay in an hotel run by efficient staff - I could name many in England where this is not the case.

It is a very well kept, clean hotel that is just 1 street off a main road (Via Cavour) so street noise wasn\u2019t much of a problem.

We got a room on the top floor which was a little more hassle to get to with either the small winding stairs or the slow little elevator, but it was away from the street and had a nice patio so overall it was a win. It is really a 4.5 star hotel. Pros: - Within walking distance of Termini train station and Ancient Rome (Colosseum). - Good breakfast included in price. - Room was ready early. - Friendly multi-lingual staff.

If you stay here (which I highly recommend) you MUST go to La Vacca for dinner 2 blocks away. As you leave the hotel, turn left and go about 2 blocks.

From the minute we arrived until the end, the staff were very friendly and went out of there way to look after us. We had a triple room which was clean and comfortable. If there were any minor gripes it would have been that the airco blew cold air onto the 3rd bed ( easily solved) and the shower a little on the small size but very useable. Similarly, the fact that the breakfast room could not accomodate everyone when they wanted to eat will ether irritate you or ( as with us) add to the charm. We found it was best to take breakfast before the 09:00 rush hour. We would definately recommend this and also return. The hotel is not immediately on a tourist route but is well placed for visiting places like the National Museum or Colusium / Forum. Should you wish to go further, then reception will happily call a white cab for you. These are excellent value and recommended even above the many hop on hop off tourist buses. Our average charge was \u20ac7 for 3 people, with a trip to the Vatican being the most expensive at \u20ac9,00 . WELL RECOMMENDED. By this you can also take it that we found the Tourist buses expensive and not worth the trouble. Again shop arround, we initially used GLT which cost \u20ac63 for 3 people 24 hrs, but later found that the Archeobus was only \u20ac36 for 48 hrs and also covered the Appia way.

It is also used by locals which is a good sign. 2) Vatican museum. AVOID unless you like moving at a snales pace with the rest of the great unwashed.

My only complaint about the entire hotel was the size of the shower. I'm sure it's common for Europeans, but for an oversized American the shower was woefully small. The footprint was small, and to compound the problem the shower had a huge full length console (lots of extra shower heads, and ledges for shower stuff) that took up a third of the shower. I barely had room to turn around, and the slightest shift in position had my belly turning off the water. The door opening was also small and made getting into the shower a bit of an adventure (step up and squeeze through the door). I do have to commend the front desk staff. All the gentlemen there were very friendly, gracious and helpful. My friend's luggage didn't make it to Rome with us, and the front desk staff cheerfully checked on the status for us regularly. It finaly showed up on day 3, and I'm convinced it would have been later if the hotel had not been checking on it regularly. They do charge to use the computer in the lobby, but someone had turned in a partially used code card, and the front desk gave it to us to use for free.

The location was good for us, but if you want to be right in the centre then this may not be for you but we liked the walk into the town everyday and enjoyed stopping at various places on the way and also was only a 20 minute walk to the station.

I had to use the 2 duvets kept in the room as additional padding to the mattress, and still work on average of 3 times a night. This was really unfortunate, because everything else about the hotel was lovely. But, after spending 10+ hours walking around Rome, one wants to sleep in a comfortable and welcoming bed. The breakfast was fantastic every morning and again, the staff were wonderful. They treated my family like gold. I would recommend this hotel on every other point. Some people prefer a firm mattress, and sadly for me, I do not.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood - but not outstanding\u201d", "Author": "Russmel", "ReviewID": "UR92218104", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on the glowing reviews on TA. It was the last hotel we were staying in during our month around Europe and based on the reviews arrived with great anticipation. We stayed in the family room which as previously described is divided into two smaller rooms. This was suitable for our family of four and the bathroom although small provided everything we needed. (we didn't find the shower too small as others have indicated.). Our room had no street view which was a little disappointing but being back from the street probably enhanced our sleep as there was very little noise. The breakfast was OK but not worth the glowing reviews it has received. It lacked fresh fruit and the variety we found at other 3 star hotels across Germany and Austria. The most disappointing aspect was the demenour of the front desk staff. We didn't ask a lot of them and They were professional, but given the rave reviews about them we had high expectations that they did not meet. They certainly answered any question but we always felt that we were putting them out by requesting information and the answer we got was straight out of the tourist guide with no additional information, service or guidance. An example of this was when we inquired if the guest computer was linked to a printer so we could print out our flight boarding passes. We were informed that it wasn't and that we would have to go to an intent cafe to access a printer with Internet access. This was despite one sitting at the front desk which we would have happily paid to use. Given the reviews this request didn't seem to big an ask. Overall I would stay there again, but would not automatically go back without looking around and comparing other hotels, as it did not live up to the TA reviews.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cwe can really recommend this hotel and will come back again\u201d", "Author": "bettinaanne", "ReviewID": "UR91598754", "Content": "Friendly personnel; very clean, comfortable,big and cosy rooms,nice interior, breakfast offers a good variation of food for the international guests.

We nipped out as it was late and got a takeaway from a local restaurant- Nueva Stella - we were greeted warmly here and it had lots of locals in the back of the restaurant. The food was nice too! The next morning after a comfy sleep, we woke early and went to breakfast, there was a great selection of pastries, hot & cold food, cereals, yoghurts, meats, breads, four types of juice, they offered a variety of coffees and teas and also toast. What more could you ask for to set you on your way? The service was wonderful, often a great mix of my broken Italian efforts and their much more honed English, it made for a fab start to the day! On the penultimate evening we asked to buy credit and use the Internet for online flight check in, we were given the remaining credit another guest had bought but not fully used before checking out. They had an opportunity to take a few euros and didn't, which surprised me as it was just.... Kind. On check out, after hassle free days staying in this lovely hotel, we left our bags so we could make the most of our last day. It was hassle free, an absolute bargain and ideally situated fir sightseeing. We did not use public transport once other than to and from the airport- the hotel was five minutes from the colusseum, termini, roman forum, ten from piazza navona, pantheon, spanish steps, and half an hour stroll from the vatican...

Better than watching the telly! So sleep was not a problem, and the room, and bathroom were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was the usual fare, but it was plentiful, and the waitresses were efficient and friendly. And the coffee is fine! The hotel is close to the Termini and Metro stations, and the single fare of 1 Euro for journeys by bus and/or Metro was fantastic value. Here's a tip! If you get on a tube, do NOT assume that Basilico St. P. is St Peters Square. It isn't! Get on the Red line and head for Ottaviano, and save yourself a wasted half an hour in the suburbs. My wife was not impressed! So what was wrong with the hotel? Nothing really, unless you are the Andrews Sisters trying to get into the lift all at once. A bit snug! Oh, and the young porter tends to overfill the kettle in the downstairs lounge, so be careful! Still, if that is all you have to worry about, you will enjoy your stay as much as we did. If you are looking for McDonalds, it is right next to the 2000 year old Pantheon. I suppose we should be grateful that it is not inside! And lastly, the 218 bus to the Catacombs, (you must go - but closed 12.00 to 2.00), which goes from Piazza San Giovanni, is parked up at the top of the square, through the arches and about 200 metres straight ahead of you.

I chose the hotel based upon overall value. I was not disappointed by the overall value, but I was disappointed by the overall service. First of all, the location was difficult to find by automobile. It is in a kind of out of the way place. It is marginally walking distance to most sights, but it is a bit of a \"hump\". It is not an easy stroll to any attraction and you have to walk uphill slightly when returning to the hotel. The decor and rooms are fine, although the decor looks like it is trying to be a luxury hotel in a bargain location. The rooms are nicely appointed, especially for the family rooms. The worst part of this hotel is the service. With the exception of one very well-meaning woman at the front desk (she gave me terrible directions to the train station), the men at the front desk were terrible. When we arrived late at night there was nobody else around and two front desk people. I was walking on a cane with two children and they did not offer to help with the luggage. Getting luggage to the room is a bit difficult because the elevator is strangely appointed and stops between floors, which means you have to take stairs either up or down to your room from the elevator landing. In addition, the front desk person advised me to park on the street, because the garage down the way was quite expensive, but did not bother to tell me that you can be towed if you don't have the right sticker and that you can drive in the area during the daytime without a spefic sticker. Fortunately, I can read Italian and the signs made it clear my rental car would be towed. The front desk staff also seemed generally annoyed when asked questions and gave the impression that it was a bother to assist you. The breakfast included was better than some places in other cities in Italy, but they ran out of fresh fruit and baked goods early, which they did not seem to replenish. The ladies in the breakfast room also seemed to be annoyed by having to assist guests as well. There isn't much else around this hotel, so once you get back after a long day, you don't really want to go out again --which means that you are stuck with not such evening choices. I did visit their sister hotel located at the Pantheon. I would stay there. The location was great. The service was great. The terrace bar was lovely with an amazing view. However, the cost was quite a bit more expensive. Also, beware trying to pick up or return a rental car at Termini Train Station. It is a disaster trying to find the rental car return location.

The hotel is located in via Urbana which is a quiet street parallel to the more central via Nazionale. The area has numerous restaurants and shops and is very safe. It is situated in an old building (early 20th or late 19th century), but has been thoroughly modernized. My room was spacious even by US standards, and had A/C. The bathroom was also quite large, although the shower itself was a bit tight. Not everything was flawless, though: the elevator was quite small and two people with luggage have trouble entering. This can be attributed to the building's age, though. Also, the mattress was a bit soft for my taste, probably from overuse. I still got a good night's sleep, though. Breakfast was included in the price (a pleasant surprise). The selection was not enormous, but rather adequate. It was particularly nice to see that scrambled eggs were part of the selection! You rarely find that in Italy. Coffee was made to order, and was quite good. The waitress also offered toasted bread when she saw that I had taken the eggs. The hotel is centrally located, very close to the Altare della Patria, and within 15 minutes walk from the Pantheon, Fontana di Trevi as well as the Collosseum. You will see similar features from other hotels in Rome, however what makes the Raffaello special is the excellent customer service they offer. They try to help whenever they can and are proactive to guests' wishes. This is the only hotel with this level of customer service I've seen in Rome.

Don't expect the comforts and amenities of the international chain hotels but if you're looking for a charming boutique hotel with local character and history, we would certainly recommend Hotel Raffaello. Our room while not large, was beautifully decorated - upholstered headboard and matching wall treatments, hotel branded toiletries and even branded slippers - great attention to detail for such a small establishment. We had read all the negative reports about the small shower cubicle - yes it was tight however neither my husband nor I had any problems showering (and we are not small people), so we couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. Breakfast was amazing - fresh, plentiful and wonderful variety - juices, fruit, bakery items, cake, cheese, ham, scrambled eggs, yogurt and wonderful coffee/hot chocolate - all you could possibly need - so substantial that it kept us going until an early dinner. The breakfast staff were very efficeint and friendly and the made sure everything was replenished and coffees served at breakneck speed. Another thing we noticed which showed the generousity of the hotel. We observed earlier arrival travellers were offered to help themselves to breakfast, even though they were not technically checked in. Interestingly, further down our travels, we arrived at an International chain hotel (where we were gold loyalty members had booked an executive club room) and while waiting in the club lounge while our room was being readied, not only where we not offered to help oursevelves to something from the breakfast buffet in the lounge, but when I asked if we could have something (given we had just come off a long flight), we were told no we couldn't.

Had read the reviews on trip advisor and decided on the Hotel Rafaello. What a good choice it turned out to be. We asked the hotel to arrange a taxi to pick us up from the airport. Giacomo pointed out all the sights on the way. First impressions of the Hotel - clean, welcoming and well kept. Allocated room 420 at the rear of the hotel. Twin beds for the boys, large separate room for us with double. Wonderful shower with power jets in the bathroom. We used the air con on some days because it was really warm, but kept the windows open generally. On the first morning woke up to wonderful smells of baking croissants. Went down to substantial breakfast buffet. Christina, our attentive and welcoming waitress was great. Attractions - visited most of them on foot. We liked the idea of following the map and my goodness we did some walking. Word of advice when you visit the Colosseum - avoid the gladiators in the surrounding area! 1 \"friendly\" guy posed for photos then demanded 20 euros - he didn't get it , we did pay an amount but had to be quite firm about it. Buy your tickets from the Forum and you bypass any queues. Visited St Peters and the Vatican/Sistine chapel (not on Wed - Pope does his address) The queues looked long and you were continually pestered to join unofficial trips, but if you visit St Peters in the morning and the Vatican in the afternoon there isn't usually a queue. Should there be, buy a ticket for an extra 4 euros from the information point in the Square and you can avoid this. We felt very welcomed in this city. People were very helpful and kind. At the top of my review I mentioned we were visiting for my birthday, we were dining at La Mela D'Oro. How wonderful it was, Christian and Sami dimmed the lights and brought in a home made cake, sparkly candle and everyone sang \"happy birthday\". I felt quite overwhelmed with their kindness - a moment I will always treasure. Thank you x Only negative bit about the area - a spitting tramp woman! she frequented the area at times getting more and more drunk and proceeded to curse and spit at anyone! The locals were quite right to be angry about her, so, beware. I have no hesitation to recommend this wonderful, welcoming hotel to anyone who wants a central base to explore this brilliant city. I threw loads of coins into the Trevi fountain and hope that the tale about returning to the city will come true sooner rather than later.

Everything with exceptionally clean, and the bathroom, while small, had a great shower and was lovely and renovated. The breakfast, while not exactly extensive buffet, featured UNREAL scrambled eggs, some fruit, pastries, cereals, juices, tea and coffee - just what you need!

All the staff are lovely and helpful, they provide fantastic free maps that we completely depended on, and really make you feel that, at the end of a long sightseeing day, you have come home!

I chose the hotel based on other reviews on this site and I'm glad I did. Most of the negative reviews on this site deal with the down-sides of European hotels in general (room size, keycard in the slot for electricity...)...welcome to Europe, don't be swayed by those bad reviews. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I booked through Expedia and exchanged a few emails with the staff before our stay. They were friendly before and during our stay. We had them call a cab for us at least once a day and the cab showed up in two minutes max. Considering the other two hotels I stayed in (also highly rated) the room in Rafaello was actually a good size. The bed was amazing!! We slept so well. They have blackout curtains, and the rooms are silent. One negative is the shower size. It is a stall shower, again typical, but it was rather small. A larger person would probably have trouble in the shower. The breakfast was typical European and nothing to write home about. Eggs, baked goods, cured meats, fruit, cereal, juice, but the breakfast staff was nice. Try to come down to breakfast not at the last minute, because they only have a few tables and you might have to buddy up with someone. The location is pretty good for the money. On arrival, we walked from Termini, which was doable, but not really a good decision. After an 8 hour flight, and a train ride with no AC, walking with our bags was pretty lousy. I would recommend a cab. When we left, we took one to Termini. When taking a cab from Rafaello to anywhere in the city, it never seemed to cost more than about 10 euros. Its an easy walk to three or four different metro stops, about 10 minutes. We bought the Roma Pass (highly recommend!!) which gave us free rides on the metro. We walked to the Colosseum as well. The hotel is basically a block from Santa Maria Maggiore which makes it touristy enough but not overwhelming. There's lots of good restaurants in the area. Our first night the staff recommended a place right up the street which was good but a bit pricey. I would recommend Ristorante Strega which is right around the corner.

The location is perfect with 3 metro stops (Repubblica, Cavour and Termini) within 10 minutes walking distance. In fact, we walked the 10 minutes from Termini when we arrived by train from Civitavecchia after our cruise - the taxi quoted us EUR 25 and said that we would need 2 taxis as we were 4 people with luggage! Definitely not worth EUR 50. Many of the tourist sites are within walking distance too, but our metro tourist travel pass was also put to good use. There are many restaurants nearby (some were recommended by the hotel) and we enjoyed some really nice dinners there. We had 2 adjoining rooms, 502 and 506, and both opened up onto lovely patios where we enjoyed a sunset pizza dinner on 21 June - summer solstice! The one room (506) was very large and had a shower over the bathtub, and the other room (502) was smaller with one of the smaller showers in the bathroom - perfect for our teenage daughters. The breakfasts were very enjoyable, with both hot and cold foods available. The only small gripe was that they sometimes ran out of the fresh fruit initially on offer, but the friendly waitresses immediately offered an alternative fresh fruit from the kitchen. My husband and daughters had to return to Raffaello a few hours after we had checked out as I fell and fractured my knee whilst climbing some broken stairs in Ostiense Station on our way to the airport and Mykonos. They very kindly offered them a room for the night and advised them where they could stay in the suburban neighbourhood close to the hospital (CTO) I had been taken to by ambulance. Just a few words of advice - if you have been hospitalised in Rome and it is at all possible, try and return home as soon as you are able to. We thought that some of our South African hospitals were not that great, but our private hospitals are far superior to the Rome one I had to spend 6 days in. After repeated postponing of the surgery to repair my exposed multiple fractured kneecap we decided that I would return to RSA for the operation. The surgeon here said that the operation had been an emergency and that it should have been done in the first six hours after the accident. By the time I got home and into surgery, it was 9 days afterwards! Needless to say we did not end up going to Mykonos as planned, and I am still in a knee brace and on crutches! The doctor says it could take up to a year for my knee to heal. If we ever return to Rome one day (and we hope to do so once my healing is complete) I would definitely choose to stay in Hotel Raffaello, and I have already recommended it to friends.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased with the Raffaello\u201d", "Author": "HolywoodCoDown", "ReviewID": "UR74018278", "Content": "Stayed here in the family room (which was actually two communicating rooms) with two teenagers.

Service from Salvatore, Edoardo, and Massimo and the lady whose name I forget (scusi!) was very professional and helpful.

Breakfast was included in the rate and we were very pleased with the breads, pastries, boiled and scrambled eggs, cheese and fruit provided each morning. The hotel was close (10-15 minutes) to the Forum and Colosseum and maybe 20-25 minutes walk to the other major points of interest in Rome. It was very clean, quiet and the space was perfect for the two of us. I loved the bathroom with the multi-jet shower, but I think that it might be difficult for a non-petite or slender person to fit well in the shower space.

We flew from London (important later). Because it was for our 10th anniversary I had emailed ahead asking if they could have some Prosecco in the room for when we arrived - it was brought up shortly after we checked in and was FOC - so a good start. Over the next couple of days we did the usual Rome sites whilst keeping an eye on the news because of the impending volcanic ash travel chaos. On the Thursday, our Friday return flight was bumped to Monday, and then on the Saturday it was bumped to the following Saturday, i.e. 8 days after our original departure. The hotel staff and management were very sympathetic to our situation and although we eventually managed to get home by rail (only 6 days late!) for the extra nights that we stayed at the Raffaello we were given a very reasonable nightly rate. As for the hotel itself, we liked where it was situated; we walked most places because in general that seemed quicker than cabs anyway. A 10 minute walk down Via Cavour and you were at the Forum and, Vatican excepted, most other sights were only another 10-15 minutes walk anyway. Although this worked for us, it might not for all. There are a fair number of pretty reasonable restaurants and bars nearby The showers (we were in three rooms during our extended stay) as has been mentioned elsewhere are all quite small but did the job - even if we couldn't get any of the 'space age' nozzles etc. to work - they seemed to have been disconnected. Our bedrooms and bathrooms were all cleaned every day and the toiletries replenished. We were never disturbed by any traffic or bin lorries at any time and we had rooms on both external sides of the hotel. The breakfasts did start to get a bit 'samey' after a while; but the items were fresh as was the coffee. All of the staff in the hotel, bar none, were exceptionally friendly towards us from the very start, and if I'm honest got more so during our plight.

The hotel location is quite good. It is convenient to get there from Cavour metro station. Cavour metro station is mid-way between Termini and Colloseo stations. So, its a good location. Note to travelers: its a fairly long walk from Termini, if you have bags with you. The directions from Cavour on their website are poor. If coming from Termini or Tiburtina, go up the stairs to end up on Via Cavour. While facing Termini (i.e., in the direction of exit from the stairs), cross the street to your left. You will find a flight of stairs going down. Take those stairs (i.e., on the other side of Via Cavour) to reach Via Urbana. Start walking towards Termini and you will reach the hotel in about 7 minutes. The rooms are decent size... not US-size, but very adequate for a vacation. The rooms are clean and the AC worked well (it was hot when we were in Rome... and coming from someone who lives in India, I really mean it :-)). The room was clean, but it had a very bad smoke odor. We did not request a room change, since we knew we will be out for the most part. But the problem was that the smell did not clear even after leaving the windows open for a day. The bathroom was large and had ample of natural light. The (free) buffet breakfast was adequate... nothing great, but quite good nonetheless.

They recommended us Restaurant Tema (about two blocks from the hotel), which happened to be the best restaurant of our 13-day Italy trip. Will we come back... I don't know.

We arrived by train and took a cab to our hotel, although it was actually close enough to walk if we had known where we were going. It was on a quiet street and the main entrance and lobby are very elegant. The staff was very nice and helpful (except for one guy who told us the wrong bus to take somewhere), and they provided a free coffee station at any time of day for you to make something. They also offered a really big and nice buffet breakfast, with servers to bring you drinks, toast, and anything else you may need. Great way to start off our days! Our room was VERY spacious and the bed was big and very comfortable! We had a king room on the 3rd or 4th floor, and looking out the window you could see the hotel's neon light at night and the quiet street (the light didn't come in the room to bother us). We really loved all the space, and there also was a fridge with relatively inexpensive drinks! The bathroom was also pretty spacious for Europe, the shower was a little small (and I'm thin) but that's the norm in Europe. The hair dryer took FOREVER to get my hair dry, but that's the kind they use there. There are a number of gift shops right nearby the hotel on surrounding streets, as well as a couple cafes and a great gelato place on a corner. The subway station is very close also (5min walk). As for the city of Rome, it's so huge but we utilized the subway as well as walking to get around (took a bus once and got totally lost and that ended using the bus system). We walked to the Colosseum, Capitol Hill, the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, etc. (we're fit), but the subway could easily get you around too. We particularly enjoyed the Piazza Navona, about a 5min walk off the right side of the Pantheon when facing it (don't know what direction that is). It is a really large beautiful square lined with tons of cafes and restaurants along with lots of activity going on - we saw flamedancers, an opera singer practicing in front of a crowd, and one evening before a GREAT patio dinner there was an entertaining mime working the passers-by. Lots of fun and free entertainment! There's another square not far away that is more for a younger (and late-night) crowd (we are 30-something's and like that stuff, but we went there and preferred the options and ambience in Piazza Navona). We went to Vatican on our last full day and it was pretty amazing. Don't miss the City nor the actual church. We did not have time to go to the museum. Don't miss the church and definitely try making the long walk up tons of narrow steps to the top...it's worth the view! On our last day we walked with our luggage to the train station, since we knew where we were at that point. PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS - if you're heading out to the Rome airport, the walk INSIDE the trainstation to the Leonardo Express which takes you to the airport is VERY LONG. Add an additional 15-20 minutes of walking ONCE you get to the station. Overall, Rome is a HUGE, OLD city, but it has charm and can be doable in a couple days.

A small irritant was that we were kept awake on our first night into the wee small hours (try 3am) by a loud television in an adjoining room. Our attempts to contact someone to deal with the problem failed as the advertised telephone number for reception had been changed! Once appraised of the situaion the next morning, the reception staff assured us that they would deal with it and we had no further problems. Breakfast is still a good quality continental buffet, available from 7 - 10am, served by two very pleasant ladies. On this occasion we explored the local area in more detail, and discovered many more shops, cafes and restaurants within a short walking distance of the hotel than on our previous visit.

Good curtains, nice bathroom, rather quick internet axcess, flat-screen TV (however, 200 channels with nothing on but Italian game shows, but then again, we were not in Rome to watch telly). I agree, however, with the reviewer complaining slightly upon the size of the shower. My worst hotel experiences have been with dirty rooms and maids unwilling to clean what should have been done before our arrival. Raffaello was the complete opposite - it might have been the cleanest hotel room I've ever stayed at! Not one single black hair in the bed or in the bathroom throughout our five days stay - that is more seldom than one likes to think. My hope for Raffaello is that they will continue to hire the best cleaning staff in town. Breakfast was ok; what they lack in sortiment they regain with very quick and polite service. Some more fresh fruit would have been nice, though. Breakfast is included, which is good. Raffaello has a brilliant location; except for Trastevere and the Vatican, virtually all of Rome is within 25 minutes of walking. The area between the Termini train station (from where you reach the airport) and the hotel is seedy, but takes only 10 minutes. The Colosseum, Forum Romanum, The Pantheon, The Spanish steps and the rest of the cosy old city centre is within 15 minutes of walking. No taxi needed at all - the Roman Metro was surprisingly effective and VERY cheap at 1 euro per ticket. (Not needing to take a taxi was a great plus - the only taxi trip we took nearly killed us, as expected.)

What a good choice it was. Hotel is a 30ish minute drive from the airport. It is located down a very quiet side street, but 5 minutes away is a taxi rank and numerous restaurants. There is of course the train station, although this is probably 10-15 minutes away. The hotel has a very small friendly feel, and they are very welcoming. The room was smaller than what we have stayed in before, but was not missing any amenities that we required (except tea/coffee making facilities). The double bed (two singles pushed together) was very hard, but made a nice change. We were on the 1st floor, and looked out onto the side street. There was no traffic noise to worry about though. In the room itself, we had a double bed, a wardrobe, table, chair, 2x bedside cabinets and various lights. In the bathroom, there was a toilet, sink, shower and bidat. New toiletries were brought every day, but the towel only seemed to be changed every other day. Beds were made when requested, and they even folded our pyjamas up. There were only two points to the hotel, and both were to do with the room: 1) The shower was small. I am a big bloke, but not huge, and I found it hard to move around in the shower. Not a problem if you're small, but not recommended for the obese! I think you can request a room with a shower over bath. 2) The aircon did not appear to work. The room was VERY hot (even in February) and we had to sleep topless, with the windows open, and lying on top of the sheets. I think this might have had something to do with it being above the kitchen, but I'm not sure. Those are the only two bad points I can think of. Breakfast was your usual affair. Meat, cheeses, cereal, scrambled egg, fruit. Don't expect a full English though! Tea, coffee and juices were also available. Overall, the hotel was EXACTLY as described in previous reviews. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, and probably even stay there again. If you're after somewhere to eat locally, come out of the hotel, turn right, turn right again. Go up to the top of the road, cross the road, and there are a number of restaurants. Go to Pizzeria la mela d'oro. Very cheap, excellent quality and the wine is great! Probably the best we had!

None of my party had been to Rome in many years so we had no idea where to stay. We found the Hotel Raffaello on Trip Advisor and were convinced by the reviews. It also helped that we got a very good price for our stay. I will attempt to pass on information to help the reader. This is by by far the best value of any hotel I have ever stayed in. From the front desk to the breakfast staff to the housekeepers, everyone was pleasant, professional and very efficient. Most of the staff spoke English, and seemed happy to give directions and referrals for restaurants and sightseeing attractions. My wife, two friends and I stayed for 6 nights in early February, 2009. We arrived on an overnight flight around 8:00 am Rome time and the hotel allowed us to store our bags until the 2:00 pm check-in time. The neighborhood has plenty of shops and restaurants. We felt safe on the streets, even at night. We were centrally located about 10 minutes by walking from the Termini, the central train station, and also about 10 minutes from the Coliseum. The hotel is a beautiful old building that has been restored. The floors and a lot of the trim work are marble. The decorating is nicely done. Our room on the 4th floor was spacious by European standards. The bed was called a double, but was actually about 4 inches wider and 3 inches shorter than a U.S. queen size bed. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were soft. The room also had two bedside tables, a work table, and a large free-standing closet with hanging space and shelves for clothing. The bathroom was large, even by U.S. standards, and had a tile floor and tile walls about two-thirds of the way up the walls. The sink, toilet (with seat) and bidet looked nearly new. (I mention the toilet had a seat because we found that many public toilets in Rome do not have a seat.) There was a towel warmer in the bathroom, which also doubled as a clothes dryer. The towels were large and fluffy. The bath had only a shower, and it was small by U.S. standards, but it was adequate. Very large people (over 300 pounds) will probably have trouble using the shower. The room had a telephone and local calls were free. The flat screen TV was nice and had CNN and BBC in English. The cleanliness of the room and bathroom was exceptional. Towels were replaced each day and the sheets were changed after the 3rd night. Breakfast was included with the hotel stay. It was very well prepared and the variety was good. The items served each morning included scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, toast, 3 or 4 fresh fruits, yogurt, sweet rolls and pastry, cold cuts, coffee, milk, hot chocolate, orange juice, and cereal. The breakfast staff was exceptionally happy and seemed to really like their work. I mentioned to the front desk staff that we had to leave for the airport at 6:00 am on our last day, and the breakfast staff prepared a \"to-go\" breakfast which was waiting for us when we checked out. I nearly forgot, but an important convenience we used was the hotel elevator. I researched extensively before the trip, and it is fairly rare to find a 3 star hotel in central Rome with an elevator.

The room was larger than we had ever hoped for in Rome -- particularly the bathroom, which was almost as big as the bedroom (although, ironically, the shower was so small you could hardly turn around in it -- but we're not complaining). Maid service was quick and thorough. Room has a safe and a locking wardrobe if needed. The room also had a comfortable bed, and a work desk for those who need it. Internet access on the computer in the lobby was convenient and resonably priced (3 euros for 30 minutes). Location: The location was unbeatable. You're close enough that you can get to all the points of interest, but you're not so close that you're surrounded by mobs of tourists (such as hotels next to the Trevi Fountain, for example). It feels like an apartment in a residential neighborhood, which was perfect for us. Fantini around the corner in Piazza Esquilino has good cappuccino and paninis, and the proprietors are very friendly and helpful. On Via Urbana, walking distance from the hotel, there are a couple really good restaurants: Taverna Urbana, and Non c'e Trippa pe' Gatti. Non c'e Trippa pe' Gatti, in particular, served up the best meals we had in all of Rome, in a totally non-pretentious, down-to-earth, mom-and-pop atmosphere. And just to prove how helpful and professional the hotel staff is ... after we checked out and were walking into the airport, I discovered that I had left my wallet in the taxi! I called the hotel (since they were the ones who called the taxi for us) and asked if there was any way they could get a hold of the taxi driver. (I wish I could remember the man's name, so I'll just call him Mr. Raffaello.) Mr. Raffaello said he would contact the taxi service right away and ask them to contact the driver, and that he would call me back afterwards. True to his word, he called back within 5 minutes, to let me know that the taxi was on its way back to the airport. Furthermore, he called again after 20 minutes just to make sure everything worked out ok.

We took the metro a couple of times, but otherwise, you can walk to most points of interest (Colloseum, Roman Forum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain).

You can catch the Hop On/ Hop Off tour bus a block away and Termini station is also the Metro stop which you need for the Vatican.

Hotel Raffaello is a 3 star that I'd say was one of the better ones I've stayed in. The staff during the day and late at night were all very considerate helping with directions to sites, suggestions about when to go, where to eat etc. When it was time to leave for home and I had issues with the on-line check-in at my airline website due to a printer problem the night clerk handled our on-line check-in and printed our boarding passes without the need for me to by an internet access card; very helpful. The breakfast was good, typical European fair which is to my liking, one can have extra cappuccini or espresso no problem. Even though we are tourist and obviously English speakers I like to practice my Italian at every opportunity; this hotel's staff was very patient and helpful and spoke Italian to me until I ran into a problem then switched to English. For me that shows that the staff, at least for me, are interested in giving me the experience I was looking for rather than just room and board. The location is OK. To walk to the Colosseum will take about 15 minutes, to walk to Trevi Fountian, Pantheon or Piazza Navona would take about 35 - 40 minutes, its a bit of a hike. It is about a 10 minute walk from the train station and bus terminal. Walking down Via Urbana away from the train station will get you to the Urbana Metro, Via Urbana is a Roman side street and not well lit or traveled at night, this may put off some people but was fine for us and we never felt there was an issue with safety. There are numerous buses that stop close to the hotel on both Via Cavour and Via Nazionalle (pardon the spelling) but you will still need to walk in a block or so. One interesting point, the hotel offered us a taxi pick-up at the airport for 65 Euro for 3 people plus baggage on arrival, we caught the train in from the airport. We had an early flight out and elected to go for a cab, the driver , a nice old Italian gentleman only charged us 48 Euro.

Location is ideal - we explored all the main sites and never once used public transport. We would recommend a very nearby restaurant called the Gallo Matto (not sure I've spelt this correctly) - up the road that is immediately adjacent to the hotel (immediately on your right as you come out of the hotel), turn right at the top, stay on this side of the road and cross the crossing and, 2 or 3 untits down, is the restaurant. Hotel to restaurant in 2-3 minutes. Watch out for the bubbly Indian waiter - he treats you well if you return the next night (we used it for 3 nights out of the 4, regretting we didn't go in there for the last night too), e.g. free Grappa (or similar type drink) at the end of your meal or a soaked aubergine (probably sounds horrible but it was nice, having a tang about it) to start whilst awaiting the first course.

I stayed here with my girlfriend for 3 nights from the 20 Feb to 23rd.

There are lots of taxis outside Termini if you have a lot of luggage, it should cost around 5 euros to get to the hotel in one. The hotel did contact me before my trip offering me a car pickup from the airport for 48 euros for two people, not a bad price in comparison to local taxi rates, but the Leaonardo Express to Termini is just 11 euros each. It is very close to the colosseum and 'ancient rome' including palatine hill etc, easily walkable in around 10 mins. Other attractions like the Trevi Fountain, and Pantheon are a little further away, but can be walked to in around 20 mins, and you'll probably find yourself stubling upon them as you explore around anyway! The vatican is on the other side of the city, and so we did get a taxi there, this cost around 7 euros, but you could probably walk it in around 30-40 mins if you have the energy! Believe me, Rome will take it out of you over a weekend if you want to see all the sights! The hotel itself is faultless, completely spotless from the entrance, all the way to the rooms. It is a small, cosy hotel, and the rooms come equipped with everything you need; minibar, haridryer, in room safe etc.... The staff are very helpful, I asked the receptionist on duty for some restaurant recommendations, he was very helpful in drawing me a map to a beautiful (although pricy) restaurant which served the most amazing tortellini Ive ever come across! The breakfast is typical as far as most european restaurants are concerned, but caters well for all, with breads, cheeses and cereals, along with toast to order just ask a waitress. I booked my room directly with the hotel on their website www.hotelraffaello.it and I requested a room with a terrace. They obliged and we were given a very big room on the 5th floor with its own lovely terrace!

There is also cereal, breads, meats, cheeses, fruits, and a variety of juices. The hotel had the broadest breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Italy. The staff was fine, though my friend complained about their attitude.

Secondly, on our second night, the bath whirlpool pipe came free from the pump and water poured out onto the bathroom floor and subsequently the bedroom carpet.The hotel's response was to use room towels to mop up the excess water and with a shrug advised us to only use the shower for the rest of the stay. With little air circulating in the room, the carpet remained damp, which added to the musty smell. To be fair, we could have made a fuss but didn't - we are British after all! If they had apologised and found us another room without a fuss, then perhaps I would be giving a different review. Who knows?! As we were in Rome to view the sites and were simply using the hotel as a base, it didn't seem worth the bother. On that note, I would still recommend the hotel - as a reasonably priced, well placed base (we paid slightly less, I think, through a website on tripadvisor). If you want to feel wowed, spend more time in the hotel than we did or are looking for something special, then from our experiences, you run the risk of being disappointed.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago Area", "Title": "\u201cSo great last year we went again this year!\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoAreaOn_The_Go", "ReviewID": "UR21952362", "Content": "This is a gem of a little hotel.

We read the reviews on here, it looked OK, so we took the plunge - fully expecting to be disappointed when we got there. We weren't! It is central; the street seems a bit downtrodden but it hardly spoils the overall experience - good restaurants are within easy walking distance. It's not a spacious hotel, the rooms are compact, but we are both quite big and it was absolutely fine. It is spotlessly clean throughout. Everything worked including the AC; many hotels in Italy turn the AC off at the end of August to save money regardless of the temperatures! The bed was super comfortable with clean, crisp, white sheets. It was also quiet and we slept like logs - yet the hotel had many guests. Breakfast was one of the best we have had in an Italian hotel; the cappuccino wasn't great but, hey! All the staff, without exception, were friendly, efficient and helpful. One thing we noted was that when they call you a taxi you get a proper, standard, licenced cab. Many concierges in the city call you a private taxi which costs you a bomb and they get a kick- back. This is a really good sign that Raffaello is well and honestly run. We got the room for Euro 155 for the two of us including tax and breakfast.

The location is good, a ten minute walk from the main station, and ten minutes further to get to the Coloseum, with a metro station about five minutes walk away. There are smoke detectors in public areas (but not in rooms) and rather odd automatically closing fire doors that are always open and apparently close when the smoke detectors go off. That sounds odd to me - surely you want the doors to be closed all the time at night at least, and to be able to easily open them in a fire to get out! I was on top (5th Floor) and have no knowledge of whether the Rome fire brigade has ladders that go up that far. I did wonder just how terrifying it would be to try to get onto a ladder at night, given the height, if a ladder could get up that far. There is only one fire exit, which is the main staircase of the building, and windows elsewhere that might offer exit are barred with metal grilles! There was, on the top floor, an exit marked not to open, and, opening it, I found that it led onto a balcony that is used for drying laundry etc, but I don't know if that would ultimatley offer you a way out in a fire, as it mainly seemed to overlook an internal well and it might actually not be accessible to fire ladders given it was not on the street. So I felt partially safe, because of the smoke detectors and weird automatically closing doors, but not entirely. Fire safety is vital in hotels, and I think everyone needs to get a lot more assertive about this topic. Other than that? Room was lovely and quite typical for a good Italian hotel. There was a small balcony overlooking an old church. A school or convent nearby (wasnt sure what) had budgies in an aviary, who seemed to churp night and day, and that is one of the sounds I remember hearing. Staff were efficient, spoke good English willingly, and were not unhelpful. Some issues with check-in which I refer to later (they don't seem to welcome solo travellers), and they were generally brisk to the point of chilliness, but not a problem since the encounters with reception last just seconds. Tiny, old fashioned tv with only one English language station - cnn business - which plays very weird adverts for banks about adding value and adding fresh perspectives and realising potential today etc., so I had to turn it off. Breakfast service was slightly disappointing. I was travelling alone, and the only single table was perched on a stairway - so if you sat back you could literally tumble down stairs. I was offered coffee, but noticed others were also offered toast which I was not offered. The same happened the next morning - I was offered coffee but not toast, although the couple near me had just been offered toast - so - despite not wanting any, I asked for toast, and the women seemed a bit cross that I had asked for something she wasn't going to offer me. I really hate that kind of thing, it makes me dislike a place because it makes me feel unwelcome or as though my money isn't as good as anyone elses. Solo travellers are often discriminated against, with this hotel being an offender. When I checked-in, the receptionist queried why I had booked a double room, as though this was somehow wrong of me, but I'd just booked the only room they had on their website for 1 person. Was it my fault? Seemingly. Naughty me. Ridiculous shower which I couldn't work out. A \"full body\" thing, just horrid, and quite difficult to get the normal hand shower to work. Hard to get really hot water from any tap. I won't stay again for that price (\u00a3135 a night) given my uncertainty about fire safety, the odd and slightly hostile behaviour at brekfast in trying to deprive me of toast, and the decidedly chilly if efficient reception staff - but would recommend it if you can get a room for \u00a3100 a night or less, which reading the review here people sometimes seem to be able to get.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel - Close to the best restaurant in Rome - Tema!!\u201d", "Author": "dradams93", "ReviewID": "UR20053593", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel over the Easter break.

I have travelled extensively in Europe, I know hotel rooms are small and I am not comparing it to an American hotel- trust me when I say this room was small. The desk clerk was not particularly welcoming at check in and when we had a question about the room he became rude and condescending. Another member of staff helped register my husband so he could have internet access and was OK. The lobby was lovely and breakfast was the normal croissants, yogurt & water-downed juice fare. As mentioned the room was small, it was dark, the \"upgrade\" gave us 2 single beds rather than the room we had booked months earlier (we were not pleased at this development) and the air conditioning didn't work properly- it ran but no cool air.

On the top floor, with acres of hanging space, drawers galore, freshly decorated, very clean, super bathroom, (except no shower screen but actually had a window) and we even had a huge private rooftop terrace! Obviously all the rooms are not this size but we were delighted. Much has been said about rude reception staff. I found them professional and helpful. Admittedly, a few more smiles would have been nice but really, who cares?

The advantage of the location is the peace and quiet after a noisy, hectic day sightseeing. There are lots of eateries round about but I would recommend \"Wanted\" at the very bottom of Via Urbana for a great pizza and I think it was called \"Archetta\" down Via Cavour on the right just at the first main intersection for really friendly service and atmosphere. Just quickly, on another subject, we used Terravision to transfer from Pisa when we visited Florence recently. Suffice to say it was an absolute shambles.

The hotel is convenient for everything on the Eastern side of the river, as long as you call a 20-minute walk convenient. For us, who just wanted to amble all round Rome, it was fine. The walk from Termini station is under 10 minutes, but not the easiest if you're dragging a suitcase on wheels because of cobbles and narrow pavements. The best restaurants are a fair way away, but we went to Strega nearby a couple of times which was pretty good. We'd never been to Rome before and absolutely loved it. It's an ideal city to wander around, not as expensive as I was expecting, with amazing history that just leaps out at you every corner you turn. English is widely spoken but, as usual, a few words of Italian go a long way. Best things: watching the sun go down from the Spanish Steps, sitting in a cafe in a Piazza watching the world go by and just taking in all the sights as you wander round. Take care if you're a church fan, as many of them shut at 12 or 1pm for a few hours in the afternoon. Recommended trip - if you're fit, climb the 350 steps up inside the dome of St Peter's to get to the cupola - the view from the top is incredible. Final warning - the drivers are totally insane.

The not so good (I can't really call it \"bad\"): - it takes about 15-20 minutes on small winding streets to get from Forum Romanum to the hotel.

I'm happy to say that our stay at the Raffaello was excellent. The room was nice, the bath clean, the breakfast excellent and the location good (not exactly overlooking the Roman Forum, but a short walk--that's why you're getting a better price). The only downside, as mentioned by other reviewers, is the front desk staff. They're friendly enough, but don't necessarily make you feel welcome. The best way to describe it is that they seem only a heart beat away from being snippy (if you were to cross some line and become a problem). Still, reception is only a minor irritation that shouldn't make you cross the hotel off your list since there are so many other things to recommend it. The hotel faces a small street just off a main thoroughfare, Via Cavour (that goes from the Termini Train Station to the Roman Forum area), making the location both quiet and convenient (note: I saw a lot of hotels that we ON the main thoroughfare--avoid these at all costs since the road is extremely loud and dirty). One concern I had was that the hotel might be too close to the train station (note: the less expensive hotels are near the train station). I had heard that the area around the train station was to be avoided since it attracts unsavory people (pick pockets, bums, peddlers, etc.). I can happily report that the area around the hotel is quite pleasant. The train station is far enough away that it is not a problem--yet close enough that you can easily walk with your roller bag luggage just fine (pleasant walk on flat streets that takes about 10 minutes--but I'd take a cab at night). And lastly, the shower in our room was this strange one person thing made by Jacuzzi (water jets squirt from the sides). It was so small I could barely turn around let along reach down and soap my legs. I'm only 5'-9\" and not heavy, so you can imagine how small it was.

I would expect it to be priced considerably below other hotels rated higher either on Tripadvisor or that had a higher star rating. The rooms are quite small. I was travelling solo so the room was acceptable to me but it would have been tight for more then one person. You can hear a bit of noise from neighboring rooms. Breakfast was decent and more than adequate with a pleasant wait staff. The rooms and hotel in general are spotless and well appointed for a three star hotel. It is in a slightly less desirable part of town than say the hotels near the Spanish steps but Rome is quite small and virtually everything is walk able. The hotel is very close to the Termini train station which is also the main bus station. That made it very easy to get around cheaply. From wherever I was I could just look for a bus going to Termini\u2026..quite easy\u2026\u2026.same with the metro. For 16 euros you can get a pass for unlimited bus and metro transport although the metro and buses are only 1 euro. There were several reasonable restaurants in the neighborhood and also more expensive ones that tended to be quite good. This is still a tourist area with quite a few hotels around however they tend to be two and three star hotels and the restaurants were seemingly cheaper than in other areas of town. Unfortunately while I was staying at the hotel I received a phone call from the United States that my father had died and I had to return to the States for the funeral. The hotel was of no help to me in this regard. No assistance in rebooking my flights and not even a condolence from either of the two attendants I dealt with at the front desk during the 16 hour period I was making arrangements to leave Rome. The only thing they told me was to make sure I did not make any calls outside the hotel on the house phone near the lobby. When I checked out of the hotel I was advised that since I did not stay over a Sunday evening (I was checking out Sunday morning due to my father\u2019s death) the rate I was paying for each of the four evenings I was at the hotel had increased 10%. This was not a big deal to me. However, the airlines and other hotels I was cancelling reservations with could not have been nicer. Refunding deposits in full and asking how they could help me out. The staff at The Raffaello were not nasty or unpleasant just not helpful in my emergency and not very understanding or compassionate or willing to help in any way and I had been tipping them nicely during my stay. In sum I would say if you get a very good rate stay here. The hotel does have a lot going for it. Only do not expect any assistance in an emergency situation. If you cannot get a very good rate then I would pass on this hotel. If not for the lack of assitance or understanding with my emergency I would have given this hotel a very high rating. So if you have no emergency you should be more than fine but I would still urge you to stay only if you have a competitive rate visa vi other hotels. Oh one last thing\u2026..right around the corner is an internet store where you can access the internet for 1 euro per half hour and make long distance phone calls quite cheaply.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny gal in Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat refuge after long days of sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "atlantic_transplant", "ReviewID": "UR11943534", "Content": "The Raffaello was a great place to make our headquarters while we visited the sites of Rome.

Our room also had a small bureau and coat hooks on the wall with the window). It was just enough space for two. The room was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated with very high ceilings.

There is a good continental assortment of breads, pastries, meats, cheese, fruits and cereal. There is also a station for scrambled eggs. The breakfast room is also very cozy, with tablecloth, settings, etc. Coffee, tea or cappuccino served to you at your table, and the friendly staff added to making this a good way to ease into the day.

The Raffaello is in a great, convenient location just down Via Cavour from Termini station. We took a cab from the airport to the hotel which was quite expensive - 60 euro. There is an express train from the airport to Termini station. Keep in mind that if you have a lot of luggage (more than one rolling suitcase each) it might be better to take a cab. Via Cavour is a main street in Rome and the sidewalks are very crowded, made of uneven cobblestone and very narrow in spots. Navigating this street with a lot of luggage would be very difficult at best even if you are in good shape like us. Also, going to the hotel from Termini is downhill - going back to Termini from the hotel is uphill. Our room was ready upon arrival, however it had a strange smell and the t.v. didn't work. We asked to be moved and were given another room immediately which was much nicer. The elevator is about the size of a coat closet so we chose to use the stairs. Our room consisted of a bed, wardrobe and a desk. Air conditioning worked well. Our room faced a side street and was very quiet so sleeping was not a problem. The room was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was immaculate and had a bidet (which I did not use). The shower was like a tube and extremely small - no exageration here - once we got in the shower it was difficult to move. My husband and I are thin people so it was not a problem for us, but I can't imagine trying to use the shower if you are a larger person. However, the shower had great water pressure and there was always plenty of hot water any time of day. If you like to use a wash cloth, bring your own - they do not provide them at the hotel. I bought some at a dollar store before we left the States so I did not care if they were left at the hotel. The breakfast was nice. Sweet breads, meats, eggs (extremely runny - but this seems to be the standard in Europe). We always got there early so there was plenty to chose from. The front desk was friendly enough but not overly so. They recommended a restaurant nearby that was very good. They were also very helpful in booking a day trip to Naples and Pompei. There are plenty a restaurants nearby and the food was very good everywhere we ate. The gelati is great no matter where you go. We always felt very safe walking the streets around the hotel after dark. The streets of Rome can be very confusing so bring a good map. We used the hop-on, hop off open air bus the first day to get a feel for the city and where things were. This was a great was to get familiar to the city and get to all the main attractions without using the metro. We used the metro once to get to the Vatican and found the system cheap (1 euro each way) and easy to use. We took a day trip to Naples and Pompei. We were picked up at the hotel around 7 p.m. and dropped off about 8:30 p.m. The trip included lunch at a hotel and was very good. Pompei was amazing and the highlight of the entire trip to Italy! I would NOT recommend doing a tour of the Vatican Museum on your own. The lines start forming before 6 a.m. very day and by the time the museum opens, the lines extend for about 10 blocks. Most people we talked to waited 5-7 hours in line. If you go with a tour group, you get immediate access with your group and a guided tour that is very informative. Our tour started at 9 a.m. and was done about 2 p.m. and worth every penny (about 40 euros each). All in all, I would highly recommend the Raffaello hotel. We only used the room to sleep in at the end of very long, exhausting days so we did not need a large, luxurious room.

Hotel Rafaello is terrific and exactly as everyone has described. I would only add the following to what seems to be the general consensus: 1.) Our room was actually larger than expected, though seemingly all the rooms have different decor and layouts, so this may not be the case for everyone. We were on the 4th floor along the alley; very quiet both from an indoor and outdoor perspective....never heard anything from adjacent rooms and with the windows shut, city noise was barely a whisper. Turn the A/C to quiet mode and you are in for a good night sleep. Very clean and the furnishings are all tasteful with no signs of wear. 2.) Bathroom itself was also on the large side in comparison to other places we'd been. Yes, the Jaccuzi shower was a tight fit, but it worked great and plenty of hot water. I suppose if I had to mark down for something, this would be it, but honestly, it wasn't that much of a bother for us. 3.) The staff was terrific....we especially enjoyed the ladies attending the breakfast which had all the typical Euro choices. The staff mostly understands English, but I think appreciated our (faltering) attempts at Italian. 4.) The elevator stops on a landing between each floor which may be confusing upon first use. The staff will tell you which floor number you need to select in order to walk down half a flight of stairs to your floor rather than up half a flight. 5.) While the property is near the Termini, it is not exactly right around the corner....not necessarily far enough to take a cab, but if you have a lot of luggage, you may work up a bit of a sweat getting there (about 15 mins). 6.) While the Cavour metro station is the closest, it is the other line that goes to many of the attractions that are beyond quick walking distance (Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese, Vatican). You can transfer between the lines at the Termini, but it was somewhat of a walk between platforms and frequently a madhouse so we eventually found it easier to use the Repubblica station instead. The metro day pass at 4 euros is a pretty good deal, though the system coverage is sparse when compared to the likes of London or Paris. 7.) Print up a map of the area beforehand and then take the one provided by the Hotel everywhere you go. City planning being what it was back in the day, it is really easy to get turned around in Rome even for those who otherwise have a good sense of direction (though there are worse things than being lost in Rome). 8.) Definitely take advantage of the roof top terrace at the sister property Hotel Senato. You can get a pass at the Rafaello front desk, although the desk at the Senato did not ask to see it. It's quite busy around sunset, then less so afterward depending on what you are looking for; the bartender is a hoot and was one of the few people in Europe who knew how to make a proper martini. The view is magnificent. Unless you require a view of the Colosseum out your window, I can highly recommend the Rafaello and will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "skp115", "ReviewID": "UR10021436", "Content": "This was definititely a good hotel 3 star hotel to stay in Rome.

The toughest time for us was getting out of the Termini itself! We got the train from Leonardo da Vinci Fiumicino Airport to the Termini and were able to walk to the hotel.

Needless to say, my first walk around Rome was nerve racking because I kept thinking about losing my bags. When we returned, we were set up in our rooms but we had to take the elevator one at a time because it's a single person lift.

They did have an AC; however, it never cooled down the room and I sweated most of the night.

You're not allowed to take the main key with you with you leave, you have to turn it in to the concierge. When you leave your room -- the AC turns off, so you have to ask for a spare key to keep in the room so it stays warm... which is better than hot, especially in the Rome heat.

Beware the portable, snack cabins throughout Rome got ripped off for water best use little shops.

The travel guides tell you Rome is big and most hotels expensive and tatty, so TripAdvisor was a huge help. I\u2019d always check it out before travelling again - so keep your reviews coming!! Firstly, flying from the UK when I went the airport parking was half price if you booked two weeks in advance, so that\u2019s worth checking out. In Rome the train from the airport was free for kids (about 11 Euro for both of us, compared to about \u00a330 for catching the Heathrow Express in London!). When you arrive at Termini there is a train timetable on the wall so you easily sorty out what train you need to catch back to the airport. Hotel Raffaello was perfect. Only 10 mins walk from Termini station, so you can manage bags on wheels when you arrive and leave, unless you loads of luggage. One street off the main road, so even when there was lots of hooting horns following a football win against Milan it was still quiet enough to sleep. Clean, central and easy to get to the sites. Unless you want to pay for a 5* I wouldn\u2019t bother going anywhere else. The lift is tiny, so if you are huge or claustrophobic that might be a problem. The hotel is on a side road, opposite and just after the junction with the huge church Santa Maria Maggiore. It turned out when we went (16/19 May) that Banca di Roma was sponsoring a culture week, so all the sites were free. Maybe TripAdvisor can highlight this sort of thing in future? The big sites for our schedule were: - arrive mid afternoon - Pantheon, Trevi, Spanish Steps ( a bit of a walk) - next day to Forum and Coliseum - next morning do Vatican, fly out mid afternoon. (Half a day is a bit tight) The Forum / Coliseum. From the hotel, walk up the 50 yard side road back to St Mario Maggiore and turn right down Via Cavour. In about 10 mins you will arrive opposite the middle of the forum. The tourist shops you pass on the way have some of the better prices for T shirts etc. As you approach this T junction on your right you will pass a restaurant with fixed awnings, Bar Masse. Pizza is excellent, pasta good (though it seems to arrive 5 mins after the pizza), prices very reasonable \u2013 strongly recommended. You are now in the middle of the rectangle that is the Forum. 20m to your left of these traffic lights is the Forum shop which has excellent picture guide books and a good cheap folding map of the ancient forum which is huglely helpful as you walk around piles of stones! When people advise you to buy a ticket at the Forum ticket office to cover both the Coliseum and the Forum, you get to this by going to the Coliseum (a 5 min walk left), then turning back on yourself into the Forum. I\u2019d also suggest walking down from the hotel to see the Coliseum lit up at night, then going to Bar Masse to eat. Must sees are the Pantheon (the roof is so extraordinary, and the largest concrete construction in the world until this century). It\u2019s free. The Trevi Fountain also, of course, though it is a bit confusing finding your way back to the hotel \u2013 if you go north up to the main road then turn right (ie East) you need to go much further than you think before turning right to come back to Santa Maria (The tunnel road you pass is only half way). The Spanish steps were a bit disappointing. The Egyptian needle at the top was covered in scaffolding, so no great views up them (and the guide photos of these must have been taken out of someone\u2019s window or from a balloon at 6am!). Watch the signs to find this (we missed one and had a tiring detour up the RHS towards Villa Borghese) As regards the Vatican, you need to check out their website to see when what is open! If we hadn\u2019t we would have gone on a day the Sistine Chapel was shut. Although I like art, it did take 45 mins to follow round the one way signs to the Sistine, and by then my 10 year old was too tired to care. Pretty impressive rooms on the way, however. We didn\u2019t get up St Peter\u2019s dome \u2013 there was a huge queue so allow time. From the front of the Vatican it is a10 min walk down the round Castle St Angelo, and you can cross the bridge for photos. We just stopped for lunch down a side road on the left half way to the castle in what looked a tatty cafe but had a wood burning pizza oven inside and was a fair price. It is twice as far as it looks on the map to a metro station, however! Tips: -go to the Coliseum then back into the Forum to buy an entrance ticket and avoid queues. The don\u2019t join the big queue when you go to the Coliseum -eat at Bar Masse - lots of wonderful ice cream (make sure its from the metal containers - other reviews say they are cleaner) -They are trying to clean up the touts posing for photos with you as centurions, but agree a price first -Stay at Hotel Rafaello -There\u2019s a lot of walking \u2013 comfy shoes not high fashion ones -Have a drink at cafes so you can use their toilets.

We staggered through the front door and into Fabio's care. We felt like we were family coming home. He and Francesca left no stone unturned to make British Airway locate the luggage and send it along to us. We were handicapped by the language difference and the airline personnel dealing with us kept saying that it was a holiday and nothing they could do - and the luggage would be shipped home and be there when we arrived. Francesca and Fabio called every hour on the hour to facilitate the return of the luggage and I am sure that without their persistence- one on us would have vacationed without luggage. The hotel was delightful- our room was immaculate and plenty roomy. The breakfast was fresh and delicious each day - there were even eggs. The ladies serving breakfast were friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed the convenient location of the hotel - we were able to walk there from the Termini (all downhill!). We could also walk to the Colosseum and Forum and Tourist Bus stop.

Hotel itself is in a creepy location 1 block off of the main busy street. During the day, really no big deal. At night...while it is only 1 block off the main street and lots of people/action, it still IS. This makes it quiet...and also creepy (maybe it's just me). Our room was a suite on the top floor with a HUGE rooftop deck. So the deck is cool to sit outside, etc. But there's also nothing to look at really except rooftops. Lots of TV stations, but you'd think that only Germans stayed here based on the available channels. There were 3 English channels, but MANY more German channels. Just bizarre. Room was very clean w/ lots of closet space, A/C worked great, really a pleasure to come back to after a day of tourist stuff. However they must love flooding because there is no shower curtain on the tub...so the water goes EVERYWHERE when you shower...on the floor, windows, toilet, etc. You'll easily use every towel you have...and then request more. Don't open your window in the bathroom unless you want someone across the way to be looking at you. Breakfast was pretty good, but most days we couldn't get a place to sit unless you went very early or late. As everyone has noted, the elevator is a joke.

When we left breakfast (take a piece of fruit for your snack and try the oranges -- they are yummy blood oranges and SOOO good), we were told there was a problem with our room and would we accept 2 single rooms. As I was travelling with my teenager, i was not keen on this so i politely declined and they said they'd figure something out. When we returned from our first walks around rome in the early afternoon, they offered us a room at their sister hotel by teh pantheon in rome which was quite lovely and then paid for the cab there and back. when we came back the next day, our room was ready and it was equally beautiful. on the \"to look out for \" list -- our shower did not flood and was fine and the bathroom was quite adequate in size. The beds were clean and comfy. the pillows however were rock hard. i hated it and have never thought of myself as a pillow snob but...whatever! Also, Would not ask for their recommendations for dinner as we were consistently steered to tourist local spots, even when we asked for places anywhere in the city. Random comments for Rome -- the Borghese Gallery was our highlight by far but is reservation only and i would suggest making reservations when you book your hotel and plan your days around that -- definitely before you leave. Ditto the vatican as we had to wait in surreal lines. that said, i noticed that many tours were waiting in line with me so i am not sure if these were \"vatican\" tours or random Rome tour groups but i would not want to pay for a tour guide and still stand in a 2 hour line. Palatine hill was fun but pack a lunch. buy or pack a nalgene bottle. Rome water fountains are everywhere and very good water mostly so it was nice to be able to fill up on the go. Near the hotel, we ate at Restaurant il giglio up by the opera house. it was good. We also ate at Its Amore -- again many tourists but the biggest salads we found for the best price. The best gelato was diagonally across form the opera house. The place has these gelato shaped cone garbage pails outside when it is open. the gelato place across the street (on same side of the street as the opera house) was quite missable. we also grabbed a meal (because no place was open at 3 pm) the train station, on the second floor.

Having come from the pampering of Florence's family-run Hotel Davanzati, we were prepared for a drop-off and, sure enough, this hotel failed to meet the benchmark of the Florentine champion. However, it was in every way adequate, and more than that in several aspects for my wife, myself, and our 11 yr old son. To get the negatives out of the way, two quirks that other reviewers have mentioned were indeed in evidence. 1) The shower DOES really flood the bathroom. Never quite worked out why and my wife didn't encounter it but having showered almost daily for half a century, I figure it wasn't me. (I took comfortable baths for the duration of the stay) . 2) There IS a clunker at the front desk, among the remaining very nice people. And, no, it's not the courtly Massimo, the friendly Fabio, or the wonderful Francesca! But if you see a ringer for Peter Sellers (in one of his bespectacled but non-mustachioed roles) save your inquiries or requests for the next shift. 3) There is one internet computer available in an alcove off the lobby but there is a charge and be prepared to get the cold stare from other guests who want to usurp the PC long before your purchased time has elapsed. However, positives outweigh these relative trifles. The triple room was comfortable, rather roomy, clean, with great blackout curtains and a handy armoire and nicely appointed bathroom. The lift was reliable, the free breakfast above average. Some reviewers have criticized the location, but it's quiet, safe, and if you're fit enough to walk, all but the Vatican and the catacombs, and perhaps the nightclub area, are within a healthy stroll. The Forum and Coliseum are no more than a 12 minute walk. The magnificent Santa Maria Magiori less than 5 minutes. Some have bemoaned a lack of decent restaurants within walking distance. I can't concur.There are numerous moderately-priced trattorias and ethnic restaurants reached by taking a left leaving the hotel, then a right at the corner. (the opposite direction to Santa Maria Magiore) Go up the hill then when the street starts to descend , you'll find three quite nice, informal restaurants..choose from the menus in front. Go farther down a block or two to the light..hang a left and discover a very good Indian restaurant on the next corner. Take a left at that corner and there's another Indian just as good and dirt cheap by Roman standards. On the other end of the scale, there is an incomparable restaurant for a special evening going uphill in the opposite direction, TOWARDS Santa Maria Magiore. Pass the cathedral, walking on the main avenue to the left of the church . Down half a block on your right (and still only a bit over 5 mins from the hotel) and you're in for an outstanding dining experience, albeit an expensive one. From the spot-on service to the comfortable yet elegant room, to the imaginative, delicious gourmet food, you've found one of Rome's ..and indeed one of the world's..best restaurants : Agata e Romeo.

Two of us had stayed in Rome before so we had a good feel for the city and at least a couple of the hotels there (as well as numerous hotels in other cities around Europe). First the positive aspects: The (double) rooms were reasonably-sized and clean. I suspect they were recently renovated and this was done with some taste. The bed in our room was a good size - by Italian standards - and was clean and firm. The breakfast selection was reasonably good - pretty typical European buffet arrangement (meats, cheeses, cereals, etc.). The hotel is situated just off Via Cavour and about 5 minutes walk to the main train station (Stazione Termini). This is also the main interchange for the Rome Metro which is incredibly useful (and cheap!) for getting around the city. The hotel staff were pleasant - based on previous reviews, I was expecting 5-star friendliness. But I have no complaints; they were all professional and polite. Now, the negatives.... The location isn't ideal if you want quick access to the main sights (like the Spanish Steps or the Trevi...or....most important, the main shopping drag of Via del Corso, Via Condotti, etc). On a previous stay, we stayed at the Ottocente which is on Via Sistina - just 5 mins from the Spanish Steps. Much better location, higher standard of hotel and for approximately the same price (and highly recommended!). Our room was facing out onto the street (Via Urbana) and, as a result, we were woken each morning around 7am with the usual stream of noisy mopeds. But, to be honest, this is quintessential Rome, so I kind of liked it in a perverse way! Overall, this is a good 3-star (in the Irish/UK sense) hotel. For about the same price, you could probably get a 4-star nearer the main sights.

For context, this was my eighth trip to Europe, third to Italy, and second to Rome. I have traveled all over Europe and have stayed at hotels ranging from 2 stars to 5 stars. I generally, because of price, end up staying in the 3-4 star range when I travel to Europe. As has been noted a number of times by travelers, travel sites, etc.. the star rating system is not what some might think as most in Europe are based on objective features such as square footage, whether there are elevators, shared bathrooms, and the like instead of traditional, conventional luxury furnishings and cleanliness. That as my background, I must say that there were a number of things that jumped out at me during my stay at the Raffaello that rank it only as average among 3-4 star hotels in Europe in my opinion. The good: The breakfast was nice, had plenty of options for a continental spread, and there were nice pieces of fruit and cookies you could take with you for the day. The wait staff at breakfast was excellent. (my only complaint about breakfast was that the \"orange juice\" was more like Tang than actual juice). Our room was clean, nicely furnished, and about average in size (per my experiences). It was not overly-large, but there were no doors bumping into the bed or climbing over your travel companion to get to the closet or bathroom. I've read complaints along those lines and stayed once in a 4-star hotel that seemed to resemble those characterizations. The beds were comfortable. A bit on the firm side, but not overly-so. The windows seemed to be pretty well sound-proofed. The so so/not so good: The bathroom. While sparkling clean and apparently recently refurbished, the bathroom in our room had not been planned out well. I don't know if this is a common problem in the other rooms, but it definitely was in ours. First, the bidet and toilet faced each other. This would not normally be a notable problem. Here it was, however, because there were only about 2 inches between the fronts of each. This meant you had to either lift a leg over the toilet or use it side-saddle so to speak. There is no chance, regardless of how skinny or small you are, that you can fit your left through the opening between them. Not a huge problem, but it could have been eliminated by moving one of the fixtures over 6 inches (and there was wall space for such a move). Second, and this is the more annoying thing to me, the shower. While it appeared to be a brand new jacuzzi-style shower, it was incredibly small. It was shaped like a quarter circle, and a lot of the space inside was taken up by a seat and jet fixtures. It is the smallest shower I have ever been in in my life (including a small cruise ship shower). There was barely room for me to turn around, and I'm a small woman (5'5\", size 4). My travel companion is 5'10\", but she is built like a model. She had trouble as well. I simply cannot imagine an average-sized man, let alone above average, fitting comfortably in this shower. Perhaps other rooms have different showers. If you have an issue with tight spaces or are concerned about fitting, I'd inquire before and get a guarantee. Finally, 2 issues with service. This is actually the first hotel I've been to in Europe that recommended a restaurant that advertises on the hotel's keys and in their lobby. I asked about a couple of specific restaurants, and I was directed to this restaurant instead. When I got back to my room, I called to ask the man at reception to make reservations at one of the restaurants I'd initially asked about. I gave him the name, address, etc. When I offered to give them the phone number, he said he could find it quickly. When we were about to leave for dinner and asked about a taxi, we were told there was no need because \"the restaurant\" was right down the street. Reservations had been made at the restaurant they recommended. The man seemed put out when I asked him to make another reservation. Second, shipping things home. I know, I know, I was silly and bought some vinegar and other liquids without thinking about the new liquid restrictions. I travel 3-4 per month for work so I'm well aware of the rules, and I have bought all miniature toilettries to manage carry-on bags. For some reason, it went right out of my mind until the night before we were supposed to leave. When I asked the hotel about shipping the items home (because I really didn't want to check a bag), I was told they just don't do that unless someone leaves something in a room. This was a surprise from a 3-star hotel with so many recommendations. Not the end of the world, but not the greatest attention to service. I will pay a bit more to stay closer to Piazza Navona or the Spanish Steps next time I'm in Rome. Overall, the Raffaello was sae, clean, and a good hotel. Well located for the train station.

A nice assortment of rolls (we woke up to the smell of them baking each morning), meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal, yogurts, and juices, as well as a fine selection of coffee, cappuchino or hot tea was grand. The service provided by the hotel was very much appreciated.

A 20 minute walk (again downhill) took us to the Ancient City Centre for a day spent perusing the Coliseum, Roman Forum, Palatine, etc. Another 20 minute walk a different day took us to the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. The only day we used the Metro (caught it at the Termini Station) was to spend the day at the Vatican. Tip on visiting the Vatican Musuems - we arrived at the Vatican Musuems at 9:15 AM (it opens at 8:45 AM) expecting a huge line. We only waited 30 minutes and when we actually finished our tour around 1-2 PM, there was absolutely no line.

We were a party of four, including my 13 year old son, we were given a quad room, which was actually a suite. A beautiful room with a lovely bathroom featuring a supeb corner shower, which was a lot of fun and had my son entertained for ages and to my amazement, actually managed to leave the bathroom exactly as he had found it, spotless, not a drip on the floor. For a 13 year old, my son has amazing standards, he loves elegance, charm, quality and good furniture and was impressed with not only our lovely room, with its tasteful pictures on the walls, which were, to his amazement, padded fabric, which added a quality of high stardard, but the fact that the hallways and staircase that led to our room (320) were so lovely too. A rich coloured carpet runs up the stair and halls, the walls again have lovely artwork and even the door surrounds and door furniture are super brass quality, all of these things noted by a 13 year old. Us adults were equally impressed. Needless to say, the public areas are also elegant and rather lovely. The breakfast room accessed by a double winding marble staircase is very welcoming and the breakfast itself is lovely including the scambled eggs. A must, from this hotel is a restaurant, 1-2 minutes walk away. Come out of the hotel, walk up the little side road alongside the hotel, get to the top and look across the road to the restaurnt with the word \"Restaurant\" above it. In the window is a Grand Piano, played beatifully every night. Lovely friendly waiters, superb meal and not expensive, but the ambiance is perfect for an evening meal in Rome. If you are in rome for two full days, have an agenda so you don't waste precious time. We had one, which I worked out and it was perfect for our return flight timings. Day 1. Up early to get in line for Vatican Museums including the Sistene Chapel. (Take metro from Termini to Ottaviano, 1 euro each) From exit of Vatican, walk round vatican walls clockwise to St. Peters Castel St. Angelo and cross river Piazza Navone (good for lunch) (Restaurant with pink padded chairs very good) Pantheon Trevi Fountain Spanish Steps (Take metro back to Termini) Day 2 Walk down to the Colosseum (Handy Hint - Ignore guide sellers outside. By-pass the HUGE queue by joining the smaller or non existant queue for groups, when you get down to the ticket office, go to the last window which sells only entrance (11 euros) plus 3.50 euros extra, for an official guided tour by english speaking guides. A superb guide with audio connection to your guide. You have saved youself a lot of money and a lot of time. This is cheaper than taking the guides from outside the colloseum and you have saved all the queing time, all for an extra 3.50 euros.) Walk up to and through the Imperial Forum (free) Exit to the left and at the top and head down towards the river Over bridge to Isola Tiberina Over bridge to Trastevere for lunch Back over bridge Walk round the edge of roman ruins of Teatrod'Marcell (like small colosseum) and head up hill to Piazza Camidoglio Work your way across to more ruins 'Foro di Traiano' whilst aiming for Via Nazionale Walk along VN to Via A. Depretts on the right, which heads towards Santa Maria Maggiore, which is just by Hotel Rafaello. Last road on right is Via Urbana with Hotel Raffeallo in sight. We arrived in time for a quick refresh before our airport transfer arrived at 6.30 p.m. (40 euros for up to 4 people - very cost effective when you are a party of 4. Saved the hassle of metro, waiting, coach and walking uphill with bags to termini). Their telephone number is :- [--] - we had a mecedes mini van with blacked out windows, my son like that.

The bathroom and the room appeared recently renovated and were very clean. We were facing the street, which was very noisy at times, especially when the garbage truck would come in the middle of the night to empty the nearby dumpsters. I've learned that it is noisy nearly everywhere unless you find a hotel with rooms that face an interior courtyard. The breakfast was typical--eggs, fruit, cereal, pastry, coffee. By the way--we got a much better price for calling the hotel than we saw online, so call or email them directly. They speak English and also respond quickly to email. This hotel is not in the middle of it all--it is closer to old Rome--the Forum, etc. You will get a real flavor for a regular in-town Roman neighborhood with restaurants that cater to locals. There is a fantastic gelateria up the street--I can't recall the name but it is named after the big church that is near the hotel--S. Maria Maggiore--one of the largest churches in Rome, so don't miss it. We walked to the hot spots every day--right up the Via Milano.

I chose this hotel mainly for it's location because it was close to a line-B metro stop (Cavour) and hence it would be easy for me to get into my office whist working in Rome. From a business perspective therefore the location was quite good, from a tourist perspective it was not so good because the main tourist / restaurant / bar / shopping areas are about a 25 minute walk away. I'm not adverse to walking but this did become a bit of a drag especially because Rome is quite a hilly place and all the streets are cobbled so its quite hard on the feet. You can get a bus from near the hotel into the more interesting part of Rome from just around the corner of the hotel but these aren\u2019t that reliable and the service ends at 9pm so you can't get a bus home if you're out for the evening. The location is much better for the historic part of Rome such as the Coliseum and Palatine, but to be honest I'd prefer to have been nearer the main nightlife in the city rather than near the historic part which basically closes down at night. The hotel accommodation is pretty basic and the pictures on the hotels website are somewhat misleading in my view. The room we stayed in could have done with a lick of paint because there were scuff marks on all walls - nothing too unsightly but something they could easily rectify if they wanted to. The bathroom was adequate although the drains did smell a bit (I think this is a generic problem in Rome) the only criticism is the size of the shower which is small. Both the bedroom and bathroom where very clean however. My biggest criticism of the room was its temperature, clearly designed for a hot climate the room didn't have adequate heating and became very cold at night. There would extra blankets but even so I did wake up a few times due to the cold. I'd recommend therefore that you avoid this hotel during the colder months. I guess that the hot months this criticism probably is reversed however! Service was only average it really depended who was on the front desk. The younger staff were pretty helpful and courteous but there was an older chap occasionally on the front desk who always seemed to be as miserable as sin. We found it quite amusing but I can imagine that other people would be quite put out by his attitude and lack of grace. The breakfast staff were also a but hit and miss - on one occasion I was ignored completely and gave up on my morning coffee completely! So all in all I would rate this hotel as average. I'm not sure why it has such a high overall rating on this site to be honest. I think its a good sound 3 star hotel but it certain isn't any more that that.

We would recommend Unicum (Via di S.Maria Maggiore) for a wonderful evening meal....go after 9pm on the right night and you will be entertained by 'The Maestro' on the piano. We also discovered a rather different experience at a small newly opened restaurant recommended by the hotel receptionist. Turn left out of the hotel and follow the Via Urbana down the hill....the restaurant doesn't have a sign but you will probably hear the entertainment long before you see the place on the right. Quite honestly we have never come across a singer like her before and, despite sitting here for 10 minutes trying to describe her style/voice, words fail me. The food was very average. The entertainment was priceless. The Collosseum and The Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore are within easy walking distance as are most of the sights of Rome if you enjoy walking.

He did not give us any information about the complimentry breakfast. When we asked about the safe deposit box he stated that it was somewhere in the room, but he did not know where. He also stated that we would need to ask for the key and then leave it at the front desk, Not sure how Safe that was. Our experience with other front desk employees was very positive; however this paticular employee made the first impression and probably costs the hotel a higher rating. The hotel is located away from some of the tourist areas, meaning a little more residential and less of a dinning selection real close to the hotel. The neighborhood is a little questionable especially if away from main streets or closer to the train station. We did dine at the restaurant around the block from the hotel and that restaurant was excellent. The room was above average, with the bathroom a little crowded. Showering was a little difficult as there was a hand held shower with no curtain. The Blow dryer in the BR probably could double as a vacum cleaner. The breakfast was average. The coffiee was good, but most of the good breads and pastries were in very low stock or they would run out of. Overall this is a nice hotel. It is not located in a bad area, but not a place to do a lot of exploring at night. The service at this hotel probably depends on the employee you get at the front desk.

Massimo was the concierge on duty when we arrived, he is great!!! We were quickly booked into a splendid room on the first floor (Rm 106, ask for this one!) a large and comfortable bed an oversized room and an ample sized bathroom, (I'm 6'0\" and 240 lbs), was just the ticket to relax in after a trying train trip. The surprise of this room was the wonderful balcony overlooking the very quite street, (great for a relaxing nightly vino and cigar). The rooms were extremely clean and well appointed, nothing looked worn or out of date. Morning breakfast was great as well, a very varied menu is prepared daily by an extremely efficient wait staff who will prepare special coffee's upon request. I wish I could remember the woman\u2019s name who ran the breakfast, as she is superb!!! Eggs to pastry every day with everything well made and tasty!! We can't say enough about the staff's professionalism. Massimo was our favorite, perhaps because we saw him the most. He is an amazing person who truly loves his job. Listen for his nightly serenade as he leaves at 11 PM every night, LOL!!! Alex is in at 11 most nights and is very professional as well. We weren't around much in the daytime, but when we were we were met with smiles and a cherry bonjourno. The noise from the street is minimal, and was never a bother we slept soundly every night. Except for the trash pickup around 4am, the street is very quite. The location of the hotel is perfect, a short walk from the Coliseum and the Roman Forum, we walked through the area around 11 pm our first night in Rome. We were out every night until after midnight and never felt unsafe. Taxi's were plentiful and inexpensive, with all of our trips under 10 euros. Our favorite restaurant is just up the street from the hotel on Via Cavor on the same block as the Hotel they have the best Fettuccini. Best place for Cappuccino is on Via Cavor on the right side of the street a Tabachi on a triangle corner on the way to the Coliseum.

The hotel looked cute and the staff were friendly which made it a relief to finally arrive. I had requested a corner room that was mentioned specifically in a previous review and when I opened the door to find a sweet but standard room I was getting that sinking feeling that this holiday was not going to be as I hoped. However, the staff (who turned out to be so helpful and friendly) turned that all around. They had left a chilled bottle of sparkling wine in our room with a card wishing us Happy Anniversary! We were thrilled, cracked the bottle open, forgot about the taxi ride and that set the tone for the whole rest of the holiday. The breakfast was just right, the location a perfect stroll to the colloseum, the room clean and smart with an indulgent bathroom. There is a fantasic restaurant within 100m. Up on the main road there is a traditional italian restaurant with piano player and hundreds of candles in the windows, reasonably priced.

It is true that you can walk to a few sites, but generally speaking it is not as central as staying in the historic centre. However, taxis are not expensive (well our party was four, so it worked out cheaper than buses sometimes and we had heavy rain for 2 days) so if you get tired of walking, this is a good alternative. There are a few nice local restaurants on Via Cavour which are well priced for Rome and excellent food. The price was good, the service was good and if I needed to I would stay again if I could not get a central hotel. I was not keen on the breakfast.
