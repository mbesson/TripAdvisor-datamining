The hotel is pretty much what you want from a Courtyard but it is in a building that used to be an old military hospital which means the room layouts (at least mine) are not optimal for a hotel. I am in a wheelchair and although I did not specify an accessible room, I have never before had issues with accessibility in the walking space around the bed but this time I could not move around the room at all. Luckily, I could get next to my bed since it was right beside the door. Since I was traveling with my father for just an overnight stay, it wasn't worth switching rooms. I had reserved a 2 bedroom suite and was a bit surprised by the layout. The 1st \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bedroom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn't have a door and is basically just an adjacent area to the sitting area. The 2nd room has a door (due to be old building, the doors were just wide enough for my chair but not by much) but is very long and narrow with 2 large comfortable beds. The ceilings are incredibly high and the windows are higher than normal which meant I could just barely see out of them, but couldn't look down. The bathroom was very small compared to other Courtyards I have stayed in. Admittedly, an able-bodied person shouldn't have my issues and would probably give the hotel a 4 out of 5. Other than the room, the staff were courteous and helpful. Check-in and check out went smoothly. We arrived late at night and the restaurant was closing but they let us in and served us. The club sandwich was good. The hotel's furnishing look almost brand-new, well-kept and pretty clean everywhere. The floor was a very nice tile. The Marriott bedding has always been one of my favorites and we slept very well in the comfortable beds. The lobby has a David's Cookies, business center, lounge area with television, and Wi-Fi. The casino is open 24/7 and had live music at the bar. We didn't play but just walked through to check it out. The location isn't the best for tourists but then again if you are staying here, it's probably for business, or some other reason other than leisure so it shouldn't affect you much. I would probably recommend the hotel to someone if they were looking for a place to stay in the specific town.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cFun time\u201d", "Author": "Newporter2551", "ReviewID": "UR123332718", "Content": "Did not need or want a room there .\"..but the music and band and dancing and casino....were a BLAST....

The propert is easy to find and if you have ever been on a military base you get that feeling when you drive up to the hotel. Parking is free and check in was a breeze.

In general this is an excellent hotel for a short stay in the west area of Puerto Rico.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cWonderful pool for kids, splish splash...\u201d", "Author": "VACATIONMERMAID", "ReviewID": "UR62005028", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel last year for the month of July with my grandaughters and they had a blast they did not want to get out of the pool. the small waterpark in the pool was the magic of the trip.

It wasn't too hard to get from San Juan to Aguadilla, but once in Aguadilla, it was a little tough to find the hotel due to road construction and some closures, but we managed to make it unscathed. When we checked in the front desk clerk agreed to give us late check-out, however failed to do anything with that information as our keys were deactivated an hour earlier than we had requested to leave and we even got a call from the front desk asking if we were extending our stay. Anyhow, we didn't want to eat dinner in the hotel restaurant, so we attempted to venture out. There was a rundown shopping center with a pizzeria, deli, and Chinese take-out around the corner, so we opted for the pizza. There was nothing else to do in the area, so we went back to the hotel, went to the bar and went to sleep.

We arrived late, after 12 midnight and immediately asked if they had received our request for foam pillows instead of the feather (allergy issues). They advised us to check the room and call front desk if the pillows were not there. We arrived at our room #306 in the main building. No foam pillows. Called the front desk , they said \"we'll get in touch with housekeeping\". Well, we are still waiting for the pillows. The room was modern and very clean and overlooking the pool. Flat screen TV but no wireless internet. Have to be wired in the rooms. It is free though so that was a plus. A few pet peeves that I agree with other reviewers is the fact that they only give you 2 bath towels and a couple of smaller towels. Also, there are no mirrors in the room except for the two in the bathroom. Therefore, you have to wait for the other person to finish if you want to put on make up or comb your hair. Very annoying. One more thing, no coffee maker! They have a coffee bar in the lobby that is overpriced and you are forced to buy coffee from them because there is no other place nearby to get coffee. The cappuccino is actually good but not worth the money. It was low season so the hotel was not full. Good for us because we heard it is a nightmare in the summer. The casino is empty during the day but gets more traffic at night. Live music from Wed. to Sunday. You have to pay for parking ($8 per night). If you play at the casino you can get you ticket validated for free parking if you're just visiting. The pool is clean and was empty most of the time we were there except for Monday when we were awaken by loud Reggaeton music. At first we thought the staff was testing the equipment because why would anyone have music playing that loud at 9:00 a.m. in the morning!!! But, we were wrong. There was actually about 100 teenage girls in the pool area! Apparently, they had rented the pool for the day and paid for a DJ to liven up the place. We left the hotel that morning and came back around 3 p.m. Thankfully all was quiet by then and we were able to enjoy the pool again. We have to say that given what is available in the area in terms of hotels, this is probably your best bet but it's definitely overpriced.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and nice.

We come to the area fairly regularly and this was our first stay at this property and will mostly likely be our usual place as long as they stay as good as they are now. Maintenance in the public areas is great, but I'm worried Housekeeping might not keep the rooms up to make them last. FYI, I am a picky traveler. I need clean and I need functional and I need friendly staff. This came through pretty well. The property is very nice and modern. If you have kids, the pool is awesome and fun. Not sure I could handle being out there myself with the screaming that comes from the fun though. Property has a small, but nice casino too which I didn't know. We didn't go in, but will on our next more pleasurable visit. The lounge was empty when we were there each night, but I didn't mind. Music was great in the background. Staff was great AND entertaining! Food was very good and priced as you'd expect a hotel lounge to be. They had a nice variety of local food and trusted stand by's (burger, pizza) for us less adventuous eaters. Room was very comfortable and a good size. My few problems with the room were: Only 2 sets of towels. We would ask for more, but had to do that each day as they never replaced just what housekeeping took, they only left 2 sets again. Towels were very thin too, so don't know how long they will last. Also, housekeeping was not the best in the bathroom. The bathroom had a large floor area, but not sink area. There was one sink (a very nice sink too) with essentially no counter, though there were two small wall shelves we used for our stuff and kept the toilet lid down so nothing fell in. The mirrow over the sink is only big enough for one person at a time. The only other mirror in the room is a full-length inside the bathroom door. This made it very hard for two people to get ready at the same time and being we were on a schedule each day, this was a problem. I don't care to put my makeup on in a steamy bathroom when my hubby is shaving. Despite these things, we loved the place. Will just bring a small makeup mirror next time with me and that should do the trick. (We are booked to go back next month already!) Certainly, this is the best hotel in Aguadilla. Having a shuttle to the airport is great too! Not sure why they have to charge guests for parking. I think they should leave that for the non-guest casino-goers.
