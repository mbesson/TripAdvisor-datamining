Wifi never fixed. Rude staff. Highway motel\u201d", "Author": "bobbiee26", "ReviewID": "UR126579643", "Content": "Absolutely terrible location, miles away in the middle of nowhere. Access to the hotel was by taking the metro line B all the way to the end to Rebibbia (about 15 mins from Roma Termini), THEN a local bus for another 15 minutes. With good timing a trip from the city centre was often about 40-45 minutes. The worst part is that the buses stop at about 11.30pm and after than you could only get a taxi - walking would be too far. This is not a hotel for young travelers. Most of the other people in the hotel appeared to be part of big tour groups which came with their own private coach, which meant they weren't affected by the hotel's remote location, or they were here on business. To make things worse, the service of this \"4-star\" hotel was shocking. - On their website that a \"shuttle bus service is at your disposal\" - in actual fact there are only 2 shuttle services, one at 8.30am and one at 7.30pm to and from the hotel to Rebibbia station. - Their free wifi worked for 2 out of our 4 days there, and when we asked them about it they just said that it was broken and they were \"trying\" to fix it (but it was never fixed) - They don't have an iron in the hotel to lend out, only a \"laundry service\" but that wasn't open anyway. My friends had to run to a nearby laundromat to get their ironing done All in all, I found the experience very underwhelming and infuriating at times. The staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. The only reason we ended up staying here is because our travel agent booked it for us in a rush at the last minute - if we had known about its location we would not have agreed to stay here.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Imola, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNice accommodation near the GRA highway\u201d", "Author": "LukeOnTheRoad", "ReviewID": "UR122988835", "Content": "The building is not brand new, yet well kept, clean.

Having stayed a purely a leisure traveller to Rome, it was a real pleasure. Very luxurious. We had our own transportation, so getting to Rome was 20 mins and parking centrally in Rome is only 1 Euro per hour. The hotel has its own free car park and free WiFi. Nice not to have to pay supplements for these services. Very friendly staff, nice continental breakfast and very clean. Even coming back to the hotel at midnight, the manager happily opened the bar for the delegated driver to have a nightcap ! Whilst close to Motorways (for great access) the rooms where silent inside, so a very good nights rest to all. Will go back if we can get the same great rates again !", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel degli Imperatori", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d642964-Reviews-Hotel_degli_Imperatori-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$83 - $177*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Guido Gonella 15</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00156</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "642964", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/62/21/6221b24f0f9f76de91623567ea2978607large.jpg"}}
