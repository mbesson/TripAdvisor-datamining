{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Terrific Hotel....the best service! Our stay at this hotel was one of the best experiences that we had on our first trip to Italy. To say that the staff were helpful and friendly would be and understatement. They made us feel like family and we really hated to leave them. Our room was comfortable, clean and quiet but nothing could compare to the service and the friendliness of the staff. They catered to our every need and they did so with sincerity and a smile each time that we turned to them for help. The breakfast that was included in our stay was wonderful and the staff greeted us each morning with a smile and friendly conversation. Our trip to Italy included a stay in Rome, Florence and Venice and unfortunately the hotels that we stayed in our other two locations did not compare to the Atlantic Palace. The staff at the Atlantic hotel made our trip to Florence like a trip home to visit family...our sincere thanks to Annika, Vincenzo, Maurizio, Giusy, MIchaela, and Giancarlo. We look forward to seeing all of them again in the near future. Thank you all for making our first visit to Firenza so wonderful.

From the moment we walked in the door we were made extremely welcome, we had abandoned our car about 1/2 mile away and they arranged for their valet parking to collect it for us and park it and when ever we wanted to use it, it was brought back to the hotel for us. The reception staff were very helpful in providing us with maps and local information on where the best places to eat were.The rooms were lovely and spotlessly clean and stayed that way all the time we were there, daily maid service saw to that. The room was spacious and well furnished.Its location is ideal for all the sights of central Florence and although located on a busy street, once you enter the door you are cocooned away from the trafiic and noise. The public areas are beautiful and again well furnished, bright and airey.Breakfast every morning was fantastic, it catered for all tastes having a full range of cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurt, bacon, scrambled egg, local bread, preserves, meat, cheeses etc etc. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone who was thinking of staying in Florence.10 out of 10Thanks to all the staff for a lovely stay!!!", "Date": "Jul 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR639769358", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "govnher"}, {"Content": "Pretty terrible I am amazed this hotel qualifies as a four star. It is more like a 2/3 star. On the plus side, it was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The downsides were:No bar, no restaurant and a truly terrible buffet breakfast. There is no-one making coffee or tea, so the only option is the machine coffee, which tasted like marmite.Total disparity in the rooms. Five of us stayed, I was in a pokey corridor with two single beds up against the wall. Others had better rooms but terrible bathrooms.Heating/air con was inexplicable. Sometimes it would be freezing, other times boiling hot. I lost track of the number of guests I heard complaining about this over the poor breakfast.Location wise it is fine, but then Florence is so small, any hotel is well located.

We stayed in this hotel at the end of March. We took our infant with us. There was a baby bed in the room when we checked in. The service was excellent. They were happy to bring us extra towels, etc.. We even bought milk for the baby at the hotel bar, and kept it in the fridge in our room. The room was a nice size. The floor could've been cleaner, but it wasn't too bad. The bathroom looked a little outdated, but it was extremely clean (And I am a clean freak!). The room had an ambience with the antique furnishings. The breakfast were excellent. There was a lot of choice, and the coffees were great too! The location could not have been better. We managed to get the baby, the pram, and three suitcases from the train station to the hotel no problem. The staff were very friendly. And there is an EXCELLENT restaurant close by the hotel. It is called Ciro and Sons. We ate there everyday of our stay, if not for lunch then for dinner. It's a lovely place, not the sort that you normally take children, but the owners went out of there way to entertain our toddler. They even brought out a little Micky Mouse cup and bowl for her to use. I would reccomend the hotel and the restaurant to anyone.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR802704507", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BelleCopelan"}, {"Content": "Great location, decent hotel We booked a triple here for our Florence trip 3/2006. The hotel is in possibly the best location there is: literally 1+ blocks from the Santa Maria Novella train station (though it is in hotel row, with dozens of other hotels similarly located in the area), and a quick easy walk to the San Lorenzo marketplace and Duomo. The lobby is spacious, clean, and quite beautiful, but the room was a bit more disappointing. Our triple consisted of a king bed + a poorly placed twin bed right bedside the door/bathroom (it looks like they squeezed in the twin bed at the last minute type of thing). Also our toilet wouldn't stop flushing after a use, thus had to call the porter to come fix it. Breakfast downstairs in the morning was great, with hot options as well.
