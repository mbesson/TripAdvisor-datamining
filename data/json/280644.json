We must've checked in at the same time when there was a sport event going on. Children all over the place which at times was quite noisy. Sometimes the adults were noisier than the children. Sounded like King Kong from the wax museum was a guest there too. It seemed to have quieted down a bit after they left. HOT BREAKFAST!!! This was a big plus. May I suggest adding some bacon? Housekeeping didn't do a good job in cleaning my room. My daughter dropped some food on the floor and it's still there after two days. Please, if you want customers to be happy, please be attentive. Seeing dirty rooms or half cleaned rooms only add to the stigma that hotels are breeding grounds of various forms of bacteria. Overall, I was happy with my stay here. The staff was pleasant, room was okay for what I paid (very affordable may I add), breakfast was great, and all the sites that my family wanted to see was just minutes away.

As usual we called and made reservations several weeks before hand and was quoted the price of $59.99/night. Upon arrival, they told us that we were not quoted that price and that it hadn't been that rate since this season had began. The woman (I forgot to get her name of course) at the front counter had such a terrible attitude, I told DH let's just go to another hotel, but knowing that it was a busy holiday, he said no since he didn't feel like dealing with it. DH told the woman at the front that we have stayed there numerous times, and never once have had any problems, so she looked us up in the \"system\" and couldn't find where we've stayed even once... which was so ridiculous, because we've stayed there I know at least 10 times before. We paid the difference and got checked into our room. The room was nice, as always is and has been before. There is a fridge in every room, which we have found to be very convenient. The rooms have been always clean, and they have elevators which make it easily accessible regardless of what floor you stay on. The breakfast was great, as always, as well as the cobbler/ice cream and cookies served in the evenings. (There was a man working one night, and he was soooo great! He kept everything up, and even when another patron was not being the nicest because the cobbler's were getting low (they had 5 minutes until they stopped serving) he said he would go get another one for her!) The day of check out however (they offer a 1:00pm checkout), our keys stopped working before time to check out. (DH went to go get ice, and tried to come back in, and couldn't..on either card) So we had to prop the door open to be able to go get the rest of things needed and to load our car/etc. I was told it had to do something with magnetization and wasn't controlled by the front office. I was still very upset from our check in experience, and felt it should be shared (because the woman's attitude was just rank, and that bothered me more than the $30 extra dollars we were being charged) and so I was going to fill out the comment card that was left in the hotel room, but there was no pen. So I brought it back home with me, filled it out and mailed it in. I was called very quickly by a woman named Desiree (sp?) and she was very helpful and courteous. She apologized for the woman's attitude and for the misquoted price, twice actually, which I was very appreciative of. She comped us one night stay, which I told her I greatly appreciated.

Some meat would have been nice. The place next door was advertising $4.99 buffet breakfasts. Cost was $55 each night. A lot of places on the strip were advertising high 30s/low 40s. So, the value might not have been ideal. But, if you eat breakfast there, it isn't too bad. Walked to the Rankin Brothers show one evening.

We had salads, sandwiches, soda and bottled water to save on our eating expense. Then when we included the superb breakfast provided each morning it was a very economical weekend.

Compared to these old motels or inns as many are called, Branson's Best is awesome. Compared to Cheatau on the Lake or one of the better hotels though, it doesn't compare but it is a lot less expensive too. Let's start with the good things first. We were moved from Whispering Hills property which we agreed to. We did not have to change and the staff was very nice about it. For moving, we were placed in one of the suites which has a refrigerator, a microwave and extends the length of the room the size of a love seat which it includes. So I have to thank the staff for putting us in a suite. The bed was a king and they are of average comfort. I can sleep on just about anything though so it was fine. The size of the room was above average. The TV is at least a 27 inch so it was sufficient too. Not a great TV as the speakers would distort or the metal casing was rattling, not sure which one it was but the sound would have to be pretty high for this to happen. I didn't notice any sound coming from any other rooms but we were at the very end. The only sound I would hear is when somebody was rolling their suitcases to their room. That would make quite a bit of noise but it didn't happen frequently. We were upstairs too so this may have helped with not having too much noise. Branson's Best offers a breakfast adjacent to their office and I thought it was excellent. They offer make your own waffles, scrambled eggs, bageles, breads, fruit, 3 cereals, biscuits, gravy, grits, orange juice, apple juice, I know I am leaving some things off the list. It's not everything under the sun but there is more than enough to choose from. It is served from 7:00 am to 10:00 am. From 9:00 pm to 11:00 pm, blackberry and peach cobbler is served along with cookies and ice cream. It's very good. The location of the hotel is pretty good. It's located on the yellow route just off Gretna Road. Nearby is Legends and the Titantic exhibit. Now let's go over the things that could be improved. It took quite a while to get the air conditioning to where it was comfortable. Either we would be hot or would be freezing. After two days, we found the right setting. Not a big deal. The air conditioning was leaking into the wall so the sheetrock was very soft around it plus there was brown streaks leading from the wall to the tile located at the front door. The bathroom doesn't have a fan to remove the steam so it gets pretty steamy in there. There is a sign stating the bathroom is continuously ventilated and maybe it is. There is a vent located in the bathroom but I sure couldn't hear anything in there such as a fan. It would be nice if there was a real fan that removed steam immediately but again, only a minor problem. I was hoping to see a restaurant by the hotel and there was one called Choppers if I remember correctly. However, it was closed every time we tried to eat there which was Thursday night at 9:00 pm and Friday around 8:30 pm. There is a restaurant fairly close but not in walking distance called Uptown Cafe. Do not eat there unless you like knats flying around your food. There are a lot of motels or inns in Branson that charge around $35.00 a night. They look something out of the Bates Hotel. The price per night at Branson's Best is around $50.00 to $60.00 a night. It looks much better than these other places. Then there is Cheatau on the Lake that offer some really nice rooms and amenities. However, you will pay a lot more than $60.00 a night.

We, as people, often take what others may say as the truth instead of realizing there are always 3 sides to every story, your story, my story, and the real story, before making our decisions as to how to judge the situation. Have you ever ate at a restaurant and the food was great? You go back again and it was not as good as before? Maybe a different chef was working that day. If it's real bad, you contact the Manager. If the Manager doesn't seem to help, you try to contact the owner/s. Did you try to contact upper management and/or the owners? Finally, my wife and I have always had a wonderful experience with this motel. Very friendly staff, great breakfast (we have stayed at many hotels in our travels and have never found one to have scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles and all the other items for FREE on any continental breakfast!), and we have met the owners who are the kindest, caring people who's main interest is satisfying their guests. We have been repeat guests of theirs for over 9 years, not because of the price, but because of the service, the breakfast and the CARE. It's unfortunate you did not have a pleasant stay, but they have repeat guests year after year and that means something.

As usual, we consulted Tripadvisor for recommendations before we booked our hotel. Imagine our delight when we came across the listing and reviews for Branson's Best. From all reviews, pictures and descriptions the motel sounded almost too good to be true. The rooms were pictured as nice sized and clean and the amenities listed were aplenty, especially for the price. We didn't hesitate but booked a two night stay at once, confident we'd chosen well. Unfortunately, that's where the happy part of this story ends and the sad part begins. Before we mention everything else we should say this: the room we had was clean, not as big as some but big enough, reasonably comfortable and air conditioned. The property itself was as pictured; clean looking, well-kept, not overly out of date. That said: We knew right from the moment we stepped into the lobby there was something not quite right. Instead of the warm welcome feeling one should get when entering a home away from home we were met with a blank stare- a glare of indifference. The way we were treated was no better: not hostile or rude, per se, just an air of mechanism. While the motel's website claims this motel is family owned it was remarkable how little the clerk (later identified as the manager) knew about her own property. We were not provided any details about the facility such as if and when breakfast was provided, notified about the advertised evening reception nor given it's time, provided any mention of the property's pool or vending services nor check out time. We were, however, forcefuilly issued the motel's time for check-in as we had apparently arrived somewhat early. When we inquired about the pool closing time the clerk said she didn't know for sure. The advertised \"25 item breakfast\" is probably just that if you included the butter, syrup and juices, coffee and water and perhaps the paper plate and cup. Sorry about that, don't mean to sound sarcastic but this was by far the most pathetic \"breakfast\" we've come across at a motel in many years. After we ate what little they offered we went down the street to IHOP and had a real meal (and we don't eat that much for breakfast.) There was no one on duty to assist us in the office when we went to ask about getting some aspirin late at night so so much for their 24-hour staffing claim, too. Also, the room's iron spewed out rust onto my favorite short sleeved shirt for which I am truly not too thankful for. Fortunately I was able to get the stains out before they set. Additionally, if your room is anywhere near the office area beware: you will hear lots of noise at any time there is people checking in, checking out or eating breakfast or late evening snack. If you're a late sleeper- say any time after 6:30am- you can forget it. We could go on but you get the point. The problem with this motel is mostly not the motel itself- it's the people. If the motel's owner's would simply staff the motel with people that made you feel welcome when you arrived, thankful you're there when they interacted with you, and actually knew what they were doing, this would indeed be a nice place to stay (sans the rooms next to the office and the breakfast, of course.) By the way, we couldn't wait to get out of there so we left bright and early the very first morning after we arrived even though we didn't even know if another hotel would have a room for us or not for the remainder of our stay in Branson.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to put your feet up\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5211765", "Content": "This is a great place to stay.
