We decided to stay only one night. The hotel tried to charge us for the remainder of the stay, but we refused. Hopefully, this says enough.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Onella", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d515021-Reviews-Hotel_Onella-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$58 - $187*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Principe Amedeo 47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "515021", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7c/c7/7cc796d42dc21e515924768ac6856e991large.jpg"}}
