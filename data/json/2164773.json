I booked through their website and booked a winter warmer deal which was extremely good value for money. My room (119) called a Club room i think may have been suitable for disabled guests as it was very spacious and had disabled bathroom facilities. Upon entering i was greeted by the door staff and the staff at reception were very polite. Check in was easy i was then shown to my room by a porter who showed me the rooms amenities. The room itself was fantastic. Very large room with a decent size and very comfortable bed. The room has everything you might need, ironing board, hairdryer, wifi, safe etc. Bathroom was great with an incredible rain shower and looked very modern. Location wise it's good. Not in the tourist centre but Barbican tube and moorgate tube are 5 mins walk away which can get you to wherever you need in London in minutes. Theres a number of good bars and Restaurants nearby too head onto City road where moor gate station is. There's a Gaucho's near liverpool st station which is fantastic. Only 2 minor complaints about this hotel: - It needs double glazing. The traffic noise wasn't too bad, it definitely didn't hinder sleep at all. It picked up slightly around 8.30am (fri morning rush hour) and when the odd large truck drove by it would rattle the single glazed window a little. This wasn't too extreme but could do with attention in the future - Fruit! Theres loads of free fruit in the room however when my girlfriend bit into the apple it was rotten at the core. Overall a fantastic hotel and i would recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fribourg, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice place at a good location - but service really needs to be improved\u201d", "Author": "CarosassoneCH", "ReviewID": "UR125862453", "Content": "I always look for new addresses in the City of London as I have to go there very often and did not yet find the \"perfect\" hotel in this area - for this reason, I also tried the London City Suites. The location is very good, and the building - an old brewery - is funny and very \"labyrinthine\". The rooms are OK, even though they have infamously soft mattresses where you may disappear during the night. I don't know how many guests got lost there since they opened the hotel ;-). The Montcalm tries to be a very fashionable, high-class hotel - nevertheless, there are significant flaws in the service quality: my first impression of the reception was checking in at an Aeroflot counter before the fall of the iron wall, my impression of the breakfast service was of the same kind - and they forgot to remove a dirty room service platter close to my room for more than 24 hours - I saw it at least 10 times ... Fortunately, I had a very good time in London, therefore, I had a quite mild view on these flaws ... Nevertheless, I'd recommend to the hotel manager to change the mattresses (and to put ONE mattress in a king size bed, not two with a Grand Canyon in between), and to really improve the effectiveness, effectivity, commitment and friendliness of the staff. This would change everything. PS: a very positive fact: 4 hours after check-out, I noticed that I forgot my valuables in the safe. I recovered everything - including a detailed inventory of what' I've left there - that was remarkable!", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTop notch hotel at a reasonable price for the City\u201d", "Author": "klear", "ReviewID": "UR125698143", "Content": "The double room was very roomy for London, and the prices were reasonable for London (roughly 200$ a night) and for a four-star hotel.

I was very happy with the room itself, well stocked with complimentary fruit and water, usual toiletries, robes blah blah. It was clean and the temperature could be adjusted. The bed was big and comfy and the rain shower was lovely. The location was perfect for me as I needed to head out to the Southbank, East London and the Angel, we could reach everything by short walk/tube/bus. I think this is ideal for business, friends and families.

When I arrived I was upgraded to a club room and was very glad I wasn't at the tired Thistle, the quality difference is substantial. The reception is through the main entrance arch to the converted brewery complex on the left. Staff were polite and friendly. As it is a converted brewery and an old building the lay out is unusual. I was shown to my room which was up one lift, a walk and then up another lift to the 3rd floor. Room was very nice, complimentary fruit bowl, water. A large bed which I found to be very comfortable and the usual facilities but all high end quality. I was in London for work and had planned a few beers after work. This got out of hand hence why I booked somewhere to stay at short notice. Despite the luxury of the room I woke up at 6am, face down on the hotel room floor fully clothed. So now the hotel was to face its hangover test, fortunately no tigers in the bathroom. After a couple of hours more sleep I set about trying to feel human enough to face a 3 hour meeting. The bathroom was modern and clean, the shower was a delight and I spent 20 minutes under it. I used the iphone dock to play my music. The room had free broadband so I prepped for my meeting. The fruit and water (and biscuits) were enough to get my body moving. The room had an iron and an ironing board so the only thing left crumpled from the night before was my face. When I checked out I felt human. I'd stay again if I could get the room at that sort of price, was tempted to book a second night as the room would have been a great place to recover from my hang over.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Country", "Title": "\u201cReally nice\u201d", "Author": "Laurista", "ReviewID": "UR121837318", "Content": "My partner stayed here for his Xmas work do, he said \"Well the guys were very helpful and the room was lovely.

Here a recap of the email i send to the hotel on 30 August. This has yet to be addressed by hotel management. We were very happy with the room and the amenities offered! Unfortunately our happiness was soon spoiled by the unprofessionalism of the staff. Let me give you some examples: Before arrival I called your hotel to order sparkling wine, which should be in the room upon arrival. My call was transferred 4 times before someone could take my order. That person, however, was extremely friendly and quickly took care of it. Furthermore she offered complimentary chocolate when she realized it was our anniversary. Following the call I thought that I was probably just unlucky that my call got transferred 4 times and thought no more of it. During our stay we asked some advice in the small reception of London City Suites, but quickly realized that the staff there had absolutely no knowledge about anything. An example is the evening of our arrival. We asked the person in the reception if there was a nice quiet restaurant in the area which he could recommend, he replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just turn left and there is plenty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The only restaurant we found was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All Bar One\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which was packed with semi-drunk business people celebrating Friday night. Certainly not a nice and quiet restaurant! On Sunday, the last evening, we decided for some Indian food and asked at the concierge/guest service desk for advice. Egis/Egil was very helpful and suggested Restaurant Mahek on London Wall. We told him that we were not sure which time we would go, so no need for him to make reservation. In the evening we walked there only to find it closed on Sundays. As you can imagine we were extremely disappointed and could not believe that a concierge would not know this. We went back to the concierge and spoke to Vlad. My wife informed him about the problem and asked him if he could recommend another nice Indian place with good atmosphere. He tried to help the best he could. However, as he said himself after more than 10 minutes of searching, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I personally do not like Indian food, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really give any advice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What is the point of asking advice from the concierge if they have no knowledge? Ultimately Vlad gave up and asked Masing (?) for help. Unfortunately he failed to provide all the information to Masing and consequently he sent us to Masala Zone in Covent Garden. The place looked like a canteen and had no atmosphere at all. The food was good however. When we were at the restaurant your staff did the turn down service in the room. In the morning after my shower I realized that housekeeping took away the used bath towels and exchanged them with small towels. There I am, at 5.45 in the morning, wet from my shower with a small towel. When I go to settle our bill and check out. I told you staff that we took one lemonade from the minibar. He insists that more drinks were taken as this has been reported by housekeeping. I have to tell him several times that we only took one lemonade and we took it the first night. It appeared that he had some difficulties understanding my English. Furthermore he did not have enough change in reception to accept a \u00c2\u00a310 note in order to pay the \u00c2\u00a33.50 bill. Ultimately someone paid me back with what appeared to be his personal cash. After returning home I realize now that I have been double billed for the sparkling wine I ordered for the room. The overcharged amount have not been returned by the hotel. Overall the room was very nice, customer service non-existent and they do nothing to correct it.

The rooms were small and with a cot in them there was very little space to maneuver. We left a couple of things in the rooms - our own fault I know but despite several attempts to contact the hotel to retrieve I am still waiting for a response 2 weeks later.
