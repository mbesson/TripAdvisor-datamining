Our room for a couple plus one child was to the side of the hotel and faced Hotel Gotic. Room was very spacious, probably used to be an apartment, good-sized bathroom, small lounge leading to 1st bedroom then second bedroom was curtained off from this. Lots of storage space, only English TV channel was news, hotel staff pleasant and helpful. Down sides were noise at night and unpleasant smell coming from sink when it was used - however this may be a general problem in Barcelona as we found the same smell when we ate at an outside restaurant in the Ramblas (!) - and you could safely leave the windows open.

The beds were really comfy and we had a balcony that looked onto a busy street. I would say if you have children this is not the hotel for you as its very noisy at night .

We paid the cheapest price that we could find (75 euro) and didn't request it or anything. Cons: - Requested a double bed, the best they could do was push two single beds together. - Hot water in shower went from normal to scorching hot... every 6 seconds or so. It was like clockwork. - Heater in room did not work. - Staff was borderline rude. I have never been to a hotel where every single employee I talked to made me feel like they hated being there and didn't want me to be there either. The quality of the room was vastly better than a hostel, but overall the experience was incredibly disappointing compared to other hotels. I would only recommend this to someone who is deciding between this or a hostel. I have stayed in some hostels in Barcelona, and this was a little bit better, for a comparable price if you have 2 or 3 people. To get to the hotel from the airport, I followed a previous Tripadvisor's post, it was very easy: Take the Blue city bus from the airport to the Placa Catalunya. It cost around 3.50 euro per person. The Placa Catalunya is the first stop on the bus, and the driver didn't call it out or anything, so be ready to get off. Take the Metro to the Jaume I stop, it is on the yellow L4 line. It is literally right outside the metro stop.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, UK", "Title": "\u201cAn OK hotel at an very good price\u201d", "Author": "Woozle00", "ReviewID": "UR11928540", "Content": "We won some free flights to Barcelona, but had to go just before Christmas and book at somewhere cheapish at short notice.

It got all you expect from 3-stars hotel. Clean room and bathroom, but air-conditioner in the room wasn't working. We were offered another room ( but only for 2 last nights since the hotel was full ). You have to close the windows at night because of noise. There is metro station 20meter from the entrance to hotel and a few coffee shops. Generally it's placed close to big street so you got all kinds of noise that can be tolerated ( and one can get a fair sleep ) only when room's windows are closed. Breakfast ( given in hotel 40m from SUIZO ) is very good. especially choice of hams. I found no parking ( but wasn't looking very close because we rented car only after check-out ), but if you need taxi - hotel staff menage it very fast and the car can get right to the entrance - it's handy when you have a heavy luggage. Do not forget that you stay in Suizo in order to explore the wonderfully pretty Barcelona and when you came back to hotel - they have all you need - clean bed and breakfast next morning. The hotel is in a very good location for exploring the city - metro station is next to entrance and RAMBLA, Port and other things are in 500 or so meters from there. We went to see a local dance show in Music House ( nice red house around 250 meters from there ) but didn't like it - it was \"tourist show\" and 60euro for 2 people wasn't worth it. The staff was Ok and always ready to help.

Our room was at the front of the hotel, more or less central, two floors up, great for people watching! The only downside was that due to the single glazing the noise outside was very noticeable and it took me a couple of nights before I got a full nights sleep, but you get what you pay for and we didn't pay a lot (don't take that the wrong way, the hotel is great!) The staff were very helpful and friendly, especially taking into account our very poor Spanish, their English was much better! Next door to the hotel is a pastry shop selling all sorts of delicious pastries and other bits'n' bobs, just the place if you like a sweet breakfast!
