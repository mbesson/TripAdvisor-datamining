It was quite small but since it was just the two of us, it worked out perfectly. It also wasn't too pricey but it was off-season, so I'm sure it would have been twice as much during the summer months. We got a room on the 3rd floor in the main building and the view was spectacular. We were able to park for free in the hotel parking lot (a definite plus in PB) and walk to wherever we wanted.

With that being said, I wanted to report that as a single older woman traveler, you may want to rethink some things. My room faced the ocean, and was uncomfortably hot with no breeze. No A/C, I had a fan only. There were people behind me (second floor), so no cross ventilation was possible, hence a hot box of a room. Bottom line: Unless they have a better room, don't bother booking this cell, and it's no way appropriate for two people!! The front desk was sullen but efficient. Not a friendly place, and unless you bring your friends along, you'll likely not speak to anyone for days on end. But, again, this may be what you are after.

It was fairly clean and kitchen was reasonably okay but looked a bit like a student flat. The balcony and stairways were a bit scruffy and dusty and cigarette butts on the floor and we had an ashtray full on our plastic table by the door. Had the location of Mission Beach been fabulous we would probably have stuck it out but checked out after one night. Def not worth $200 per night considering what we got for our money for the rest of holiday. Mission Bay is for youngsters and is loud and scruffy. Having said that this hotel is clearly very popular with seniors and families because many were booking for next year so maybe it is not as bad as we think but we were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When checking out they asked if we wanted to pre book for next year and appeared shocked when we said no so it seems quite a lot of people must say yes.

The view from the windows and patio are was fantastic especially at sunset.

The Mission for breakfast) or a ten minute drive away (ex Hash-a-Go-Go for great breakfasts). Our cottage was simple, clean, and airy.
