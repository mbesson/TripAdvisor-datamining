The hotel itself is a little away from the metro station but not a too long walk - maybe 15 mins. The hotel is a best western so you can expect cleanness and other basic facilities, there is also a nice little restaurant within the hotel - but its not owned by the hotel. There was all the basic stuff i wanted - TV, en suite and bed was comfortable. The staff were helpful. I would recommend this hotel, but for some people a more centrally located hotel would be better.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto, on", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, will come back again when revisiting Berlin\u201d", "Author": "m9ma", "ReviewID": "UR107871693", "Content": "Did not expect the hotel to be conveniently located to bus#171 that runs from Berlin Airport (Schonefeld).

The location was extremely far and inconvenient from central Berlin, two trams and bus to get to (took an hour), and the bus is constantly late and doesnt run past 12am. The room smelled musty and the chairs were stained. Breakfast was expensive and mediocre at best, cold eggs and bacon. Had the pasta dinner, had to send it back as it was undercooked (crunchy even), and they still left the item on the bill, and offered a shot of Ammerreto as a consellation, I declined and asked that the item be removed from the bill and they obliged (althoug I shold not have had to ask). Overall dissapointed and would not stay again nor recommend.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ogre", "Title": "\u201cGood choice for budget travelers\u201d", "Author": "Eisaksrx", "ReviewID": "UR88160518", "Content": "We choosed this hotel because I take part in different loyalty programmes, and this was compreratively cheap option with possibility to get Best western rewards points as well as SAS Eurobonus points (checked out 21/11/2010 and points registered already 24/11/2010!). But it was a positive surprice that it was also easy accessible by bus Nr 171 directly from Schonefeld airport (bus station Zadekstrasse).
