However, Bloomsbury is full of tiny, private, cheap hotels in a similar price range to the Montana Excel, and having stayed in a few of them, there are some things which let the Montana down. Positives are free wifi and a very reasonable price. Some travellers complain about the size of the rooms. They are small (I mean, swing-a-cat small) but sorry, people, this is London. Big rooms come at a price, so then pay a bit more (twice as much, in fact) and go to the Premier Inn in Kings X. This is the third small hotel I have used in Bloomsbury / Kings X in the same price range, and I can say that the room sizes are pretty well all the same. Ground floor street rooms can be noisy - you have been warned...! Where the Montana does fall down compared to its peers are things like plastic coffee cups instead of china, fuzzy TV with only analogue channels (digital TV is free in the UK, so I really don't understand this). And no guest should have to stand queueing on the stairs for breakfast! If there are not enough seats then either expand breakfast hours so some people can eat later, or add a couple of tables (which could be tricky). Oh, and hire an extra pair of hands and stop overworking the great staff down there. It is unacceptable. Talking of breakfast, its a cooked breakfast, which is what some people want, but vegetarians or non-pork eaters may find the alternatives limited. There is no cereal, only toast. Its a good option for a quick, cheap overnight but if I was staying in London for longer I would probably choose one of the other Bloomsbury options .. or, like I said, pay a bit more!", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "memphis, ny", "Title": "\u201cClean and near Kings Cross station\u201d", "Author": "pookle1", "ReviewID": "UR122108427", "Content": "Solo traveler, so I was interested in finding a place to sleep just for one night near the train station that was safe, clean and provided breakfast and free wifi.

We were given a ground floor room right next to the reception area, and apparently underneath the stairs to the upper floors. The walls must be made of paper because we could hear the receptionist talking like she was in the room. She and another member of staff were talking, or rather shouting, until about 1 or 2am. Everytime someone walked past, or up the stairs, there was a loud creaking noise. I normally sleep quite deeply, but this woke me up every single time. The room itself had no window, so there was no natural daylight. The real problem however was that it got boiling hot during the night, which made sleeping even more difficult, if that was possible. The only positive thing was that we got an ensuite room when we didn't book it, however the room itself was also pretty dirty, with dust and hairs all over the drawers and wardrobe. I think I did get some sleep at some point, but probably not for more than 1, maybe 2 hours.

First..... of all I booked a twin room so why would you question when 2 people come to reception for the key! Second....I booked the room and dealt with all the paperwork as I speak better English, where as my friend speaks little English so a night porter asking him question like (where did you do tonight?, what name is the room booked under?)and not letting me translate isnt going to help! It was just a shame after having a great day and night to have to deal with rude staff member! Which puts a bad feeling into body and mind for the visit! Third and final.......

We traveled with some friends who had one that was not, and the WC was just next door and so this was no bother to them.

If you want a more up market hotel you may not get the same sort of location as this one, and it will no doubt be more expensive. The road which this hotel is located has many other hotels in the same price range, so just read the reviews and choose accordingly. Be rest assured this hotel is OK for a no frills short stay.

We were to much outside to notice this little detail too much. Another minus is that the breakfastroom gets crowded if you get to late out of bed in the morning, but that is all negative sides I can find. The breakfast is a rather nice little buffet, and if you need any more of anything at all you can just ask the staff and they will help you get it. The breakfast-room is nice and light, even though it is placed in the basement. We ordered an \"en-suite\" room or something like it, and probably got a little bigger room that way, we did not pay to much more for it than an ordinary two-bed room, so it might be a nice investment if you don't like the small hotel rooms you mostly get in London. Our windows could open up and the room was clean and nice, and our towels got changed every day. The bathroom was a nice size and also spotless. There was no phone or so in our room, we had an waterwarmer, tea and coffee, sugar and cream and cups, a small, old tv, and a closet, and the table who held the tv also had a little cabinet. I noticed that even though we had no phone in our room, there was an available phone in one of the hallways, and that the note with fire-instructions on our rooms door also told all the important things we needed to know, like check-out time, and that you could borrow an iron and ironing-board if in need, and some other things.

It also has a reputation for rampant bed bugs (I've been attacked twice, both in hotels over \u00c2\u00a3100 per night) and strange plumbing (what's with those separate hot and cold sink faucets - my right hand is freezing while my left is burning) - based on these criteria, the Montana Excel is really quite a good value. The hotel is very well located, only a few hundred feet from the Kings Cross/St Pancras Tube station. It's on a quiet street with Argyle Square (a little park) in front. Be aware that Google maps might send you to 16-18 Argyle Street - which is the wrong address a couple streets west. Be sure to enter \"18 Argyle Square, WC1H\" when searching google. I stayed on an overnight layover and airport transfer on December 23rd. The Hotel was almost empty and the entire city was very quiet. The receptionist was very polite and she upgraded me to a double room, from my single room reservation, without any second thought. It's worth noting that this location is very convenient for taking the Tube to Heathrow and coming from Stansted. The room itself (Room G5) was nothing to get excited over. I was on the ground floor, just across the hall from the door leading to reception. The room had a shower and a sink but no toilet. The toilets were just outside the room, only 12 feet down the hall. While I was there I saw no other guests. The toilets smelled and looked clean. The room had good linens and decent pillows and towels. Many low-end hotels wash their bath towels with their kitchen towels, transferring the kitchen grease smell to everything. The Montana Excel's bath towels had only a faint smell of kitchen grease, meaning they likely only partially subscribed to this philosophy. The beds were comfortable, the window opened to a small center atrium, which allowed in some nice, fresh air. The room had no heating controls, the heat radiated from the walls surrounding the sink. This was effective at heating but really was too much without keeping the window open for balance. The television was small but worked fine. There was a small fan in the room that didn't work. Nearly every plastic thing in the room, like the tv remote control was sticky or greasy and contained who knows how many microscopic nasties. The shower opened directly into the room with a carpeted floor. If you opened the shower door while the water was running, it splashed all over the carpet. Overall the room was pretty clean but there wasn't anything in there that was purchased this century, save for the linens. In conclusion, the Montana Excel offers a very good value and clean room for those who appreciate a well-located, budget hotel.

Minuses for this place would be the shared toilet and the fact that some of the rooms were difficult to reach when carrying luggage up the narrow stairs, but overall it was fine. The staff were very friendly and we had a good laugh with Natalia the receptionist. Very central location, on top of the northern line so everything was in easy reach, also loads of shops and takeaways nearby. Can recommend the food at the chop house.

Superb location, literally minutes from King's Cross, which was the reason I picked it - I went to a concert in London on Sunday night and had to get an early train to visit family the following day. Room was small but perfectly adequate for my needs - one small niggle there, though, namely polystyrene cups for the tea and coffee...proper cups are cheap enough at any pound shop! Comfortable bed, plenty of hot water in the shower...and then the morning rolled around - which was when I discovered that although the buffet breakfast looked absolutely delicious, the Montana is yet another hotel that expects its guests to eat at communal tables. There were only a few tables available, and the occupants had positioned themselves in such a way that they were clearly unwilling to share them - and since I didn't have time to wait indefinitely, the McDonalds round the corner had to suffice. Hotels need to be aware that although Europeans may not mind this practice, Brits find it slightly uncomfortable - especially women travelling alone - and as a result, despite the location and cheap rate, I won't be staying here again or recommending it.

You have a 2 minutes walk to go to King's Cross where you have trains, subways and buses. So it is really easy to go in each part of London. The only badpoint is about the noise.

The night receptionist was also very helpful, he took my friend down to the kitchen and let her warm her take-away in the microwave in the early hours of Sun morning. We had a quad room and it was a very good size, there were a few small problems but considering we'd paid just \u00c2\u00a321 each i didn't complain. The room was bright and generally clean but the carpet looked like it desperately needed a vaccum and the hangers in the open wardrobe were very dusty. The bathroom was bright and clean but unfortuantely their wasn't enough hot water so i was the unlucky one that got a cold shower! The bed linen and towels were clean so it was comfortable enough for our needs. Breakfast finished at 9am so we decided to opt out in favour of a lie in. So i can't comment on the food but my friend did say that the kitchen and dining room were spotless.

You could feel the springs on the mattress but luckily for our weight, it did not reach the level of which they pierce through the mattress! One thing I have to comment is, the breakfast.

Realised too late at night the TV wouldn't work as it's remote had no batteries, in the morning I woke with burning eyes from the cigarette smoke that was seeping under my door - I had specifically asked them for non-smoking for health reasons. The shower gave no hot water. The curtain didn't cover the whole window so had to move it to the bit you were in to avoid providing a display for opposite windows! Went down for breakfast - food was fine, and a buffet so you could eat as much as you like. Previous reviewers have said about greasy food - well, that is what an English breakfast is! Like it or lump it. There was the traditional English fry up plus cereal, toast, fruit juice and tea/coffee. The problem with breakfast though was the moody woman serving in there - she gave off such a horrid atmosphere. Despite all that - it's cheap for central London and was clean and I felt safe there as a lone female...... I have stayed in some real rat holes in London in the past so whilst Montana was not great it was certainly not awful and I wouldn't say avoid.
