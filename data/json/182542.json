I asked about upgrading to a waterview but decided it was too expensive. The reception clerk said I was booked for a king which was quite small, and would I like a queen double which was bigger. It really was a large room, two beds and a sofa. It also had two windows and a small balcony at the back from which you could see the water do I was delighted. The service was excellent in the restaurant and bar, and I used the free wi if in the lobby area. I only had breakfast once as a treat, but it is costly so I can recommend Moonpennies ( turn left out the hotel cross at lights and you will see it at next junction ) I didn't like the music in the lifts but that is a personal preference. the pool was very good too. It is very easy for the convention centre and the shops so I would say it's worth it. If you are a Marriott rewards person you currently get half price on entrees.

I was expecting a non-distinctive, upscale chain hotel property but instead was delighted by how contemporary and attractive the decor is. While not as hip and edgy as W Hotels, the Renaissance Vancouver looks and feels up-to-the-moment. The location at the edge of the harbor provides a beautiful view from the lobby bar and restaurant. And even from my corner city view room, which lacked windows but had a \u201cJuliette\u201d patio accessed by a glass door, I could see the water and mountains. The bathroom was well appointed with granite around the sink and Aveda toiletries; however, it was a small space with barely any counter area for putting your stuff. An especially nice touch is the very relaxing, ethereal music -- like something you might hear during a massage -- that\u2019s always playing in the background in the lobby area and adjacent spaces. Location, too, is an asset.

My only complaint here was that the room was too small for four people. The room was only about 10 feet wide. That being the case it was difficult for more than a couple people to see the TV at the same time unless you were all in the same bed. The hotel does provide parking at a rate of $23/night, however the parking garage has a max height of only 6 feet. This would've been nice to know in advance as we had skis on our roof which had to be removed. I did not eat at the restaurant or use the exercise facility/pool, though these did look nice. The location is great, just two blocks from the convention center and the bay. The service was great and the people were friendly. The common areas were well designed and very clean.

We weren't sure what to expect, maybe a room on the lower floor with no view, or a room on a higher floor with a beautiful view. We didn't know what the customer service aspect would be like either. We are so happy to say that we experienced 'WOW'! We pulled up to the hotel and weren't sure where to park, valet was polite and offered to park our vehicle, or we could park our vehicle ourselves in the underground parkade. We were given very clear directions on how to get into the parkade and up to the lobby reception. Once at reception, we were greeted by Somayeh and Sam. They were both very professional and at the same time, very fun and entertaining. We were told our room was on the highest floor, facing the harbour; we couldn't wait to go and check it out. What a treat to be on the 18th floor and have such a magnificent view of Vancouver harbour. The room was spacious and impeccably clean, super comfy and quiet, even with the patio doors open (so nice to be able to open the windows or a patio door for some fresh air and see the harbour and mountains). We went back out and walked around the city, had dinner close by, then relaxed in our room. The lighting and decor in the room is well done. The room had robes that were oh so very soft. I love a hotel that has soft robes, towels and linens. I think it says a lot about the hotel and that it genuinely cares about your comfort. We ran into housekeeping a few times and they were very friendly and had lovely smiles, so nice to see. The next morning, we had breakfast in the restaurant, P2B, unfortunately this was not good and is our only complaint. The buffet food was cold and dry. However, there was a lot of variety. We didn't find the staff in the restaurant as pleasant or fun as the rest of the hotel. Other than the restaurant, which really is very minor since there are so many other places to dine nearby, this hotel really was BLISS, and we do hope to return again one day soon.

I know Renaissance is part of Marriott, but I also know the difference between the hotels and I am definitely aware of where I booked my stay!!! He finally found our reservation. After we settled in and we headed down to go to dinner, we stopped and asked the same guy if he had any recommendations on where to eat since we were only staying for a couple of nights and wanted to have the best experience we could. (we had to ask him cause there was no one else working there at that time). He didn't even look up from his computer, and said, \"there's a lot of places, just go to Robson street.\" My boyfriend and I both looked at each other and said to him, we will go there, but is there a specific place you can maybe recommend, and he said just go there and I'm sure you will find something. Worst customer service ever! We then proceeded down the stairs to try to find something to eat, and we figured we would try asking the doorman, Hector. I cannot tell you how great and helpful he was! He gave us 5 different recommendations and was super nice about it. He explained how to get to the restaurants and let us know that if we needed anything else he would be happy to help. Now that's what I call customer service! Cesar, who is another person that was working at the concierge was also super nice and helpful. He always had a smile on his face and helped. Honestly, the hotel was in an okay location of downtown. It's a 5 block walk to the main street, but the view of the Harbour is very nice.

The concierge lounge was open late Sunday afternoon and we able to take advantage of it. The lounge served delicious hors d'oeuvres, soup, salad, and a variety of cheese and veggies. We went to see the pool and gym. The pool wasn\u2019t anything big but it is a nice amenity to have and the gym was spacious with lots of equipment. There is a restaurant and bar on site but we didn\u2019t try it. There was a long line in the morning but go elsewhere for breakfast. Just two blocks away, there are lots of places advertising full breakfast at cheaper prices and we took advantage of that. There are two computers in the lobby area and the valet guys were helpful in directions and taking care of the luggage.

The room wasn't large, but it wasn't small either.... bottom line, we had enough beds to accomodate everybody comfortably and the kids enjoyed playing with the beds. The view towards the harbour and Stanley Park is not unobstructed, but it's nice nonetheless. I did enjoy taking a morning picture of Stanley Park framed in between two high rises. What else is good: location. IMO, sleeping in the Coal Harbour area of Vancouver makes a huge difference. I regard Stanley Park as one of the greatests urban parks in the world, and probably the most beautiful. The pedestrian/ bycicle trail that joins the Canada Place and Stanley Park has to be one of the most pleasant walks anywhere. Another positive was the staff, very helpful. Regarding the previous comments about Internet, parking and breakfast... Internet is free in the lobby, so what's the issue? How many hotels of an equivalent brand name offer Internet for free anywhere in the property? Not many, so I thought this was a nice surprise that added value to my stay. Parking is expensive but if you are trying to save money, keep in mind that street parking in that area of Vancouver is super safe and free during the night. I actually left my car in a Chinatown parking garage (EasyPark close to Main and Keefer) for $10.50/ day during my all-Vancouver days. I picked the car up for our day trip to the Sea-to-Sky highway. Got back around 8pm and paid for two hours of street parking right across the hotel (there is a 2-hr limit so if you need more than 2 hrs you have to be more inventive). Free street parking starts at 9 or 10pm (can't remember). Bottom line, there are ways to save in parking.

Nothing stopping you from coming into Waterfront station from the airport and taking the expo line to Burrard station and walking from there ( or vice-versa when leaving). Taxis are queued out front and it is a short walk to either Robson street or the waterfront if you want to go for a run. Never ate at the restaurants because there are too many great places nearby to eat out or pick up food including Waves Cafe and Urban Fare which are less than a block away. There is also a 7-Eleven and Shoppers Drug Mart nearby for picking up things. Like others have said, the rooms are a bit date with some pretty funky design carpets. But really you can't complain because it is clean and the rooms are spacious. W. Hastings past Burrard street is quite quiet especially at night with the most noise coming from the bar/lounge across the street at the Marriott.

Otherwise the room and hotel was ok but nothing special at all. Everything seemed a bit old and a general refurbishment wouldn't harm. Oh n for Internet in the room they wanted to charge 15.95$ per day - only in the lobby it is free. The good thing is, that they don't seem to be tech-savvy: you can take your laptop to the lobby, get a free login there and bring your laptop up to your room again and it is working for free :-)) So overall the stay was ok as I didn't have to pay but I would have been disappointed would I have paid for it.

We chose this hotel because of a nice discounted offer. We were shocked when we arrived and saw the room. It felt like being in a matchbox with little room for 2 people to move around. It was sparsely decorated, and the bathroom was a joke. There was not even a hook in the bathroom to hang anything on. The view was of a city building. I went to the front desk, and I requested a different room. I was told there would be no other room available at the price I paid, but I could get another room if I was willing to pay more money. I refused and I decided to tough it out. When using the bathroom, we found that the sink would not drain. I called the front desk, and they said a plumber would be sent up. After we waited 30 minutes, the plumber arrived, and he worked on the sink. He said he could not fix it completely, but he thought it would now drain better. After he left, we discovered, it continued to drain sluggishly. I went to the front desk to request another room, basing my request on a non-working sink and I was once again told there were no rooms available unless I was willing to pay more! I again refused and decided to just deal with it. I am amazed at all the good reviews of this hotel. It appears others had a better experience. In my opinion, the room that we stayed in was not a 4 or 5 star room, but more like a 1 or 2 star room at best. We would have done far better to have stayed at a Motel 6, a Comfort Inn, or a Hampton Inn. At least, we would have had more room, a working sink, and a breakfast. Also, it should be noted that for those with a car, the parking fee is $42 per night! In my opinion, the only thing this hotel has going for it is the nice location.

It was good value at that price but definitely would not be good value at the rack rate. Our 12th-floor standard double room had been remodeled but the furniture seemed low quality with knicks and scratches already marring surfaces. The new carpeting (stripes in bold colors that proved a distraction in the room) was already rather grungy. The room was good-size, though, and had a comfortable bed. The small bathroom was adequate and had Aveda products. There was a limited view of the harbor, which was pleasant to look out on, from the corner window. Our room was quite a ways from the elevator, which meant that I saw far more of the hallway carpeting than I wanted to see. The pattern -- two geometric designs featuring primary colors -- had a dizzying effect on me. This decor (and that within the room) is not what one usually encounters in a 4-star hotel. The hotel advertises a $23 daily parking rate. With tax, that actually comes to a daily rate of $31 plus some change. We thought that a bit steep so parked our car in a nearby Easy lot, where the cost is only $6 from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. At 10 p.m., we moved the car to a parking meter across from the hotel.

In short, while decently renovated with good cosmetics, all the renos in the world can't compensate for a complete lack of soundproofing. We thought the lobby was adequate, the decor interesting although not opulent. Our kingsized room was sparkling clean and had a very comfortable bed. The bathroom door was an odd sliding arrangement designed to minimize door swing and thus allow a king sized bed into a smallish room. That's where the good news ends. The bathroom door affords no sound privacy which could be an issue for friends sharing a room. A bigger problem is that hallway noise transmits so directly through the main door that you would think the people in the hall were standing in the room with you. Between rooms, conversations can easily be heard and we were blessed by next door neighbours who let their baby (after waking crying at 6 am as babies do) bang on a recycling bin or something for the next 30 minutes at 6:30 in the morning. This was not a muted sound. While the drumming stopped the baby's crying, it started ours! Other friends stayed here and commented independently on the same problem with noise and they had a problem with their neighbours leaving the bathroom fan on all night ((presumably to drown out hallway noise?) . Bar food and drinks are expensive relatively speaking, and service while friendly was very slow. However, our friends had dinner in the restuarant (we did not) and said the food was terrific and good value for top dollar. We thought the continental breakfast was good quality although toward the top end of expense.Service was better at breakfast, speed wise. You cannot beat the location of this hotel for easy access to shopping and an inexpensive cab ride to good restaurants and thus my recommendation at all, but the noise thing really is a large problem. If you drive, take the valet parking at 40 dollars a day because finding your way to the self park for 30 dollars a day (OK, 27ish) is a challenge that you don't want to repeat in a city you don't know.

We got a 12th floor city-view room for $70 on priceline, and since the Vancouver Paralympic Games were just wrapping up that weekend, we thought it was a good deal given the location, etc. It is right across the street from the Marriott, and a block from the waterfront. Check-in was swift, and they took my Marriott card for points against any \"extras\" (no points on hotel rate, of course, since thru priceline). The staff was very polite and professional and made sure no one waited long. The lobby is quite modern and elegant, and previous hints about capturing the free wi-fi in the lobby were accurate; we were able to use it subsequently in our room, though we only tried it once very briefly, to see if it would really work. Simply boot up your laptop in the lobby and sign on to the free lobby wi-fi. A password is provided for accessing it again later, although my machine didn't ask for it when we got up to the room--it just connected directly. It's for reasons like this I don't understand why free wi-fi is not just as ubiquitous as free toiletries and coffee... Self-parking was $29 per day with taxes, and the hotel staff were unhelpful about options for parking nearby. Understandable, I suppose, so do your own research in advance if driving. I read of a $6/day lot nearby in another TA review, but we found no such deal. The room we were given was a double (2 beds), and if not exactly small, it was definitely on the \"trim\" side. Perfectly fine for a couple or pair of friends traveling together, but I would not recommend this room size for a family (unless it was with a single infant). The beds were nicely made up with quality linens and pillows, and while the mattresses were just a bit firm for my taste, my partner (as usual) loved them! I appreciated the mix of foam and down pillows and the lofty comforters. There is a single nightstand between the two beds, which is a bit inconvenient for us, as we had to share a lamp and the electrical outlet for our accoutrements, but I travel with a Belkin Mini (thanks CdnTravelWriter) travel plug which has come in infinitely handy for these situations! Also, the room had a lovely chaise next to the ceiling-to-floor windows, which made quite a comfy reading nook in the mornings. Also, these windows are actually sliding-glass doors that open to a small...well, it's not exactly a balcony, but you can step out between the windows to a railing...I think it might be called a \"juliette balcony\". There are no smoking stickers on the doors, of course, as it is a non-smoking hotel, but I saw people dangling cigarettes above and below on more than one occasion. Even 12 floors up, the noise from the streets is noticeable with the door open, but the chance for fresh air is a nice plus. The room does have A/C, however, and it seemed to work quite well. The room's decor is a bit on the bland side and seems a little mismatched, although everything was perfectly clean and in good condition. There is a large radio alarm clock, though not the iPod kind which most 4* hotels provide these days. However, props for the \"coffee and tea\" box, which was amply stocked with 2 different kinds of tea, regular and decaf coffees, liquid non-dairy creamer, and a variety of sweetners. These are replenished daily and do not come in those ridiculous pre-packed packets, so you can have as many or few condiments in your coffee/tea as you like. I also appreciated that the tiny one-cup-at-a-time coffee maker is one of those newer models where the coffee packet is actually the tray that you slide in for the water to brew through--much less chance of finding a grimy machine or moldy old grounds left in it! The bathroom was on the narrow side, but with plenty of counter space and--much appreciated by the female traveler!--with a mounted, move-able, make-up mirror. Too many newer hotels are dispensing with this luxury, and I mourn the loss! The linens were well-stocked, and while the toiletries were on the sparse side--shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap--they are Aveda's Rosemary-Mint, which my partner and I both like the scent of! Also, the shower curtain is on a curved rod, and the tub was what I consider slightly wider than standard, so despite the narrowness of the room itself, the shower did not feel in the least cramped. Plenty of water pressure and hot water, at least at 12 floors up. There was a sliding door closet (the bathroom door was a sliding pocket door) and this design kept the small entryway clear of annoying door jams (get it? lol!). The closet held no robes, but did have an in-room safe big enough for a laptop, plenty of hangars (for us, anyway), an iron and ironing board, and a suitcase stand. The bureau, more functional than attractive IMHO, held a large flat screen TV (I want to say 32\"?), six large, deep drawers for unpacking, and a desk at the opposite end, equipped with a business console--extra plugs, etc. A nice desk chair was also provided. As mentioned by previous posters, noise is in the hallways--particularly by the cleaning staff--is both noticeable and prevalent. The room's door is clearly not sealed--with the lights off, you can see a good inch of hallway light beneath the door, and probably a half-inch around the sides and top. I don't really understand why the hotel wouldn't invest in a bit of stripping around the doors to seal them and block some of the hallway noise, because it would surely make a difference. Also, as reported here on TA, the cleaning staff apparently makes a habit of knocking lightly on all guest doors between 8-8:30 am (at least on the weekends), regardless of whether your \"Marinating\" sign is out. We forgot ours our the first night and were woken by knocking at 8:15; the next night we put out our sign and the knocking came at 8:30. They knock lightly--by no means a pounding-- and move on, but I find most people sleeping in a hotel room will react to a knock on their door, no matter how light! And the staff ensure you don't drift back to sleep by making an astonishing amount of noise as they clean the rooms around you--toilet lids are slammed down, closet doors slammed open and closed, hotel doors knocked against walls, trash buckets rattled against the side of the cart...it's very obvious that the intent is to wake guests and move them along in their day so that the staff can get into the rooms and clean them. I can see the strategy, but if I were trying to have a late, leisurely morning, it would be annoying. However, the cleaning woman we met was very polite and friendly, asking when would we like our rooms to be ready, etc. and she did an excellent job of cleaning and straightening the room. She was generous with replacement items (even 4* hotels are getting stingy about replacement supplies these days!). We did not try the restaurant, room service, or use the pool or business center. I will post room photos when I remember to download them off the camera. All in all, I felt the quality of the hotel for the price we paid was fair, although we've won hotels on priceline with a little more of a 4*-feel in this same price range. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the staff is polite and performance-based, and the location is excellent if you are focused on downtown activities. However, I would not rate this hotel in exactly the same category as the Fairmont or Four Seasons, which priceline does. In fact, of the 4* hotels we've won in Vancouver (we've done this 7 times now), this property was probably our least favorite--not because it's not nice or comfortable, etc, but let's face it--staying at the Sutton is not the same experience as staying here, by a long shot! But that is really a priceline issue, so I won't belabor it. I would recommend this hotel as part of an $80-or-less 4* bid on priceline; I would not recommend it to anyone who specifically wants to book a 4* hotel in Vancouver at the regular rate, as there are better values at full price.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cockeysville, MD", "Title": "\u201cOlympic stay enjoyable!\u201d", "Author": "ajgeb", "ReviewID": "UR57963848", "Content": "I and a friend stayed at this hotel for the first 11 days of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games.

Our room was dark with a slit of a window that looked out on the backs of bushes half a level up from our room, so it felt like we were in a basement.

I never saw the front lobby space without hundreds of pieces of tour luggage crammed in it. Since it was rumored that the hotel had views of the harbor, I took my laptop out onto the patio. There was a huge expanse of patio without chairs, and one area for restaurant patrons -- like the \"free\" Internet, if you wanted to enjoy the view, there was no option but to pay. To add insult to injury for this horrible stay, I had reserved via the Marriott web site and used a code to get a special rate. I had called the hotel directly to make sure they had the rate noted -- they didn't, but assured me they would. When I checked in, the front desk staff tried to charge me a different rate.

Overall, we had a good experience at the hotel, but could not quite get past some of the hotel's quirks. We ended up in a harbour view room. This after an intervention by a very helpful bellman, who asked my wife how our stay was shortly after we checked in and were \"upgraded\" to a city view room to be given a king size bed. Note that the harbour view room also had a king size bed. The harbour views are excellent - or at least were from our room. It appeared that the high rise condo across the street could block views from some rooms. There are two sets of sliding glass doors which both allow you to open the windows and / or block out the seaplane noise. With the windows closed, the room is very quiet. The room itself - as noted on other reviews - is quite small. The closet area is not very deep. Hang a shirt or jacket on a hanger in the closet and you'll have to turn it sideways to close the closet door. There is a very modern set up for accessing the internet and displaying your PC on the flat screen TV in the room. We did not try this set up. Internet access in the room costs $16 CDN per day. The bathrooms were small, and the light switch was a bit of a reach around the corner on the outside of the room, if you forgot to turn on the light before entering. The bathroom servicing was one of the quirks. Most hotels will leave 3-4 bath towels for a room with two guests. Consistently we were left only two towels. I don't know if this was conservation, hotel cost saving measures or just a quirk of the cleaning staff on our floor. The biggest quirk by far is the elevator system in the hotel. The doors close very quickly and on arrival, I actually rode the elevator up and back down and up again from the parking garage as by time my wife got off the elevator, the doors closed before I could get off. As noted in prior dated reviews, a room key is needed to operate the elevators to guest floors. I had several interesting experiences as the elevator began moving before guests could punch the button for their floor. There is a very large pool / fitness center area on the fourth floor. This would definitely be one of the pluses of the hotel. Upon check in, no recognition was given of the fact that I was Marriott Rewards Silver Elite status. Given the large number of tour groups staying here, I would have to think that not many Elite members stay here, although I may be wrong. At any rate, I was not made to feel welcome or in any way special because I was elite. This was in contrast to the helpful bellman, who was very specific in his recognition of our elite status (different marking on room key). The hotel's parking garage is a maize of underground twists and turns, including a few blind turns. Should you self park, drive slowly and carefully. Also, it is easier to turn right out of the exit onto Cordova than following the main signs to exit onto Hastings. In light of recent notoriety about gang crime in Vancouver, I would say that the hotel is in what appears to be a good location. A three minute walk will take one to the Seaside bike and walking / jogging trail which extends around Vancouver's beautiful waterfront and includes the walk around the seaside perimeter of Stanley Park. I did the walk from the hotel, around Stanley Park and back via Denman in two and a quarter hours. There are suggested nine and four mile walking / jogging routes on business card sized cards available in the fitness center. Going east from the hotel, it is a short walk to Canada Place, the new convention centre, and Burrard St. Burrard Street is where to go to get most city buses. The Skytrain can be boarded at the Waterfront Station opposite Canada Place. Tip: if you want a Translink day pass, they are sold in the city's visitor information centre opposite Canada Place (the place listed on the Translink web site in the 1000 block of West Hastings as selling transit passes did not sell day passes - at least not the day we tried to buy them there). The appearance of the hotel from the outside is definitely showing signs of age - but that may be in part due to the contrast to the newness of the hotels and condos surrounding the hotel. On the whole, we had a good stay, but on the whole I would most likely choose another hotel on my next visit to Vancouver. And I do want to acknowledge that despite some issues with service (towels, check-in), the helpful intervention of a great bellman really made our stay.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cExcellent views of the Harbour\u201d", "Author": "guienriquez", "ReviewID": "UR32132138", "Content": "Me and my partner stayed there one night after getting off an Alaska Cruise.

The jacuzzi had hard blue mould growing on it and the lockers for the pool looked like veterans of a high school: most of them were well hammered, doors bent out of shape. There was a plentiful supply of new looking exercise machines. The actual room (again on the concierge floor) was quite small altho with a good view of the harbour. The hallways were done in a red/yellow/orange/black modern paint/carpet garish swirl...hard to take first thing mornings and just plain ugly at other times.

Because I get E-mails from Marriott Rewards a few weeks later they sent me an offer for the same hotel for a special renovation rate that was even less. I had read 1 negative review that said someone had stayed in a room that had not been renovated so I was sure to request that I be put in a room that was newly renovated just in case. The reservations agent explained for the renovation rate special I would not have a water view but that was OK with me since we would be on a cruise ship for 22 nights and would see plenty of water. When we checked in (prompt and efficient) and went to the room I was very pleasantly surprised to have a wonderful water view.

We purchased a scone and a muffin and some cream for coffee and ate in the room the next morning. We checked out and rolled our luggage to the nearby cruise port to embark on our cruise.

My boyfriend and I are both in our early 20's and we decided to drive down to stay with my mother during her business trip. The stay was mediocre at best, there was construction going on and it was always noisy. Because we were younger, we were treated with disrespect, despite probably having an income greater than any of the hotel staff. The first time was definitely the better of the two times we stayed there, we had paid for a deluxe room with a king bed facing the water, we got two doubles, in their \"deluxe\" room, which was not all that deluxe but was nice enough. Both times we were put on floors where there was construction, which wasn't such a problem, but was annoying. On the day we were to check out, we returned to our car which we had self parked in the parkade, trying to avoid having anyone drive our car because we had almost hit a skunk and our car smelled terrible, and we noticed glass all around our car. Shocked, I walked over to the passengers side door to see that the window had been broken and all of our valuables, including our navigation system, my digital EOS camera, lenses and accessories, two ipods, money, car chargers, our cell phones, designer sunglasses and various other items, had been stolen. Devastated, we went to the lobby, furious that no one had reported the break-in, including the car that had been parked beside us the night before, which we figured must have been there since the glass had splattered and left the outline of their car. There were also supposed to be 2 \"security\" guards who were supposed to be doing laps around the parkade to ensure things like this didn't happen. When we went to the manager, he passed us a paper that had all of the autobody shops nearby and a map how to find them as well as the procedures in how to deal with a police report and the insurance people, and they also had plastic, tape and a vacuum nearby the parkade. This was not reassuring. It was clear that these problems happened frequently. Given the low wage of the valets and hotel attendants, we were almost suspicious of them because of the fact that it was 11:00 am when we were leaving and our car had not been reported despite the enormous amount of glass that was all around our car. As well having stayed there a week before and having valet deal with our car the staff knew exactly what was in our car and where, considering that the compartments that were checked had been the hidden locations where my boyfriend had left his wallet the time before. It was clearly a smash and grab job as nothing from our trunk was taken, and not even the door had been open, which is was even more suspicious. We were parked right beside the elevator, which was at a dead end in the parkade as it was at the very bottom and our car is a new Mazda 3 GT Lux. but was not comparable to the many BMW's and Mercedez which littered the many parking spaces. Why our car? It makes absolutely no sense, the thief must have either been in our car before, or had known that we had a GPS stored inside our glove compartment and that all times, except that night, we stored our wallets in a hidden compartment on top of our middle console. It made us really wonder about hotel staff. What was even more unsettling, was that when we reported our claim through our house insurance, the man dealing with our claim laughed and said, \"that's funny, I'm looking at the Renaissance hotel right now, it's right across the street from me, I am right across the street from them and I won't park my car there, I park my car 4 blocks away because I get claims coming out of there every single week, that place is notorious for being broken into.\" So there is some food for thought, I would definitely tell recommend the Four Seasons, because they have extremely safe security when it comes to parking your car, and theft is serious to them. At the Renaissance, when we told them we had gotten our car broken into, they looked at us as though we'd just told them we got a flat tire, not like all of our stuff had been stolen and our car was broken into.

Both valet and self-park are in the same garage but I guess the valet level may be more secure or at least have more activity with the ins and outs of guests and staff. According to security, they experience at least one reported break-in per week since any one off the street can walk into the garage. There is only one security guard assigned to patrol multiple levels of parking. The hotel comp'ed our parking for the night (gee you think?!) and sent housekeeping with a shop vac to clean up the gas. They also sent maintenance to tape up the window (we are from Seattle so the car had to get back into the States for repairs) but he did such a poor job that the plastic blew off before leaving the city.

All in all this is a nice clean hotel with friendly, helpful staff in a lovely location - the walk along the marina to Stanley Park was beautiful, we even seen seals in the harbour!", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "StPaulus", "ReviewID": "UR4002099", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in a 17th-floor room facing the harbour. Check-in was quick and efficient, the room well maintained and clean. Our request for foam pillows was promptly fulfilled. As mentioned in other reviews, there is construction in front of the hotel, and seaplanes start and land frequently after 7:30am on weekdays. While the extra windows on the balcony do a pretty good job of minimizing the noise I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper and if you are planning to sleep in. Once you get up, a terrific breakfast buffet awaits you. We managed to get an excellent rate and really enjoyed our stay.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cA breathtaking experience\u201d", "Author": "paul1021%", "ReviewID": "UR3831921", "Content": "My first visit to Vancouver, British Columbia was exceptional.

Even though, there was constuction taking place near the harbour it was negligible to the serene water views we experienced. We stayed on the 10th floor on the right side facing the water. The view of the harbour is better toward the right side. The construction is necessary so that city of Vancouver can prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Each day we would return to the hotel after hours of sight seeing and the view was so breathtaking I think would have been perfectly content watching the planes land/take off from the water all day long. Besides the view, the bed was absolutely divine. We were in Vancouver in September and it was slightly chilly but the heated floors of the bathroom was a great touch. There is nothing I would change about this hotel or trip. THe staff was very polite and helpful, esp in organizing one of our excursions to Victoria Island.

The concierge, Alex, was fabulous, as was Erika. We arrived at 4pm on July 3rd, and our room was not ready until after 5pm (strange, considering check-in time is 3pm). Unfortunately, the room wasn't worth waiting for. It was filthy. The counters in the bathroom, the top of the toilet, and the rim of the tub/shower hadn't been wiped down in weeks, if not months. The floors were even worse. There was lint and tiny pieces of garbage all over the carpet, and hair (even one large wad) on the bathroom floor. The beds looked like they'd been slept in, although I don't know how anyone could sleep in them in the first place, because they were hard as a rock. The mattresses had to have been at least 20 years old. And, we had reserved two rooms - they were both just as filthy and beds just as bad. We paid over $200 CDN/night for each of these rooms, and they were worse than Motel 6.

The bedspreads,curtains,wallpaper is very outdated and hard on the eyes. We were on the 12th floor and I could hear the room next door perfectly - everything they said, did -heard their tv - if they sneezed coughed. My employee was in the room on the other side of me and she could hear me talking of phone and my tv (I speak very quietly and my tv was on very low). The adjoining room doors were thin and the light from the other room shone through along with the light from the hallway from the front door. Rooms seem very old. Towels actually had holes in them!! Was quite shocked as I stayed in the Marriot Victoria in October and was told this was part of the same chain - you would never know it. The pool was fine but no towels first night there only small hand towels and scug around the hot tub.
