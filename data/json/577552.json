Where can I start.. hmm... The room: I stayed in a 3 bd room. The room is pretty small for 3 ppl. The furniture and beds are old. There were bed bugs which I had to report to the Front Desk, after that a Guy came and sprayed our room. The bed bugs where gone. The service is pretty annoying. A couple of times they came to vacuum the room at 9am when everybody was sleeping. Its pretty dirty, but for the price you can manage. The hostel: I hoped to meet a lot of new people here, but unfortunately 90% of the people living here are Spanish and they have a close closed group speaking Spanish, so if you don't speak their language don't count on finding a group of new friends... The Toilets and Showers: Toilets are a mess and on top of that they flush every 10th time, so don't be surprised to seeing not flushed toilets all the time. I personally think they are saving on water that way. Showers are OK, but not the cleanest ones you could find. Food: Breakfast: Cereal with milk and toast + cafe or tea Dinner: Usually pretty crappy, but once a while they provide a pretty good dinner. Overall food is pretty good for the price! Other activities, Parties etc... : NONE Location: Excellent. The location is the BEST you could find. Walking distance to SOHO and Oxford street. Night buses and 3 tube lines. Close to London Night Life! Overall: FOR THE MONEY IT ISN'T BAD. ESPECIALLY AFTER LOOKING FOR APARTMENTS FOR A SIMILAR PRICE I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING CLOSER THAN ZONE 3. IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO SPEND YOUR FIRST DAYS IN LONDON. IT'S CLOSE TO ALL THE SHOPS, BARS, TRANSPORT AND TO THE CENTRE. GOOD FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU HAVE ENOUGH AND WANT TO FIND YOUR OWN PLACE. IF YOU ARE COUNTING ON FINDING NEW FRIENDS AND PEOPLE, BUT YOU AREN'T SPANISH IT WILL BE DIFFICULT HERE.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "NIGERIA", "Title": "\u201cWHAT A BREAKFAST\u201d", "Author": "AFRICAN7", "ReviewID": "UR43815089", "Content": "Never knew there are still places that serve workhouse rate breakfast in the UK. Stayed in this place for a few days, tried breakfast once and decided to cut losses and ignore it on other days. I mean how do you call two slices of toast (you prepare it yourself) a cup of tea/coffee with cold milk, lard/jam and cereal (corn flakes/oatmeal) breakfast? I mean no egg, no sausage, no beans even if you can go luxurious? i did not bother with the dinner but my friend who went said it was corn, a piece of chicken and greens (lettuce or so) and they calim to give breakfast and dinner. Please someone needs to insist on what B&Bs can call a meal for guests. This place is only suitable for 1 night and you should not bother with any meal!!!

I am not a picky person when it comes to hostels - just something clean, well-managed, fully staffed and welcoming. That was not the case with Bowden Court. If you're truly just looking for somewhere to sleep at night, it's bearable, but otherwise, I would strongly recommend paying a little more and staying elsewhere. The rooms themselves are fine - at least the one I was in. Some people were placed with \"roommates\" who were actually residents (people who had lived there for months, or even years). Probably not the situation you are looking for. The sheets were clean, but the blanket was stained. The bathrooms were horrible - many were locked, others were filthy and didn't flush. No soap or towels in the bathrooms. Showers were cramped, small and smelled like mildew - although at least there were individual showers. Still, they were gross. The food was unbearable. We tried to eat \"dinner\" there the first night, but it was fish (clearly just frozen fish that had been heated up) with overcooked, unseasoned white rice and green beans. The coffee was undrinkable and the water cups were visibly dirty. We didn't bother to try any of the other meals, although apparently the night we were there was an especially bad dinner night. The reception desk was open and closed at random times, although they were generally pleasant and helpful. Overall -unless you're desperate, I'd strongly advise that you keep looking", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nowhere", "Title": "\u201cThey just don't care\u201d", "Author": "lupidan", "ReviewID": "UR8354532", "Content": "We went here for three weeks. It's a disgusting place. There are a lot of bedbugs in many rooms. Many of us had some bedbugs stings in some part of our body. One of our friends had many bedbugs stings and she was allergic. His body was full of blisters (BIG blisters...), she couldn't even walk correctly, and all they did was give her a washing machine token, a pound for the tumble dryer and some detergent. They also paid her back the 40 pounds she spent on medicines. But they don't really care about the bedbugs, they just get people in rooms, no matter what... To use the computers for internet you have to pay 1 pound for 1 hour (no free internet) They don't clean in the weekends. And the days they do it, they clean once a day in the morning, in the evening you can see hair in the showers.... :S And the food is terrible... Everyday I had dinner I had the feeling I was eating the leftovers of the last day.... Well, the good thing it's in a very well communicated area, near Regents park and in Zone 1... In short.
