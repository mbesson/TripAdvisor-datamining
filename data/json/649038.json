{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointing Return Visit Under New Management I stayed here twice previously with my family and returned for a romantic getaway- what a mistake. I knew from booking that the ownership had changed but was reassured that all the staff and so on were the same.The only good thing to say is that hotel surroundings were still lovely and peaceful. The villa itself however was not cleaned properly and there were signs of something eating from our minibar cupboard every morning. The swimming pool needs maintenance and we quickly got out after we skimmed the surface clear but found all sorts of algae growth. Yuck. I could go on but I think you get the idea.

Small, beautiful place. Great, elegant decor. Huge room for which we paid an incredibly reasonable $75 a night. Enormous windows with peaceful, verdant view. Quiet. Touches you appreciate, especially compared to much of hte competition: Delicious breakfast, water cooler in the room, everything clean. Oh, and three sweet ducks walking around. Even wireless, though we barely used it. Location is fine, in a pretty peaceful group of villages about 20 minutes from Ubud which we found far too much like the Hamptons anyway. The owners are American and don't talk to you much, which is fine. Local staff are very nice. The place does charge a lot for a car and a driver, though that was true everywhere except when we arranged for ourselves away from the hotels.

Location:Well, first of all, as it seems, Ubud is growing very fast and is becoming a little bit overcrowded (not like Kuta, although) and some hotels in the Ubud seem to be not so relaxing due to too many people near them (monkey forest road and others).Location in litle village of Mandala Desa is also great as there are not so many people, with beautiful view on rice paddies. Driving froim Ubud to the Hotel gives you that feeling of a place that is very difficult to find and therefore gives you privacy and much needed time to relax2. Hotel;It is not tipical hotel as it has only a few houses/villas which gives you extra privacy.As it is connected to the local village it brings even more on that remoteness.3. Staff:Staff was really great. Although not so good in english (which is common to whole Bali) they were very friendly and helpfull. Excellent breakfast in the villa, driver that can be hired for the whole day trip with extra politeness for showing how great Bali is.To sumarize staff and their services/politeness were absolutely 5*.4. PriceReally, for what it gives you cannot beat this price. It is much better value for money than other places in Ubud that we saw and specially than places in southern Bali. Big villas, beautiful view, excellent breakfast, unlimited pickups from and to Ubud (although after 5pm it is charged but the price is very very affordable-one coke on Frankfur Airport).We had a great time in Mandela Desa and if ever back we will definetly stay there again.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR885277220", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "impala73"}, {"Content": "Sweet little retreat We had a great stay at Mandala Desa. Pickup from the airport is complimentary, and they'll drive you to your destination if you're leaving from Ubud to somewhere else. They dropped us at kuta which was a pleasant surprise, not sure if any other property would do that.Food was great and at a very reasonable price. I didn't know how reasonable until I started to eat at other parts of Bali. The pizza is a must-try, it was like $2 USD? Breakfast is included and the nasi goreng is a must-try as well, one of the best we had in Bali (comparable to made warung's).The room is big and spacious, with a really huge bathroom and a huge tub. Wifi is complimentary and sometimes after midnight it goes down but I don't think anyone will be using wifi except for me because I had to work.This property only has two villas and two suite rooms, so if you're looking for a quiet retreat \u9225?this is IT. The staff generally leaves you alone and they're always on standby if you need them.The only thing is the distance from central ubud, monkey forest rd which has all the handicraft shops, eateries, etc. Shuttle about 20 mins and is free before 5pm and 50,000 rupiah after that so you might want to plan your itinerary well.I haven't mentioned the rice fields, they were a sight to behold, pardon me, I am from a city and rice fields are really beautiful to me. Another thing is if you're a light sleeper you might want to note that you can hear cocks and dogs in the middle of the night, but somehow I think it's like that everywhere in ubud. They have cocks, ducks and dogs everywhere.Overall this was the best stay we had in Bali, and I would prefer ubud over kuta / nusa dua anytime.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR125720592", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "wynlim"}, {"Content": "A Piece of Paradise       outdoor living room villa 2", "Date": "Jun 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR365204996", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "aleocha"}, {"Content": "Best Vacation Ever! This was my first visit to Bali (or any other third world country) ever. Mandala Desa is the bomb! My husband just kept saying this is the best vacation he has ever had! This is good as I planned the whole thing with Elizabeths (owner's) help! The communications pretrip was so wonderful! She was so helpful to answer all my questions. She was able to set up a private cecack dance and dinner in the villa with just those of us staying there. The dance was amazing as the staff was able to guide us through the Hindu story of the dance as it was happening. I got so mesmerized by the dance, I almost forgot to put the unblievable food into my mouth! The food was also amazing, traditional fresh fish, shelfish, veggies and rice prepared in various balanese methods. I think the traditional spicyness was toned down for us westerners. It was so wonderful! All the food prepared while we were there was exceptional! The staff was amazing. They were so attentative and accomodating!. We took the village walk with August! It was so great to have detailed explainations for all the culture we experienced. He was great!We told Dewa, our driver what we wanted to see, and he just figured the whole day out for us. The coffee plantation on the way to Lake Batur was the best! Ketut was great too!Eddy was the greatest conceirge ever! He was always on top of our plans and expectations!Mandala Desa is a private, quiet and relaxing jewel villa tucked away, just a few miles from the hustle and bustle of Ubud.

The staff are warm and respectful, the room (Villa) is spotless, and the surrounding is serene. Expect a gecko to be saying hello in the night and rooster to greet you by dawn, but that is the lifestyle in rural Bali.The Villa is huge but I was tad bit disappointed by the wall that pretty much blocked the view. Yet privacy is everything at this place, because there is only a few units, the staff are attentive, and food is just divine with a selection of diversity in their great menu! If you rent a Villa, food will be served at the outdoor Bale which is a little hut within the compound. I like the idea of the pool, though I haven't personally dip into it since it was cold (in the morning).Transportation used to be free of charge all day and night but I guess they are charging 50,000 now after 5pm :(. This won't stop me from going there again next February 2008! Perfect for couples who just want to rest, relax and indulge in each other. Some days or night, you can even hear the gamelan, a prayer or hindu chant from a distance away, which adds up to the authenticity of the place ... it's soothing, like music for you soul. I enjoyed my stay there thoroughly, although not so accessible, the transport service makes up for it, unless, of course you know your way around and discover Ubud on a motorbike!

We're staying at Mandala Desa, a tiny (4 villas) hotel or homestay near Ubud. We couldn't have chosen a more perfect, relaxing spot to take a relaxing and recharging holiday. The villa is very private and luxurious, our room has marble floors, garden bath, outdoor lounging areas and an unreal view of rice fields but it's run very charmingly in a family-style, casual way. Not a good choice if you want the polish of a big hotel, but sweet staff and expat owners are a great help with arranging transport, sightseeing and so on. We are the only tourists in the village and were thrilled to be the only outsiders at a temple ceremony here with dancing and beautiful offerings. It's a 15 minute drive to Ubud, the staff arranges drop off and pick up so we normally go for dinner, massage and way too much shopping! Highly recommended for honeymooners and stressed out city dwellers:) Not good for singles unless you come with a bunch of friends.", "Date": "Apr 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR570101872", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JuliaK2"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d649038-r23086044-Mandala_Desa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "649038", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
