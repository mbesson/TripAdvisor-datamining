However I have been in a number of cities and found Amsterdam generally expensive. So with this in mind was 150 Euro a night for a three person room a few hundred yards from Dam Sq over the Easter weekend good value? I felt the room was poor, even dingy but it is in an old building full of character. Beds were clean and comfortable but towels were never changed or beds made during the 4 nights there. We asked for clean towels on day 3 and they were given. Some new decor and this place could be a winner as its location is near the Anne Frank museum and in a safe area with easy walking to so much of Amsterdam. The self service breakfast was excellent and the house cat was so friendly. One other comment on the church bells that ring through the night every half hour ! Lovely in daytime though.

Even when I managed to establish that I'd a booking, there was no welcome, and the only friendly face I saw belonged to a large ginger cat. At least there was someone happy to see me. My room card was handed over, once I'd paid the EUR 20 \"key deposit\". (Since when did cheap mag-strip cards cost EUR 20 to replace?) I was warned about batteries in the door lock. Time to try the \"key\" in the street door lock. About five tries later, I got it to open. Having opened, it wouldn't lock again. So I went upstairs to my room. They weren't wrong about the room lock. The battery cover was missing, leaving the batteries exposed, and it simply didn't lock. There was no way of making it work, either. Color me unimpressed. Mine wasn't the only room whose lock had lost the battery cover, too. The room and bed at least looked clean, and probably were. The next job was to close the windows and shut out the gale outside. One of them eventually yielded to brute force. The other couldn't be made to close, let alone latch shut, despite best efforts. As it was directly above the head end of the bed, it was going to be a cold and drafty night. And if the wind was from the wrong direction, a wet one too. So much for security and comfort. The room was tiny, but I'm a frequent traveler to Amsterdam, so I was expecting that. There were towels provided (not fluffy by any stretch of the imagination, but not scratchy either). No soap, shampoo or any other human comforts. Strangely, there was a flat sachet of some kind of perfume, the sort that comes on magazine covers (and probably did). Fortunately, I'd brought shampoo with me, a bottle from a rather better hotel, which served as liquid soap for use with the washstand (the toilet and shower were communal). I laid down on the bed and surveyed the ceiling, in which a single light fitting appeared to bear every stain it accumulated since it had been installed. Somewhere in the 1970s, I'd guess. A dead moth completed the picture. Decor, both in the room and outside it in the accommodation common areas, was desperately in need of a refresh. Electric cables were mostly inside badly installed and cheap trunking untidily stuck or screwed to the wall. Plumbing was all there to see. The whole place felt run-down and neglected. I feared for my luggage, given the lack of security, so my trip out that evening was necessarily brief. Leaving, I did get the front door to latch, so I had a little hope that I'd come back to the same bags I left. Thankfully, I did. When I settled down to sleep, I discovered that the bed rocked really badly. No, that's not quite correct. The bed rocked really WELL. Thankfully, the telephone directory the hotel thoughtfully provided was just the right size to chock the bed leg, that and a book I'd brought with me. The mattress felt like an upholstered block of foam, and had only a thin sheet between me and it. Once I'd put on enough layers to insulate me from the cold draft from the part-open window above my head, I managed sleep of a sort. The following morning, I went down for the breakfast buffet. The lady on the front desk didn't even look up. The buffet, to give credit where due, was reasonable, and the breakfast room, which doubles as hotel reception, was light, nicely decorated and clean-looking, in marked contrast to the room areas next door. On display there were cereals, cheeses, meats, all of which looked fresh, and on the warmers were scrambled eggs, slightly dry beans and some fried sausage. Juices, coffee and tea were provided. It was only as I was heading to my chosen table that I saw what the cat (sleeping peacefully on a chair) had left underneath it. By this time, I felt like dropping my pants and doing the same. I picked a different table. Still, breakfast went down and stayed down. I handed over my \"key\", got my deposit back, and left the Belga, never to return. The only redeeming features of this hotel were the buffet and the free wi-fi. And the cat, although it could use a little toilet training.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roma", "Title": "\u201cDON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!\u201d", "Author": "lucille106", "ReviewID": "UR80165710", "Content": "Or I should say stay in this hotel if you don't mind having a visit every night from mice and some type of insect that bites you in bed.

I had seen some but taken them with a pinch of salt. Oops! We went to Amsterdam for my friends hen do. We thought for 45 euros each for a triple room, it would have been a decent hotel. We weren't expecting a luxury multiple star B&B, just something clean and nice. The one good thing about this hotel is the location; Jordann. This was a really nice location with lots of shops, restaurants, coffee shops and bars. That's where the 'good' ends I'm afraid. We arrived at the front desk and were told we had to pay the entire stay before we got into the room. The alarm bells should have started ringing here but we were excited to have arrived so paid up front. 5% charge for using any type of card which was never mentioned. We then went to the room and realised why they had asked us to pay up front. If I hadn't have paid I would have turned and walked out and found somewhere else to stay. The first thing you notice is the smell. The carpets were grotty, paint peeling off the walls and a random peice of material stuck up on one wall presumabley to cover up the great cracks in the walls. The bedding had loads of cigarette burns in it, only one of the lamps worked, the plugs sockets were literally hanging off the walls (in fact the TV was plugged into a very dodgy socket right next to the bedspread - fire waiting to happen). We were lucky enough to have a bathroom which i'm glad of because I've read about the communal shower. However, the towels were tiny, I would have said they were hand towels) . I'm quite small and would have expected a towel to actually fit round me, but no. The 'ensuite' had enough room for a shower and a toilet next to it. No room to manouvre at all or even shut the door if on the loo and taller than 5'2. One other thing, the doors often don't close properly so if you are daft enough to stay after reading all of the reviews, make sure you really check the door locks properly after you. Then we come to the service. The staff obviously don't care. We didn't get fresh towels or any other type of service for our 3 day stay. On the third day I asked (at reception because nobody was interested in answering the phone) for fresh towels. I remind her again 4 hours later that we wanted towels. She said that she would bring them up later. We got them at 11pm. Breakfast was ok, not too much to complain about other than the miserable guy on reception. I went down for breakfast at 9.30 one morning (it finishes very sharply at 10) Had a piece of toast, then asked for more bread at 9.55am. The guy was obviously unimpressed that I was asking for help when he was busy on the internet and responded \" Breakfast is finished, if you had been down 20 minutes ago there would have been bread\". Hilarious, since I had been there half an hour before and there was hardly any breakfast left at all.

The room was a little shabby (big patches of paint had fallen off the walls!) and the bathroom tiny, but it was very clean. We had to vacate our room the next day, but weren't really bothered about that - the maid moved all our belongings to the next room, which was at the top of some very steep stairs! The second room was tiny but adequate and again clean. The shared shower was fun and games as you don't really have anywhere to put your clothes in order to keep them dry and you can't really put them on without getting wet!! I ended up going back to the room with a top on and towel round my waist!! With regards to the heating - we sussed that it was generally switched off, but you could turn the radiators on in both rooms by adjusting the thermostatic valve, however it then got too hot and we had to turn them off!! The breakfast buffet was basic but fine - different breads, gouda and meat. Also crackers, jam, pate etc and cereal. Fruit juice and hot drinks also provided. I was a little concerned about security as the front door was always open and our second room had obviously been broken into before as the door frame was all patched up! however we didn't ever feel unsafe. The location was very good and was quiet, although unfortunately for us there was a large very loud group of american girls staying, and the walls are very thin! Obviously the hotel can't do anything about this, but if people come in late you can hear doors slamming as you have to pull them hard to shut them properly. We went to the smallest pub in amsterdam a couple of times - just off dam square - the staff are very friendly and the drinks reasonably priced - i would def recommend it! Overall the Belga hotel was a pleasant experience and fine for what we wanted, if you are expecting a posh, modern 4 star hotel - you might want to stay somewhere else.

Its a small 10 room place in a great location at a very reasonable price. The location is still great but the two wonderful sisters who ran it for years seem to have vanished and the the new managment appears to be kids - either 20 something's or teenager boys who spend all their time watching the video cameras newly installed in the halls The shiny new cameras are an interesting update considering the rest of the mess. Interesting that security is such a concern to the manager since the hotel has an separate outside door on the street that goes up to the room and the manager disabled the card reader when it had a continuous malfunction so it was essentially wide open for days. Its always been a little shabby but clean; still shabby but with dirty windows, dirty curtains, grimy walls, dirty bedspreads, filthy carpets with obvious and recent food stains . The broken toilet paper holder presented a real problem since the bathroom was tiny and it featured the shower that drenches the entire bathroom; the toilet paper was always a bit \"damp\" - not to mention the 20 watt light bulb over the tiny sink (good thing I don't wear makeup). It was chilly in Amsterdam and our repeated request for heating never produced any, although one radiator did get slightly warm one day. But the absolute capper was the freshly dead, oozing, partially eaten dead mouse right in front of the breakfast buffet. The young \"manager\" that morning kept carefully stepping over the mouse until I requested that he remove it and he did but not with any good will. And, since Amsterdam was 100% booked for a convention we couldn't move but God knows I did try. And, be aware that they charge an additional 5% when you use a credit card , fair but not always disclosed when you book a room.

The room was tiny without much walking area, but since we weren't anyways spending much time in the room, it wasn't a problem. The sheets and towels looked old but seemed clean. We had some problem with the lights not working the first evening, but it was attended to promptly by the staff. The toilet however was claustrophobic without any ventilation / exhaust. Breakfast consisted of cereals, bread, jam/butter, juice, tea/coffee, cakes, scrambled eggs and fruit, again quite sufficient if not the best.

It was well situated for local restaurants - I particularly recommend Il Panorama, an Italian cafe just 2 mins down the road. The reception area had a small cafe-like area and two very friendly cats. We were given a pass card for the front door and our room, which was on the first floor up a steep (but not too bad for Amsterdam standards!) flight of stairs. The decor in this area was basic but clean. Our room was a small double with a washbasin, two chairs, desk, bed and built in wardrobe. It was again basic but clean. The toilet was in a small understairs cupboard just outside the room and the shower was down the hall. Both communal facilities were perfectly adequate and very clean. Overall, we really enjoyed the stay. If you're the sort of person who spends hours in their hotel room, you probably wouldn't like the Belga.
