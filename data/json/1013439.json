We stayed here for 2 nights pre-cruise. The location was wonderful....steps from Las Ramblas and a beautiful square full of restaurants. We were able to walk down to the waterfront and use the tourist bus as well as the subway and numerous attractions. The apartment was clean and very secure. The desk staff at the apartment were friendly and helpful. There is no one at the desk after hours, but they are available by phone. You should probably ask for 2 sets of keys for your party, because the outer gate of the entry way is locked in the evenings and if your party splits up, there is no way to ring or knock to get in. My husband had to find the back of the building and call up to the window for me to let him in. We payed 120 Euro per night, which was a deal for this location. Would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "Jul 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR396129121", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ldohe"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1013439-r17999643-Las_Ramblas_Bacardi_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "1013439", "Price": "$248"}}
