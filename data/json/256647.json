It seems we have the option of high end (and high cost) 5 Star at one extreme and shared accommodation at a backpackers at the opposite end of the scale. So when I had to make a quick business trip to Sydney recently I wanted somewehere with a few creature comforts that didn't cost the earth and Stamford Plaza Sydney Airport looked like a good option. I must say it didn't disappoint (I hate it when you search for accommodation, rely on reviews and hotel photos and turn up to a place that's a real dive). This hotel is extremely conveniently located right near the domestic terminal (but a little too far to walk especially in drizzling rain). I hired a car (not just to get there but for getting to and from my meetings) at Sydney airport and headed over to the hotel. I was warmly welcomed, provided with a temporary parking spot near the front door free of charge and ushered to the check in counter. I was give a free room upgrade to a bigger room on the top floor from where I had a magnificent view over the airport and Botany Bay beyond. The room was suprisingly quiet (obviosly much thought had been given to the glazing). The decore is a little dated (not new and trendy, but warm and comforting). It was extremely clean and offered everything I needed in a spacious room. The king size bed was comfortable and the bathroom relatively large for a hotel and well laid out with all the nice little features you would expect. On my bedside table were two complimentary bottles of water and nearby were tea and coffe making facilities and a well stocked mini bar. As this was a short trip I didn't have time to try room service, but the menu looked good and covered a good range of dishes. I felt extremely comfortable in this hotel and would not hesitate to return. It offered a shuttle service to both the international and domestic airports and parking on site. The check out was fast and efficient and everyone of the staff I met made me feel welcome and were extremely friendly.

I have stayed here many times and not been disappointed. I was very pleased with response to special reqests especially extended book out time. I no longer complete survey forms of hotels because in over 40 years of travel no hotel has ever responded to any suggestions or complaints (whether by form or direct complaint at reception) and I am firmly convinced that they simply go into a bin. However many good managers respond to \"tripadvisor\" so it is apparent that they do react to suggestions via this medium so with that in mind I make comment, with the very best of intentions, on minor matters requiring improvement: 1. The hotel was chosen mainly because of its convenient access to the airport and previous good experience, however, taxi drivers, can be highly rude when they discover you have only a short trip (my tip: please jot down their details and report a complaint on the web) so my wife & I decided to use the shuttle bus - we arrived at the bus stop at 6.10 pm and the hotel at 7.00pm...any 'convenience' advantage was well-and-truly lost! 2. After this annoyance and arrival at the hotel, reception was excellent and we were in our room as quick as a flash; settled in; changed to casual dress; then discovered the phone was out of order...we couldn't order in-room dinner! So dressed again to go downstairs to reception and report the matter. The technician did arrive quickly and addressed the matter but by the time we received our dinner it was after 9.00pm...again , any 'convenience' advantage lost. The meal however was exceptional and worth the wait! 3. \"Dooners\" - the bane of my life...I assume hotels use them because of convenience and speed for cleaners and bed-making but surely any cost advantage is lost through having to turn the air conditioning onto cool/cold? Bring back sheets and blankets! 4. At a time when every dam in the country is overflowing and the countryside is soaked and flooded we have signs calling for less use of water and showers that have little pressure ...go figure! Overseas guests surely can only wonder at this madness! The only advantage I can see is cost saving for the hotel in water rates! 5. With a group of clients from across the country I was anxious to impress so the pre-dinner drinks session was important - unfortunately, the very fiendly bar man did not know his drinks and got our orders mixed up five times. These orders were not difficult - reisling received instead of 'bubbly', etc. 6. For dinner we had pre-requested a-la-carte but all were directed to the buffet. Personally I thought this the best seafood / buffet I have enjoyed in a long time as did others but I did have to handle complaints from some of my clients. I would have chosen the buffet in any event. These criticisms are not intended to deter any potential guest from staying ...this is an excellent hotel and hopefully management will take note and act on the matters I have raised.

I have rarely been disappointed with the result and this is no exception! The lobby/foyer interior of this hotel looks very nicely decorated and modern as you'd expect from an upscale hotel but still has a kind of down-to-earth style that makes it quite appealing. Being so close to the airport it is obviously a magnet for airline crews since I saw a considerable number of member of flight people -particularly from Malaysia Airlines there. The airport shuttle is nice and convenient , although some would argue with the $6 fee imposed when a lot of airport hotels have complimentary shuttles but no real big deal. The hotel is not particularly close to any of Sydney's major attractions but is convenient to stay presumably for a transit hotel for the short term The rooms are clean, comfortable, spacious, warm, welcoming and nicely furnished with at least a few of them offering breathtaking views of the city/surrounding area that are rare to find for this price. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in. It had all the luxuries and amenities you'd expect from a hotel of this calibre, although the mini-bar needs to have a more diverse selection of foods (the choice of beverages are great though!) The bathroom is nice -although the bath area is a little small -and there are a great number of nice shower/bathing amenities provided for by the hotel which are a nice little touch -and the cleaning staff do a great job! Due to the double glazing on the windows, the noise from the aircraft is minimal and you can be assured of a peaceful sleep. The room temperature is very easy to set here -which I am thankful for, considering the struggles I've had at some hotels -and so thus it made it easy to get the room temperature right! The rooms are slightly dark due to their colors and could do with a bit more lighting but nevertheless they have a pleasant ambience and I had a nice experience despite it taking quite a while to settle in for some reason) and it was a pleasure to stay here. I'd recommend this hotel for the rooms and the breathtaking views alone. The restaurant has a nice ambience to it and, both here and on the room service menu, the hotel offers delightful cuisine options that include both Malaysian/Singaporean and western dishes. All the dishes I sampled from this cuisine were absolutely delicious so compliments to the chef. The restaurant staff at dinner were very attentive and helpful, less so at breakfast. I do commend this hotel for its initiatives to help the environment and conserve on resources which are quite groundbreaking and innovative. There is room for improvement in a few areas. Firstly, something really needs to be done about the room keys! They seem to malfunction at the slightest whim and I had my room key fail to work four times in less than one day (including twice in less than five minutes! and the second time after the staff had fixed the problem the first time!),. Obviously the room keys are over-sensitive to exposure or something like that because I've rarely had so many problems with a room key! Secondly the customer relations skills and communication efforts of some of the members of staff needs to be improved. The front desk clerk when I checked in was very difficult to understand at some points when she talked and I couldn't understand what she was saying. I had this problem with a few other members of staff. I'm not quite sure whether it was their accents or their enunciation but I rarely have this problem and I'm usually good at hearing. In addition to that, however, some members of the staff just lacked proper communication skills period. On the first day of my stay here, a staff member knocked on the door at about 9AM in the morning (I presumed she was a member of the cleaning staff but then I heard the cleaning staff doing the rooms later in the day so I'm not sure whether she was) and, when I went to opened the door, she just stood there looking at me blankly instead of telling me what her purpose was in being there. It happened again later in my stay as well. I don't think the intention was to be rude but it was quite disconcerting and some members of the staff obviously need better communication skill Room service seemed overpriced, particularly in relation to some of the portions given, and ringing for room service was sometimes a problem (twice the phone was not answered and the third time the people in charge of room service were not available and had to call mem back later). Also most hotels I have stayed in offer a complimentary glass of water with the room service order and this is one of the first hotels I've stayed in around the globe that d\u00c3\u00addn't! The charge for wireless internet here is higher than even some of the city hotels and it really shouldn't be that high (most American hotels offer internet access free of charge, I wish more Australian hotels would take the hint!) Despite that, my stay here was pleasant and comfortable and my room was lovely and I would stay here again and recommend it to people in transit or with early morning flights.

Restaurant has a Malaysian/Indonesian kind of theme and dinner was very nice. Breakfast was pretty average for the price with the same foods offered every morning... no variation. Coffee was thoroughly ordinary; breakfast coffee was self-serve from a machine, eek! By the third morning we were ready to pay extra for a latte and a good strong long black, but their real coffee was also ordinary. The room keys are a bit of a problem too so be prepared to have them re-programmed each day to keep them working! Staff are not over-helpful either... service at reception was slow and there was a disagreement at check-in over whether brekky was included in the rate or not. Luckily I had brought a copy of the booking form so they had to honour that.

Some aspects were great; others very disappointing. Reception staff efficient. Room smelled of paint, but otherwise good. Had to wait in the bar area on arrival for a table for three at about 8.30pm on a Saturday night, as did the previous couple before us. Not a long wait admittedly, just five minutes, but we were tired from a long flight and hungry and it did seem odd when there were lots of vacant tables. I guess they were seating patrons in the front part of the restaurant. Then when we were seated the chairs were scratched and the green fabric on the handles and seat were stained...didn't give me confidence in the food hygiene standards. Food was OK; probably had been better earlier in the evening; lots of items no longer left. Confused about how the noodle bar worked. We had explained that we had the Meal deal but were taken to our seat and not told anything until about ten minutes later (that our set menu had been ordered); by this time we'd already started in on the buffet. Staff member very obliging saying not to worry. Serving area of the restaurant needs a makeover: dated. We asked for late checkout and this was happily given: terrific. We slept well: great crisp sheets, appealling bathroom, nice furnishings, curtains. Charge for internet excessive: approx 55c/min to a max of $29 in a 24 hr period. Charge for shuttle bus for three was $36/return. Buffet breakfast was outstanding in choice and food quality and replenishing food. We ate early about 7am Sunday morning. Went to relax in pool and spa area but disappointed with both: no umbrellas or other shade in pool area; pool was cold not heated, pool and surroundings tired and in need of upgrade. Spa in a separate area and just awful: smelled like mould, cold water, got out after 30 secs. Check out efficient. Staff helpful, pleasant. Wouldn't stay here again although , in fairness, given the meal deal the rate was good value. We would have preferred to pay a little more in taxi fares vs. shuttles and go to a hotel of our choice in Sydney with a nice pool and spa which is how we choose to refresh after a long flight when we are breaking our journey. This is more important to us than food.

We are plane geeks and this hotel used to have the best airport view combined with excellent customer service and reasonable pricing. A friend of mine was flying in from the USA a few hours ahead of the time we could be in Sydney due to work and living on the South Coast. For several reasons, I wanted the payment for the room and any hold on a credit/debit card to be placed on *my* account. I emailed the hotel in advance to check the procedure for this and was told I needed to fill in a form and scan both sides of my credit card and send it back to them, which I did. I was told notes would be placed on the system. When my friend arrived at the hotel, nobody there knew anything about the form I had filled in, and they demanded to swipe my friends credit card. They placed a $650 hold on the account! $450 for the accommodation (which I was more than happy to pay) and $200 for incidentals (highly excessive, in my opinion). Due to his credit card being from the US, there were also going to be a bunch of fees and charges and currency differences, so in total the hold placed on his account was nearly $700. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid, and what I went to so much trouble to sort out in advance. Especially after reading reviews here re the holds they put on accounts. When I arrived at the hotel and discussed it with the duty manager, a verbal apology was all that I was offered. That really didn't do a lot for me. Even worse, I had to explain what had happened several times because it did not seem like the person was listening to me or understanding what I was trying to say, especially about the extra fees and charges. They were unable to reverse the hold on my friends account as it was a weekend (I had also foreseen that being a problem, which again was why I tried to fix it in advance) and told my friend that in order to have it reversed on Monday they would need a fax number for his bank and all his bank details. Unfortunately Monday here is still Sunday in the US, so faxing the bank would do no good whatsoever. It also seemed like reservations and the hotel itself do not communicate as the room was set up for one person and three of us were staying in it. The booking confirmation I have clearly states 3 people. Sadly, this hotel is looking extremely tired. There was paint peeling from the cornices, there were chips of paint and chips of marble missing in the bathroom. My favourite plane spotting chair was not present in the room at all. There was some unknown white mystery substance dripped all over the bedhead and wall. I won't say what I suspected it might be, but it was bad enough and made me uncomfortable enough that I cleaned it off myself. Lucky for us we were only using the room as a base for somewhere to sleep and plane watch in between day trips. But we could have made a base for ourselves across the road at Formule 1 and as long as we brought our own pillows and a floor mat for the bathroom (see my review of that hotel for an explanation of that!) we would have saved ourselves a bunch of money. On top of all that they wanted to charge us $20 a night for carparking. Carparking used to be included at the regular room rate, which was what we were paying. On check out I paid for the room with my credit card, as planned. The total was $456 ($6 for the one way shuttle bus my friend took from the airport). When I complained once again to the completely different duty manager re the hold placed on the account and my friend was giving him the bank details, I requested that the car parking not be charged to us. Note, it was not *offered* to me, I had to ask. The duty manager did agree to not charge us for the carparking. Given the inconvenience for my friend who was unable to access a large amount of his funds for several days (two days later the funds still are being held as I write this), I would have thought they would offer to remove the $6 shuttle bus fee as well, but they did not. I have to say I am truly disappointed that a hotel which has always been so reliable customer service wise and facility wise has allowed themselves to go downhill at such a fast rate of knots. It was always my first go to hotel when I needed to stay near the airport but now I will have to look elsewhere. The view is still first class. That is something the hotel has no control over whatsoever, though! :) And the things they can control they are epically failing at.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cUnexpectedly Good\u201d", "Author": "Mr_Paul_AU", "ReviewID": "UR119684742", "Content": "Having read previous reviews comparing the Holiday Inn Sydney Airport, where I stayed last time for a short trip, and the Stamford, my expectations were not as high.

One thing I would mention that might cause an upset with someone's holiday is the transfers. We had our tickets for our return as we had checked in and paid before our holiday but the bus driver was very abrupt (even rude). Another guest who we had met at the airport and had prepaid her accomodation and transfers online was spoken to very rudely by the bus driver who demanded her ticket and again by the doorman who was also very abrupt with her and to insisted (to the point of hostility) that she must have a ticket to have used the bus.

We could see through the glass door that some staff at the check-in counter looking at us struggling with our luggage, but they did nothing. - We decided to stay at the hotel for the whole day and ordered something to eat (in-room dining). We followed the instruction given at the Directory (ie. Dial 7 for Room Service), but our call was unanswered; we tried to press the button which shows symbols of people carrying trays but again our call was automatically diverted to a message box. (We're hungry!!!) Then we decided to call operator to order our food. If the operator didn't pick up the phone, we might've called Pizza Hut... - It seems more training needs to be given to those who are working in the cleaning area. When we checked in (around 9-ish am) we saw one cleaning trolley next to our room. We didn't understand how he/she cleaned the room/ made-up the room, but surely we heard a lot of banging on the wall. - Last but not least, when we settled our final bill, we were charged for shuttle-bus fee on our arrival date (we arrived with taxi). Luckily we always went through every single item on our bill. - This one is very trivia.... it's the decoration in the room. Not sure why there's a huge clay pot on the top of the TV cabinet. Arts? Not sure.... It's an eyesore. + The only good point was that its close location to the domestic airport and there's shuttle bus to/from airport for just $6 per person. + And thank God our in-room dining order came up pretty nice. I do recommend potato wedges with sour cream. Reasonable price and tasty too (no service tax and government tax. What you see is what you pay). +/- Our package includes breakfast for two, so we maximised this opportunity to sample some food at the ground floor. The selection was quite alright; creamy mushroom was yummy, hashbrown was crispy, but there were some little flying insects around cold-food area.

The airline promised us complimentary breakfast, but when we went down to the restaurant in the morning, the host at the restaurant said we needed a voucher. We had not received one when we checked in and when we asked at the front desk about it, the same woman who was there the day before said we didn't need one! The lack of communication between staff members was frustrating. Also, when the line to be seated at the restaurant got a little long, one of the busboys came over to help out--but the restaurant host reprimanded him sharply and sent him away. I did not like to see an employee treated that way. We had just as indifferent a reception when we checked out the next day. Even though we weren't charged for the room, the extra charges were outrageous: It cost us $162 for a 20-minute phone call to our travel agent in the US! Be very aware of hidden costs like that before you use any services. The only reason I'm giving this hotel more than one star is because the \"service\" people (non-reception, such as the housekeepers and busboys) were very friendly. Their \"superiors\" at the reception desk could learn something from them about customer service! Also, the facilities were nice: The room was clean and comfortable, and the gym was excellent. Keep in mind that this is very much an airport hotel. If you do not have your own transportation and you would like to go into the city, you will either have to pay for a taxi, or walk a mile to the subway station.

There was a TV and a couple of couches that we eventually shared with 20 odd other people (actually they were mostly on the floor). We arrived some 2 hours before the 20 odd other people - these poor travellers had been redirected to Australia due to ash clouds over NZ. There was no communication from hotel staff and definitely no understanding - 2 kids, 2 adults, a 30 hour flight and no hotel room at the end is NOT a winning combination As a note to those travelling with peanut allergy, this is probably not a great place to stay.

Stayed at the Stamford yesterday for nothing more but a quick getaway from the stressful week i had previous ,to arriving at the hotel needless to stay i left more stressed than i had been to begin with! Upon arrival there was no one available to help us get our luggage out of the car let alone take the car down to the valet parking that was included in our package we waited 10mins untill someone showed up yo help us out,the man then took my bag and left it literally in the middle of the lobby??? i kept my eye on it as i was speaking to someone at reception. I had made our reservation about 2 hours prior to arriving at the hotel and it was made via the phone! We had told the hotel that we wanted to pay for the room using cash not a credit card they said there would a $100 bond,which was fine but upon arrival we were also asked to hand over our credit card details to put a hold on some money even after we had given the the $100 bond??? i spent 15mins telling the man at the desk that i would refuse to hand over my credit card eventually he said that it was fine and i could just pay by cash! Before alll of this had happened they claimed that there was no reservation at all under our name????!!!! Finally made it up to the room,verything in the room was great other than having to pay $16.95 to watch one movie,which i thought was over priced (not even Formule1 charges that much!) I called for some more towels to be bought up to the room waited 20mins! Made a phone call to reception to have a wake up call and have a newspaper delivered to the room and if we could possibly have a late check out apparently everything was looked after,went out for dinner came back again no one was there to take our car we had to wait again......when someone did show up they said that the valet parking was for only one use and that we would have to pay $20 each time the car was bought up to us! I had had enough by this point so finally i asked for the District Manager he came out and said that i would have to pay for the valet parking and that it wasnt included in the package i said to him that i would go up to my room and bring my laptop down to show him what the package included, he agreed i bought the laptop down and began to look for the package but what do you know??? the package is no longer there! I said to him that the package wasnt there and that i will refuse to pay for the parking because even the man at check in said there would be valet parking included! He said that he would let it happen this time,i told him that i wouldnt be staying there again he really didnt seem to care which once again didnt surprise me!!!! Breakfast was awful even though it was a buffet breakfast! In conclusion i have never wanted to leave a hotel so soon, im not planning to go back there again i would rather stay at a formule 1 then go to this place and get treated the way we did these people have no idea at all about customer service,let alone general manners!

Big TV tower holding a big TV(as in a box not flatscreen), heavy desk, heavy furniture etc. it did give the impression of elegence with the special wallpaper, which was somewhat made from linen. I saw this only once in the Sacher Hotel in Austria and that reminded me. I went for dinner twice in the restaurant and always before that to the bar to have a drink or two. i found out fast that the barman was a student or trainee, which reflected in his drinks, he made. The bar menu wasn't great anyway but I didn't bother. There are many different ways to enhance things with little or no effort but the hotel has to figure that out by itself. While i was sitting in the restaurant, i spotted an obviously higher manager. The supervisor almost jumped from another table to him to great him. It was maybe the hotel manager or so. However i didn't like it. Because while he got treated as a VIP other guests suffered from that. And please do not believe that nobody recognized that he got his food first while coming to the table later. The guest don't know, who gets treated there and even if it was the manager, he has to step back and advice his staff to serve the guests first instead of him!!! The food was above average. I can say that because I ate toom much on both occasions, I went to the restaurant. i also went to the gym to have a swim in the pool, which was outdoors. I didn't mind that it was a bit cold outside. I just hd a problem with the pool and surounding area being dirty! On my check out day, I still had some time, so I ate breakfast outside at a small openair cafe. it looked a bit like an imbiss and a bit overprized for what was available.

Check in was quick, a bit vague with directions ie car parking considering we haven't been here before and I was travelling alone with 2 children. Found the carpark and had to follow a man to my car space which I found confusing but finally found it. One member of concierge must of took pity on me and was excellent for the rest of the stay, wished I'd gotten his name. We had an early morning flight to Melbourne the next morning and this man suggested we take a taxi and not the shuttle, I was a bit worried about a taxi taking us this close to the airport but the concierge man was there the next morning and grabbed us a taxi and made sure he took us to the domestic terminal. Excellent service...I decided to leave my car at the Stamford while away and he quickly got that sorted out for me, $10 a night was the cost. On arrival back into Sydney taxi driver wasn't too pleased about the short fare back to the Stamford but this time my husband and older son were with us so he more or less reluctantly agreed and kept the $7 change. Taxi cost to domestic terminal from Stamford was $10, cost from Sydney domestic back to Stamford $13 and he kept the change. As soon as we pulled up at the Stamford this man was out the front and remembered us and went and got our keys for my husband to get the car. All very smooth and quick, he really was excellent.. The Stamford was nice, we were on the 9th floor with a view over the pool and nothing much else, room was clean and tidy with mini bar. Personally I would not stay here again, nothing to do with the service or location but I don't like high buildings and rooms with no balconies, now thats just a personal thing and in no way a reflection of the Stamford qualities, if these don't worry you it's a great place to stay and very close to the airport. I just felt that having 2 children with me there was no room to move outside of the building, no grounds where they could play, so we walked into Botany twice and had lunch and dinner there.

The process in getting the meeting organised went smoothly and everything was as requested in this regards. I found the meeting area quiet and our room was perfect for our needs. The Conference staff were also very professional and attentive - this is one of the key things I look for when arranging meetings/conferences. The hotel itself is in a great location when you have delegates arriving from various states - very central. It is a short 15 minute walk from the airport if you want to stretch your legs after a flight, or a shuttle bus service runs regularly at a cost of $6 return (I believe, we only used it one way). Check-in went smoothly and quickly and the I found my room on the 9th floor to be spacious. The bed was one of the biggest and most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel for a very long time. The view was okay, although I would have liked to have been on the airport side of the hotel as I believe the view of the runways is spectacular - if you like that sort of thing. My only real complaint - and this is a usual one with me when it comes to travel within Oz - is the outrageous cost of the internet. $0.55 cents per minute, capped at $29 - so when it reaches $29 you pay no more for the 24 hour period. Again I just think that a business hotel should be offering free internet to its guests or at the very least a reasonably priced internet. When I can put $40 per month for 25g of high-speed internet at home, I just don't understand the gouging that goes on in regards to hotel wifi. Anyway that will no doubt continue to be my whinge. We ate in The Grove restaurant and enjoyed a delicious seafood buffet at $55 per head which I thought was very reasonable. They had a good variety of cold seafood (the oysters were great) and hot dishes were also on offer. The desert selection was too good! We also had breakfast in The Grove and again the buffet breakfast was fantastic value for money at $15 for continental or $17 for hot/cold buffet. I went with the Continental and there was a lovely variety of cereals, fresh fruit and pastries. A couple of colleagues had the hot breakfast which included made-to-order omlettes which looked delicious. The catering for our meeting was great - the fresh fruit tartlets were a huge hit. Lunch was again in The Grove, but as our meeting was only small it wasn't worth them doing a buffet again, so we were given a limited choice menu to complete at morning tea so our lunches were ready when we were. Again delicious food - the chef is very good and his mustard sauce (served on grilled fish in my case) was divine, but he wouldn't give away his secret. We found all the staff to be pleasant, helpful and friendly. My only other complaint is that you needed your room card to get the lift to work and we all struggled with this throughout our stay. But other than that it was very pleasant.

It normally offers the best rate and facilities for an airport hotel in Sydney. Check-in is always without a hitch and if you require car-parking, there are normally packages to leave your car for a period, which are reasonable. We generally use the hotel shuttle to get to the airport, which gets you to either terminal quickly, which runs every 20 minutes in the morning. There is now a small charge for this service; approx $4? However, we do not recommend using the service on arrival back into Sydney. We have had to wait, for long periods to be collected and it normally results in a phone call to the hotel. After an all night flight that's the last thing you want. On one occasion we waited for over an hour. Taxi's aren't keen to take you the short distance back to the hotel, but atleast you're back at the hotel quickly. If there's a few of you, a taxi would be cheaper than the shuttle. The rooms are clean and are of a 4 star standard. We utilise the room offerring 2 doubles and although it's a little tight for 4, (ie 3 teenagers and parent) it's manageable. The restaurant is acceptable for the establishment, but you are paying 4 star prices. Breakfast is easily purchased at the airport and generally the cheaper option. However, travel agents have been offerring better deals than on line or direct through the hotel, as they have been able to get breakfast included; again this depends on your departure, whether you can utilise breakfast.

After reading the reviews here I was quite nervous that I would end up regretting my stay. Much the opposite as it turned out; I checked out feeling rather satisfied with the how things went. I could have booked a $70AU private ensuite hostel room within minutes of Sydney Central, however given the views on offer, I decided to pay the extra $100 and book a room at this hotel. I booked through the hotel's website and paid the $20 upgrade for a room with Airport views. The 'jaw-dropping' views were well worth it indeed if you are interested in that sort of thing. My room was very clean, all listed appliances and features were present and in working order upon my arrival. Its not an easy job being a hotel housekeeper - so I give these staff high praise for their service. I did not try room service or the hotel's bar/restaurant. I believe I was entitled to access the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool and gym, although I did not have time to visit these features. Given its location, I still found the hotel to be rather quiet - although my room was at the end of the corridor and high from street level which helps! Sydney airport has a curfew between 11pm-6am, although some planes have their engines on at stages during the night due to maintenance which takes place across the road form the hotel. Again though, I didn't find this to be a problem. I was looking forward to using my Qantas frequent flyer card to earn some points(miles) for my stay, although after asking at checkout I was informed that there was minimum of $265 needed to be spent during my stay. As my room was less then this, I did not end up spending enough money to qualify for frequent flyer points. This must have been listed somewhere deep within the fine-print me thinks! Other then that, I was very happy with my stay and hope to return to the hotel later this year. I guess only then will I be able to get a more accurate idea of whether or this is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel. Staying on the 10th floor does sound more appealing then staying on the 3rd floor and perhaps the fact that I was a solo traveler, instead of a family or larger group, meant that it was somewhat easier for the hotel to meet any specific requests I had (although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any other then an airport view) I do advise all travellers to always call or email your hotel about a week prior to arrival; to double check points such as: *Confirmation of booking (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on the automated email responses) *To ask any questions about specific features of the hotel and how they relate to your stay *To double check if the hotel can meet any of your requests ie. Airport transfers, awareness of party size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you are travelling in a group, confirmation of room allocation etc. I did this, printed out and brought a copy of their reply email with me during my stay.

We chose to stay at an airport hotel to avoid an unnecessarily early start for our three year old daughter the morning we were to fly home. In a word - it was AWFUL. The building is old and tired. The airconditioning did not work effectively and our room was like a sauna. The room was not well cleaned and the beds were not comfortable. The room was missing basic things like a bottle opener and the alarm clock burst into life at 3am. In addition the service was the worst that we have ever encountered anywhere. The check in staff were efficient but unfriendly and volunteered none of the usual information you expect on check in. The porters were rude and unhelpful resulting in us pushing the trolley with our bags on it to our room ourselves and then returning it to reception. The housekeeping staff effectively told us to look harder when we advised that we were unable to locate a bottle opener in our room! The only friendly staff we encountered were in the bar and we appreciated it! Families with children are not welcomed at this hotel. We wanted to dine in the AV8 restaurant the evening we arrived but found that the childrens' menu was not available - it could only be ordered through room service. As a result the three of us returned to our room and sat cooped up together in our stifling room on a bed as we had a very average room service dinner. As matters transpired we would have been better off remaining at our very well appointed serviced apartment in the city than staying close to the airport. That is because although we requested a taxi to the airport half an hour before we required it , the porter did nothing to facilitate it and we were left stranded on the forecourt for an extra twenty minutes.

It is certainly not the luxury chain it was and comes across as a hotel chain charging premium prices for an inferior product. This is obviously coming from head management but stems down to what we the customer ultimately gets. This hotel is no exception, however my last stay was not too bad (I stay here a few times a year as it's a company contract). Location is great for the domestic airport, you can even walk the 10 mins to the terminal (not international) if you don't have much luggage however there is a shuttle to both domestic and international for a fee of $6.00 which must be pre booked and leaves about every 30 mins. It's a busy hotel. Checking in and out can take some time when there is a queue. I have never had a problem with front desk, booking has always been found and the staff are courteous. The rooms however look very different to those on the hotel website, I could swear it's a different hotel. They are however quite good but unchanged from 15 years ago when I first stayed there, just after it opened as the Sheraton. My last room was good, spacious, very clean, and a very comfortable queen bed. Lighting is adequate and bed lamps have 2 settings. There is a desk with internet access and 2 phones (one bedside). TV is local and cable. Bathroom is good and comes with all amenities, good thick towels and plenty of them however the shower is over the tub which appears very low and uninviting if you want a soak. As with most hotels in Australia now the shower has a water saver head but I was suprised by the pressure, it was pretty good. I have never dined in the restaurant here but be warned, room service is a complete rip off. It's expensive, there is a $6.00 tray delivery charge and the quality is appalling. The one time I did order I sent it back and refused to pay. I ordered a sandwich which sounded great on the menu. When it arrived I just laughed. Two slices of supermarket bread with a slice of turkey in the middle and a handful of packet crisps on the side, $18.00 plus $6.00 delivery. A complete con. This is a hotel taking advantage of us, the customer, as there is really no where else to get food. That is a big gripe of mine. I have noticed a McDonalds has opened near by so this stay I resorted to that. I don't mind paying if it's quality but the food at this hotel is far from that. If you are after a decent airport hotel around Sydney this is your only choice as the only other alternatives are Ibis, Formule 1, Holiday Inn (ex Parkroyal) or Mercure (ex Hilton) which is on the other side of the airport.

We also did not receive any help to carry our baggage, not even any offers. We were then left to figure out which floor our room was on and how to park our car. On subsequent return to the hotel in our vehicle on two other occasions (late at night), we found that the car park gate was shut and we had to make our way around to the reception area to rouse a staff member to open the gate for us. (This is not an easy task if you are in your car down the driveway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly just a key to open the door would be easier?) On arrival at our room, we found that our mini-bar key was not working and there were no bathrobes made available for our use (the information on the internet stipulated that there were bathrobes supplied). Furthermore, the shower pressure was very low, making it difficult to shower/clean oneself. We were also looking forward to having thorough work-outs in the gym, however found that a lot of the machinery was faulty or broken (two rowing machines, a bike, a treadmill, a chin/dip machine). The air-conditioning appeared to be too low or out of order because it was extremely hot inside the gym. There were no towels and also no cups to have a drink of water. To top it all off, the spa was out of order, and it felt like the supposedly heated pool wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at all heated. Outside around the pool area was messy, with dirty crockery, glassware and dirty towels lying around. Even the bathroom/change room facilities for the pool area were untidy, with dirty towels lying around.

The staff at reception are wonderful. Very helpful, professional and accomodating. The room itself was OK, no major complaints, but a standard hotel room with reasonably good quality fittings. For our purposes for one night it was completely fine. The food in the hotel is a bit substandard. The menu didn't offer a great variety of choices and it seems the preferred option is the buffet, but if you are pregnant (like myself) then buffets aren't great. The food was overly expensive for what it was and the service at the restaurant was a little below expectation - when travelling with a child and giving a childrens menu it usually helps to advise if any of the listed options are not available PRIOR to leaving the menu. Of course our 3 year old was set on having pizza only to be told that they couldn't do it. This is not a big issue in itself but anyone who knows what it's like to manage the expectations of a tired 3 year old will know what I'm talking about!! Anyway my only other complaint was that the sheets were so OVERLY starched that they made a huge noise every time we moved in bed. This probably sounds bizarre but I've never come across this before and I spent the whole night trying not to move so that I didn't wake up my husband or daughter!! We got an excellent deal for the room on Wotif.com so for what we paid it was perfect. The location next to the airport was great and within easy reach for the shuttle bus which took literally a few mintues to get to the airport. The noise from the train and the airport was actually very minimal and our 3 yr old was very entertained by watching the planes landing and taking off. All in all if you need to stay next the airport this is an excellent option, just don't eat at the hotel and make sure you shop around for the price!", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "HOUSTON, TEXAS", "Title": "\u201cNormal Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "THEPOW", "ReviewID": "UR22315463", "Content": "OK if your staying overnight to catch a flight.

We had the seafood buffet. Although it was nice I dont think it was worth the money. The prawns were a bit slimey and the crab had no flavour. I strongly suspect that everything was not as fresh as it should have been. The smoked salmon and salads were delicious. There was great variety of desserts. We tried many of them however some were stale and not very nice to eat. The service here was not very good at all.
