{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beautiful family run hotel My husband and two girls spent our first night of our holiday in Spain at Cal Batlle and we were not disappointed!! We flew into Barcelona and drove to Sant Celoni from which we travelled up the coast the following day. It is set up in the mountains so you don't really see it on your approach up the hill but the view when you drive in the gateway is fabulous. This is an old stately country house which was restored about two years ago by the current owners. We arrived late in the afternoon after the restaurant had closed prior to the evening service but the owner very kindly made us some sandwiches to keep us going. The whole hotel has been beautifully restored and is set in such a peaceful and tranquil setting with very private gardens and pool area. We decided to eat in the restaurant that evening and they were happy to allow our children (two girls age 5 and 10) and went out of their way to ensure that they were happy! The menu was fabulous especially the salt cod puff balls which my husband had - melt in your mouth!! The meal that evening and a very substantial breakfast in the morning was fantastic - the quality was excellent. Our room was well air conditioned on arrival and we had complimentary water which was great. The views from all sides of our room were beautiful.We were very sad to leave the next morning and sorry we had only booked one night but maybe we'll get an opportunity to visit again one day!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR230744273", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Paulafluff"}, {"Content": "Peaceful oasis midway between Barcelona and Girona Fabulous Hotel a short distance from the motorway linking Girona and Barcelona. A tranquil, calm family run hotel, nothing was too much trouble. The spotless rooms were available on arrival with complimentary water . We ate lunch in the dining room sharing with spanish business men and couples. The food was delicious and could not be faulted. Maitre, Vanessa and all the staff could not have been more welcoming and requests for milk so we could make tea in our room was no problem.The trip to Girona{ well worth a visit] took just 40 mins by car, we also walked in the picturesque Montnegre region and drove around the local towns.There is are excellent restaurants in Sant Celoni but the food at Cal Batlle was exceptional and the staff provided a very professional service.On our last night there was an ice bucket and a complimentary bottle of Cava from Maitre's friends vineyard. At all times we were made to feel so welcome and Vanessa took time to tell us the best route to Vic although we eventually thought we would leave this to another time. They shared the history of the hotel with us it was so interesting. I left my jewellery roll which has been forwarded.If you fancy a break away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona in an unspoilt part of Spain. I could not recommend it more highly.", "Date": "Jun 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR475079375", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "caroline427"}, {"Content": "Un oasis de tranquilidad   showReview(18160558, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR260239641", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Luna-White"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d639165-r18573923-Cal_Batlle-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "639165", "Price": "$270"}}
