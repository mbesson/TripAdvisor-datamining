We had no such problems - but also the jazz club was shut and the karaoke bar was also closed during our stay. Our room was nice and clean - not the newest room/furnishings but clean and we had everything we needed. One thing I did notice was there were a lot of sharp edges everywhere and this might not be good if you travel with young children. It was perfectly fine for us, nothing to write home about and really not shabby at all so maybe we were lucky? The pool area was nice and refreshing but quiet during our stay. There is something weird about the way you get to the hotel rooms via lift: you have to go to the 4th floor and switch lifts. This is a bit of a hassle but not the greatest problem in the grand scheme of things. The hotel had free wired internet and stored our luggage for 12 hours before our very late night flight.

The hotel is starting to show some wear and tear and could do with a face lift. First, the colour scheme. For some reason, some designer thought it'd be a good idea to make everything purple, blue, pink and green. You'd see the same 4 colours everywhere - from the breakfast area, down to the cushions in your room. And the pillows are starting to look a bit old. Everything in the room is clean and very safe to use. But like a favourite towel at home, some of the towels are starting to fray and get a little thin. The room is on the smaller side, but since Gallery Hotel is billed as a boutique hotel, that's to be expected. There's room for a bed, a table, the closet and little else. TV is a flat screen, high-def viariety, so much appreciated. Plugged in my Nintendo Wii and it worked just fine. The hotel may not be in the best of location, certainly getting out of the area would require a walk to Clark Quay mrt station (a pleasant enough walk when it's not too hot or raining), a bus or a quick cab ride. But there are plenty of food options around the Robertson Quay area if that's what you're looking for. Liang Court Shopping Centre is also within walking distance should you require the amenities of a shopping centre or a supermarket (the Japanese supermarket Meidiya is a great place to pick up Japanese groceries or get a quick bite from the many small eateries within it). Gallery Hotel is a decent place for the price you're paying, especially when hotel prices in Singapore are going up, up, up.

So I choose to stay at Gallery hotel due to the fact that it's located at a very good area with alot of good places for dinner & drinks. And also the affordable online rates. The reasons why we were very disappointed with the hotel : 1) Beds We booked through Agoda site which didn't state if it was going to be a twin or double bed. When we checked in, we were told that they only allowed twin-beds if we booked online. (which obviously we did) The hotel was full and we were recommended to upgrade to a Junior Suite for S$130 (without taxes) 2) Free breakfast & mini bar (not!) : Once we decided to upgrade, they told us that we had free complimentary breakfast & mini bar drinks. We were quite happy about it but they did not give us any vouchers to confirm this. We decided to check in first & double confirm with the officer before we headed out in the evening. We spoke to the guest officer who's name is April. She was not very friendly and insist that her colleague made a mistake and we DEFINITELY DID NOT have a complimentary breakfast/mini bar drinks. There were no apologies or explanation. Just the fact that her colleague made a mistake. But she assured us that she will check with him (as he is on his break and was not around) We headed out and came back.. but was still feeling exhausted by checking YET again at the counter for this \"miscommunication\" --> Please note that they DID NOT even bother to get back to us on this issue. 3) Room Service As for the room service,When I wanted to order beer, they told me they didnt serve by pint. But in the end, they served a full pint (to my room) --> This made us more confused as they insisted that they didnt have it! Upon checking out, we discovered that there was DEFINITELY a free complimentary breakfast/mini bar!

However, it's the odd design choices that really bugged me. Number one design crime: the LED alarm display built into the bedhead. You cannot turn this thing off meaning that you have a red light at eye level on for the whole night. Why would anyone think this is a sensible design? I rang Reception and asked if this could be fixed. Humorously, a hotel worker appeared with a piece of cardboard and sticky tape to temporarily cover it!! It's an incredibly stupid design decision and does not work practically at all. Additionally, the bathroom is tiny with a large and potentially dangerous inward swinging glass door. And all TV stations did not work. Even more annoyingly, the walls are paper thin. We heard our noisy drunken neighbours on one side come home talking loudly at 1am. And the next morning, we could hear our other neighbours' alarm going off at 5am. Not ideal when we didn't need to be up until 7am.

Internet worked just fine, and all the usual things are available in the room - bathrobe, safe, minibar, etc. A nice element (at least of my stay) was that items in the minibar were complimentary.

It did get a little repetitive after 5 days, but I still felt that it was a good, healthy, and pleasant breakfast overall. I didn't have any other meals in the hotel, so can't comment on that. Service was good - even to the point that the staff somehow knew that it was my birthday, and delivered a complimentary tiramisu, which was delicious. The pool is definitely unique and special - do try it out (bring goggles) - it felt pretty amazing to be swimming on the 5th floor, underwater, looking out down below to see cars driving by and birds flying around. And the deep section is just about long enough to be able to get in some decent swimming for exercise. Also, the gym is good, even though slightly longer hours and some new equipment (and maybe another treadmill or two) would make it even better.

It's close enough to be a long walk away to the major entertainment district of Clarke Quay and yet not nearly far enough to take a cab there. With the smaller Robertson Quay next door however, there should be enough pubs and restaurants to provide choices a visitor on a short stay. Be warned though - the weekend crowds to Robertson Quay make the hotel a popular spot to park or to take taxis from - creating noise and some inconvenience on Friday and Saturday nights. Otherwise, the taxi stand outside the hotel usually has taxis waiting for fares. (There is no subway station close by). The rooms I've stayed in have usually be clean and adequately done up. However, there was one room that they put me in once that only had a shower curtain dividing the shower and the toilet, with the run-off drain located right in the middle of the toilet. This made the entire toilet a flooded area every time I took a shower. Check the toilet the first thing you do and avoid this room at all costs. I found the restaurant decent with great staff. With the food choices available in Singapore though, I would only eat in the restaurant only if I wanted to do away with the hassle of deciding which of the many good restaurants in the city to go to. The one thing that I enjoy the most every time I stay there is the swimming pool on the 5th (6th?) floor. It at the corner of the building and has full glass walls on the sides facing out. It is quite an experience swimming and being able to look down on the street below while underwater. (At the same time, people from the street can see you so naughty things while swimming!).

But then CBD of all major business centers has been a quest for most travellers looking to fir in the tiny budgets most companies have for travel. Ofcourse this is not meant for the CEOs. They can always go to The Fullerton and pay close to a bomb. But affordable stay in right in the heart of Singapore's business district is what Gallerey has achieved. The hotel has some distinct advantages : Prominent location. Near to the singapore river and situated at the Robertson Quay. Walkable distance from the center of Singapore business. Come on we are in Singapore which is nice and clean and green. Walking is a pleasure there but for the sweat!!! Reasonably priced considering the location. Easy accessibility to LIttle India and China town. Yes We indians still want to eat authentic Indian available at Little India and shop at Mustafa's Very easy to get cab or a public transport. Ohh you have to travel to figure out that getting a cab in Singapore can be a real ardent job. Very close the center of activity in singapore like the Boat quay, pubs, the reverse bungee and ofcourse the Clark Quay. But then the affordability comes at a cost and the cost makes one think whether one wants to be staying at gallery again. (I am an exception as i went for the advantages) The hotel is just a building and everythig is packed in a single building. There is nothing worth mentioning like a lobby, a pool or a gym. From the time one enters and to the time you go to your room, you have to atleast change elevators and wait for them to change. The pool is such that if there are 4 guys in there we start bumping to each other. and the pool is easily visible from the building opposite to the road. My Indian friends will certainly not be comfortable in such situation. To go to the gym or to the spa you have to cross some 2 buildings and then realise ohh the spa closes at 8!!! and then the biggest casulty is the poor room. if you did not realise in the mornig and get up in darkness you will bump on the wall. Yes you got it. the rooms are very small. There is no internet available in the room. How is this possible in a business hotel??? Please visit once. But then I think Singapore is not the place to really have a great vacation. Full credit to the guys out there to create what they have created out of an tiny island but at the end of the day its all artificial. Singsapore is all about inclusive and great democratic culture. You feel there at home at once and when you travel for business you want to be closer to office and if that is the case like me stay at Gallerey at affordable prices.

The same cannot be said of the others we encountered. The free internet is a plus point and you can use one of several computers at any time. The room was medium sized with good amenities and cheerful decor.

On our second stay we were given a room on the hotel's road side and as a light sleeper, the traffic kept me awake most of the night. At 6am the front desk staff were happy to arrange for a room change later in the day. However on being given the job of moving our luggage a few metres down the hall, the older concierge staff member, was rude in gruffly asking us, \"Why you move room, huh?\" I explained the first room was noisy, and he grunted as if I was talking nonsense. I was so astounded by his rudeness. Personally, if I stay there again I will make sure I am not in a room in earshot of the road.

Then I found out that not more than 20 rooms in the hotel were decorated in \"hip\" style. Like mine, the room had no design at all (see attached pics). The only \"hip\" feel I could find at the hotel was the outlook of the hotel wall and their swimming pool. WRONG RESERVATION -- I booked this hotel thru internet and requested 1 king size bed, non-smoking room. But upon our arrival, they could only offer me a 2 single size beds room. Their excuse was I because I booked thru internet and I needed to call in advance to secure a King size bed with them. They asked if I'm willing to pay S$50 more to upgrade my room to a king size bed room. I felt that I GOT CHEATED, so I didn't accept their offer and kept my 2 single size beds, non-smoking room, which the living room & bathroom was so tiny just like those semi double rooms in Tokyo. DAMP BEDDING -- The bedding was damp I guess because the room was too small, the bathroom and living room was packed together, plus the ventilation system was not working well that when I get a shower, the steam would come out from the bathroom glass door gap (a big gap) and would make the whole room so humid. WEAK WIFI SIGNAL -- I believe they got wifi in the hotel, but the signal was very weak that I got disconneted serveral times within a few minutes. Luckily, their normal wired internet connection worked very well. SERVING MINI SIZE COMPLIMENTRY WATER \u2013 You can find 2 bottles of 310ml water in the room, I could finish drinking the whole mini bottle in a second. Can they be more generous in serving normal size 500ml water?! Of course I can always ask for more bottles, but it\u2019s so troublesome to have to call house keeping 2 times in a nite for water.

But this last stay at the Gallery Hotel really soured my experience and I don't think I'll ever stay there again. When I checked in I didn't get the room type I wanted. I requested a non-smoking queen/king bed through Agoda and they were out of them when I checked in. I asked them if they could upgrade me to the next sized room with one bed, and they said they'd check. But when they found out that I had booked my room through an online service they said \"sorry, no.\" They did offer to upgrade me with $60++ SGD more per night which I declined. I really didn't know that booking through an online service would mean that would be less motivated to keep a loyal customer happy. Anyway, the stay was fairly uneventful until I got stuck in one of the elevators. The elevator had not worked for over an hour (it wouldn't open on the 5th floor) but there was no sign for it warning guests. When I took the elevator up it got stuck and I had to call for help. They admitted that it wasn't working but only for the 5th floor. So they asked me to go up to the 6th floor and then walk down the stairs. I was really shocked that they would keep an elevator operating knowing that it wasn't working and with no warning to guests. In fact, the engineers didn't even tell the manager (he didn't know) until I made a fuss. I think sometimes you get a sign to not stay somewhere anymore, and the elevator incident was my sign. I hope that the management at the Gallery changes because it's too good of a hotel to be performing so poorly.

The overall design of the hotel reminded me very much of the Adelphi in Melbourne - right down to the glass-edged rooftop pool cantilevered over the street - but it comes off as a slightly pale imitation of that hotel. There is an awkwardness to the design: for example, you have to catch two elevators to get from the ground floor reception to the guest rooms. There are a number of bars and nightclubs located in the hotel, but my sleep was not at all disturbed by any noise whatsoever - the room was completely quiet. The hotel is also just a short walk along the river from the popular Clarke Quay dining and nightlife area (Singapore's main nightlife area for \"the young people\", according to the taxi driver who took me to the nearby Asian Civilizations Musuem) and many other riverfront dining options on both sides of the river. We enjoyed drinks and tapas at the hotel's riverfront EM Bar in the evening, where you can watch the joggers puff past you and enjoy very reasonably priced happy hour drinks in a relaxed garden setting. In fact, this was the only relaxed part of the hotel - and the most enjoyable. A downside is that the hotel is quite a walk from the nearest MRT station, although taxis in Singapore are of course quite cheap and there are always several outside the hotel. In summary, it is an okay hotel but I think they are trying a little too hard for the \"artistic ambience\" that it claims to have. Worth trying once if you can get a good online deal.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cSo what?\u201d", "Author": "madhot", "ReviewID": "UR16747141", "Content": "Needed a weekend away so decided to spend it at the Gallery as i have dined @ Zenden (for dinner) before.

I appreciated the free internet and inclusion of breakfast in my room rate. But the rest of the hotel left me rather uninspired. The Room In their attempt to be hyper-architecturally cool they're missing basics. The closet doors are on ceiling tracks so that they 'float'. Nice looking. But they don't slide far enough to actually allow access to the drawers inside! The Bathroom: The heavy glass swinging bathroom door, which again looks very cool, is hinged only to open inwards rather than swinging in both directions. This means that when you want to get out of the bathroom, you have to back against the basin to do it. And to flush the toilet you need all the strength of either your back/feet or shoulders/arm as the wall-mounted button is too low for hand pushing and too high for foot pushing unless you kick. And you need to hold it in for quite a few seconds to get the desired effect. What a palaver. Nice toiletries... The Bed: AWFUL. I stayed in a standard room and the queen sized bed was harder than the worst rock-hard Asian beds I've experienced in my many travels. Thank god there were lots of pillows to try and soften the blow, but I did not get a comfortable night's sleep, which made my day at the office and flight out the next night quite tough. The Logistics: As other reviewers have mentioned, the two-lift system is a huge pain. Dragging luggage in and out of two lifts to check in-out is a huge nuisance, and there are not enough lifts to service the number of rooms at key times, so you wait forever at each juncture. The Food: The room service menu is very limited, so plan on going out for lunch and dinner. Breakfast is fine, and was included in room rate. The Staff: Staff are not particularly polite - too hip to provide any real service, I guess - but you should have little cause to call on them as the hotel is pretty self-explanatory. The Spa: I can highly recommend the Ayuthaya Thai Spa at the hotel - decent value and fantastic Thai massage/spa treatments. i had a 2.25 hour package that included a back/shoulder/neck massage, thai foot massage and facial for SGD188. Of those, I'd recommend you stick to the Thai Massage and don't bother with the rest - the massage was superb. The rest was a bit pro-forma and lacking in care.

Now facts on the table. The hotel is not very spacious, lobby has a reception desk, taxi desk and two benches and that's it. Club dancing music is played there at any time of day. You have to change lifts to get your room, 2 lifts bring you up to the restaurant level (over-air-conditioned - I felt like putting a jacket on every time I transferred from one lift to the other), and 2 other lifts on the other side of the hall take you up to the rooms. The corridor leading to the room was like an industrial building's one - feels like being in a factory (oldish decoration is partly to blame).

Hmm, it didn\u2019t mention that in the confirmation email, and their web site lists \u201cnon-smoking\u201d as an option when you book. Apparently that means at their option. One whiff of the smoking floor had us upgrading to whatever available non-smoking room they had, which turned out to be an Observatory Suite. Our suite was a pretty big room on the corner of the building looking southwest over the river, and though visually interesting was very cold. Not cold as in lacking visual/emotional appeal, but literally cold as in 19 C (66 F) despite setting the thermostat to 30 C and setting the fan speed to minimum (there\u2019s no way to turn it off completely). Their fix the next day brought the temperature up to a balmy 21 C (70 F). The desk kindly informed me on check-out that yes, the air conditioning was too strong and that it was probably due to the weather, and that other rooms also had problems with their air conditioning, some being too hot, others being too cold. Right, and I won\u2019t be paying because my credit card is maxed out, I\u2019m unemployed and I don\u2019t have any cash. At least that\u2019s what I should have said. The hotel and rooms are attractively designed, but other problems crept up in our room. One non-opening window wasn\u2019t well sealed and allowed lots of traffic noise in. The glass bathroom was annoyingly small, especially when there was plenty of room to spare in the Observatory Suite. The attractive tub didn\u2019t work well as a shower stall being raised above the floor level and curved at the bottom. On the upside, the included in-room internet service worked perfectly, and the breakfast buffet was varied and tasty. The pool looked pretty nice. Staff was friendly enough, if a bit young and giggly at times. The front desk staff appears to be well practiced at deflecting complaints and giving excuses. We probably wouldn\u2019t have felt so ripped had we gotten our original Bookend room at SG$168, but at SG$238 for the Observatory, this was a pretty bad deal.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot bad, but could be better\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4089385", "Content": "I just stayed at the Gallery hotel this Fri and Sat.

Amazingly, no one answered the phone. There was water dripping inside the elavator. The bathroom on the ground floor was a mass. wet toliet paper on the floor, the sink was leaking. They also hire lots of rookies at the reception. They were very slow when I checked out. The location is cleary bad.

The hotel is good. Definetely not the best hotel in singapore. The design is definitely nice and the room interior is interesting. It is not an expensive hotel and the quality of the materials is not top. But architecturaly it is a very interesting hotel. The hotel is old though and not as clean as one would expect. There was dust in the bathroom and furniture (unacceptable to me). Service was very good. i did not have breakfast so I can not comment on that. I believe a better maintenance and cleaning would make it much much better. I was lucky enough to get wifi connection from different sources probably around the hotel. A week later I did stay at the Carlton Hotel and I could say that it was much better/cleaner and the location was better.

The hotel is bit away from the MRT station. To give you all a rough idea on how far it would be from the MRT station, if by walking, it would take approximately 20 minutes. However, during these 20 minutes, you would get a nice view on the riverside and walk pass the famous clarke quay. And if by taxi, it would take approximately SGD4.50 to go from the hotel to Orchard Road and SGD2.50 from the hotel to Suntec City. If someone is travelling in small group (2 persons), I would suggest to take the airport shuttle when you arrive Singapore. It would cost you SGD7 per head and it is a door-to-door service. But if you are travelling in three or more, better take the taxi. The hotel itself is neat and hip. If you want to try something called boutique hotel.

We paid for the higher end of room and for what we paid for the room was tiny! everything in the room was smaller in size - could not fit two people in the bathroom, the cupboard could not fit our one standard sized suitcase. The room was worn and same with the hallways. Normally what a hotel lacks it makes up with in other areas but we didnt see this during our stay and unfortunatley would not stay here again. The hotel lacked service and when we needed things we often had to ask twice! There was no room directory and after asking we never got one. Alot has gone into the modern building design - so much that in order to get to our rooms we had to take two lifts every time. The pool was very nice however funnily enough sticking with the modern design the deck chairs were uncomfortable. There is also a pool bar. Breakfast was nice and a great variety. Location was great, being right on the river. Taxi's were always nereby to catch at the hotel. Although their isnt an mrt this did not bother us. At night we would walk to clarke quay - only 10 mins whihc was great. there are lots of building of new bars etc nearby and it looks like the area will be fairly trendy soon. I always hate reading the bad reviews but i have tried to think yes i had a great stay but it was only okay. This hotel has some much potential and with the right management and refurbishment of the worn down rooms and hallways it would make such a difference. overall we paid a little bit more than normally you would in singapore and did not feel we received our monies worth.", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Gallery Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d306150-Reviews-Gallery_Hotel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$156 - $301*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "306150", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0d/bd/0dbd2bdbb032625a4a921fb9648edad57large.jpg"}}
