I've stayed in hotels all over the city & eastern suburbs and this was my first time at Pensione. It has a great location but I have no idea where they get the notion that they're a 4 star property (self-rated). The rooms are comfortable, with nice linen, good beds (we had a double - I would think that 4 star hotels have queen or king beds). The bathroom is modern & very clean but lacks any kind of space to keep your toiletries. The TV is an old style CRT on the ceiling and really not easy to watch but who comes to Sydney to sit in their room and watch TV. WIth the price of flat screen TVs nowadays I'm surprised that they have these old sets in such an awkward position. As for late check out there's no leeway at all - you want it you pay. $20 till midday and $60 for a 7pm departure. There's lovely tea in the room - 4 different flavours which we really enjoyed, and ironing facilities. They have a self service laundry instead of crazy hotel prices at most other places. Most annoying factor which is the trouble with such a location, and maybe the room we had was the club and noise until 6 am sunday morning which would keep light sleepers up. The stay all up was fine, I like the quirky signs & old building but it's more like a budget hotel where everything is extra and not a 4 star.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood location, inexpensive and clean are the only pluses\u201d", "Author": "kewlmeister", "ReviewID": "UR126571131", "Content": "Stayed for 1 night on Thursday 22/03/2012 out of neccessity and curiosity about this quaint hotel that I keep coming across during my online search for accommodation in Sydney CBD. I had initially planned on either the Park Regis or Ibis World Square. Online line booking was straight forward. Its website is basic and functional. Check-in was efficient and quick. Reception staff was pleasant. Corridors to the rooms are like a maze because of the (small) floor area of the building. Was assigned Room 210A which is a standard single room. It's only about 20-22 sqm size. Definitely not a room for a person with claustrophobia. Good thing I am not one. The Pensione Hotel being in an old (1950s?) building, the room has very high ceiling. This together with the dim lighting and wall colour (dull violet) makes the room interior excessively ancient and depressing. That said, the room and its adjoing bathroom are well kept and very clean. The CRT television set is mounted high above the entry door. Hence the only way to watch it without straining the neck in the very confined space of this tiny room is by lying down on the bed. The channels works intermittently drifting in and out of signals. The bed mattress is hard. Didn't have a good night sleep at all. Woke up really tired. The only other hotel I had stayed in before with comparable \"hardboard\" like mattress was in Shenzen, China. LOL Paid AUD$10 for in-room WiFi internet access. Signal and speed of its WiFi internet connection was excellent. Normal check-out time is 10am (rather than 12noon). For noon check-out an extra AUD$20 is charged, and which I paid for. Being conveniently located on the Chinatown end of Sydney CBD George Street makes it a good base to explore the city, be it to shop, dine or sightseeing. Checking out is also without hazzle and efficiently handled by the reception staff. Upon arriving home and checking my credit account online statement I realised they have double charged me for the 1 night stay. There were 2 charges of AUD$140 instead of just one as should be the case. I email them immediately requesting them to rectify their charging error, which at the time of writing this review (abt 8 hours after sending the email) I have yet to receive a reply from them. Not impressed at all.

The hotel is in a prime location within Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinatown district. If you are walkers (as we are), you are within a 15-30 minute walk to all key locations, including Sydney Harbor, Darling Harbor, museums, great shopping and places to eat. Should you prefer to take public transportation, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location could not be more convenient, with more than ten city buses (including the free 555 city shuttle bus) stopping outside the main entrance and taxi stands on the corners of the block. The front entrance is unassuming (you can practically walk right by it if you are not looking for it), but do not let that fool you. While I had prepared myself for a small room, it was very clean and very comfortable, even for three adults. Additionally, the bathrooms were very nice with amazing water pressure, a lovely shower and great smelling toiletries. Finally, I cannot say enough about the staff at the Pensione. From our first phone conversations when booking with Lauren, to each and every employee we encountered, they went out of their way to make us feel welcomed, while providing great local information and recommendations. After our stay at the Penisone Hotel Sydney on George Street, I would not only stay at another Penisone or one of their sister hotels part of the 8 Hotels chain, but highly recommend it to friends and family visiting.

During our weekend stay there, we didn't hear any noise at all even though out room faces the main George Street. The staffs are helpful and the free wifi there was handy also. There's also a Guest Lounge Area with a kitchenette at the back of the first floor to hang out with other people. The free '555' CBD Shuttle is only 5-10mins walk away and will take you all the way to Circular Quay where Sydney Opera House, Darling Harbour, Harbour Bridge and most of attractions are located (Queen Victoria Building is also only a 10mins walk on the same street too if you fancy doing a spot of shopping there). Please note, the free shuttle does get full fairly quickly though. The Central Railway Station is 15mins walk away and has regular trains (every 10mins) departing for the Airport (10mins journey). All in all, it's in good location and good value for the money if you don't mind the size of the room.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "supatrippa", "ReviewID": "UR120629887", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed one weekend night to attend the KPop music festival at ANZ Stadium.

The front desk was warm and friendly. A very good start. Check in was a breeze. The room was of good size ( we stayed in the deluxe room ). There was a narrow wardrobe and inside the wardrobe was a small bar fridge and below the bar fridge was a safe box. The room was well lit with 3 lamps in total on top of the ceiling lighting. Room was modern and furnishings were contemporary and tasteful. The bathroom/toilet for our toilet was meant for a disabled person so it was very big. Lighting again was good. Mirror was big. Good water pressure and hot water was quick to come on when we needed it. However, the basin was a bit too small for our liking. The room was quiet as our room was to the back of the hotel on the 3rd floor. The location of the hotel is fantastic! Right smack on George St where almost everything is in the CBD! Bus stop almost literally just outside the door step. Close walk to Darling Harbour and Chinatown. Unfortunately, Wifi is not free and is charged at $10 for 3 hrs. Probably this is the reason why it is not 5 stars from me. In this day and age, Wifi should be free to guests and not be a premium on top of the room charge (that's my opinion anyway). Maybe Pensione can think of free Wifi that's capped at, say, 50mb a day for hotel guests? During checkout, the front desk even asked if I have transportation arranged and if I had my shuttle ticket printed out in advance. A very nice touch I have to say.

Lots of restaurants, cafes, souvenir shops and a pharmacy within 2-3 minutes walk (including a FANTASTIC French cafe on the corner of the next intersection up from the hotel). We arrived by car at night, and the one-way street it's on is VERY busy--no place to park, even temporarily to check in. So we just threw on our hazard/parking lights and prayed for the best as other cars and buses swerved around us. There's no parking onsite, but they do have two options--one just a block away in a public garage and one that was further away (but cheaper). WARNING! If you choose the public garage that's close by, it is not a 24-hour garage--it closes at some reasonable hour (not sure when, probably 10 or 11pm) and doesn't open until some reasonable hour (I think it was 7am). That's very important if, like us, you have an early morning flight and need to be at the airport well before 7am. Fortunately the staff at the front desk were VERY good and pointed that out to us, so we got the car out before going to bed, parked it on a side street 2 blocks away overnight, and then got out of there so early we didn't have to plug any parking meters. Can't say enough about the whole reception staff, in fact....between asking enough questions to figure out the garage thing to getting online to check us in for our flight--and then the usual task of giving directions--they were great! Rooms are fairly standard, not too big, not too small. Our room (#406) faced a courtyard which was probably good from a noise standpoint (remember what I said about being on a very busy street), but it wasn't real great for scenery. Odd, as well, was the fact that our window was completely plexiglassed in. No way to open the window--because you could see the handle, but couldn't get to it because it was behind the plexiglass. Shower was nice, bed was OK....air conditioning worked fine (which you needed because the window wouldn't open).

It's near the corner of Goulburn and George Sts, very close to Chinatown. A bit of hike from the central CBD and the harbour. Well served for public transport with a bus stop right outside (don't forget to get a bus pass from a newsagent, you can't pay cash on Sydney buses). It's not that far to Town Hall station. Visitors to Sydney may find the area a little dodgy feeling - but it really is quite safe, though I would be careful walking around late at night, like in all cities. There is a Coles grocery store across the road. Make sure to ask for a quiet room - there are a lot of internal facing rooms for less noise (I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet my room was) There are more rooms than are evident from the street frontage, hidden in a maze of corridors, some with steps, so perhaps not ideal for the disabled. I stayed in a Petite Double, which is very petite ! But there are high ceilings so it feels OK - it's fitted out with a queen bed, a chest of draws and a bar fridge. There are no cupboards (so no ironing board or iron in the room, they do have a separate laundry though) - just hooks on the wall. There is no seating and the TV hangs from the ceiling. They have cable tv - BBC news, V, espn, Arena - but don't have any of the digital channels or SBS. My room was a little tired - some paint is peeling from the walls. The lighting is rather poor - very dim. It was difficult to read as there were also no reading lamps (I find this is a problem in many hotels, I guess it must save on electricity costs) The room is airconditioned - not adjustable, you're stuck on 20o which was not quite cool enough as it was very muggy weather when I stayed. There were 2 very big (if grubby) windows which you could open (mine looked over a lightwell onto a roof, had to keep the curtain shut for privacy). The bed is a little saggy, and the decor is a bit tired (or is it just the drap colour scheme?). The bathroom is really lovely - clean and new, with a good shower (good water pressure and hot water!) but like the room, poorly thought out. The toilet gets soaked when you are having a shower, as they placed the entry at the wrong end! The hotel has a nice shared lounge space with a tiny kitchen (eg microwave and sink) and a laundry. They have an arrangement for free entry to a Fitness First gym nearby (which is a much better option than an in-house gym which are often tiny and poorly equipped).

The room was very basic but OK, despite only having a view of the a/c units through very grimy windows The main issue was that we were a bit rushed when we checked out because we only just made the 10am check out deadline and I left my favourite necklace behind in the room. I realised in the taxi on the way back to our original hotel that I'd forgotten to put it on and immediately rang reception to ask if someone could retrieve it. The person on Reception was very sympathetic and said it hadn't been handed in but that she'd check with housekeeping. She rang back very quickly to say that she'd asked them to check but that it wasn't in the room. My husband explained that I had definitely left it there because I only ever take it off to go to bed - it has great sentimental value for me, although it wasn't a valuable piece of jewellery per se - but a further search apparently failed to find it. Despite several phone calls that day and the following couple of days it never did turn up, which upset me a great deal because I KNOW I left it behind in the room and we rang the hotel very soon after we left, and certainly before any other guest had checked into that room. The girl on Reception was very helpful and sympathetic but that didn't help me retrieve my precious necklace. The saddest thing about al of this is that it ruined my entire trip to Sydney and it's now the only vivid memory I have of my time in Australia.

Very large bathroom and shower, very big and comfy bed. In room safety deposit box, and the onsite laundry was a bonus too! Our only minor complaint about our room was the lack of drawers/shelves for storage, there was only a small wardrobe space. We had relatives staying in a Premium Petite Double too which was decorated in the same contemporary style but much smaller (although still had a huge bathroom/shower) so wouldn't recommend for travellers with lots of luggage - luckily our relatives are from Oz so only had small cases for their 3 night stay. Standard rooms did not appear to be decorated in the same style, a bit more basic, but communal areas were all styled well. You have to access the hotel via a doorway entrance on George Street, reception is on the first floor, we never had a problem with the lifts during our 5 night stay. The location of the hotel is fairly central, China Town on your doorstep, with lots of buses running up and down George Street - including the rare 555 free shuttle bus to the harbour! Town Hall underground station is only a short walk away, and is takes approx 15/20 minutes to walk up to the harbour with lots of shops on the way. A taxi up to the Harbour/Rocks was only 9 dollars. Darling Harbour is also within 10 mins walking distance. My only negative about the location was some of the 'adult' book shops close by on George Street, but don't let that put you off as we still felt it was a safe area and always busy. There is a fabulous little deli/cafe just up from the hotel on the corner of George Street/Goulburn Street that is great for breakfast and sandwiches, and seems to be open practically all day and is always busy! There's also a great little bottle shop next door.

Our room was tiny, so was our friends' - there are bigger rooms, but I guess you get what you pay for. Not that it was cheap over the New Year period. Security may be an issue. The lifts require your room key to access the floors, but if someone comes in the front door, they can walk up the stairs and are in the hotel.

The second occasion, the ne'er-do-well accepted my rejection, no doubt someone else let him in later. He did NOT belong there. Another time, my friend found a homeless person climbing the stairs to the 1st floor (2nd floor American) where reception is. He was asked to leave, but this must happen too often. Our friends were in 105, which is just at the top of the stairs as you enter. It is also above Charlie Chans' pub, which plays music loud and late.

However, they will ask if you are leaving cash, and then refuse to take the package if you say yes. So you have a choice of fibbing or not leaving cash. Another however - no receipt is given for the valuables, and to get them back, all you have to do is ask for your room number and you get that envelope back. No proof of you being in that room or anything. That needs to be rectified. Now the good things: It is near China Town, Darling Harbour, the free 555 bus to Circular Quay, and the Cheers pub, which shows the English Premier League matches. There is also a gym close by which you can use, as a guest of the hotel. There is a good breakfast place on George and Goulbourn Streets (NW corner) - La Francais - or something like that. The 3 Monkeys pub on George and Liverpool streets is a bit smarter than others near by. WiFi is AU$ 15 for a day's use - cheaper than many places, but not free. Boo. Minus points for that. Australia is particularly bad for not having free wifi. It is already an expensive place to visit, with the strength of their dollar, so AU$ 27.50 per day, which many place charge, is a bit steep.

There is a clean, airy, decent sized guest lounge which has a kitchenette and fridge for guests to use. There is also internet access in the lounge for a cost of $5.00 an hour. The accommodation is very comfortable and clean, and the building is well maintained. We can't fault the service we received from the staff who were more than helpful. We booked our room via a \"desperate for a bed for the night\" online agency and paid $90 for our double room with ensuite. The regular tariff starts at $95.00 a night. The Pensione is well located in George Street, not far from Chinatown and Darling Harbour. There is a bus stop very close by from where you can catch the free green metro bus which does a circuit of George Street and Elizabeth Street from Central Railway station to Circular Quay and back. Very handy to know about if you are trying to economise. We also bought multi tickets that allowed us to travel unlimited distances on the buses, trains and ferries. We saved a lot of money that way too. If we go back to Sydney, we would certainly look at staying at the Pensione again.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ballina", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great surprise\u201d", "Author": "WhenWeTravel", "ReviewID": "UR85530705", "Content": "Found this place at the last minute, and thought for the price and for one night it was worth the punt.

So here goes: I stayed there for a week in Nov 2009, thought the location was great and loved that the hotel was so modern and clean. Booked a double premium and realized that the windows didn't open, only air-conditioning for air circulation. I had checked in and left immediately to meet a friend for \"High Tea\" at the QVB, but mentioned in passing to Ross at reception that I would much prefer to have a room with opening windows, so my allergies won't act up. He was right on it and offered to move me into a different room right there. All said and done, I was in a different room and on the way to meet my friend within 20 minutes. Stayed there for the remainder of the week and had a great experience, checked out Saturday and got on a plane to Melbourne. Here's the kicker: On the plane I realized that I had left a credit card and my green card in the hotel safe in the first room. OMG! Called Ross as soon as I landed. He was incredibly sweet, told me that there wasn't much hope since the room had been occupied since, but that he would go up and look right now. Miracle - my stuff was still there!!! Ross then proceeded to make arrangements to have DHL ship it all to me to my hotel in Melbourne and called and kept me posted of his progress all the way. Then there was a mix-up with delivery (DHL's fault) and Ross was on the phone with them immediately to make sure I got everything back and was able to come home to the US without a problem. Thank you, Ross - you are gem!!! All in all, I will stay there again the next time I'm in Sydney and I hope Ross will one day get to run his own hotel, since he TRULY understands the meaning of the word \"customer service\".", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pulau Penang, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201c3-Minutes from Everything!\u201d", "Author": "leonbec", "ReviewID": "UR65230723", "Content": "Booked a Premium Triple during my recent trip - 3 Adults + a 2yr old toddler.

Sure the outside appearance and entry were a little offputting and our first experience of the lift was a little scary. However when we learnt how to operate it with our security card there was no problem. The room although small was spotless and the ensuite roomy and clean. There was a small frig and wardrobe and large security safe and also tea/coffee making facilities. The room was serviced daily. I had read about the noise but to be honest we never found that. We were one room back from the busy George St and the most noise we experienced was that of doors closing, partly because of the strong automatic closures. There was a roomy guest lounge with internet facilities(which I never used) and also a variety of lockers. Others had criticised the cost but it was not a problem to us and we found it very convenient to store our belongings between checkout and final departure. By far the greatest attraction to us was the location. We depended entirely on public transport and with a bus stop right outside the door and maximum waiting time for a bus about a minute was fantastic. There is a free CBD bus approx every ten minutes. We bought a seniors pass every day for 2.50 and that gave us unlimited transport all day on buses, trains and ferries. Would we go back, yes I think we would however the peak room rates would be too much and we would have to pick the season.

We paid $185 for a room which we thought was a good price point for a boutique; in return for that we got a tiny box of a room that was completely barren of comfort. dingy paint work, a rattly old window that allowed all of the noise of george street to penetrate. there is no bedside lamp so you have to turn the light off at the door and then stumble in the dark to your bed (bring a torch!). the bathroom was also tiny, with scratchy towels and no toiletries other than a piece of soap. there was one glass shelf next to the tiny sink, but it was on an angle so anything you put on it rolled off and fell on the tiled floor. seriously ick!! bad lighting, a TV that did not work, and no desk finished the furnishings. the lifts are extremely slow so that usually the stairs are the best option. we immediately tried to find another place to stay but Sydney seemed to be completely booked out for this saturday night so we were stuck. i used earplugs to keep the noise out, but woke up at 5.30am with a headache from the roar. we ended up checking out at 7am and heading home to Melbourne early because a nice-lie in was clearly not on the cards.

The price difference was rather significant and we were understandably upset cos we were told it was not available on booking. The receptionist at night, who was of asian origin, was very very unhelpful and rude about it. She raised her voice and said there was nothing that can be done about it and rudely instructed us to speak to the manager who will only be in the next morning. All the while, she just sounded very frustrated and kept raising her voice. It was as if she was the customer who was let down in the first place!! She just kept repeating the same answer and refuse to help us clarify our doubts, instead, just pushed everything to the morning. Breakfast offered is a joke. It's charged at AUD$8 or so and consists of a box of dry rations with cornflakes, muesli, a packet of milk etc. A poor backpacker who booked the breakfast option was stunned when handed 3 packs for his 3 day stay and when asked if he was meant to eat in the room, the receptionist just replied (loudly), \"we do not have a cafeteria\" belligerently. That said, the receptionist in the morning, a young asian girl, was utterly sweet, helpful and nice. She was far more professional and although had many people to handle, was unfailingly polite and helpful. Rooms wise, there was no closet for the standard room. Neither is there a fridge, tea/coffee making facilities. There was no window as well. Carpets were threadbare and room was plain with no decorations. Room was also so small that there was literally no space to put my luggage. The 'upgraded' room had pipes (the relatively big ones) running through them in the room.

On reading the reviews I was a bit nervous and brought this to the attention of the reception staff on arrival. He attempted to move us both but unfortunately could only move one room so I am fairly qualified to compare the two. Firstly, the reviews are right. The rooms along George Street are noisy 24/7 so make sure you ask in advance for one that is not along that side of the building! In saying that, my friends were moved the next day as soon as another room became available. The staff member was excellent. I travel to Sydney very often for work and stay in 5 star hotels. The cost per night of these range between $300 and $400 per night (corporate rate) and with the Pensione costing $120 per night it's important to keep that in perspective. The Good Things 1. The cost - $120 per night for a deluxe room in Sydney is pretty good 2. The location is very good for getting around. Buses, trains and light rail all on your doorstep 3. It has a guest kitchen and laundry (good for longer stays) 4. The tea, coffee and guest soaps were good quality (not the dodgy cheap hotel stuff) 5. The room was modern, clean and air conditioned (Daiken - which is very quiet) The Bad Things 1. If you are in a room on George Street, it is very noisy 2. If you are hoping to see the Sydney icons from your bedroom window, you will be disappointed 3. The rooms are VERY small. They were fine for us as we travel light, but those who travel with massive suitcases will find it very tight 4. The TV is too high and you can't watch it without getting a sore neck Conclusion If you are a first time visitor to Sydney and have visions of seeing the opera house, harbour bridge and bondi beach from your hotel (or nearby) this is NOT the place for you. This end of Sydney is NOT what you see in the tourist brochures. Spend the extra money and stay closer to Circular Quay. However, If you are happy to use the transport system, want a good, private room for a good price then consider the Pensione. If I was travelling to Sydney for a holiday I would consider staying there again.

This was our first trip to Sydney and getting on in age I like to plan things down to the most minute detail. We constantly we at the reception desk asking questions, my wife said I was pestering the staff but not once did I get the impression that I was imposing. On arriving back into the hotel each day we were always greeted with questions about how our day was and this was a fantastic way to share our experiences. In fact the staff were so great we had to take photos to take home and show the family and put in the album as these lovely young people really did deserve to be remembered as part of our holiday. Don't worry about the hotel - its clean and central.

I think we thought that it would be luxury at a budget price. It wasn't. But it was still nice. Our room was small, and had a fridge. But I did find the fact that there wasn't bed side lamps annoying as you had to turn the big light off and get in bed in the dark! The decor is nice and the bed is quite soft with only one pillow each. I would expect the reception staff would have provided more if we had asked. We didn't have a chair, although the only thing i use a chair in hotel rooms for is to chuck my clothes on. There was a small comfy stool though. There was no wardrobe either, but we lived out of our bags. The $7 breakfast seemed a bargain from their website, but it is just a small box of cereal, a small carton of juice and some milk. I think I had in my head continental at croissants and jam and fresh bread!! We found the hotel to be a 30-35 minute walk from the rocks and 10-15 minutes from darling harbour (we walk quite quickly), but there is a bus stop right outside and nearly every bus goes to the rocks or circular quay. The area is busy at night, but we didn't find it excessively noisy. Out room was quiet and had a window although it was around a courtyard not getting much light. There was a telephone to dial directly into our room although my mum tried calling a couple of times and the line was dead. We did not investigate this any further. We arrived early around midday and our room was ready and we found the receptionist quite helpful. Our room was on the 2nd floor but there were tonnes of steps to carry our heavy bags up. There was a lift but we were impatient and it was quite slow. The bath room was really nice and tiled. Quite trendy. But it was lacking in a tooth brush holder and the shower door nearly came off of it's rails the first time i triend to use it. This was reported to reception. It didn't seem to be fixed during our stay so we just had to be careful opening and closing it. All in all a nice place, clean, comfortable and everything we could need - we only sleep in hotel rooms, there's far too much to do in sydney!", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Territory", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5186688", "Content": "We made the mistake of hiring a car when we arrived in Sydney airport. When we arrived at the hotel it became apparent that the car was going to be more of a hinderance then a help. The hotel location is perfect - it's walking distance to Darling Harbour and the CBD and for anything else there is a bus stop just outside the door. The rooms are very clean and tidy and the bathrooms are very trendy. One thing to note is that whilst the rooms are clean and comfortable they are light on the ameneties - there is a wardrobe, fridge, TV (mounted on a bracket from the roof) tea/coffee, lamp, hairdryer, air conditioning. You can tell this hotel is geared for the traveller that is not intending to spend a lot of time in the room. In saying this there is a great area towards the back of the hotel that is very open with lounges, internet, laundry and small kitchenette with all the crokery and cutlery you would need. We chose this hotel after a recommendation from a friend that stayed just after they opened some 18 months ago. For the money your asked to pay, considering this is a central Sydney hotel, I would stay again. If you are looking at this hotel then please take into account my comments on ammenties.
