(Had to check out to have a fee removed from my bill.) Rooms were clean, spacious, carpeting could use a deep clean but otherwise, fine. Hotel is near two Walgreens - in case you forgot something on your cruise. Many restaurants are within walking distance but Old San Juan is about an hour's walk away. (Cabs are very expensive and I think they were $20 to get back from OSJ to the hotel.) Take the bus if you have the time. Did not use the casino but walked through it. No craps table but they did have roullette, blackjack and slots. Smoking is not allowed in hotel or casino but smokers can go outside or smoke off their patio. Did not eat at the restaurant...noticed prices were a bit expensive. Cab from this hotel to Pan Am Pier is about $15 (2 adults, 2 bags.)

Can't comment on the Casino because I did not try it. The number of vagrants in Condado seems to have increased quite a bit in the past few years.

Reasonable prices; good location; and good amenities. However, the staff of this hotel really turned me against the Radisson brand... in Puerto Rico at least. If you're a traveler who likes spending a lot of time in the hotel, you will be disappointed with the Radisson Ambassador. However, since this hotel is smack in the middle of Condado, you will be able to explore and see much more of San Juan than you might otherwise would. This hotel is old, and I don't mean old in a charming way, but old in a \"this was once a great hotel... in 1962\" way. Everything has this 70's/80's kitsch that I can't really put my finger on. It's also pretty clear what this hotel is about - providing somewhat cheap rooms for tourists as well as a gambling establishment for nearby residents. There is NO lobby in this hotel - just a casino, which was obviously shoehorned into the hotel's 1st floor. One day for breakfast we decided to try the hotel restaurant - do avoid at all costs. Our ridiculously overpriced breakfast was little more than stale muffins, donuts, and pastries (at least the edible part of the meal). There were also eggs and sausage, but I couldn't stomach those items. I did manage to visit the spa, but was grossly disappointed. I had made an appointment for 6 PM (the last slot of the day) because I wanted to be out in time to grab dinner and drinks afterward. I showed up on time, but still had to wait nearly 30 minutes. The massage and facial I received were brutal. My face was red for over a day and I somehow left the massage in more pain. Definitely avoid! Probably the worst part of this hotel was the casino. My group was treated very poorly by the casino employees and I was shocked at how unwilling to be hospitable they really were. Normally, at the tables, servers will bring you any assortment of drinks and snacks that you might want (after all, you are throwing your money at them). I ordered a Cuba libre (nothing complicated: rum, coke, and lime) and they acted as if I was asking for the key to the casino vault! I was kindly informed by the pit boss that all they could offer me was ONE local beer(the kind that's $1 a bottle at any outside bar) even though I had been sitting at the table for a couple of hours that night and the nights before. This really miffed me as I had seen other patrons (supposedly locals) order drinks like Pina Coladas and Daiquiris and offered snacks and sandwiches. Lesson for hoteliers: Don't think you can treat visitors poorly... especially the ones with internet connections.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for pre/post cruise stop over!\u201d", "Author": "LadyHeineken", "ReviewID": "UR127993922", "Content": "First off, I read ALL of the reviews before booking our one night stay.

There are always cabs available as soon as you walk out the door. Both times i stayed there, it was part of the ambassador club. With that i also got access to the club which offered a free buffet style breakfast with all the basics - oatmeal, bread, bagels, pastries, fruits and yogurts. If u r a coffee drinker use the coffeemaker in your room or go the starbucks two blocks away as the buffet breakfast offers crappy coffee dispense from a coin machine straight out of a 1970 hospital. They aso offer light snacks @ 5.30 but i was never there at that time. I also got a coupon for a free drink and a coupon to use at the casino. The hotel itself has been renovated but you cant hide that its been around. The rooms are clean, staff helpful and pleasant. For those looking to be right on the beach this is not your hotel as it is a block or so from the beach. There is a small and clean rooftop pool and a small fitness center. There is also a salon and restaurant. The food is not bad there but the portions could b bigger given their prices. The casino and lounge areas are also small. As a club carson member u also get free wifi in your room. This hotel is for people who don't want to spend all their money on a room.

I have been to San Juan several times and this time I decided to stay here as I have stayed at several Radisson hotels in Canada and expected a certain standard--the most appealing being that the complete hotel was designated as non-smoking. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was in the elevator and in a standard room. It was huge (photos will show-- Rooms 1 and 3 were the same layout and design), clean, comfortable beds plus a balcony. The view was not great but still it was nice to sit outside. I also like the fact that the AC unit was new and built into the wall for easy control (this would play a bigger role later). I unpacked and then decided to put my valuables in the safe and it would not work. Thinking that I was doing something wrong I called the front desk and they were very prompt with sending up a maintenance person. He was not able to fix it so within a few minutes the day guest services manager was there to apologize and to give me a key to a suite one floor below. I packed up again and moved to the suite. It was large, had a living room and a nice little hallway to provide separation to the bedroom. There was a balcony there too with even a worse view, but it was fine. I did notice that the suite seemed to be in a section of the building that might be older because the furniture and carpets did not seem to be so fresh and new as the standard room that I was in. With a working safe and being unpacked again, off I went to have dinner and explore. Issue: the one thing that was different in the suite as opposed to the standard room was the HVAC system was not individual like the standard rooms but instead a system of ductwork. Normally, this would not be an issue, however around 3am I woke up because I could not breathe---second hand smoke was seeping into the ventilation. I went to the front desk but at that hour there was nothing they could do so there I was at 3:30 walking on the beach alone---it was either personal safety vs not being able to breathe. The next morning though, to give the hotel credit, they were very open to me moving back to a standard room. Though I thanked them for the flexibility I still had to voice concerns that a published non-smoking hotel would allow smoking. The answer I got was that they needed visual proof that someone was smoking in the room. I completely disagree with that and the approach taken by hotels eleswhere is that if there is the smell of smoke in the room, visual proof or not, a cleaning fee would be added to the credit card. It seems to work everywhere else but not in San Juan it appears. Thankfully, I was only there for a few days and went off to Miami. I would consider this place again but only on the condition that I could have a written confirmation that I would be placed in a standard room with the individual AC, not the duct system, so that I would be able to breathe again.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood location but average for cost\u201d", "Author": "Svenara", "ReviewID": "UR122317384", "Content": "The hotel is located in the excellent neighbourhood of Condado in San Juan.

Now coming the hotel itself, it was average for the cost paid. The carpet was old and it felt unclean. I smelled strong disinfectants in the bathroom. The bathroom as such was clean. On day one when I checked in, the bathroom was stocked with a shampoo, conditioner, and two soaps. Since I have long hair, I managed to finish my shampoo on day one itself and noticed that the hotel had not replenished the tolieteries the next day. I specifically asked the hotel cleaning staff for a shampoo and they told me that they were out of supply and it will take one week for them to be brought in. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The TV was old and there wasnt much to watch (unless you paid it). The room had a hair dryer (took me a while to plug in) as it was rusty!! On day 3, all of a sudden, while I was sleeping, the room alarm started ringing (5.15 am). I had never touched the alarm and neither had requested for a wake up.

It's an old building, so you get the \"small\" bathrooms, but they are nicely upgraded with marble, tile, mirrors. Every staff member we encountered was courteous & helpful. In the best area of Condado, within walking distance of many bars, outdoor-seating restaurants, coffee shops, fast-food chains, shopping etc. Easy bus or taxi ride to Old San Juan if you don't have a car. On-site parking, but not sure of the cost. Remember, San Juan has an aggressive parking-enforcement program, so you stand a very good chance of getting a ticket if the meter is expired ($35), or you are parked improperly --- even though it looks like everyone is doing it.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edgewood, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER\u201d", "Author": "2Mari", "ReviewID": "UR120440285", "Content": "I made a reservation at this hotel for one night so that we could be closer to the airport for our return flight to Florida.

Shortly thereafter, it was our turn. The agent informed us that we could have checked in upstairs given that we booked an Ambassador Level room, (use the elevator bank to the left of the casino entrance, floor 9 or penthouse/pool level). After lunch at Orozco's, a 10 minute walk away, we checked in at the Ambassador Level Desk at 1 pm. We noticed a long line in the lobby but the check-in process upstairs was seamless. Check out the next day was quick and efficient. Again, there was a long line at the lobby dessk. We had friends who stayed in a regular room on the second floor. They were not impressed. Our room on the 8th floor was recently renovated and comfortable. In short, in our opinion, paying $25 extra for the Ambassador Level was well worth it.

Apparently a lot of people have never been away from their cocoon of a town in the 50 states. I've stayed at the Ritz and I've stayed in Old San Juan but this was my first and definitely not my last stay in Condado. The neighborhood is fabulous. Turn left as you leave the Radisson and you will be in a more local Puerto Rican area. Turn right and you will be in the area catering to tourists. Our room was immaculate, large and fresh. My bed was comfortable. We had a regular king room on the ambassador club level. The views up here were great. We could see the city, the mountains and the sea. No, it's not beach front but it's only 1 block to a public beach where you can bring your own towel to sit. Or you can turn right and walk 3 or 4 blocks just past the Marriott, turn right, and go a block to the beach and rent a lounge chair for $3. How can anyone judge a hotel on the clients who are staying there any given night? That's ridiculous. Our first night found a lively, variable aged group of American's and Puerto Ricans enjoying live music in the lounge. There was a lot of drinking, dancing and having a good time. The next night was much quieter but there was still live music. We walked through the casino even though we don't gamble. It was a lot larger and more sprawling than I expected with rooms flowing into other rooms. There was something for everyone. We were given early check in just past noon with no problem by Luis at the front desk who was very polite. He was professional and I enjoyed giving him a wave each time we passed by his desk. Yes, he smiled back. The rooftop pool was clean and perfect. We went in the water and enjoyed visiting with other guests who told us how much they liked their stay here, too. Luis gave us some great dining suggestions. We ate at one place twice because the food was great and also a really good value. You'll find 2 walgreens and 2 starbucks within easy walking distance - one in each direction. Yes, you will see a few homeless people. Very few. Very harmless. And WAY less than you will ever see in the greatest city in the USA - San Diego, CA. We gave one man a pie we bought from a charity and he was so polite he thanked us and immediately ate it. You will see homeless people in every city in the USA. But you won't see streets this clean in most of them. This is a country of character. Be open minded about your travels. Our breakfast in the ambassador's club was very nice and had everything we wanted. Some people even enjoyed waffles, out of the toaster, but still it's offered. The bar in the evening was an honor bar. You make your own and fill out your own ticket. It was well stocked. Our bathroom was small but very functional with great counterspace. The lighting in the bathroom and in the bedroom was better than any hotel I've been in. Ladies should like this. The coffee maker actually had it's own little counter space outside of the bathroom. Many hotels these days are putting it right in the bathroom which to me isn't the most sanitary of places to keep your coffee and cups. This hotel does it right. Every room has a balcony so even if you don't want to pay extra for a high floor with a better view, you can at least step out to see what's going on around you. We had a sweet and cheerful housekeeper who gave us extra caffeinated coffee for the asking since they normally only leave one single serving of each type in the room. We don't drink decaf. Our AC was good and cold. There are loads of electrical outlets in the room which made it easy to charge up all our electronics at once. The wifi worked perfectly on all our devices, (iphones, ipad and netbook) and faster than most hotels. We liked having a safe which still some hotels are lacking. They even gave us each a free bar drink and bottled water daily which may just be because we were on the club floor. You can rent a car from hertz right next door. If you aren't daring enough for authentic Puerto Rican food, you'll find Burger King, Subway and Fuddruckers all either right next door or within a couple of blocks. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I've never stayed at a Radisson before but after this experience, I'd happily book another one. You really should disregard all of the unfounded complaints you've read previously. I'm really picky and a neat freak and the Radisson met my unusually high standards. We've been out of the states plenty and appreciate the cultures of others and Puerto Rico is definitely not an extreme or frightening culture.

Assuming that this is for cleaning would be wrong. We stayed here two days; one before and one after a cruise. Unfortunately, we prepaid with no refund, or we would not have stayed the second night. The first night we were exhausted after 12 hours of travel and because of meeting with friends we didn't screw around with the staff. We just kept our shoes on in the room. The carpeting in the room was so wet you would think they were vacuuming with a mop and bucket. They have coffee machines in the room but they are designed for two individual cups of coffee. They only leave one regular and one decaf coffee packet (you need one per cup) and no creamers (dry or otherwise). On our second night at THREE O'CLOCK and not one minute before we were given our room; this time a suite. The sheets were badly stained and ripped. The coffee cups were not clean. One had lipstick and the other had semi dry coffee in the bottom. We went down to the front desk and stood in line (despite no one else being there) until the staff chose to acknowledge us. This is a very common thing at this hotel. All of the staff seems to have something better to do or talk about then customer service. We showed the desk manager the cups and complained about the sheets. He called over the housekeeping manager and she wrote down our complaint and took the cups. We went out and after dinner returned to our room. They returned the two cups to the room. Only the lipstick had been wiped off-the cups were still dirty (quite sure they were the same cups). The sheets had not been touched and were still disgusting and so now it was back down stairs to wait in a line of one. We were told the only thing they can now do is move us to another floor. So we packed up and moved two floors up. The carpet in this room was also wet in places. The sheets were still torn but less stained (definitely not hotel quality and according to the note markered on them they were new in 2008 when Radisson took over). Over the years I have stayed in some low end motels for business and this place ranked with them at twice the price. They claim free Wi-Fi but it is spotty at best (good reception in the restaurant or front desk). The restaurant staff was actually good although the breakfast buffet needs work. The hotel appears to need major repairs, the satellite cable connections to room are in need of an overhaul and it is two blocks from a second rate beach. The outside noise is constant (think staying in New York). They had a band in the bar that was playing at volume that would rival a Who concert (not great for a bar only 10 feet wide).

The taxi ride from the airport to the hotel was brief, but did not look like any place where a hotel should be. We stepped into the lobby, which was narrow and dim, to learn that our room did not include a refrigerator. The next morning at breakfast we paid $15 a plate at the \"breakfast buffet\" for less than stellar scrambled eggs and yogurt. This led to daily trips to the nearby Walgreen's where we purchased food that did not need to be microwaved or refrigerated, because neither contraptions were available to us during our stay. Each trip led to us being bothered and followed by at least two homeless people in a short distance of only two blocks. The description on the Radisson's website claims that the hotel is only a block away from the beach. It fails to mention that this beach is also plagued with homeless people, covered halfway with rocky shoreline, and is not large enough to even sunbathe.

I did not go to the beach at night but was warned not to. Downside: The lobby and the room (other than the bath) felt like Las Vegas in the 70s. Gold highlights, glitzy fixtures, and just plain old.

However, the staff doesn't have much to work with in terms of a property. I really wish we had paid a little more for a better location and a nicer hotel. When we arrived at the hotel there were 2 people in the check-in line ahead of us. When we finally got to the desk about 25 minutes later, we were informed that housekeeping did not yet have our room ready. It was 10:30 p.m! The man behind the desk said that he could give us a different room but that it would be directly over the casino and we would hear the casino all night. (I was grateful that he warned us of this fact.) So, we decided that we would wait in the bar for 30 minutes as our room was readied. We were immediately given a voucher for 2 free drinks at the bar, which I thought was quite nice. When we arrived at the room, it was just strange. It was supposed to have been a \"Microwave Executive One Bedroom Suite.\" There was a division between the \"living\" area and the sleeping area, but there was no microwave and, as far as I could tell, no place for one. There were two closets, one in each area, but there were no hangers in the closet in the living area and only 8 hangers in the other. Definitely not enough hangers for 2 people to unpack. The \"living\" area had a desk and chair, and then one side chair. There was a TV in this room, but it wasn't really a comfortable place for TV viewing. All in all, the space was just strange and dark. The furnishings had also seen better days. But, the worst part was the smell. The entire hotel was supposedly non-smoking, but the room smelled like it had been smoked in....a lot. It was also kind of damp and musty smelling, so much so that I really wanted to go out and buy some air freshener or something. But I didn't. I just dealt with it. The bathroom was pretty beaten up as well. The flooring tile was cracked and the toilet was leaking on the floor. The location was really strange as well. It is a block or two from the beach, but it doesn't feel like it. Our room was on the second floor, so the street noise was annoying when we were trying to sleep. We checked in on a Thursday night, which wasn't too loud, but Friday and Saturday nights were a different story. All night long there was shouting, singing, clapping, etc. in the street outside the room. We investigated and found that there was a Burger King with a drive-through directly across the street from our room. We had not been aware of this since our balcony was angled away from the BK and toward the ocean (though we couldn't see it either for all the run-down buildings between it and the hotel).

Rooms: We requested a room on a high floor to avoid the noise noted by others and ended up on the 8th floor. One night we could hear someone snoring in another room - but other than that - no noise issues. We had a partial view of the ocean blocked somewhat by other buildings. The room was smaller than I expected, but it was clean and did not smell funny. We noticed the A/C was broken - but after a long trip we decided to wait until morning to bring it to the attention of the front desk. The next day we left early and did not return until the afternoon. When we came back the A/C was fixed, but it was not properly linked to the wall unit, so we had to manually turn it on and off at the base. Not a huge issue for us. The shower at times in the morning goes in and out of water pressure/heat, but not to the extent I had to jump out of the shower.

I've read some really great reviews of the Marriott (which is more expensive) and I wasn't really that impressed by it in person - they also did a poor job of handling my friend's wedding making several critical errors in planning and reservations.

Seventh-floor suite overlooked the parking lot, a source of entertainment as gamblers stumbled to their cars. Breakfast was fine, but there was no regular coffee available, only specialty brews (latte, espresso) from a machine. Odd. Location in Condado is great, with bus stop and restaurants nearby. Staff are outstanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheerful, helpful and polite. Two negatives: room thermostat kept resetting to 68 (too cold) and the bathroom had no fan or air inlet.

We had spend 4 previous nights in another part of the island and wanted to stay near San Juan for two days prior to our departure. I booked via hotels.com and was able to get a non smoking room (king bed) on the fifth floor for $93/night plus taxes (came out to $234 total for two nights). Pros: Convenient location -- 7 minute drive to Old San Juan, 15 minute drive to airport. Rooms were clean, nothing fancy, but fully functional. We had a small balcony (not really used) which faced the parking lot. From my observation the only rooms that would have a beach view would be the top floor rooms with views towards thebeach but even those I believe would only be a partial view of the beach which is 1 block away from the hotel. Easy walk to convenience store both locally ownned ones and national chains (Walgreens). One complimentary drink ticket per individual in your room (not bad since drinks run about $5.50/piece). On Friday night there was a very good spanish (latin salsa and merengue) band in the hotel cabaret area (near casino) which provided some great music until 4:00AM -- so you don't need to go anywhere to be entertained, but be warned the cabaret area with dance floor is small and crowded (we got there at 1100PM and stayed for about 1.5hrs. Cons: Ok, the area around Ashford Ave where the hotel is out are going through a transition phase so don't expect this to look like the French Riviera....it is not necessarily the \"hood\" as another reviewer wrote but you can see signs of graffity in many of the real estate properties (both old hotels and former commerical sites that are no longer in business). There will be the 1 homeless guy per block, but did not feel like they were a bother and did not hassle us as we walked both in the AM and evenings. Plenty of police presence patrolling the local area so I was not concerned for the safety of my wife and I as we strolled though the local blocks. The city of San Juan (or maybe this is part of Santurce (Condado) need to re-invest some money in to the upkeep of the infrastructure (bus stops, garbage cans, etc....) to make sure the place looks presentable to visitors...Hotel staff -- fron desk lady that checked me in was friendly but I can not say the samething about all employees we encountered...totally different than what I had just experienced at Dorado Embassy Suites, where everyone greeted you regardless of the time of day. There was no offer from bellhop to bring bags up to the room, which I could certainly have used. Hotel management should address this with their staff, a little reminder of customer service. Lobby area is tight as you check in with the casino being just a few feet away from it. Parking was ok at a self rate of $12.00. If I had to do it all over again, I would not get a rental car and simply take the bus or a taxi to go to Old San Juan ($15.00 each way), and to the airport (about same rate).", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Battle Ground, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGood location and Nice rooms\u201d", "Author": "whawk", "ReviewID": "UR66543880", "Content": "Only stayed (1) night on the 6th floor as part of the ambassador club room group.

We reserved online using CitiBank \"Thank You\" points, requesting an Ambassador Level room. After taking the glass elevator up to the top floor, we checked in and went down one floor to our room. The room was quite spacious and clean looking, with a good sized bathroom, expected modern amenities (individually controlled air-conditioning, built-in safe in the closet), plus a private balcony facing west. It offered glimpses of the beach a block a way (but there were occasional hi-rises blocked preventing unobstructed views). Still, the first night provided us with a gorgeous sunset from our balcony. The room was tidy and the bedding was crisp and clean. My biggest complaints with the room were that the carpet (though looking fairly new and unfaded) was buckling in spots. The other problem was with the hot water. On the first and second day, things were fine. But the last two days of the trip would find us with either limited hot water, or nearly no water pressure at all. It was all rather random so another shower an hour later would be fine. It wasn't a huge hassle for us, but if you're in a hurry to check out or catch a flight and want to be showered first, be warned. The common areas of the hotel were also nice. The long common corridors were broken up nicely with with mirrors, patterened carpet, and lighting. Staying in the Ambassador level also gave us access to the Ambassador Lounge on the roof level. This provided us with daily free breakfast (cereal, waffles, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurt, assorted juices, coffe/tea). In addition, every afternoon they offered free hot hors d'ouvres. Additinonally, upon check-in we received two free rum-based drinks from one of the hotel bars. Also on the roof of the building was a small, clean pool. On the ground floor of the property were a few bars and a popular casino. Despite the popularity and crowds downstairs, our hotel room was perfectly quiet. The location was also a key reason to stay at the Radisson Ambassador. It's located right on popular Ashford Street, where you'll find restaurants and shops. Around the corner you'll find Condado Beach. It's a smaller beach, with rougher waves, but was still quite nice (and has a gay section, if that's what you're looking for). Additionally, a short walk in the other direction brings you to Ocean Park Beach, which is much more expansive (and with slightly calmer seas).

I was lucky to be placed on the 7th floor, away from the casino/bar, and with a partial ocean view (peeking between other buildings) from the small balcony. I had free internet via cable (may only be for the suites). But as I said, don't expect a resort. The lobby is cramped considering the size of the hotel (the space is given to the casino), the color theme in the hallways is brown, and the room was also darkish (in my case the room was divided into 2 parts since it was a suite, and that also made the room darker). The rooftop swimming pool was decent size, good for sunbathing. No greenery at all. The beach is just 1 block away (2 counting from the hotel entrance on Ashford Av). Condado is a good beach, not the most chich since it's a public beach with a real mix of people. The rooftop hotel gym was, as expected, small. Newish machines, but few. There was a good size gym located about 5 blocks away in Ashford Av - called \"International\". Just go out the hotel entrance and take a right. They charge USD 15 for a daypass and have plenty of (oldish) machines. The beach is just outside. In summary, I think the Radisson was pretty good value, but lacked in charm.", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel, lacks modern facilities\u201d", "Author": "andrewclauer", "ReviewID": "UR25991882", "Content": "I stayed at the Ambassador for 16 nights during a business trip in late February/early March. I selected this hotel exclusively due to low rate that I found through radisson.com ($135/night). I have stayed at many other hotels in the Isla Verde/Condado/Old San Juan area on previous trips, and while my opinion of the Ambassador is certainly tainted by some of the other nicer properties (El San Juan, Marriott Stellaris, Intercontinental, Embassy Suites), the Radisson has a good location (though not beach-front) and again, represents a good value. I was fortunate to end up in one of their two-room suites, which provided ample room to live/work during the trip. The room itself was generally clean, and offered a small balcony (as do all rooms, I believe); however, the balcony overlooked the large surface parking lot. I am not a hotel expert (though I do spend 100+ nights per year in them), but this property strikes me as having such potential to be a great place. Unfortunately, that transformation from OK to great would require a large implosion and several hundred million dollars to affect. The good: location right on Ashford in Condado. Price. Room size (at least the suites). The staff were all friendly, helpful and pleasant. Everyone from front desk staff to the housekeepers. The just OK: The hotel is older. Its facilities are older, including the casino (which appears to mostly cater to the local crowd). The \"gift shop\" is old, rundown, is not affiliated with the hotel itself (can't charge to the room) and lacks any real selection. Room service was marginal, with food presentation poor. The property has an expansive surface parking lot (and small 2-3 story garage area) which is completely packed on certain nights (Thursday, Friday, Saturday). People park all over the place, blocking others in (and the valets stick cars everywhere too). This causes a lot of unhappy people when they was out of the casino 4 hours later, which invariably results in yelling, a lot of horn honking, etc. I have have noticed this more since my room was on the 5th floor, directly overlooking this ritual. I would consider staying here again for the same price while on a long business trip. If you're in town and don't want to spend a lot of money, and don't mind walking a block to the beach, this hotel is a good choice. If you're looking for fully modern amenities and big, exciting casino, there are better choices in the area.

I had read some bad reviews here and was slightly nervous about my pick but overall the hotel was just what I expected it to be! The taxi from the airport was $16. We checked in at the lower lobby without a problem. We had read that we could check in upstairs at the Ambassador Club but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t busy so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about that. We had a one bedroom suite in the Ambassador Club. The living room had a seating area, desk, TV, sink, and small fridge. The bedroom had a sleep number bed and another TV. The bathroom was a decent size. We never had turn down service with chocolates or the robes that are advertised but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother asking for these services. From our balcony we could see the ocean in a couple spots and actually could see the ocean from our bed. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was not fancy at all but all I was looking for was a somewhat roomy place to stay in close to Old San Juan with a refrigerator. The hotel was pretty clean. The nightly happy hour is from 5:30-8:30 with some appetizers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheese, veggies, small sandwiches and a hot breaded ham and cheese something. The drinks are on an honor system so you pour them yourselves and record what you drink. The manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special is on Thursday from 5-8pm (the book in the room says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Wednesday). Free drinks and about twice as much food including a pasta dish and salmon pieces. This was the one time we saw the Ambassador Club crowded! We just came back from the beach and were the most down dressed people there! The continental breakfast in the Ambassador Club included cold cereal, fresh fruit, cooked oatmeal, bagels, and muffins. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a coffee machine with good cappuccinos and lattes! The deal I booked on Radisson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website included two eggs cooked any way and choice of breakfast meat. The two desk clerks I talked to didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what I was talking about. I probably could have talked to a manager but instead I called my travel agent and she straightened everything out for us. Somehow it got us access to the full buffet (which cost $13) in the Grill which was pretty good. It annoyed me that the deal that was advertised was difficult to get. Remember to PRINT out a copy for your records \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to prove to the hotel workers what you are supposed to get! The pool at the roof level was pretty cool! We took towels from the pool area with us to the beach multiple days. The lounge bar had people in it most every night. There was live entertainment every evening. Apparently this is where locals come for a casino and entertainment. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a concierge in the hotel which disappointed me. The operator, Mannie, was helpful with restaurant ideas and provided a map with many restaurants and other businesses listed on it. There was also a tour desk which was manned by a Sunshine tour representative. We booked a tour through the rep to the BioBay in Fajardo. We were transported to Fajardo in a 15 person van and kayaked thru mangroves to a lagoon. Here the little critters in the water glow when disturbed! Very cool! The thing I liked the best about this hotel was it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s LOCATION!!! The Condado area was a great place to be for a week. We tried three different beaches within walking distance of this hotel and each one was better than the next. The small beach which is the closest was the first one we hit. Pretty rocky and very small. The next beach we went to was about a mile walk away on Ashford Ave, the Condado Bridge Beach. There were rocks blocking the waves from the beach and made the beach very calm. There was a bit of seaweed farther into the bay but a great beach with plenty of water to play in. We rented beach chairs for $4 each and had a great afternoon here. The last beach we went to was by the Marriott. We accessed the beach on the street just past the Marriott. It was a nice long beach with fun waves. Rented beach chairs here for $3 each. This was the best beach of the three we went to. The restaurants in Condado were also great! We went to Yerba Buena (good mojitos), and Mmmo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Argentinan Grill (try the combo that includes eight types of meats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the sangria was great!), and Danny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (good pizza). We also went to Bangkok Bombay (a Thai & Indian place), and Ikakos (great seafood). My favorite restaurant was Bebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place where the locals go and looks like a big cafeteria. The Mofongo here was awesome! Mofongo is mashed plantain with seafood or chicken mixed in. All these restaurants were no more than a 10 minute walk away from the Radisson. There is also a Burger King, Subway and Starbucks close by for those that want familiar food. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find too much nightlife in this area but Old San Juan is only a $12 cab ride away and it sounded like there was tons of nightlife there. Condado is a mostly residential location. There are more condos than hotel rooms in this area. It was great eating outside a restaurant and seeing people walking their dogs, going for a run (lots of runners), or taking the baby for a walk. There were only a couple of panhandlers and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bothersome at all. I felt very safe walking along Ashford Ave all day and night. I am most definitely going back to San Juan and plan to stay in the Condado area. I might stay in the Radisson if a good deal is being offered. All in all the Radisson is a decent, basic hotel. It was clean, the people working were nice enough, the hotel bar had entertainment every night, the breakfast was OK and the pool was cool. The Radisson is NOT a resort!

The hotel is constructed in such a way that many things simply do not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd physically. One selling point for the Ambassador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club is private check-in and check-out but this is done on the top floor of a separate tower. The swimming pool and billiards room are also located in a separate tower. We expected that at the very least they would provide a written explanation of where things were located on the property but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. This made for a frustrating stay to say the least. Overall, we felt we paid far too much money for what we received. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at much cheaper hotels with nicer accommodations and better service. Checkout was a zoo and the clerk was not the least bit concerned that we were dissatisfied. We were scheduled to stay at the Radisson on our way back from Dominica but changed our hotel. Completely separate from the Radisson, the location is outstanding. There are several stores and some great restaurants within walking distance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be sure to check out Yerba and the Asian Fusion restaurant down the street. The local bus (Number 21) costs only 75 cents and goes to Old San Juan. If you feel like walking about an hour, you can walk to Old San Juan. The beach is a couple of blocks from the hotel. We strolled along the main street at night and never felt threatened in terms of safety. There were always tourists and joggers out and about. We do not recommend the Radisson but do highly recommend this area of San Juan.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOkay, But Ready To Try Someplace Else\u201d", "Author": "BHL", "ReviewID": "UR13608888", "Content": "I stayed here for six nights in February '08. I booked my reservation directly with the hotel and had a suite on a concierge floor. Part of the attraction was that the package included complimentary continental breakfast, and also an honor bar/happy hour. When I arrived for check-in, I was told I that because I had an Ambassador Club reservation, I should check in upstairs in the club, located on the penthouse level. Unfortunately, I wasn't directed to the proper elevator bank, so it took me a while to find the right place. There a woman was waiting with the key to my room. I'd been told downstairs that she would explain all of the amenities due to me, but she had little to say, and only answered my questions with as short a reply as she could muster. Not my best first impression. Also, it seemed counter-productive to send me up to the penthouse to check in, only to have to go back downstairs to my room, all the while toting my luggage. I stayed in a mini-suite on the 7th floor. The living room had a TV, desk and chair, two arm chairs with an ottoman, a fridge and wet bar with a complimentary bottle of water. The front room had no windows and was rather dark, but the bedroom was bright and sunny, with ocean views off the balcony, another TV, a loveseat, a king-sized sleep number bed, and plenty of storage space. I found the decor rather staid, though, brown tweeds and greens, not the brighter, more tropical color scheme I would have expected. Nevertheless, everything was clean and seemed to be in working order, and I loved sitting on the balcony in the evenings listening to the sound of the coqui. It was convenient having plenty of cabs lined up outside the hotel whenever I needed to go anywhere. There are plenty of restaurants of a nice variety within walking distance, and Ashford Avenue is sort of the main drag in Condado for restaurants. However, if you're looking for souvenir shops this is not the place to be. The beach is only about a block and a half away, but there were high surf warning signs posted, and I saw only a few people on the sand. Also, the winds were so strong it was almost unpleasant to be down there. I tried the happy hour the first night. You fill out your own bill, which then gets added to your room charge. The bar is moderately stocked, and it's all do-it-yourself. Mixed drinks were somewhere around $4.25, but I paid $2.25 just for a small bottle of ginger ale. The hors d'oeuvre were nothing to write home about: some cheese cubes with crackers, crudites, and one hot dish of sliced sausages with onions. The continental breakfast the next morning was slightly better appointed, with fruit, hot & cold cereals, yogurt, breads and pastries. However, I didn't take advantage of either service after the first time. When I wanted a heartier breakfast I ate in the Ambassador Grill, which is only reached by going all the way downstairs and crossing over to a separate elevator that only takes you there. They have a pretty comprehensive breakfast buffet for something like $12.95. I went to happy hour at the grill once as well. It's 2-for-1, and on Thursdays it's ladies' night at the lobby bar, where ladies drink free. We tried to go there, but the live entertainment was so loudly horrendous that we retreated to the calmer environs of the restaurant. I wasn't impressed with any of the live entertainment I saw during my stay there, although the small lobby lounge was always full. A better choice is to go to the Marriott in Condado. On Saturday nights they have live salsa and merengue bands in the Lobby Lounge, and huge bar area as soon as you enter the property. Drinks and entertainment were much better than at the Radisson, and it's only about a 5-10 minute walk away. I found the staff friendly enough and very responsive the couple of times I called upon them, other than the woman working in the Ambassador Club. I also had turndown service in the evenings. My only complaints were that the elevators really did not work well. The one in the restaurant refused to go down one day when I was on it. When I went back to the hostess station to report it, she didn't seem surprised at all, and directed me out through a back way. Also, the single elevator that served the tower in which I was staying would often balk before it would finally go downstairs. Also, while my friend on the 8th floor said she couldn't hear a thing in her regular room, there was this annoying noise coming from either upstairs or next door to my room the entire time I was there, at all hours. So that, combined with the fact that I couldn't seem to identify my \"sleep number\", led to some restless nights. I would recommed this hotel, but not overly enthusiastically. I am already planning another trip back, but this time plan to stay in Old San Juan. That's where I ended up taking cabs to most of the time, and at $12 a pop I figure I might as well stay down there next time.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cJust okay\u201d", "Author": "Ducksoop", "ReviewID": "UR13405295", "Content": "This hotel is fine for a stay of a night or two (we stayed there one night before our cruise), but if you're planning an extended stay in San Juan there are much better choices. The hotel is in the heart of the city so there is no view of the ocean or easy beach access, but there is a roof top pool if you want to swim or enjoy the sun. The casino on the first floor appears to be popular wih the locals. The lobby is small and a bit gloomy, and the staff at the desk is not particularly friendly. A little more smiling and a few pleasantries would go a long way towards improving the welcome. I imagine they must get a lot of people pre/post cruise because the attitude of the staff is to get you processed without fanfare and get your luggage out of the small lobby. We arrived in the early afternoon and were given what must be the most undesirable room in the hotel (or at least I hope there are none worse). The entire view from our balcony was the equipment for the hotel's cooling system and the roar of the compressors was very loud (our balcony was virtually unusable because of the roar). There was also a large spotlight mounted on the wall outside our balcony which made it very bright at night. I suspect the hotel would have given us a discount if we had complained but since we were only there for one night we didn't bother. (I recommend you request a room away from the AC equipment when you make your reservations--the noise is quite loud and a light sleeper would not have a restful night). The room was a bit dark but nicely decorated and was comfortable. When we first arrived in our room we found the carpets covered with a sticky powder of some sort, but in all fairness after we called housekeeping a lady quickly appeared with a vacuum cleaner and the carpets looked fine afterwards. Otherwise, the room was clean and well maintained and the bathroom was very basic but spotlessly clean. This hotel is an okay choice if you need a convenient place to stay before your cruise (the cruise docks are about 5 minutes away by taxi) and it is within walking distance of several dining spots and shops. There is a terrific place for breakfast just block away which will serve you a delicious full breakfast and a killer cup of cafe con leche for about $7.

There is a lot of \"saving\" of slot machines here and in every casino, but that's just the way it works down there and should just be accepted as part of the culture. The drink system is a little different, too, with the waitstaff appearing to obtain some kind of permission or voucher from the pit bosses; a player's card will ensure free drinks, but otherwise, I'd say you should probably let the pit boss know you're a hotel guest.

Didn't have food at the hotel because there were plenty of places to eat on the same street as the hotel. Took a local bus a block away from the hotel to Old San Juan and felt safe the entire ride there and back (much cheaper option than taking a cab). Music is nice at the little bar at night as well.

This last leg of our trip included a four night stay at the Radisson Ambassador Hotel. The room was nice, though we wanted two double beds, and received a king. It was a typical room with typical amenities. There are a couple good and bad points about this hotel I want to share. First, the parking situation is ATROCIOUS! We arrived back at the hotel at various times in the evening, only to find the parking lot extremely full. You have the choice of valet, but it costs more. We discovered the next morning, there were only a handful of cars left in the lot. This meant that casino gaming visitors took up all the parking meant mainly for hotel guests. We were on the third floor and could hear a lot of the casino noise from downstairs. Another thing you don't find out until you arrive are the parking fees were $15.00 per day. The hotel didn't express much sympathy when we brought this inconvenience to their attention upon checkout. The front desk reply was \"Yes, we are quite a busy hotel\" ONe thing I want to rave about is the proactive action taken by the hotel housekeepers. My daughter still loves her milk, so I bought a half gallon at the store and chilled it in the ice bucket. The next day when we got back from our busy day, we found a small fridge in our room with the milk chilled nicely inside. I was very impressed by this. I guess we made a mistake staying at a hotel with a casino in it. So if you don't want the parking hassle and the noise from a casino, definitely don't book your stay here.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "barbados", "Title": "\u201cWas fab! \u201d", "Author": "BImtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR5901810", "Content": "I am from the island of Barbados and I work for the premier All-inclusive Resorts there which is the Almond Beach Resorts Inc.

The front desk was on point and did everything they could to make sure we were happy with our room which was clean, pleasantly fresh with supplies and all appliances in working order. I think I could have brought a pet Anaconda and they would have been accomodating with a smile. The first floor is host to a casino which allows smoking so our first impression was that this hotel was kind of seedy with typical casino decor. Frankly, it is, but knowing that the staff was doing their best to make our stay enjoyable was comforting. The casino crowd seemed to be mostly locals but I found playing with them to be quite entertaining. Low minumum bets ($2 roulette) allows even the first-timer to give it a whirl. No craps table though. This is a city hotel one block from the beach surrounded by all types of cuisine and shopping at all price levels. We had some terrific meals in OSJ and Condado vicinity. The hotel breakfast isn't gourmet by any means. However, it was cheap at under $20 for the two of us w/tip and again, our waiter proved to be such a nice guy aiming to please us, we looked past it but we ate out the following morning. The pool was clean and padded loungechairs were in order with fresh towels. The gym is compact with Cybex machines, dumbbells and clean. We witnessed the attendee do a full scrub of the pool deck as well as hand-scrub every chair (Poor guy). Although, the pool bar is only open on weekends, the written pool policy was BYO unless the bar was open. Most hotels strictly enforce a \"hotel products only\" rule. Aside from the city hustle/bustle below, it was peaceful being high up on the sunny pool deck. Having been to the beach the previous days while at another hotel, we didn't mind the seclusion of the roof top which only had a handful of guests. Look...this hotel is surrounded by buildings on all sides so in my opinion, there isn't a great view to be had. Most rooms have a view of someone elses rooftop. I wouldn't choose to spend a week with the fam at this location but for 2 nights with my girlfriend, it was fine and allowed us to experience authentic P.R. cuisine, nightlife and shopping within easy walking distance.

They even called ahead to make sure they were serving what I wanted to eat. I stayed for New Year's Eve. They had a great party. It was packed and when we requested a table once one became available, they got a table and chairs from the back so we could have a place to sit. What can I say!! Had a great time. The staff was great and I would definitely choose this hotel over other pricey ones in the Condado Area.", "Date": "March 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Arlington NJ", "Title": "\u201cConcierge level worth every cent\u201d", "Author": "Phil6184", "ReviewID": "UR3265801", "Content": "Stayed three nights at the Radisson. I had upgraded to concierge level for an extra $30 a night and it was worth every penny. For starters, the night receptionist, Viviana is excellent at her job. She made very helpful suggestions about my short stay in San Juan. Her enthusiasm for the Island was infectious. Secondly, concierge level includes a continental breakfast, appetizers in the evening along with a self serve honor bar. If you like a cocktail before dinner, you can make your own, just the way you like it. Concierge level also includes a free in-room movie daily, but I didn't take advantage of this. The hotel seems to be popular with business people, and I met several at evening cocktails who were very friendly. For me this was a big plus. The room itself is a good size, with a king size bed, a premium mattress (select comfort) \"What's your sleep number?\" The bath is marble and tile. I had a balcony which did have a water view, although I had a view of a parking lot and other high rise buildings too. Ok...the hotel is not on the beach, but it is an easy 2 minute walk to the beach. if you don't like that beach, then walk in either direction until you find a nice spot. There is so much to do in Puerto Rico, I could care less we weren't directly on the beach. The tour desk arranged a tour of the rain forest. It was a fun tour, but it doesn't return until about 3 pm so pack a lunch. I was starving by the time we returned! Speaking of food, the restaurant \"Yerba Buena\" serves cuban food and has live entertainment far better than would be expected. Lots of fun! All in all, I had a very nice stay at the Radisson and in Puerto Rico.", "Date": "March 11, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Radisson Ambassador Plaza Hotel & Casino San Juan", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d150444-Reviews-Radisson_Ambassador_Plaza_Hotel_Casino_San_Juan-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$136 - $221*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "150444", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/73/87/7387d0001de1480805578d3c77ce27ce4large.jpg"}}
