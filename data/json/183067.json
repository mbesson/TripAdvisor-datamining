On this stay the room smelt (stale smoke?) on arrival and there was a stain on the carpet. The bathroom, as with most rooms I stayed in there, was in need of general maintenance. The TV was a new LCD model but only had the first 30 channels tuned in and the sound was completely out of sync with the picture; so fairly unwatchable. I've been a platinum member for 4 years - initially I was generally given a room on 12th floor and there was always a nominal gift in my room on arrival. That has all long gone, along with benefits such as bottled water. Even the nice touches such has handwritten welcome note seem to have gone as of this last stay. As others have commented, the food service is somewhat expensive. $40 for a sandwich, dessert and drink! Easily $75+ per person for a full meal. The hotel itself is quite tired, and the building is not kept as presentable as it used to be. The front entrance in particular doesn't give a good first impression. Quite often dirty glasses and plates from guest rooms were left on the floor in the corridor all day before being collected. The hotel staff are not the same as in recent years. Many of the old faces no longer work there and the hotel has lost a lot of the spirit and atmosphere that used to make it special. Some of my interaction with the current staff left me feeling uncomfortable where they have been border-line rude or have openly criticised their management or the hotel in general. Not good! The hotel makes much of its award winning past, but unsurprisingly it hasn't won the top award for at least a couple of years. Certainly the hotel's claim to be one of the current top 10 Holiday Inns in the world is somewhat laughable. It's not a bad hotel, but for all it's hype it is fairly average. I've stayed in better Holiday Inns elsewhere in Canada and other countries in the world. I always used to be an advocate for this hotel, and 4 years ago would have given it a 5.

The restaurant was filthy, period. The trays the sugar bowls sat on were disgusting, ketchup and what looked like dried egg yolks were all over these trays, I moved tables once noticing this thinking this particular table had just been overlooked, but the next table was the same. The same went for the salt and pepper shakers, sticky with dried food from other peoples dirty hands. Salt grains were all over the table so it had obviously had not been wiped after the previous guest. The milk jugs for coffee are put out on the tables first thing in the morning and then left out all day, this is very unsafe, you would think in a large chain hotel like this the staff would have to take a health and safty course at some point. Eventhough milk is pasteurized it still contains bacteria. Milk left out for more than an hour at room tempature increases the number of pathogens that are present and will become become unsafe to drink in about 4 hour (and I wouldn't wait that long). I overheard a server telling another one she was going to leave a couple of these milk jugs for the girls on dinner shift in the service stand once she was finally removing them. (this was at 2pm, now already left out for aprox. 7 hours) I never once saw any management for the duration of my stay, (restaurants where the management sits in the office all day never do well) so the staff has no guidence. They also seem to be very understaffed. One poor girl was franticly running around taking care of at least 15 tables, guest sometimes waited for more than 5 - 10 minutes to get coffee, eventhough most people take advantage of the buffet you have to aks for a menu if you want othewise, and just because it is mostly buffet that doesn't mean service is not needed. I then continued to watch a mother and her young son sit at a table, the son then proceeded to play with the extra settings at the table. He had put his hands all over the cutlery, coffee cups, saucers and the side plates (using them like building blocks) and of course when the server came to clear the table after the guests had left she only took away the plates they had directly eaten off of and just repositioned the so called \"clean\" table settings. Once again very unsanitary. I'm sorry but with this horrible N1H1 epidemic going around I would not want to be eating off of plates and putting cutlery in my mouth that people had touched all over. I was impressed with the selection of the buffet (well overpriced though) but I could only imagine what kind of practices go on in the kitchen behind closed doors after seeing the state of the front of house. This hotel has aparently won a bunch of awards (that are hung all over the wall on the way to the restaurant, which looks quite silly) and I don't understand how. This restaurant needs some serious guidence and proper sanitation/ health and saftey trainning. I commend the servers for their great attitudes but not for their practices.

You are also offered a glass of sparkling wine, sushi and a grab-bag of soda, chips and breakfast bars to take up to your room. Finally, I was also given a coupon for 25% off breakfast for each of my nights stay. Very nice touch indeed. I was given Room # 1235 in the East Tower which I was led to believe was an upgraded room. This room was on the top floor, was at the opposite end of the elevators and had a balcony facing the Yorkdale Shopping Centre. Unfortunately, I found the room to be a little disapointing as it only had two standard beds (vice queen size), had paint/wallpaper peeling by the balcony door and had smallish bathroom. This opinion is in relative comparison with a room I had in the same hotel six months ago in the West Tower which seemed larger and nicer. Although I am not 100% sure, my sense is that the hotel was fully booked and due to my relatively late arrival, I was given what was left-over. Due to my short stay, I did not complain and accepted the room as presented. Due to my schedule, I was not able to make use of my breakfast buffet coupons however the coffee bar was very convenient, if not a little pricey. The hotel lobby was very clean and efficient.

The entrace to the hotel is tricky - through the lot of a car dealership. It looks as if the road was widened and the hotel lost their entrace - but once you figure out how to get in to the hotel - it's a great experience. The rooms have been updated with granite countertops, nice furniture, a comfortable easy chair and roomy desk with a comfortable office chair as well. There was adequate room for 4 suitcases and more, the beds were reasonably comfortable. But the best parts of this hotel are the restaurant, the staff and the indoor sports/pool area. I've seen other Holidays Inns with atrium areas - but they are usually made up of a pool, jacuzzi and lots of arcade types video games. However this Holiday Inn has a nice pool, jacuzzi, sauna, workout area with enough machines to occupy about 10 people, an indoor miniature size tennis area (carpeted!), pingpong and a toddler area with toys and coloring and changing rooms. All of this is free for guests. There's also a pool table ($1.50 a game). The restaurant is nicely appointed - but you woulnd't expect the food to be of the very high quality that it is. We had the breakfast buffet 2 mornings ($17.95 - and kids eat free) and it includes everything from eggs benedict, sausage, ham, bacon to smoked fish (high quality) fesh fruit and these amazing smoothies . The french toast, bakery/home made breads were delicious - all very much worth the money. The dinner buffet had a limited entree offering - but entrees were made to order and were done perfectly. The night we were there the available entrees were salmon, shrimp, steak & pasta. The steak was prepared with a flavorful rub and grilled perfect to medium-rare. The salmon was panfried with a sweet & tangy glaze. Pasta and shrimp were also done perfectly. The salad bar was gourmet - fresh mozzarella, cold seafood salad, smoked fish and roasted vegtables, and all varieties of lettuce and accoutrements and the breads were artisanal. Kids could eat free from a kids menu (mac & Cheese, mini-pizza, etc.) or half price fromt he buffet. We had one kid take the pizza dn one dop the half price buffet. She loved the food. But above all - the service here was fabulous. All of the people we came in to contact with - waiters, the buffet chef, the young lady manning the pool and sports area, etc. were all very helpful. They offered useful travel advice, another got me a map of toronto and made a call to get open and closing times of a lcoal atraction, etc. All offered without me hainv to ask. And no matter how many tennis balls got lost in the bushes surrounding the indoor sporting area the young lady was always sweet and kind and managed to find another tennis ball somewhere. My kids wanted to stay at the hotel \"forever\". Tip - the mall is across the street and the subway is on the grounds of the mall - but it is on the far side of the mall and involves a walk of about 3 city blocks by the time you cross the parking lots on both sides of the mall and a very heaviuly trafficked street. So you may want to drive your car to the other side of the mall if you're taking the subway and are traveling with kids. Tip - the hotel does charge a $7 parking fee.

There is a large atrium area with a pool, hot tub, small tennis type court, supervised kids play house of sorts and a ping pong table. There are some rooms with balconies either overlooking the pool are or the front of the hotel. There was also a restaurant with a very nice but sophisticated eclectic menu, most entrees around $20.00 and a children's menu with a good selection. When we returned to our room in the evening, there was a message from the front desk checking to make sure we had everything we needed and a little box of chocolate truffles with a card.

The hotel is spotless, the beds are comfy, and I enjoy how close I can park (for a fee). It is across the street from arguably the best mall in Toronto (Yorkdale Shopping Centre), and it is right on the 401 if you need to hit the road, or you can pick up the subway at the mall. It's primarily a driver's neighbourhood, so if your attractions are downtown, stay downtown. Otherwise, I'd recommend it. The room service, coffee bar and yes, sushi, are great.

The pool was large enough and very clean- with a whirlpool and sauna in the same area. The hotel has a small fitness room and a kids' area (more for toddlers-5 years). There is also a pool table, a ping-pong table and a \"tennis court\" with a foam ball- lots of fun for the kids. We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast. We had the buffet which was very good with a great variety. Kids eat free- but the adult prices are high. My husband and I paid $17.00 each for breakfast. Although the price was high, it was not high enough to keep us from going back for breakfast the next day! One additional tip- the mall across the street has quite a few restaurants to choose from.

If you want to out for an evening stroll you are walking beside a very busy road through essentially a commercial (not retail) area; not very pleasant nor interesting.
