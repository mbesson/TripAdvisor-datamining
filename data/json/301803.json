I was a little worried it might be a bit far from everything but the location was perfect. We were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to go which included Orchard Road right to the far end where we went on the Singapore flyer and visited Raffles. It took a couple of hours but that was stopping looking in the shops along the way. When booking the hotel we asked for two connecting rooms, poolside and that was exactly what we got. The room had a 6ft bed, lovely bathroom, mini bar, bathrobes, Slippers. The rooms have adaptors which will take all types of plugs, even out British 3 pin. Saves all those adaptors!, All the things that you would expect from a Sheraton. When you walked out of the sliding patio doors it was directly on the poolside. Couldn't have been better. The hotel has a dining room which also offers breakfast but we didn't use this. There is also a bar/lounge area offering afternoon tea as well as the usual selection of bar drinks in the evening. Just a short walk from the hotel is the Newton Food Court which is an experience. You will be badgered as soon as you walk in but have a walk arond and choose which of the stalls you want to eat from then sit down and order. The seafood is to die for and full of locals which I believe is a good sign!! The hotel are happy to book any excursions for you. We did the night safari which was certainly worth the money. Beware if asking the hotel to book a taxi for you. They charge 8 Singapore dollars just to make the call which is a little bit on the steep side. i would recommend that you book the driver that drops you from the airport for your return. The Internet is also very expensive and there is no WIFI available in the lobby areas. You can use a PC in the conference area but its not exactly convenient. You would expect hotels in this class to at least have WIFI in common areas. Overall these hotel was ideal for our short stay in Singapore and I would certainly recommend it to others.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but very loud noise\u201d", "Author": "islandbikini", "ReviewID": "UR128029384", "Content": "Let me start with the positive things about this hotel. 1. Great location. So easy to walk anywhere in the city.

Very lous construction next door. You will not be able to relax unless you stay on the other corner of the hotel. 2. The breakfast buffet offeres variety of dishes but they had been sitting there for too long that they were not fresh. I had a stomach problem right away. 3. It is a big property but seems like they're always crowded everywhere.

His helpful attitude and assistance reduced the stress and worry caused by the loss of our luggage. The hotel is not Raffles, nor is it the Marina Sands, but it met every expectation we had. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom very nice and spacious, the shower rainhead very refreshing and the room large, clean and comfortable. The hotel is about a 10 min walk from the shopping on Orchard and I enjoyed every bit of it - walking past several colonial homes on Scott which you wouldn't see otherwise. The service made this hotel an excellent experience. It is nice when things proceed flawlessly, but I believe you really see a hotel's service ethic when they are presented with issues to overcome.

But for Singapore, this is a 3-star hotel at best in every respect. Location: Isolated in terms of walking down to the lobby level and finding stores. Not isolated if you think of a subway station 30 seconds away and Orchard Road a nice 10-15 min walk. But seriously, this is the most isolated hotel I have stayed at. It is in a residential area, quiet, uneventful. Price: For the price you would pay at this place, go to the Marina or Orchard Road. There is absolutely nothing to justify the price compared with other hotels. None. Nada. Zilch. Not in quality. Not in service. Not in amenities. Not in flexibility of the staff. Rooms: I got assigned a non-refurbished one. Really old style. The TV is a 19 inch CRT. It was nice seeing 15-year old technology. The remote control must have bacteria from the 19th century ( you will note in other hotels the remote controls are wrapped in plastic and the plastic is sanitized regularly ). The lighting system is frustrating: you must control all lights from a control board by the bed. If it is dark, you are out of luck in terms of what to turn on. The bed is ok. The desk chair had major stains but was replaced promptly. The safe can not hold large laptops so be forewarned. It is on the small side but at least available. The laundry prices are super expensive. They are a rip off, i.e. 5 SGD for socks. There is a fridge that is not automated so that's a plus as you can use it with your own drinks. The room itself has plenty of space, not tiny by any measure. What started off my stay on the wrong footing was the manager on duty rather using a white lie when I asked him why I was not given a newer room. His answer: well sir, given you are staying here for 5 nights, It is better for you to avoid the smell from the new rooms; I put only people for 1-2 nights in those rooms because of the smell. :) Imaginative but a lie. I asked him to extend my stay by one night at check in. His answer: well sir, given you booked on expedia, it is better you go back to expedia. In short, one of the worst managers I have encountered in Singapore. No interest whatsoever in making me feel welcome. The gym: bad circulation of air so that sweaty smell when you are exercising. Too few machines for cardio given the hotel size: 4 treadmills and 2 steppers and 1 rower and 1 bicycle. They would need double that. Even at 6:30 AM you can't find a treadmill. The pool: I did not use but looks nice and clean. Breakfast: Frankly, below average ( for Singapore again ). For a European hotel, it is 5 star breakfast. For Singapore, it is a 2 start breakfast. Limited choice. No service by waiters. Overall, I would highly greatly immensely recommend you stay elsewhere as the Sheraton does not have a major price difference with other properties. I would not recommend nor would I come back here. If you pay for an executive room with lounge access, go somewhere else as you will have paid the price of a much better hotel and do not have to play roulette about getting a room from the 70s. Internet is 21 SGD a night for one device and 28 for 2 devices. I hope this is helpful.

The location is a bit off from the famous spots like Orchard Road, Clark Quay or Boat Quay, but everythings can be reached in few minutes by taxi or even in 15 minutes by walking. The hotel is a typical Sherton Hotel with all the nice features, which are normally offered by this kind of business hotel. Unfortunately I visisted Singapore during the time of the famous air show and in addition arrival was on Valentines Day, so the hotel was fully booked, Meaning that I had to pay unreasonable high rates.Upon check-in I had to wait quite some time, mainly because of a long queue waiting in front of me, but also because of a somehow unefficient check-in process. Even as data are all available beforehand and reception can prepare everything prior to the arrival, it took too much time in each individual case. To my surprise there was no dedicated check-in available for Starwood Preferred Members. Finally the concierge started to assist the receptionist and the processs speeded up a little. My room was nice and big enough, my king-size bed was very comfortable and all necessary amenities were available. The Sheraton is offereing a couple of different restaurants, all of them at the high end in regard to prices but with good quality, too. Every evening I had a final drink together with colleagues, who were staying there at the same time, at the lobby bar. Nice music but sometimes lousy service. On my first evening the waiter was more busy with greeting his friends, who spent Valentines Day at the Sheraton, than getting us some drinks. The other evenings it was slightly better but a bit unprofessional service. All the waiters and the barkeeper seemed to be newcomers.

They did not have any rooms with two beds yet but was able to take our luggage and the concierge was EXTREMELY helpful in helping us decide what to do in Singapore.

There is a sauna and steam room in the pool area vicinity along with the gym on the same floor/area. As me and my friend were in the pool, the front desk lady did come up to deliver the keys as promised. I was very impressed with her service!

I used the pool and enjoyed the spaciousness of the area. The weather was such that it was not conducive to me using the gym, but after checking out the facilities, I committed to memory that I should do so if I happened to visit next when the climate was cooler. I used Room Service during my stay which I could not fault. Worth a mention: Upon checking in, I was informed that some floors were being refurbished. To ensure guests were not affected by any noise or inconvenience, they were placed in rooms far removed from the renovations. That being said, I would have had no idea any works were being undertaken. Absolutely no disruption or no noise. I appreciated the upfront candour, given that I have been in hotels previously where this has not been a consideration and subsequently have had to request a room transfer, or suffer the noise and inconvenience in a high season occupancy. My room was very much in keeping with most Starwood city properties, which has never disappointed. As one previous reviewer mentioned, the shower was in the bath and there was a shower curtain, however, given the size of the bathroom, which was generous, it provided the best of both worlds - a bath and a shower - and the curtain was pristine and new. Sharon See, Director of Rooms, went above and beyond the call of duty happening to be at the wrong place at the wrong time where I was concerned, after not being able to access my room with my key due to being on the wrong floor to start with. Every effort was made by Ms. See to accompany me personally to sort things out. And when we met again per chance on my check-out, Ms. See assisted me with organising some additional items via Housekeeping on my departure. I cannot fault the standard and level of service I received during my stay at the Sheraton Towers - all team members were friendly and courteous and any queries I had were attended to immediately. I would highly recommend this hotel - whether it be for families or the corporate sector - it is close and convenient to the main shopping hub, offering the high standard of service one comes to expect from the Starwood chain of hotels.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "limassol", "Title": "\u201cOne more time thanks to Starwood hotels!!\u201d", "Author": "glou2", "ReviewID": "UR123547772", "Content": "It's not that this hotel has something wow but it's nothing u could not like!

I've also tried other similarly priced hotels such as the Marina Mandarin last time I was in Singapore and price for price, the Marina was better - newer, cleaner, better location(the shopping mall was just downstairs!). I always had a bit of regret coming back to Sheraton Towers ...that is until today! I was given a recently renovated room on the 17th floor and boy was it a significant improvement from the last time I stayed here. It is now what you can truly call - 'Sheraton' standard - well, almost! it doesn't look super luxurious but before this it felt more like a 2-3 star hotel. The TV is new and stylish (its still lacking some channels, and there's not much variety sadly - great looking TV but nothing good on). The room looks mostly the same a before but there's a few hidden nice touches - the room controls are noticebly new - the drawers and minibars looks nice - and the bathroom - spotless. There's a also a sky-shower like faucet and a bigger tub(or maybe its just my imagination!) Water pressure could be improved but its definitely hot enough :) Internet is fast, but unfortunately not free and not cheap! Its 21SGD per device for 24 hours - there are other daily, weekly, monthly plans even. I definitely feel less 'regret' checking in to Towers now than before :) For first timers, there's an MRT nearby as you walk out of the hotel - go left. probably 100-200 meters. Orchard road is just a few stops away, its not near but not that far either - but you probably don't want to walk on a hot and humid day. There's a \"circus\" food court nearby but I don't recommend it as its mostly a tourist trap (exorbitant prices, average food). You're better off finding stuff in the middle of Orchard probably. Overall its not a bad place to stay if you're in Singapore - location not too bad, rooms are definitely above average now, (though they could have used a bit more check in staff, there was only one manning the station while I was checking in - but she was nice and friendly enough! - even gave me a call to make sure I was okay with the room I got!). The lobby does look old and a bit outdated but if you don't hang around there much it shouldn't really bother you that much :) I'm attaching as many pictures I can to show the state of the rooms - it's nicer than last time trust me, it doesn't look luxurious but it's definitely an improvement!", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201ccozy\u201d", "Author": "jtkJakarta", "ReviewID": "UR119642461", "Content": "I have stayed many times over the last 10 years at the Sheraton Singapore.

The only other Starwood property in Singapore is the St. Regis and that is far more expensive (but much nicer). The Sheraton Towers is woefully in need of a refurbishment. It must be the only 5 star hotel in the world with small, old CRT-type TVs (only a few rooms have flat panel TVs and some of those are old and small). The channel selection is abysmal and the reception is erratic. Only a couple of the top suites have DVD players.

On the positive side, the hotel is very clean and the staff are nice. The gym is small but very good - beware, it is not a hotel gym and is run by a commercial company so when \"members\" arrive it is REALLY crowded. Out of peak hours it is fine. The Executive lounge is nice - but the selection for breakfast and cocktails is very limited. Be prepared to have someone pounce on you every time you enter the lounge asking for your room number. Given that entrance is controlled by your room key I fail to understand why they make such a big deal about establishing your room number. But my BIG complaint is the price. I recently had to pay SGD400++ - it was the cheapest rate available. For the standard of the rooms etc this is simply usury. The owners have failed to invest any money over the last 10 years, which the exception of refurbished elevators, which are now so dimly lit you can't even read the floor numbers or the signs. I have stayed in most of the premium suites (I'm a Platinum Member so get upgraded) - if I had to pay the full rate for these I would be VERY angry. There is absolutely nothing of interest around this hotel (condos and office blocks) but it is very close to an MRT station.

I chose the hotel based on its participation in the SPG program and because of an attractive corporate rate. Check-in: Relatively fast and efficient. I arrived at 7:00am and was only able to get a room if I paid a full night's rate! Otherwise I was told I would have to wait until 10:00am. I understand that rooms may not be ready or the hotel may have a policy to make guests wait, but it seems petty to charge a full night's rate for a couple of extra hours. Not the best start at this hotel. Room: The rooms are this hotel are like a step into the 90s. Very dark, rather dated, and with an old TV and old bathroom fixtures. That said, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower had good water pressure. Amenities: The hotel has a nice gym facility, although it seemed to be crowded. The pool area is nice. I didn't have much trouble getting a taxi when needed (often times this is a problem in Singapore). The breakfast buffet was average - I've had better and also have had worse. I definitely would not pay the full asking price, but it was included in my room rate. I did take advantage of the laundry service a few times and the service provided was excellent. Location: The hotel is a 10-minute walk from Orchard Road, so not a terrible location. The MRT is right next door, with convenient service to the city center. There's also the Newton Circus Hawker Center within walking distance. The walk to Orchard Road was a bit tedious but otherwise not an issue. Overall Verdict: I probably wouldn't stay here again unless the hotel was renovated. Singapore is one of the great hotel cities in the world, and it's not worth it to stay at a dated property in an out-of-the-way location just for a few starwood points.

My friend first got to know his future wife on a first date there many years ago. I attended many university balls there as well in the early 90s. The room I had was decent sized. The bed was very comfortable and consistent with other sheratons in asia.

I am an SPG Platinum member, and had booked two rooms (King and Twin) on Cash & Points, for two nights, passing through Singapore on longhaul flights. After reading the reviews, I had forewarned my wife to expect a very tired shabby hotel, poor service, inconvenient location, etc. I am happy to report I didn't find any of these things. Admittedly, being Platinum, I was upgraded into one of their 22 signature suites, (which are intriguingly each furnished individually in the style of a different famous world city). My children had a nearby standard twin room. Both of our rooms were perfectly adequate, well supplied, clean and presentable. Everything that was supposed to be in them appeared to be, and there was nothing that stood out as being particularly tatty, old or in disprepair. Nothing appeared stained or dirty. The rooms were smallish - as is common in hotels in Singapore. The standard online price for them seemed very ballpark (5 star accommodation in Singapore is universally overpriced). We ate in the Executive Lounge on the 3rd floor, which was spacious, nicely detailed and comfortable, and had a small but adequate continental breakfast in the morning, and a reasonably good cocktail hour. The pool area on 5th floor is pretty basic in keeping with the older age of the hotel - but I have seen a lot worse. The gym next to the pool looked well equipped. The ground floor and basement restaurants looked inviting. There is a nice al-fresco outdoor dining area on the ground floor that is amid full sized palm trees and a high waterfall cascading down rocks which was a nice feature. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk up Scotts Street from Orchard Road, but is very close to the Newton Circus Hawker food market, and is also directly next door to the Newton underground MRT station on the NorthSouth line, so the next three stations are all Orchard Road shopping, etc. Taxis to most central city locations were very inexpensive. While you can't step out of the hotel into the middle of a major shopping precinct, I didn't feel the location was inconvenient at all. My only annoyance was the fact that they had an understaffed reception desk, no SPG desk, and the Exec Lounge couldn't handle checkin/checkout. This meant that there was often a queue at the reception area - a hassle checking in and checking out. Taxis could also be difficult to get at different times of the day - but that is also very typical for Singapore. All of the staff I dealt with were friendly and helpful however. There is no doubt that this hotel could do with a spruce up.

I have stayed in various rooms at this Sheraton, from the standard rooms to the executive floor. Even the standard rooms are reasonably spacious, attractively furnished and usually everything works (if it doesn't, they fix it immediately). The beds are wonderful, so comfortable. A twin bedded room is two double sized beds, each with at least four pillows with extras in the wardrobe. Room service is, well ....room service! With fabulous food everywhere in Singapore, who wants room service? The breakfasts in their buffet restaurant are very Sheraton, very good, plenty of fresh fruit and excellent variety of cheeses and breads make the Continental b'fast good value. The soaring marble walls and the floor to ceiling glass overlooking the waterfall add a touch of the dramatic to this restaurant. Plenty of attentive staff members and everything looks good, crisp white cloths etc. The hotel has a very good outdoor pool - some rooms open directly to the pool area and there are also several luxurious individual cabanas in their own enclave just off the pool area - the cabanas do not have air conditioning. The location in Scotts Road may not suit some, being about a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road, but there is an MRT station right next to the hotel. I really like this hotel for its more restful atmosphere, more friendly than the usual five star hotels in Singapore.

(I did not mean to sound nasty to others but just trying to save others from staying there). As SPG Platinum member, I was TOTALLY and UTTERLY disappointed for what I got. I stayed there at the end of December with my friend and upon check-in, enquired the 10% discount which their Starwood Privilege Members (a F&B program) are entitled to. Though I knew it has to be mentioned upon making reservation, was I not entitled to open my mouth and asked?? The clerk treated me like a beggar and told me \"You can only get discount in the Cafe Resaurant\", and not for the rooms. Knowing very well its terms and conditions, I politely (I was more polite than him) asked him to check as it's not the money, it's the principles and entitlement) What's the big deal if I din't get it? He then reluctantly told me he would check and got back to me. A couple of hours later, I received an apology message and I was finally granted a discount of US19.00. I booked a twin room and therefore did not get any upgrade which I was entitled to (as Platinum member). That is fine as long as the room is nice and clean. To my horror, the room was smelly and extremely old-fashioned. It's more a room for the group tourists paying a US$40 rate!!! The twin beds are so tiny that I called it \"grand baby cots\" and I almost fell out of bed a few times. The filthy windows that faced the construction site opposite did not help to make me feel regrettable. The TV is so small you need a pair of binoculars to watch TV. I've never dreaded to go to bed when staying in a Starwood property but this hotel really succeeded!!! I will give them an award if they asked me to. I wrote to their Customer Service Center to tell them my experience (I was not even complaining) and told them I did not require a standard hotel response which would not have made up for a bad experience. But I did - I got a standard reply from their Front Office Manager apologizing and then ask me to \"Let him know should I stay there again\". He must be crazy - I would not even stay there again even if they give me a free room. All in all, the hotel was a total disaster (not the staff) and one felt being cheated, especially when paying US$190 for a night which is not considered as \"cheap\" or even reasonable. I'd rather pay another US$100 for a better deal. The staff at the Executive Lounge did not even offer to serve us drinks and we had to help ourselves. Perhaps we have Asian-looking face?? Whatever you do, DO NOT stay in this hotel unless you are an old-fashioned person and want to reminisce the good old days! A hostel is even better (although I have not stayed in one). If the location of this hotel is good, there are also many other choices too. Believe me, I was so glad to have moved to a much nicer hotel the next day. To be fair - at the same time - that's not much the hotel could do if whoever owns that hotel did not want to invest in a complete revonation. The other Starwood properties are all very nice. But, do us travellers a favour and justice - take down the Sheraton label from the exterior of the building, otherwise people will continue to fall into the Sheraton traps!!

Rooms are clean and serve their purpose but lacks in style and taste (a given for most hotels these days) with old TVs and plain furniture. The newly designed lobby is grandeur with marbles and smart lighting used to good effect, but still is unable to compete with the likes of the stylish Oriental or the magnificent Shangri-la (just to name two). The pool and the gym is also quite average and bland. The exterior of the hotel is the worst drawback, displaying a desperate need of a make-over. In all, the hotel is functional and will serve the basic needs but seriously lacks in tasteful touches. I once found a large, bulky and ugly looking air freshener placed right in front of the elevators in the hallway of my floor. Perhaps the ugliest sight I had ever seen from a (so-called) 5 star property. So what about service? I stayed here a few times and regret to say that the level of service has been poor every single time. The biggest flop was when I wanted to catch a taxi out at around 10:45PM and asked the doorman for help. To my shock, he showed resentment and told us that he was getting ready to go home as he finishes work at 11PM! Never before did I experience such nonsense. His tone of voice was also that of an uncle telling his nephew. In the end, I had to find my own cab \u2013 A revolting experience that I will never forget. Another mishap I experienced was when the check-in staff had no idea about the package I had booked. I once booked a romance-package that allows you a late checkout at 4 PM. When I was told that the check-out time was 12 PM, I enquired about my package but the staff had NO IDEA what I was talking about. After what felt like forever for her to search around her computer, I was told that the best she could do for me was a 2 PM check-out. Not wanting to spoil my romantic weekend, I forced myself to agree and went to my room. It was later that day when the front-desk called me to apologize and extended the check-out to 4 PM, which should have been the case from the very beginning. STS has to wake up and smell the coffee as Singapore is spoiled for good hotels with more in the pipeline. With no taste, poor service, only adequate amenities and doormen that scold guests for asking him to do his job, I would advise all to stay well clear.

Got a bar bill added to my final account when asked to see it as I had not used the bar they could not find it. Eventualy the money was taken off me bill The only good things were the curtains blacked out the day giving me a good sleep and the pool was a nice size for getting some laps in. Would recommned staying in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront instead much nicer and cheaper. Also do not be taken in by the taxi mafia the white mercs out the front do not use meters and charge a fortune. So getting a normal meter taxi is hard as the door mafia do not allow them to wait outside.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel For Staying ...

The Ritz Carlton, Conrad, etc, are walking distance to Suntec but very expensive the days I needed them.

I have stayed dozens of times in Singapore, in just about every 5 star hotel on the island (and even Sentosa!). I am amazed that Sheraton Towers is so high on the popularity index. I have stayed here about 6 times over the past few years, and have always been disappointed. The only reason I stay here is that the sales staff are very slow at putting up their rates when big conferences are on, which means the Sheraton can be an absolute bargain when other nearby hotels triple their prices. There are two main problems: 1. The rooms are small and antiquated by Singapore standards. They are not even in the same ball park as what is on offer at just about every other 5* hotel (e.g. Conrad, Grand Hyatt etc.). The bathroom is tiny and again very old. In all honesty, I have seen better rooms at a 3* Holiday Inn. 2. The service is consistently poor, from the front desk, to the concierge, to the room service staff. They just do not care and it shows. The ony friendly person is the guy who opens the door, and he was only friendly to return-guests who he recognised. He completely ignored me when I said hello to him. The only thing the Sheraton does as good as the competition is its breakfast buffet which is out of this world. Overall, I am perplexed as to why people stay at this hotel. Particularly considering it is as expensive if not more expensive than much better nearby hotels. Even Starwood know it is not up to scratch - this hotel was booted out of Starwood's \"Luxury Collection\" a few years ago! If you want this area and a name-brand hotel - stay at the Grand Hyatt just down the road.

However, when I checked in I was told that since I was paying a discounted rate, which I booked on the Starwood web site, I was not entitled to the \"normal\" amenities afforded Platinum members! I have stayed at Starwood properties all over the world and have never been told that you had to book a certain rate in order to get the standard amenties.
