{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice place This older hotel has been redone by an individual artist. As an older hotel. the room and bathroom are both small and basic. And the shower curtains did smell a little moldy and it seemed that it was difficult to air out the bathroom. The artist's unique design of each room makes the hotel a fun and unique experience, but the location is just ok--when you step out the door you don't walk out into one of the SF's neighborhoods bursting over with personality. It's near the financial district and very close the Chinatown, and a short walk to Union Square and Powell Street. They also serve a continental breakfast in kind of an awkward little room.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR359690997", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "minnie_n"}, {"Content": "Funky but noisy The Hotel Des Artes is in a great location and the art is very funky. However, the parking is more expensive than they tell you if you ask (we were told it would be $15 and it was $25 a day) Our room, at the rear of the hotel was very noisy (with the bar below being open late and then the glass bins being emptied at 4am)You can't open the windows because of the noise and there are no fans so you end up baking hot! The art in our room was damaged which was a bit disappointing. The ice machine is a nightmare and might take your hand off if your not carefully. Breakfast is packed and in a tiny room.  And finally, housekeeping! She tried to clean our room at 8am, luckily we had locked the door as she didn't knock first and we were still in bed. Second, she then tried to come back at 8.30am and then at 9am so in the end we got up and let her in. She just wouldn't take no for an answer. So no lie in for us!I think given the experience we had the location is great but the rooms overpriced.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR668459629", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "NikkiandAndy"}, {"Content": "Funky budget in the heart of the city! My husband and I wanted to spend a week in San Francisco without totally blowing our budget - we looked into the Hotel Des Artes webpage and booked the $300 FOR A WEEK explorer package. What a great deal! The place reminded me of an extremely well-kept hostel (we shared a bathroom down the hall - no problem with lines or waiting ever.) The art in the rooms was so unique (the employees will let you go into the other rooms to look at the art if they are unoccupied, too!) It was such a positive experience. And they give you bagels, coffee, tea and juice each morning, which is a plus.If you are looking for turn-down service, don't bother. But if you want something extremely reasonable in a great part of a great city, I would highly recommed it!", "Date": "May 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR111381401", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hayleyannp"}, {"Content": "Funky Alternative to chain hotels       Hotel des Artes, Peacock Room", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR492295913", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "diatwo"}, {"Content": "Unique experience       room", "Date": "Mar 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR312536236", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "letravelist"}, {"Content": "Like staying in a gallery!

Definitely a place to lose yourself in the artwork! We enjoyed a suite with fantastic murals that included glow in the dark paint (not in the bedroom).

No bedbugs either time, nice, clean rooms and a great price. We liked the central location, although we did walk through some shady areas to get there, it is San Francisco!

Be warned the photos you see of this place on the web and in magazines make it look A LOT nicer that it really is. Art hotel, sure. Boutique hotel, noooo way!Rooms are surely individual and uniquely painted, but that is all that they have going for them. Contemporary beds and the room furniture were nothing more than plywood construction w/ a nice coat of black paint. At least our chair was from Ikea. The carpet is dingy + we wore sandals the entire time for fear of foot-born illness. There was graffiti on our toilet seat. Sick. I can't imagine what it would have been like had we not splurged for the private bath.Worst of all...I woke up in the middle of the night w/ really itchy legs. After being awakened at 6:30 am by someone using a saw in the building next door, I noticed my calves and thighs were covered in bites that i didn't have prior to getting into be there. Bed bugs to the max!!! We found the staff to be quite unhelpful and not friendly. They seemed like they just don't want to be there. This place is totally a hostel in disguise.
