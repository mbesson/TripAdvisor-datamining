The breakfast was good, again pricey but good quality, prices do include a 15% service charge that I am totally against, I think tipping should remain in the interest of the customer and not demanded by the resturaunt.

Had we known how good this hotel was, we would have skipped our time in Victoria and the much trumpeted but overrated (in our view) Fairmont Empress in favour of the sleek sophistication and more personal service here. Just one reason to withhold that 5th star and that is the very early closing time (to English visitors, at least) of its restaurants. By the time of our arrival at 9 o'clock, the only dining option was the \"English-style pub\" - great fish and chips but noisy and informal and not quite what we had envisaged for our last night in Canada at this otherwise superlative hotel.

Unfortunately, my most recent stay was terrible, and it will be my last visit to that hotel. My family stayed for 4 days at the beginning of January 2011. The hotel was understaffed for the holidays, and should probably have been closed. We paid full price despite the hotel appearing to be on skeleton staff, and were not told that there would be any service difficulties when we booked. There was no parking attendant, so while paying $25 per day for parking, guests were required to phone the front desk, then wait on the street while someone was sent to open the parkade security gate to enter. Despite being expensive, the restaurant was a disaster. During our first meal we got to listen to a club member angrily complain to the wait staff about how a rotton meal has caused his son to become ill. That night our own meals were edible, but some of the entrees appeared to have been frozen and heated up in a microwave. The following night, the restaurant served us a chicken club sandwich with chicken so old that the edges had turned grey and hard. Three of the four meals served to us that night were inedible. When I complained to the shift supervisor, she decided not to charge us for our meal, which was appropriate considering we did not eat it. I hope my experience was an anomaly, and that they work out their kitchen and staffing problems. I had been happy with the hotel in the past, but the last visit was bad enough that I will not return.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn elegant establishment.\u201d", "Author": "ogilvie444", "ReviewID": "UR98853190", "Content": "I adore this hotel.

I was attending a conference at the Vancouver Convention Centre and the Terminal City Club is right on its doorstep. I managed to get a good rate through Expedia. The location couldn;t have been better. It was a very short walk to the conference but also to many other places and I think was the perfect choice of location. My room (806) was a deluxe double with city view but in fact I could just about see the harbour. The room was spacious, with good amenities. I liked having the fridge and microwave but it did seem a bit silly to have to ask for cutlery and crockery and even then they only brought my one plate, a teeny-tiny bowl, a knife, fork and spoon. The water and ice delivery in the evenings was a great idea. The bed was very comfortable indeed and I slept very well. There are only 12 rooms on each floor so not much noise. Free wi-fi was definitely a bonus. I also liked the bathroom supplies which were high quality. My bathroom was a little small but fully functional. Despite advertising in the rooms that the hotel is environmentally aware and setting out in detail what to expect from the point of view of towel and bedding changes, they still changed the towels every day apart from one. This does annoy me. If a hotel is going to have an environmental policy, then at least stick to it. Thefront desk staff were nice enough if not overly friendly. Simon in the 1892 bar was very friendly indeed. I used the bar on a few occasions and entertained some colleagues there a couple of times. There was a good choice of wines and a sophisticated atmosphere. I did not eat at the hotel. The leisure facilities are fantastic. To the people above who say the entrance is not clear and that the front desk is up some stairs, then perhaps they were at a different hotel to me. The hotel is quite clearly marked, as is the front desk which is up 5 steps from the main lobby. Beside the steps is an obvious ramp for those worried about luggage. My only minor grumbles - I would have liked cutlery & crockery to take more advantage of the small kitchenette area, a mini-bar would have been nice especially as 1892 is only open 5 nights a week and closes at 10. In-room service also finished quite early. Not that I eat and drink a lot but I was on a completely different time zone for the first few days and wide awake until into the small hours. I would definitely recommend this place and stay here again.

I spend about 75 + nights a year in hotel rooms so have a good comparison base. The room we had was decent though nothing fancy, but we had no real complaints about that. The check-in process was poor and the initial welcome was not acceptable (someone who may have been the manager was at the reception desk doing something on a computer, did not look up when we came to the desk but only grumped at us that someone would be along to check us in--not very welcoming). We arrived in the morning and were fully expecting to be asked to check our bags and come back later: no issue with that. We were told that the room would be ready by 2:00 at the latest (check-in time is 3:00). We came back at 3:45 and were told that no room was ready and to take a seat. We then noticed that a couple of other groups were sitting around waiting. They did find us a room after a 15 minute wait, but there was no apology or basic friendliness. Surprising from a top-rated hotel. On check-out, we again had an indifferent front-desk clerk, who then got quite huffed at me when I expressed surprise that they did not accept debit cards (in Canada, a debit card is a bank card to make a withdrawal directly from your account, and there are really almost no businesses that do not accept them as Canadians love this kind of transaction). I didn't get thanked for my patronage and again felt quite unwelcome. Another negative: the reception desk is almost 100 yards from the front door (up a set of stairs), so when you come in you an head right to the elevators with no one having any oversight. There is a security guard behind a desk, but he seemed to never look up when we came in and there seemed to be no way for him to know who was and who was not a legitimate guest--pretty easy to get onto the hotel floors, so I think security is a big weak point in this hotel. A plus: the location is good. We chose this hotel over our regular one (3-4 stays a year--the Cascadia Hotel Vancouver) because we were working at a nearby location for three days. We had hoped that the hotel would be good as will be back another 3-4 times this year in the same location. As we will be bringing 30 + others with us each time, we thought it might be nice to do a recon on the TC Hotel. If they couldn't treat us with respect, why should we bring them a decent amount of business on a regular basis? We'll instead go back to the hotel we know, despite the inconvenience of the location for our purposes (staff are wonderful at the Cascadia, which keeps us coming back over and over), and put our people in one of the other very good hotels close to the TC Hotel (Pan Pacific, Delta, or Fairmont Waterfront, for example).", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cobble Hill, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel with excellent staff\u201d", "Author": "bwick22", "ReviewID": "UR48091219", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one night while visiting Vancouver for a concert.

There were only 10-12 rooms per floor. For the most part, the hotel was very quiet. One night the room next to us was very loud, but I only heard them when they were in the hallway. As soon as their door was shut it was silent. The room was very large and plush. The bed and pillows were very comfortable---the floor to ceiling windows were great, and we had a very nice view of the city. I slept very well each night. The decor was stylish and the bedding was very nice. The kitchenette was handy and we used the mini-fridge and the microwave. We had plenty of coffee and tea to pick from in the room. The bathroom toiletries were also very nice. The bathroom wasn't huge, but was plenty for us. The free wireless internet was also a plus, although I was a bit wary of the internet security. I also liked getting free bottled water and chocolates each day. The 'club' pool and hot tub were also very pleasant. It was very quiet and clean and had windows with great views. The pool was setup mostly for lap swimming (not really for kids) and had pool 'exercise' equipment you could use (kickboards, etc). The pool was treated with ozone, so there wasn't a strong chlorine smell (although I think the hot tub had chlorine...) The locker area was very classy and the sauna and steam room seemed nice, although we didn't us them. They had towels to use and the front desk was very friendly. My only complaint was that the pool/fitness area closed at 10 pm. The other minor complaint I have is that some of the front desk staff seemed a bit snooty. One guy was very friendly and helpful, but another was not. The security staff did watch our luggage when we checked in at 11 am before our room was ready, which allowed us to explore for a while. Overall the location, decor, comfort of the beds, views and pool make this place great. I would recommend it to those looking for a quiet, classy place to stay downtown close to Gastown, Canada Place and other attractions.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral", "Title": "\u201cstunning hotel\u201d", "Author": "MargaretM1", "ReviewID": "UR36077028", "Content": "We had to cancel our booking of 2 nights as we were returning to UK following a family bereavement .They gave us a full refund !

We never heard a single noise from elsewhere in the hotel and the traffic noise was just a distant humm and not a bother. It is first and foremost a club so very posh and the reception staff can be a bit snooty but everyone was very efficient and the porter couldn't have been more helpful. The pool and fitness facilities are absolutely wonderful with glorious views. There is free internet access off the library. Housekeeping was very good. We never like to get up too early when on holiday and, by the time we'd had breakfast in the room, it was often after ten before we left the room but we were never disturbed and our room was always made up when we arrived back. Someone comes around every afternoon with bottled water and to fill up the ice bucket which is very convenient. The only small quibble would be that, although the suite had a small kitchen area there were no dishes or cutlery supplied when we first arrive. There was a note to say that if we wanted anything just to ring reception and they did bring dishes, etc. up as soon as we rang but it would be nicer if they were just there and you didn't have to ask. The hotel is perfectly situation - just up from the waterfront and within easy walking distance of Stanley Park, the city and Gastown. We enjoyed the Water Street Cafe in Gastown and Wild Rice which is worth going to for the food even though it is a bit of a seedy area. One thing that had worried us before we went to Vancouver was that several people had commented on the number of panhandlers on the streets and we thought it might not be safe to wander around at night.

I write to thank you and, if I may, through you, to thank all the staff and personnel at the Terminal City Club for your superb hospitality and service during my stay in Vancouver last week. This was my first visit to Canada, and so I'd like to say a special thank you to the Club for being such an outstanding ambassador for your City and Country! Names of staff particularly remember include Hiroko, who saw me through the wide range of breakfasts available to hotel guests each day: I systematically travelled to Hawaii, Tokyo, Scotland, and elsewhere around the world each morning without ever leaving the breakfast table. Melissa guided me at lunchtime, and I'd like to mention Melissa's young man who prepared that quite outstanding barbeque on Thursday evening --- it was the first time I had really tasted oyster! Nicholas was always a special delight at table, what a great personality, he made me feel most welcome and always entertained. Mike at the bar, whom I understand is famed locally by Members for never having a bad day, confided to me his secret: always to leave any troubles outside and pick them up only when leaving the premises. Excellent advice. And Mike introduced me to a full bodied red for which I was most grateful, the wine reflected the warm and personable - distinguished - nature of the Club itself. But everyone at the Club really was outstandingly helpful and I can't praise everyone enough. Mine was too short a week, on business, but the weather was good and I was able to spend quality thinking time after work walking to and from Stanley Park. At 6am each day I was in the Club pool. What a great facility. I remember the softness of the green towels; the weighing scales that lied a little more each mooring, and the wide array of cleansing lotions --- all of them magically topped up themselves as new! On my last day, Mike asked if had any constructive criticisms to make about the Club. I was glowing and not the one to ask. I have been racking my brains to find something positive to contribute in this respect. But, so far, I have not come up with anything other than praise and thanks. My only advice is: just keep doing what you do. I hope to return to Vancouver on business, but, alas, probably not until next year. Next time I shall certainly add a few extra days for leisure at the Hotel and bring my wife who sadly was not able to join me this time round. I shall of course book in again, if I may. It's the only place in town. Please tell everyone you have a number-one fan over here in Oxford. I've been telling everyone about the TC Club Hotel in Vancouver!
