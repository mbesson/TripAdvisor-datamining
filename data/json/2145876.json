We did not eat the 15 euro each buffet breakfast but instead found a wonderful organic bakery 5 mins away.

It is a beautiful historic building directly across from Retiro park. While the exterior has retained its historic look, the interior is completely modern. This conversion seems to have been pretty successful. The rooms are pretty standard hotel rooms with a nice small balcony that looks out over the street. The french doors were great for getting fresh air into the room. Storage in the room is somewhat limited as there is no closet or dresser, only a small wardrobe. A nice feature of the hotel is that the rooms have a laptop for your use. We got good wireless in our room, but they have a horrible wireless access policy. You have to physically visit the front desk to get the username and password for the day. The first day we got 24 hour access, the second day we got 3 day access. And this isn't access for the room, it is for each device. So if you have a second device (smart phone, iPad, etc.), you have to go to the front desk again for a password. It was quite annoying. Front desk staff was younger and seemed fairly inexperienced. The food and selections at the breakfast buffet are quite good. However, they are very understaffed. You first have to find a clean place to sit, and then the coffee service is quite slow. Fresh orange juice was very good as was the selection of fruit. Access to the park is wonderful, and the Prado is close by. But this hotel is quite removed from most activities in the city (Shopping, Plaza Mayor, etc.). Also, there are very limited dining options nearby. If you are looking for a good location close to the excitement that makes Madrid, this might not be the hotel for you. However, if you are looking for a hotel a little out of the way, quiet, and with access to some of Madrid's major attractions, this one might be for you.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for art lovers\u201d", "Author": "man727", "ReviewID": "UR128182017", "Content": "It is a small and elegant hotel with great views of the Retiro Park, close to the museums and within walking distance to the Plaza Mayor.

The hotel looks recently remodeled and has a space age-y feel. We didn't spend much time in the common areas or get the hotel breakfast so I can't speak to those. Our room was very spacious with high ceilings. It didn't have much of a view as it faced the back of other buildings, but that didn't matter much to us. This does affect how much light you get in the room in case that's a consideration for you. The beds were comfortable and we liked having the little individual lights by the bunk beds. They also had extra blankets in the cupboard which was helpful, as one of us liked to have the air conditioning on \"high\" whenever we were in the room. The air conditioning works really well. They also provide free wi-fi and a laptop in the room. The bathroom was a decent size and had the fanciest shower head. Considering it was so hot in Madrid that we were showering three times a day, I really appreciated it. As with the other Petit Palaces we stayed in, the bathroom door was clear glass with the center smoked out. Since the bathroom door faced away from the beds, the light from bathroom wasn't as intrusive, but I still think the bathroom doors are impractical. Maybe they could smoke out nearly the entire door to block the light yet maintain the modern look. The hotel is located right across the street from Retiro Park (which is absolutely lovely!). It's also particularly close to the Prado and within walking distance of the Reina Sofia and the Thyssen Bornemisza. Although it's close to these sites, it's actually in a quiet, residential neighborhood. There are several restaurants right along the same block and even more restaurants if you walk to Calle Serrano and Calle de Alcala (only a 5-10 min. walk).
