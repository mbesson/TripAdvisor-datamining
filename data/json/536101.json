I just took photo of three of them, he said then there is just FEW of them not many as you say! can you believe it??? I myself am Iranian but I think the main problem is because of iranian passengers who don't care about such problems, they don't expect much from the hotel to be clean rooms or good food, although they have paid enough for a much better hotel (like Moscow hotel for example) and I think it's because they're mostly from small cities in Iran or they wouldn't stay in that hotel for a night.

We got our rooms on the 2nd floor next to each other they were clean until we went into the bathrooms, they were filthy both of them. The cleaning staff were in the hall way I called them in to clean them and they did the best they could but the bath tubs had cracks in them with solid dirt in them, while they were doing that the kids were in the balcony\u2019s and when they came back in the rooms they doors wouldn\u2019t lock again, I called the maintenance staff up to have a look at it, all he said was I am sorry I cant fix it, but don\u2019t worry the girls will be fine in room. NO WAY was I going to let my girls sleep in a room that had the doors unlocked. I then went down to the reception to get the rooms changed, they said no problem at all by now it\u2019s around 6pm we have not even had time to eat yet. We got moved to other rooms to be honest they were not much better the only good thing was they both had 2 queen size beds in each room, but we just wanted rest and have something to eat. We were told the staff will being our luggage to the new rooms in around 10 mins but we waited for 1hr called the reception they said they will send someone up, another half again no one came I just went and got the 4 suitcases and 3 bags myself. The girls ended up sleeping in our room. What a waste of night that was. 13th Jan 2009- The breakfast was quit good we left the hotel around 11am, I left the notice on the door saying \u201cservice the room\u201d we got back at around 6pm to get changed to go out for a meal and surprise surprise the room was just as we left it, again I called the cleaning staff and they said they will be up shortly. We left and came back in at 11pm, the girls went to there room 20 mins later they came screaming back to our room. Saying there were COCKROCHES in the bathroom I went to have look and there were 4 under the sink and back of the toilet, Furious I went to the reception and talked to the night manager, he said we will move you to other rooms AGAIN \u2026\u2026 so we were now moved to the 3rd floor, the rooms were a little larger, the girls were so frightened they again slept in out room. 14th Jan 2009- Again the breakfast had a nice selection, they rooms were cleaned while we were out over all the day was actually good. 15th Jan 2009- Had breakfast and went out enjoying our last day in Dubai until we got back to the hotel at night around 9pm we had a flight at 8am back home. We went to check the girls room for cockroaches and there they were in the bathroom again by this time the girls were terrified even to sleep in out room, my wife calmed them down and went to our room, I went down to inform the manger again, to be honest I lost my temp with him he cam up and had a look for himself apologised and said he will call our booking agents Asia travel for a full refund for 1 room to be arranged I got a letter confirming that. I was shocked when I went back to my own room there were COCKROCHES there too, to be honest even the manager was shocked he offered us another room change but we didt want to move again it was our last night, there was one in the bed and several around the room, this time I took photos I have uploaded them here. We were so glad to leave the hotel at 5am. We didt sleep at all that night. Still waiting for my refund..........

I read the reviews with mixed feelings and hoped for the best thinking that you get what you pay for and also that it wasn't bottom of the pile here on TA. It took an eternity to find it - not the hotels fault I grant you but some better directions would be in order. Nowhere to park other than pay meter parking at 20AED. Who has 20 x 1 AED coins with them I ask... ( put my Visa card into one of those street meters - you are kidding me) I abandoned the car and left my suitcase in it. Figured I'd sort out any difficulty later. The hotel wasn't good. In fact it was awful. My low expectations were not even close to imagining how poor it was. The decor was a cross between a down market curry house in a depressed northern British city and a brothel. Hideous brown paintwork competed with appalling shades of vinyl seat covers... The room I was allocated was filthy and had not been serviced. God knows what stains were on the bed but I rather suspected somebody had been murdered or deflowered on there the previous night... On complaining the service team came to check and at first seemed to think I was being awkward before agreeing that perhaps it needed cleaning ...perhaps...????......They gave me another room that had been 'serviced' but that was grubby as well. Iron burns on the carpet, no curtains to speak of, no tea or coffee making facility , just not clean and not fresh in any way. It also seemed way to close to the night clubs I had seen on the way in. I sat on the bed having carefully checked it for body spills. I weighed up my options and decided that I didn't like it and I especially didn't like the idea of 8 days of it. I went to reception and had a stand up row to get my passport back - they claimed I had already got it back- and I left to find somewhere else. Do yourself a favour and don't go here. If you are used to UK Travelodge or better you will hate it.

We would not have stayed even if paid to do so, it was appalling. We couldn't get out quick enough and refused to check in, saying we would be reporting them to Dubai Tourism for gross misrepresentation, they should be removed from their web site.

the worst hotel we ever stayed at. === On arrival after our long journey from ireland, we stepped into dubai airport, it was beautiful, even though we were tired and jet lagged, it was our first visit to dubai, so not knowing what to do we went to information, to see how to get to our hotel, either by bus or taxi, taxi was recommended, so of we went, after about 20 min we arrived in a part of dubai called deira, it was near the famous gold markets,when we stepped into the foyer we looked at each other, and my heart sank, it was dull and scruffy looking, we filled in some forms and were taken to the lift with our baggage, by the bell boy i would say he was helpful, the lifts were smelly, and scruffy, finally our rooms on 4th floor no 406 and 409, when i opened the door and seen my room i knew i had made a bad mistake,the carpets were disgusting and dirty, so bad you needed to have something on your feet , the tiles were mouldy in the bathroom and you wondered to yourself was it safe to sit on the toilet seat.. the bases of the beds were also very dirty looking, we had booked a double room for ourselfs, and a twin room for our daughters. double room was 2 single beds pushed together, so when you lay in the centre you nearly fell on the floor between the 2 beds. they had given us some sort of heavy blankets, that you were afraid to touch, my wife took at least 1hour before she could get her breath, with the smell in the room, lights were not working on the walls, by now we were really tired, so sleep was getting the better of us, my wife asked me to close the so called curtains on the veranda, but when i went to do this , i noticed that the lace curtains were missing as well as the runners, all that was there was 2 heavy curtains that were fixed either side of the window, i knew if i went to move these the whole frame holding them would probly break., so we had to sleep first night with no privacy. and people across the road could see clearly into the room. when i lay down i found myself getting very itchy, as if the bed was alive with fleas, this also happened with my wife. after getting up a few times , with scratching myself, we finally fell asleep,, next morning my wife showed me little lumps or bites on her back, i went to front desk and told them about curtains and no wall lights, maintainence man arrrived about 20 mins later, told us he would sort out the curtains, so he used the 2 heavy curtains, and pulled them closed in the middle and joined them with a large pin, this was ok, i thought, this would only be for a short time, but was still like this on the morning of our departure. so we had no veranda or sun during the day. i asked at reception were the pool was located , they told me it was under renovation, so i went for a look, on the top floor, there was a pool ok, with no water, looked like it had not been in use for a few years, actually there were black rubbish bags thrown into the base of the pool, it was totally disgraceful. nothing was matching the photos and the information we had seen on the internet. when we booked this DUMP. the breakfast was very poor, we tried to contact the company we had made the reservation with ,,,, they asked me for my ref no, but the paper with this was locked away with our passports, so it was a waste of time trying to explain, i will be reporting this to the u.a.e tourism board, i know if someone owned a hotel like that , over in ireland, the health people would close it down, thia was meant to be a special holiday as my oldest girl is getting marrried next feb07. so this was our last family holiday . and what a dissapointing one it turned out to be alll because of the hotel we had booked, i have contacted the travel company we booked this through, to see what they have to say, after alll ,,, they are given false information. i left the best bit to last, on thurs we went out around the souks, for a walk, came back to hoel around 11.30 pm, room next to ours had a massage sign over the door, i said to my wife i never noticed this before, and us only next door, next thing some girs, chinese ithink, came to the door and asked my wife and myself if we wanted massage, we both replied no thank you, as we had to pack our cases, as we were leaving for the airport 4 am, well let me put it another way, it was the first time that so many people visited that one room, the 5 days we stayed there/ it was disgusting with my wife and myself one side and my 2 daughters the other side of this room. i will never use this company again, i would safely say it would be better to sleep in one of the parks or even on the street. watch this space later when i will attach photos of this dump, they called it 3 stars, i rate it less than 1 star. never stay
