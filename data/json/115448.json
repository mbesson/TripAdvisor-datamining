Stay anywhere else--the Mariott on Market, Loews, the Bellevue, the Double Tree. It'll cost more, but it'll be worth your sanity. Two colleagues and I had to stay here forr three nights because it was what out employer would pay for. The staff was very nice, but even the most wonderful, accommodating people could not ameliorate the situation. People stay here because it's very cheap--you probably can't stay anywhere else in Philly for under $70. It is next door to a homeless men's shelter (and yes, they will say things to you and approach you), but it is across from a police station. We are from NY and are used to urban areas. However, we don't like to slum it, which is what we had to do at the Travelodge. Our rooms were tiny--no big deal, as we weren't going to be I our rooms often. But We didn't have any exterior windows. Our windows featured security glass, like the mind seen in prisons, and had lovely views of the hallway. You can hear everything through the paper thin walls--the beeping elevator buttons, the conversation in the next room, the sounds from the room above. My remote control's back panel was missing, so I had to use it upside down. My blanket had holes in it, and whenever I turned on the shower, the wall/pipes rattled loudly. The continental breakfast consisted of cold cereal, bagels, muffins, and hot beverages. Every day we stopped down for coffee, I noticed one yogurt (and only one yogurt) out for the taking. Odd. The low cost attracts normal, unsuspecting travelers but it attracts some class-less people, too. I was awoken at 4:04 am when I heard a guy pounding violently on his buddy's door, screaming that he was in dire need of a cheeseburger. It seems that many of the guests at the Travelodge enjoy standing in the hallway and yelling conversations to their friends at odd times of the day. On the last night I was there, I awoke with three bug bites I did not have when I went to sleep... I appreciate that this hotel fulfills a need for the budget traveler, but my advice is to avoid this place at all costs. Do you like getting more than five hours' sleep? Don't stay at the Travelodge. Do you like catcalls from the homeless? Don't stay at the Travelodge. Do you like getting a bargain, and then realizing that you've actually been duped into overpaying for the most horrible, uncomfortable stay you've ever had?

As there aren't many value hotels with free breakfast and free high speed Internet to choose from, we looked this hotel up through trip advisor. The homeless shelter next to the hotel made us worried before we got there, but things turned out better than we expected. First thing, location. This hotel is right next to the Philadelphia Convention Center and just a block from Reading Terminal Market. It was so easy to find! We just used the city map provided by the information desk at 30th street station and things worked out great. This hotel is also close to other landmarks like the Liberty Bell and Chinatown, all within walking distance. Right next to the hotel, there is a small convenience store that sells snacks and other amenities. This hotel is not far from the SEPTA station and it took us just 5 mins to get to 30th Street station. Really conveninent! Price and service come next. Staying at main hotel brands doesn't fit into our budget, this hotel provided a nice, comfortable place for us to spend the night in the city. Though the room was a little dark when all lights were on, we did not care much since we spent most of our time outside anyway. The bed was comfortable and the restroom and shower were clean. The signals of the wifi were really strong that my friend and I were able to upload photos to our blogs instantly. There are not many varieities for breakfast items though, they only had bagels, muffins, yogurt, and cereals. But the toaster made my bagels alright. One thing I have to pick about the free breakfast is, their coffee is tasteless. If you are a coffee lover, I recommend that you go pick up a starbucks instead.

The Travelodge is located in a convenient location for visiting the city center and is in easy walking distance to the Convention Center, Chinatown, and historic attractions.

The sink was out in the sleeping area, which was also very small. There were red stains on the carpet which I hope was paint not blood. There was a burn hole in the bedspread. We had planned to stay 2 nights but decided during dinner that we weren't staying the second night. Fortunately we only live an hour away. This would be OK if the price was $50-$60 but not $107, its basically just a place to sleep.", "Date": "October 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cQuite new, good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2526468", "Content": "Looking for a good place to stay right in the center of Philadelphia as I was for two nights? Yes, this could be it. No need for a car here. If you arrive by plane, just take the RR1 to Market East Station and the Travelodge is about a 7-minute walk away. Then, walking will take you to all the places that are of interest within the city. This property is quite new. And that also means that there is an area nearby that is not so new and you will feel a little bit unsafe, especially when it\u00c2\u00b4s dark outside. But the Travelodge itself and all its rooms are new and therefore in an excellent condition. However, you get a clean room and that\u00c2\u00b4s about it. The bathroom and the hairdryer are in good shape, too, but the sink will be in your room and not in the bathroom. As mentioned in other reviews, the windows will not allow an interesting look outside. From my room, I was opposite an office building that I could nearly reach by stretching out my arm. And what about your privacy when you get a room with a window facing the interior corridor? You can expect all the usual amenities here. The breakfast is just the basic stuff really. Only coffee, orange juice and a danish, sometimes bread, are provided. Had one problem when my room key did not work on day two, but that was solved promptly.", "Date": "September 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pottstown, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "JasonDiff", "ReviewID": "UR1709183", "Content": "A great location adjacent to PA Convention Center makes this hotel a great value for the money.
