WE wanted a hotel that was near to the main attractions and with good transport links (tram). The hotel nice and comfortable (a bit on the small side). It was clean and pleasant. There was a buffet breakfast which I would say was very limited but OK. The big downside for us was the building work right next door on the main road side. It seemed to start at night (may be we did not notice them during the day as we were out). and go on till early morning. The sound of the drills and cutting equipment made sleeping impossible. So check before you boook to ensure thsi building work is over. As if this was not enought, form late night the main road was being used as a racing track for motor bikes. We wre subject to contant screeching of tyres and roars of engines. This hotel is not for you if you are a light sleeper. Apart from that, could not fault the hotel. Staff were friendly as you would expect. The hotel itself was of a good standard.

The tiny table and desk are helpful, but the chair is always a challenge to bang into one piece of furniture or another. We did have one minor misunderstanding which started us off on a bad footing. We were presented with a coupon for a \"Welcome Cocktail\" in the rooftop bar. We went there that night and chose cocktails from the bar menu, only to be told they meant a specific \"Welcome Cocktail\" concoction prepared for guests. That miscommunication cost us about 25 lira and I felt a reputable business would have said, \"We're sorry for not communicating or printing on the coupon what we meant -- we will take the loss.\" They were adamant about payment so we had little choice but to absorb it.

The famous Blue Mosque is a few minutes walk down the road from Pierre Loti and you have a wonderful view of this from the roof top terrace in the hotel. Explore the Grand Bazaar, a short walk up the road and don't forget the Spice Bazaar near the marina. Expect to Haggle in the markets and never pay the asking price for anything. There a plenty of lovely restaurants within walking distance fo the hotel serving tastey traditional Turkish dishes. Currency exchange is quick and easy, but avoid this in the banks and hotel as the rates are often more favourable in the kiosks in the town.

Upon arrival, we found that the driver who had been arranged by the hotel for a free Airport transfer dad been waiting all this time. Astonishingly, he had no complaint whatsoever. In fact, he was more than happy to give us a guide tour during the forty five minute trip between the airport and the hotel. Great start! Upon arriving at the hotel, their was an instant appreciation of the difficulties we had had in getting there. Check-in took more than five minutes for ten people which we really appreciated. There were some details which the hotel required from us, however, we were told that we could provide these once we were settled in. The hotel itself was located in the most ideal of locations considering we were on a sightseeing trip of the city. It is centrally located to most of the recommended places worth visiting, many of which are within walking distance. Once inside, the hotel is very quiet. This was most surprising considering the hotel was fully booked. We had three triple rooms where we were more than comforatable. The rooms are not the biggest we have stayed in, howeevr, they are more than manageable. The room & the hotel is very clean throughout. What we enjoyed & appreciated the most was the willingness of the staff always being at hand to help. One example of this was when we arrived back at the hotel at 2am with my partner barely being able to walk having walked into a bollard. The Reception Manager (Muharram)was happy to send someone to the Pharmacy to get an ice pack for us. Once we realised that it was not nearby we declined but we had a bag full of ice cubes delivered to our room within two minutes. And then there was the Reservations Manager (Pinar) who ended up taking full responsibilty for out itinerary during our stay. She was constanly intersted in what we had planned for the day and then built a plan for us around that having taken the trouble to genuinely understand the things we enjoyed doing. If I have to be critical, particulary considering the trip had been made in December during their winter was the fact that we could not get the room cool when we felt hot.

Switched it immediately. Room was immaculately clean. Don't know how she got a room with a small window...i had two long french windows that opened. View from the room was amazing. Room was absolutely a good size as European rooms go. Had plenty of space with a brand new double bed, desk, two night tables, and small cafe table with chairs. Carpeting was immaculately clean( I wear white socks and can attest to this). Linens were spotless. No smell or odor in the room. Breakfast had excellant choices...typical european breakfast. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food and view in the restuarant on the roof were both great. Even ordered room service, and it was outstand quality and service. On the downside, in all fairness, was the resturant hostess (a blonde girl)...took my order, never brought me my bottled water, left me sitting while she proceeded to scream and I mean scream in her cellphone. She paced around the restaurant the whole time screaming in her cellphone. Still no water. Thank God for the waiter, who was kind and amazing or I would still be sitting there waiting. The hostess proceeded to use her cellphone while I ate my dinner...still screaming. Really rude to the guests. Definitely did not want to work with the guests. I feel badly for all the rest of the staff, as she was the ONLY disappointment..I would NEVER keep her employed in that capacity, as she did not care for the guests, and was not up to the standard of the rest of the employees who knocked themselves out for the guests. I would never consider staying anywhere else but here. Staff and hotel were both amazing! Location is the best in Istanbul.

It was smack bang in the middle of all the historic buildings, all within walking distance. Is located in Sultanahmet, close to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and the Grand Bazaar. Whilst our visit to Istanbul Ramadan started, which was great, the atmosphere was great, there was entertainment put on near the Blue Mosque everynight which seemed to be telvised somewhere, but this was happening all around. Just outside the hotel, just before the fast was broken a band of four ment would recite some religious verses with musical instruments, it was great! I was concerned that maybe shops etc would be closed during the day, but all were open, just note, Grand Bazaar closed on Sunday, else most shops still open. It was a great atmosphere for families, couples etc. The tram ran outside and had stops very close by, one to the left and one to the right which was very slightly downhill. As you come out of the Hotel and walk up the main street to the tram stop on the left, just infront of the stop at the side is the kiosk from where you purchase the plastic coins you need to use the Tram. It costs about \u00c2\u00a31.50 a coin. You use one coin for your trip to where ever you are going, whether it is 1 stop away or 20 stops away. The trams are airconditioned too. Rooms in the hotel are cosy, but did the job, the room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels left too. Is a basic ensuite with a shower, but hey, does the job. Beds were a little uncomfortable, but then again, I find that any bed that is not mine uncomfortable. Breakfast is basic, this was a bit dissapointing, it always seemed a bit random, who has fries for breakfast? Well that was one of the options on everyday. Otherwise, lots of bread, cheese, jam, honey, boiled eggs, cereal, olives. On the occasion got tomatoes with melted cheese, mushrooms with melted cheese and fries! You could order omellettes at an extra cost of 10-15 Liras, which we did order once, OK, but not worth getting again. Cordials available, but if you wanted freshly squeezed orange juice it was extra. We used to go out and have freshly squeezed juices at a much lower price and they were lovely, plently available. Staff were pleasant and spoke good english. There is a PC available in the reception area for you to use and access the Internet. Was going to use the spa facilities but never got the time as were out and about most the time till late, so just didnt get round to it so cant tell you much on that. Airconditioning was fine, I know it runs on a system that the airconditioning/electrics switch off when you take out the key card, but then why have it on and waste electricity when you are out all day, yes the room is a little stuffy on your return, but soon cools down. The room did have a refrigerator, but it was not cold, things were just slightly cool, so was disappointed with this, as I needed to drink chilled water as the water did not taste very nice (bottled water), had to find a shop that sold cordial to put in my bottled water. The people are very friendly, just speak to them with respect just how you would want to be spoken to. Taxis, haggle the prices as with the prices when shopping, you will learn where to and where not too, but taxi drivers will charge you a lot so dont ever pay what they ask for and sort the price out in advance. All in all, great place, will do it again, but remember Istanbul is not cheap, yes somethings may be, but restaurants are about the same as the UK. Just one personal note, whilst we were there, a lady sold some knitted socks and such items just to the left of the Hotel, she would be there everyday in the baking sun, all day, with her son who was in a wheelchair. On our last day, we wanted to give her some money and take maybe a pair of socks so it didnt look too much like charity, but she wasnt there! She was there everyday from about 9am until late afternoon, but we were unfortunate to not meet her before we left. If you do see her, don't make the same mistake we did, buy something from her.

We were given room 103 (photo uploaded) which was on a corner of the building and hence had two window bays with a desk in one and a chair and table in the other. The room was therefore a good size and had plenty of space on the floor for a large hard case. The room overlooked the main road (trams and a few slow cars / vans) at the front of the hotel with the Cemberlitas tram station about 100m away. Yes there was some noise but not enough to be a problem. The buffet breakfast was adequate. It was a shame that omelettes and cappuchinos, both of which I enjoy, were (clearly marked) extras. So none of the concerns raised by the poor reviews were a problem for me (although I can understand that for some they may be) and I definitely would consider staying here again, especially for the excellent location. A tip for travelling to the hotel from the airport. Take the metro from the airport to Zeytinburnu (fare 1.5 TL) and then the tram to Cemberlitas (not Sultanahmet) (fare also 1.5TL). The tram starts at Zeytinburnu and therefore far less likely to be crowded than if changing at Aksaray and the hotel is nearer the Cemberlitas stop than Sultanahmet.

Related to the breakfast, I find it very normal (cereals, bread, cheese, jam, juices, coffee,\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), nothing special, just OK. The location is brilliant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really in the heart of Sultanahmet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very close to Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and Grand Bazaar. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a Starbucks addicted, you can find one really near and if you need to change some money, that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bank facility, open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., really close to the hotel. The staff was very helpful. I only had a problem with the electricity, but then they explained me that I was placing the keycard in a wrong way. At the last day, around 4 a.m., we had problems with our transfer and the hotel staff helped us a lot. We arrived at the airport, at time, because of the proximity from the hotel to the Ataturk airport. Istanbul is a wonderful city and Turkish people are extremely nice! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re attracted to the Turkish culture and if you like the fact of the city is located in two different countries, Europe and Asia, then go ahead and fly to Istanbul! I do not regret my choice. This hotel has a perfect location, a good quality-price relation and excellent views from the roof restaurant (You can see the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and so much more)!

As a TripAdvisor fan, I had to force the issue by threatening to book online. My partner and I were picked up at the airport by a hotel courtesy bus at reasonable cost, and also returned to the airport the same way. Booking in was made simple by helpful staff, particularly the petite young lady on the desk but I am unfair; ALL the staff were helpful. Free drinks in the bar as we booked in whilst the luggage made its way to the room. Yes, the rooms are a little small, we are both tall, but there was everything there. Free coffee maker, a mini-bar, a free safe, easy chairs and plenty of hangers in the wardrobe, but no chest of drawers. Still, even for a week, there was plenty of space, even after shopping. There was a minor problem with the room but the hotel moved us whilst we ate our first breakfast. Breakfasts are on the top floor, but the lifts stop one floor below so disabled guests might not be able to reach it. The food was adequate, but simple. Three containers of hot dishes, a large range of cereals, cheeses, vegetables and bread (the white was very moreish), a few cakes, some sort of fruit juices in a dispenser, tea and coffee and be quick if you want a mini-croissant. Breakfast 7.30-10.30am. Freshly squeezed fruit juices and omlets are extra, we had delicious orange juice at 5 lira each, (we called lira yettels). The Turks don't seem to eat a lot a fruit, its even difficult to buy, locally. We did not use the bar or the health spa downstairs so I cannot comment, but I did use the free Internet. As others have said, there are two i's, use the one with a dot over it, and the @ is a little tricky too, but the young man on reception is helpful here. If hotels are all about location, this hotel wins, hands-down, against the big boys such as the Hilton, Ritz Plaza and the Marmara. You are very close to all the main historic sites, the mosques and churches, Topkapi museum and the incredible cisterns and much more. The mostly crowded trams run past the hotel and 1.4 yettels will get you down to the sea front and the Spice bazaar (a must) and the Bosphorus water tours. There is also a small mall of famous name shops by the waterfront. A short walk in the opposite direction from the hotel will get you to a bus terminal where the 94 (?) will take you to its other terminus and the twin shopping centres of Capacity and Carousel (the former with high quality shops plus Marks and Spencer clothing). That same walk (to the left) will also lead you to the Grand Bazaar which is huge. (There is a small bazaar to the left of the Blue Mosque as well). There is a lot of shopping in this area around the hotel but not always high quality, but DO barter. Put your own price/value on something and stick to your guns, you may win. Fake LaCoste shirts in this area are double what you pay in the underpasses around the Spice Bazaar. Eating around the hotel is good, even for us non-meat eaters. The hotel will get you a free mini-bus to and from a very good restaurant near the waterside although it was the most expensive place we ate in, at 140 yettles for the two of us. Around the hotel we usually paid under 100. We used the Central (to the right and across the road) three times and the Sultanahmet fish restaurant up the road past the cistern, twice. Both highly recommended. As you walk everywhere you are accosted by restaurants and shops enticing you into their premises. Exchange good humour with them and be as polite as they are to fully enjoy the experience. Being Israeli, we wanted to visit the Neve Hashalom synagogue. This is quite tricky and needs to be pre-booked. The hotel staff were great in organising this. They also pre-booked a open-topped (weather permitting) Grayline tour bus that takes you on a 90-minute tour of this vast city. Worth every yettle. This was the end of October and the weather was mixed, from glorious to diabolical on one day, so take an umbrella and some warm clothes. And don't forget your camera. We first visited Turkey on a cruise in June 2008 and instantly fell in love with the country and its people. Its racial tolerence should serve as a benchmark.

There are lots of really nice cafes nd restaurants surrounding the hotel and for those of us who like familiar territories, Starbucks is across the road and McDonalds about a 100 yards away.

About the hotel: This is small hotel with about 15 - 20 rooms. The room was comfortable but space was limited. There were tea coffee facilities, a basic minibar, and a safe provided in the room. The bathroom was reasonably nice with good pressure in the shower! You get nice fresh towels and a bathrobe. The hairdryer provided left my hair really frizzy so take your own. The socket connection is two round holes similar to those in France. The staff were friendly and helpful and had good knowledge of the area. There is free wireless internet in the lobby and in the room. There is also a computer with internet facilities in the lobby and refreshingly, it is free to use. The turkish keyboard has two \"i\"s so its a bit difficult to use. Breakfast is a bit disappointing. Its served on the top floor and you have to pay extra for an omlette, eggs or freshly squeezed juice. Cold stuff is free but limited in choice. I didnt fancy rice krispies for breakfast and there was limited choice of healthy cereals. We ended up not going to breakfast altogether as there are loads of nice cafes outside that serve hot breakfast at a very reasonable price. The hotel has a traditional turkish bath. For a 2 and half hour session including exfoliation and massage, it cost 50 Euros. Definately worth the money. Very good experience and it leaves the skin baby soft. There are other traditional turkis baths in the area but are not as clean and modern as the one at Pierre Loti. I would definately recommend this hotel. About the weather: I arrived in Istanbul on the 18th of October and the weather was pleasant. You need a light jacket during the day and something a bit heavier at night. We were able to dine alfresco almost everywhere though. It can rain in istanbul in october and a mac/umbrella would be a wise option. If you are blonde - better to dye your hair a darker colour as it can attract alot attention - sometimes pleasant but sometimes it can be a bit much. Guys in Istanbul are friendly (and cocky) so you get approached on the street alot. I enjoyed the friendliness and it was all good fun! A cruise on the Bosphorous is definately recommended. On one side you see the asian coast and on the other the eurpoean coast. You pass under the bridge that connects the two continents. A 90 minute cruise cost us \u00c2\u00a32 each!!!! You get it from Emininou and a cab ride from Pierre Loti in Sultanahmet to Eminiou costs about 12 YTL or \u00c2\u00a35. If you are considering going to Istanbul - dont hesitate as you are bound to enjoy it!", "Date": "October 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "leeds", "Title": "\u201cwatch out\u201d", "Author": "mohayat2000", "ReviewID": "UR21111671", "Content": "After having travelled for the last 7 or more hours we were expected to relax in the hotel for a few hours but this luxury was denied for another 1 hour or so, due to the fact that the room we booked was out of order reason given was electricity travelling to the taps so this posed a health hazzard ??. However my suspicions were that the room was double booked however as a compensation package we were treated to 2 free orange juices for breakfast we should have been greatful but were not impressed, there were other incentives 10% of mini bar and free sauna/hammam which we didnt have the pleasure of taking of advantage of. The hotel we were transfered to for the 1st night was not in such a good location, and much further away than we had anticipated also the quality of the hotel not as good, we did try to complain b4 we left but no real notice was taken.

Yes, you could pay extra and get an omlette or fresh squeezed juice, but the regular juice is just as good. The hotel was also decorated nicely inside. My only complaint is that the room was a little small, but that is compared to American hotel rooms. Compared to European hotel rooms, they were the normal size.

All of the staff in the hotel are very helpful and friendly. The staff at reception were particularly good with travel advice and directions. The only disappointment was the Russian woman in the hotel's health club. She was surly, aggressive and unhelpful.

The result of the match may have been a disappointment, but the hotel certainly was not! From the start, check in was relaxed and welcoming with a complimentary drink while they sorted out the formalities. Room was on the small side, but adequate and clean (although a bit more storage would have been useful). Some noise at night from trams, restaurant downstairs and people in the street, but if you are bothered about this you could always ask for a room that doesn't overlook the main street. Breakfast was nothing special, although great views of the skyline (including Blue Mosque), but freshly squeezed fruit juice and omlettes are available for a small premium. Extremely convenient location for the main attractions in the Old City and beyond; walking distance of Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Hagya Sofya etc. and very close to the tram stop that will take you further afield. However, it is a nightmare for taxi drivers; the hotel is on the corner of a dead end street and traffic is barred from the main road (trams only). Before my visit I was slightly concerned about being a lone female visitor to Istanbul, but the service and general helpfulness of staff soon quelled any concerns. There are of course many 'boutique' hotels in Sultanahmet area and although some are in a much prettier location I would still recommend the Pierre Loti for its convenience to everything and warm hospitality.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pierre Loti Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295494-Reviews-Pierre_Loti_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$137 - $370*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piyerloti Cad.
