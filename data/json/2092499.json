BUT the bed was comfortable and housekeeping came each day to change and clear/clean. The kitchen is far from fully equipped - purely basic utensils and a microwave built in almost at ceiling level. An African village could benefit for a whole year from the wasted water that has to be run off for the longest time before the hot water kicks in. The tiles throughout are grubby - although mopped each day, it really needs a hand/knees approach with scouring liquid. Reception, housekeeping and conceirge staff were very pleasant. The decor and the vast room service menu where more focused on MidEast guests. It is the only place I have stayed that do not have yogurts and fresh juices on the breakfast buffet. Very mediocre.

The apartments/suites were well furnished with quality fittings and furnishings with seperate bedrooms and sitting areas (a flat screen satellite TV in each).The kitchenette area was well equipped for cooking and washing requirements if wanted. It was very quiet with comfortable double beds using quality linens. Rooms were made up efficiently and in good time. The only major drawback was the shower/bath arrangement - a walk-in shower or 'wet-room' arrangement would have been better as the step in to the bath (no grab handles) for a shower would be hazardous for an elderly or infirm guest. The shower arrangement was more style over substance as there was poor water pressure at the shower head and also took a very long time to warm up. Getting taxis was often not easy and the concierge/door staff were often absent doing other things leaving guests to fend for themselves for taxis etc. The location is away from the frenetic bright lights of Dubai which will probably suit some. There is a good supermarket in the hotel building and a bank opposite to the rear (ATM). The hotel's advertising blurb says it is close to the Mall of the Emirates which stretches the definition of 'close' - although it can be seen it is not possible to walk there and a taxi or the close-by metro needs to be used.

We were on the 5th floor no problems with lift regularity etc We checked in and out in the middle of the night without any hassle either end. Staff were all friendly and helpful through out. breakfast is a feast with something for everyone -my wife is a vegetarian and had plenty of choice. The food in the 24hr cafe is 'food court style' and was perfectly ok but basic.We ate their twice after midnight. The 24hr supermarket was handy and about average in price. The suite was very clean and we saw the cleaning take place one day and it was thorough. The suite comprised of a large bedroom with plenty of clothes storage We had to ask for coat hangers which arrived in minutes. The kitchen had plenty of crockery and cutlery. It included microwave, hob and washing machine but no dryer so the room was decked out with our wet clothes. The bathroom was clean and the shower worked fine. There was a separate loo and bidet. The lounge had 2 leather settees,a coffee table and a writing bureau which we felt made the room a bit cramped. Of The other facilities, the out door pool was small with a rather cramped sun bathing area and seemed to be out of the sun for most of the afternoon -the indoor pool was a good pool for swimming,with a rather distant seating area which for parents with young children may not have been close enough. Location was fine although the walk to the metro was across sandy unfinished pavements so not too friendly for ladies in heels or wheelchair users or pram pushers. (For fist timers to Dubai get yourself a gold class rail card it will save you a packet on taxis.) My only beef with the hotel is they charge 150 ds each way for airport transfers when our taxi was about 70dhs each way.

I would not have liked to spend a week there but it would be ideal for a short stay business trip. The pool was not in an ideal location on the first floor and not good for catching the sun.

The Supermarket seemed to stock most things and the small restaurant served Starbucks coffee....cannot comment on the food as I never ate there. The outdoor pool is located on the first floor, for me this is not where you would want to spend the day, it is quite small and sun beds can be at a premium, however it is clean and towels are provided whilst using the area...we found it perfect to \"have a dip\" after a days sightseeing or after business. This hotel is perfect to use as a base, taxi's can be easily obtained and trips to most local places will be 15-20 UAD...for pure value this hotel will be hard to beat, but if you want a little luxury or a place where you can finish the night off with one of the cocktails Dubai is famous for, look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kaufbeuren, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNightmare\u201d", "Author": "Martin X", "ReviewID": "UR119570558", "Content": "This hotel was way the worst experience I ever had. After an 8h flight we arrived at the hotel at 6.30AM. As expected we could not check in, but this hotel is the first that wanted to charge us extra for storing our luggage until we could check in (requested on top amount was the same than the room fare!!!). It took us one hour until we could fix the storage of our luggage with an unfriendly and unhelpful clark. There were no possibilities for us to freshen up or than sitting in the lobby until we could check in at 2PM, so we decided to go for sightseeing and check in later. When we came back at 8PM the concierge requested us to wait. After 15 min of waiting in the lobby without any progress we got angry as the two clerks only were going around our questions, we found out that our room was still not arranged. They told us to wait 30 more minutes (this was more than 13 hours after we first tried to check in and 6 hours after the announced check in time of 2PM). As we had a business dinner at 9PM we decided to \u201cfreshen up\u201d on the toilet and went to the dinner undressed and smelling. When we came back at 11.30PM our luggage was standing unattended in the lobby, even they promised us to store it for us until we will be back. The only good thing was that we finally could move into the room we thought. The room it self was the same nightmare, it was dirty, the bedding was not fresh as well as the cosmetics that were used. We did hot have hot water and the bath was flooded when we moved into the room as the shower was leaking. When I tried to talk to somebody responsible, no manager was available and up to now I did not get any response to my complaint. With the check out we had the same trouble. We nearly missed our flight as the check out took us 30 minutes more than expected because of technical problems.

We had a pleasant stay, despite of some glitches. The staffs in the hotel are very nice and friendly. They always welcome us with smiles all the time. The concierge was trying to help us by recommending some things to do. Oh, they have lots of discount coupons on the lobby, near the reception, you can take the booklets and use the discounts. Very handy. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment. Our room was nice, though it is kind of small for two adults and three children. But it's very cozy. The furniture and amenities are good qualities. They cleaned our room daily. They gave us extra blankets when we asked them. The bathrooms are modern and nice, though the shower leaked some water out everytime we took a shower. No big deal though, because they always change our towels and linens everyday. The kitchen is small but has everything we need, stove, kettle, toaster, microwave oven, pots and pans, etc. The washing machine is very handy to use, but unfortunately they don't have any hanging rack for us to hang our damp clothes, so we have to make do with putting our clothes all over the furniture to dry them. The TV has mostly Arabic channel, but we are outside most of the time anyway, so it doesn't matter. The small convenient store in the same building is very handy. The pool ... hmmm ... on the last 2 nights we stayed there, it was very dirty (the pool on the 1st floor). I know it was Eid holiday and maybe lots of people are using it, because the day before Eid, we used the pool and it was sparkling and very clean. They should try harder to clean the pool, especially when the water gets cloudy and dirty. The breakfast is tasty, but the menu stays the same everyday. They should try to rotate the menu sometime. We love the omelletes and the french toast, though. Our neighbor is kind of annoying, by smoking on the hallway, though it was written on the wall that it is forbidden to smoke by law. But the hotel put some air purifying machine and it always takes care of the bad smell. The area is very quiet, respectable area. Much more than Bur Dubai or Deira. It is close by to a Metro Station that would take you to Ibn Battuta Mall and The Mall of the Emirates easily (each of them is like 2 metro stations away). And the Metro will take you all over the place. You can find the map on one of the booklets on the hotel lobby. We booked using booking.com and got a great deal out of it, with breakfast and free wi-fi included. The published rate is much more expensive that the one we got.
