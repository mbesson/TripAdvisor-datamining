I must say we were not disappointed! The hotel staff were so helpful even before we arrived in Rome with pre booking tours on our behalf and making sure our 3 rooms were all together, during our stay seeing to our every need and even down to sending me a personal email once we arrived back in the UK to thank us for our visit. The staff, especially Laura and Tiziana, were most helpful and really made our stay. Their English was perfect, they ensured our group of 6 people were taken care of in every aspect of our stay and they also helped point us in the right direction whenever we weren't sure about anything. They pre booked us a Vatican and Sistine Chapel tour for all of our group with queue jump tickets which was great. The tour company were very professional and our tour guide spoke perfect English. They also made sure we kept up with the tour as we travelled with both my elderly grandparents which I thought was very considerate. They also arranged a Colosseum tour the following day with the same tour company and queue jump tickets (which is well worth the extra money) which was excellent and again they walked at our pace due to my grandparents not being able to walk fast. The hotel itself I believe is in a very good location. It is about 100 meters from the tram line (number 2 tram) which takes you directly into Flaminio within 6 minutes. Once in Flaminio you have the option to go by bus or on the Metro which will get you pretty much anywhere in the City or you can just enjoy Flaminio which has many bars, restaurants and shops. The Spanish steps are also walking distance from here. There is also a restaurant as you come out of the hotel, turn left and is about 50 meters away which serves very good food at a good price. You can purchase a 1 day travel card from the newspaper stall by the tram line for 4 Euros per person giving you UNLIMITED public transport use up to 12am that day, so well worth it as taxis are very expensive. The rooms are very comfortable and clean, but maybe a little on the small side if your used to staying in larger hotel chain accommodation but we found it more than adequate. However when in Rome you probably wont spend to much time in the room as there is so much to see and do. The breakfast is perfect and offers a selection of cereals, breads, pastries, fruit, yogurts, cheese.......the list goes on, so more than enough to start your day before leaving the hotel. Plus the views from the 5th floor restaurant are something else with great views of The Vatican. Also another service which we thought was excellent was after 10.30am till around 11pm each day on the fifth floor (where the breakfast is served) the hotel also offers guests FREE tea, coffee, water and pastries on a self service basis. We took advantage of this service everyday once returning from the city and before venturing back out for dinner in the evenings. They even let us use the free service the evening of the day we checked out whilst we were waiting for our taxi which they didn't have to do. All in all I would say if you are looking for a clean, comfortable hotel with 5 star service but want to pay the price of a 3/4 star hotel then you won't go wrong with the Hotel Astrid. the hotel is not right in the centre of Rome but within minutes you can be with the public transport service located very near to the hotel. If this hotel was in central Rome I'm sure you would be paying 250 Euros plus per night!! When we return to Rome we will most definitely be returning to the Hotel Astrid.

Since we arrived the night before, we didn't know that the tram next to the Stadium was only 5 minutes away from the metro and center. Once we found that out we started every day at the Caffee Stella Ruschena on the corner for an espresso and hopped the tram to the center. Another night we came back from the center by taxi which was an affordable 10 euros between 4. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Laura. They were kind enough to book our taxis and restaurants, including recommending the Parilli de Flaminio which was literally a few doors down. It was the best meal we had -- delicious, affordable, and worth a stop. In addition there is a cheese and meat shop on the way to the metro that had delicious prosciutto sliced paper thin, provolone, asiago, parmesan cheeses, fresh pasta, and plent of package snack breads like tarallini. We could easily have exceeded our luggage limit with that shop if we weren't worried about Customs. The rooms were smaller than expected, and our room was on the street side. Bonuses were the french doors with small balcony from which we could see the dome of St. Peter's and the Tiber River, and the shower. An elevator made a fourth floor room accessible and the stairs provided some easy exercise when wanted. The street side location meant a lot of traffic noise, but we enjoyed it as part of the city atmosphere. WiFi was free though very slow in the rooms.

The hotel is OK, with larger rooms, but is close to a busy street and in the morning you can't sleep 'till late. Black curtains, so no light inside. At the time of our stay, heavy renovation to the next building, so from 7 o'clock lot of noise. When we arrived, we have discovered dirty towels in our room, which were eventually replaced, but is for the first time that this happened to me. Also the air conditioned can be turn on or off only from the reception, which I found to be very strange. In the rooms there was a controller, but it didn't work. We have to figure it out for ourselves, so take this into account. Also, there is no temperature control, just on and off. Very odd... The staff was helpful, gave us indications. But I wish they informed us about how things work, not to find out for ourselves (air conditioned, keycard in the room etc). With except in one morning, when they entered the room while we were inside, because we forgot to put the card in the special place and from outside it looked that there is nobody inside... It was early in the morning; they could at least knock... Well, we'll put it at funny things and hope they tell the next clients that from outside it could be seen if there's a card inserted in that special place. The breakfast was a little bit disappointing. Not many to choose from, very basic. In the first morning, at 9.30, there was virtually nothing left. The breakfast room, although it offers a great view, is very small, not proper for so many guests... Overall, a pleasant stay. No thrills... Next time I will choose a hotel in the city center, to be in walking distance of sites. If you don't mind being outside \"the action\", then this is an OK choice.

The location is pretty good for a young couple. The neighborhood seemed safe and has a few restaurants and \"mercados\" where you can buy your own proschiuto and other Italian delicacies. Its a two minute walk to the Tramway which takes another five to ten minutes to reach Piazza del Poppolo. From there, the subway or your feet will take you just about anywhere. Its a nice walk from Piazza del Poppolo through the fancy shopping district to the Spanish steps. I have to say that this hotel was reccommended to me by a friend who lives in Rome and he went personnally to book it for me, so maybe I got extra special attention, but the service was outstanding, they helped us with everything and gave us a \"huge\" room by their standards (still small by North American standards...). Everything was nice and clean, though not necessarily new. The breakfast terrace is a big plus, with an awesome view and a good variety. On our final night, we had already checked out but they kindly let us make our own dinner on the terrace with Bread, Proschiuto and Cheeses we had bought around the corner. Add a nice sunset and some Pinot Grigio and we had our best meal in Rome, for about 20euros!!! Rome is an expensive city for hotels and I think this one delivers great value at 137euros/night (on the same trip, I stayed at the prestigious Grand Hotel de la Minerve for two nights at 285Euros/night and didn't feel I got my money's worth.)", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, FL", "Title": "\u201cHighjly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5377645", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at the Astrid. The rooms were nice and clean. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast was outstanding. Some comment on the distance to the main part of Rome. We didn't find this to be an issue. The trolley comes close to the hotel every few minutes and once on you were at the metro stop within 5-10 minutes. We could get to the Vatican or the Coliseum within 20-25 minutes from leaving our room. I highly recommend getting the daily or weekly metro pass which makes getting around very easy. I would also note that the hotel is in a nice residential neighborhood close to the river. There were some nice shops, particularly a nice local grocery where we talked with the owner every day about the World Cup and a local pizzaria. For the price, we were very pleased with the Astrid and would go back and send family and friends.", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cOkay but a trek into town\u201d", "Author": "LondonCG", "ReviewID": "UR5292034", "Content": "Stayed here in a group of six, including parents. The hotel itself is OK - rooms were rather small and ours had peeling wallpaper on the walls and ceiling but it did seem very clean if a little more down at heel from what I'd expected. The chap on the front desk was extremely helpful and the breakfast - and the terrace - is definitely a bonus. We did find a couple of nice little restaurants nearby but the main disadvantage was the journey into town. I've always stayed in central Rome before and it does save a certain amount of hassle when you're not having to bother with multiple forms of public transport to go out every morning and taxis, etc. of an evening. Certainly, negotiating trams, metros and buses isn't for everyone on a short city break and bearing in mind some tired members in our group, also proved quite a drag, especially at the end of a day's sightseeing.

Breakfast is very good and on an eat as much as you like basis. The location is a little way out of town but not a problem as there is a tram every 3 minutes to Flaminio from the stop about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. From there you can catch the limited Rome Metro to all the destinations it covers. The hotel is not in a great area for restaurants so you almost invariably have to go into town to eat.

Breakfast: Breakfast was lovely, made extra special by a fantastic sunny terrace and balconies with views over the River Tiber and St. Peters. There was a selection of pastries and cakes, cereals, toast and jams, fresh fruit, cheeses and sausages, juice and coffee with an extra chioce of coffees and juices if requested. Location: We stayed here because of the parking so we were expecting to be a little way off the centre of Rome. But if you dont mind walking it wasn't too far at all -just a nice stroll along the river. It took roughly a 15 minute walk to Piazza Del Popolo and a further 10 minutes to the Spanish steps. 45 minutes walking along the river took us to the Vatican - although we did opt for the long and scenic route! A taxi was great in the evening and cost only 5 Euros from Piazza Navona back to our hotel. Although be mindful if you book a taxi from the hotel as we did, apparently they start the meter on their way to collect you, so it was already at 5 Euros when we got in. A little noisy at night but to be expected. Overall this is a lovely hotel with helpful, friendly, and mostly English speaking staff.

First time in Italy and we had a wonderful time. Our room was nice, we chose one with a shower. We decided to change to one with a bath, as these are much bigger and still have a shower - highly recommended. This was not a problem for the staff and the maids moved all our personal belongings, whilst we were sightseeing. The staff were all very pleasant, especially, Titiana - her English is very good, compared to my Italian, which is practically non-existent! Good location - 5 minutes walk to the Tram stop - purchase a 24-hour ticket - costs only 4 Euros - you can use this on the trams and underground. Just remember to watch out for pick-pockets on the underground - watch your personal belongings! The breakfast room and balcony are very nice - beautiful views over the Tiber River and distant landmarks. Very, very pleasant to sit out there in the mornings and enjoy a cafe latte. The hotel has a number of leaflets, detailing the sightseeing trips available and the staff were very helpful in organizing these for us. The tour buses collected us outside of the hotel and returned us there afterwards.
