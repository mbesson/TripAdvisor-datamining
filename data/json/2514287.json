Yes, the room rates are cheap, but you also get cheap service and accommodations. The rooms are miniscule. Between the bed and the small dressing table, you only have room for one person to move around. The bathroom is so small you can touch both sides of the walls with only one arm extended. The \"shower\" is only as big as a large wash basin. You need to wait for hot water to come on for more than 5 minutes. The first single room they gave me had such an uncomfortable bed I had to request for another room, which they did, but the mattress was only marginally better than the first one. The walls need to be repainted. Breakfast is so basic, might as well go eat at the nearby McDonald's.

The only reason why I ended up going in the first place was because my best friend had already booked our room. At any rate, my first impression of the staff was that they were quite courteous and friendly, inviting me to stay and sit down to watch TV in their (small) lounging area while i waited for my friends to arrive from the US (the booking was under my friend's name, so i couldnt get the key). Going upstairs and into the room, i do have to admit, it had a musky smell - but after leaving the window open for the day, it was pretty much gone by night time. Showers and toilet were clean and worked well. Breakfast was simple, but generally quite decent and, to reiterate from before, the staff was quite friendly, often times going out of their way to help us. All in all, i have yet to find anything really negative about the stay. Looking back, I now have a hard time giving credibility to some of the unfairly negative reviews this hotel has received. Some reviewers are clearly too \"stuffy\" - complaining about the silliest things (too small an elevator, demanding fruit before breakfast when they don't serve fruit and so on). I'm not saying the hotel is perfect - far from it, but for a budget hotel (NOT 5 STAR HOTEL, FOLKS!) this is actually a pretty nice place to stay. Will certainly go again next time i'm in London. That is, if you're spoiled and want luxury or people, then Westin or Hilton might be better for you. If you're on a budget, then this place is more than worth a look in my honest opinion. Oh, one last thing to mention - when my two friends (both of whom also agree with my statement above) left, I shopped around for a cheaper place to stay. In spite of finding several, i chose to stay here. Why? well, i clearly found it to be more then worth while.... just my $0.02", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athlone", "Title": "\u201cMakes Bates Motel look like four star luxury!\u201d", "Author": "laurabgreene", "ReviewID": "UR92378490", "Content": "Don't even think about staying here!

I said to my friend, 'well there are Mercedes parked outside so it can't be that bad'. How wrong I was. The check in process was straight forward, and the trip to the room resulted in my friend being momentarily trapped in the lift, much to the disgust of the staff member who's comforting words were 'it is very dangerous'. Yes, the lift is dangerous. The room itself could have done with a lick of paint, not least to hide the stains from damp - although I am not sure what to recommend to get the stains out of the bed sheets. The bare wires dangling from the ceiling, the broken mirror hanging precariously from the wall, and the bedside table with nails sticking out, all made for an interesting nights sleep. Helped along by the man in the next room vomiting all night. I was hoping that Ashton Kucher would jump out and shout 'punked' as I lay awake...all night. The bathroom, was very small however the shower itself was shockingly quite good. Of course there is a but...... there was an ashtray on the wall next to the toilet. Complete with ash. Either it hadn't been cleaned since the smoking ban came into force, or they don't mind if you want to break that particular law. I assume it's the former. We decided not to check out the offerings for breakfast, but did leave our bags there after check out. thankfully our bags were not tampered with and my friend did not unwittingly smuggle drugs to the Southern hemisphere as we had anticipated. Granted \u00a360 for 2 people is a bargain in London, although one I shall not be taking up again.

They put the prices up by \u00a310 due to the fact of it being the Carnival- so we ended up paying \u00a365:00 per room per night. We were quite disappointed with the layout of the hotel - very old fashioned with lots of strairs which were steep- the staff offered us the use of the lift there but it was so tiny and old we decided to use the stairs- as we were afraid that it might break down. The room was poor quality and very small. The beds were soft so I had an uncomfortable nights sleep there. The towels which they provided were old and messy. The bathroom was okay in size but the shower was too small - we both ended up with bruises and I hit my head on the tap a number of times. Room needs to be painted despartely and new furniture needs to be provided. It reminded me of an homeless hostel or bed and breakfast- I have been in a few in my line of work and I can say that this accommodation was on par with what is offered there. If you do go there please expect poor standard of accommodation! The only saving grace of the place was that the staff were very helpful and accommodating.", "Date": "September 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cCan only laugh!\u201d", "Author": "cornish_pastie", "ReviewID": "UR5709820", "Content": "Remember the price! I kept saying to myself..... It is surely one of the cheapest stays in central London you'll find. I stayed with my wife and MiL for a couple of nights. The room was oh so tired - not dirty - just tired! The shower room was 'amusing' - it had a false floor in there but the toilet was clearly fixed to the original floor so you had a bit of a 'drop' to sit down and ended up with your knees a lot higher than you might be accustomed too! The bed side lamps were all hard wired so unless it was a bulb gone they couldn't easily sort out a reading light. The wiring generally looked a bit suspect with ceiling roses missing. But it was so bad it was good and we couldn't stop laughing each time some other quick came to light. But to put up 3 people within 5 min walk of the tube at what are basically hostel prices. With more notice you can get modern fresh rooms at something like the Travelodge but without the 'character'.
