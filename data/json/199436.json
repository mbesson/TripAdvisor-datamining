As there were only a few rooms available we had to decide on the sport, so took it. When we later got the booking confirmation and receipt we found that the hotel wasnt actually in central Berlin, but in Koepenick, an area on the outskirt of the city. We were a little disappointed and felt conned, as we were hoping to stay in the centre to be able to visit the many Christmas Markets with ease, and now we find that we will have to commute, not a big deal for most but our party consisted of myself, a wheelchair user, two young people with learning disabilities and a child with a sight impairment, so not the easiest of groups to get around with. The only saving grace was that it was closer to the airport that we were arriving into. Before our arrival we contacted the hotel directly to ask for suitable rooms for the party and the wheelchair user in particular, and this was no problem for them, they also helped with giving directions to the hotel from the airport, by public transport, with the best options for wheelchair access as this was different than the travel info given on their site. However on arrival we found a large mvp taxi, which could take us all plus the luggage and wheelchair. En route to the hotel the taxi driver told us lots about Berlin and Kopenick, (and the fact their Christmas market didnt start until the week after our stay). He also agreed to pick us up the next day and take us into Berlin central. Taxi cost from airport to hotel was 25e. On arrival at the hotel we were unable to check in immediately as some filming was taking place of the Queen of the World beauty pagent was staying there. We were however offered a free drink as compensation. Once the filming was finished we were checked in with a inter connecting room for the wheelchair double and twin, which was very useful. The triple room was accross the hall, but on same floor and within easy reach. Rooms were modern, comfortable, and had all that would be expected in a modern hotel. We decided to eat in the hotel that evening and found the food very tasty and service was good, although we had to ask to eat in the restaurant rather than the bar, where they were going to serve us; the bar tables were low and it would have been difficult to eat a full meal, rather than bar snack from. Price was reasonable for a hotel restaurant, and there were snack options too (the potato rossti with egg was delicious, huge and well worth the money). The next day we went into Berlin, and Peter the taxi driver, picked us up as arranged, took us in via a tourist route giving us a guided tour to the sights. For all of us it cost 30e inc tip! It was very good as we would have missed many things as we simply wouldnt have known we were there. The markets in Belin were great, and seemed to run into each other there were that many, we had a great time. The only other thing to say about the Penta was that for the duration of our stay the 'queens' acted like spoilt brats, and being anything but ladylike, they were like a pack of drunken football hooligans returning to their rooms in the early hours, running around the corridors, waking people, knocking on doors, some right some wrong, and general having a ball without a second thought for others staying in the hotel; obviously as there was publicity, the hotel pandered to them, and often parts of the hotel, bar or lift was out of use to the public as photo shoots or filming were taking place, and it did impact on our stay quite a lot, the initial free drink not being enough to compensate for the inconvenience, in any way. Would I stay again, possibly - but only after checking there were no special events planned that would impact my stay again, and checking that Peter our taxi driver, was still available to take take us into town and back - and factoring these costs into the saving to be had staying here as opposed to staying in the city itself.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel with a poor location.

It is a very good riverside hotel to relax and enjoy the countryside beauty. Yet it is not far from the urban centre. Take a 5-minute walk and you can reach the S-Bahn station Spindlersfeld. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn systems will bring you to nearly everywhere of Berlin downtown within 40 minutes. The rooms are quite spacious and two-third of them have a partial river view. However, if you not lucky enough, like me, the one-third roadside rooms are little bit noisy. For given the competitive price (euro 60 per night with breakfast), I have no complaint. The breakfast is very good in Europe standard with some hot dishes. The restaurant is so nice and you can enjoy a beautiful yacht club and river view. Remeber to spend a half day in the town of Koepenick itself and you can experience the local culture. Small solar-energy boats for rent nearby which only costs euro 10 per hour.

The room wasn't huge but it was comfortable enough,and the manager was extremely pleasant and helpful. When we got there they hadn't received our booking form the internet site we booked through, but he was very relaxed about it and it was all soon sorted out. He also booked us a mini bus taxi to Schoenefeld airport the next morning - for six of us, about 20 euros. Be warned, you will need to get a taxi from Koepenick station to the hotel, but it will only cost a few euros (ie less than 10) Koepenick itself was a pleasant little place to wander round, with several restaurants to choose from if you don't want to eat in the hotel. We did, and the food was delicious. The breakfast buffet was quite adequate - no comparison to the one at the Holiday Inn Schoenefeld, but then on the deal we got here, the Holiday Inn cost quite a bit more ( though their shuttle to the airport or station is free). Then again, there aren't many scenic delights to stroll round at Schoenefeld airport, so it all depends what you are looking for. As for some of the other reviews, I am baffled by people who apear internet savvy but who moan about the location of their accommodation and mark it down accordingly. Surely you would check the location on the internet before you booked it ???
