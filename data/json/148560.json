They gave us clear directions when we couldn't find out how to get into the gated community. We were able to take the bus in to Old San Juan and back to the hotel with their help. Unlike an earlier report, we saw no more than the normal police presence and walked to and from the bus stops, picked up an ice cream at the mini-mart near the entrance to the community and ate at an unusual little local restaurant called Pizza Cono which served a pizza in a cone across from the mini-mart. After staying in several places in Puerto Rico and wanting to continue to see the real Puerto Rico, the one that people who live there see every day, we were not bothered by rust (they are along a saltwater beach!), heat and humidity, brick buildings (which might stand up to a hurricane)....

Over all I really liked this hotel and would stay again. Pros Very cute, small Caribbean style hotel. Friendly and helpful staff - Thanks for all your help John. Bilingual staff (English and Spanish) On the beach - literally just a step off restaurant and bar Nice lobby Secure - its located in a gated community Good food at the restaurant - all four of us liked our dinner items (chowder, Sea food fettuccine, mahi-mahi, a hamburger and salmon ceviche for an appetizer). Some rooms come with great ocean views/balcony (we loved sitting out there) Beautiful,clean beach (we noticed they came by at dark and collected trash bins) Restaurant had the option to serve meals on the beach (tables set out on the sand). Rooms were neat and clean (yes, some sand gets in from the beach). Relatively close to the airport, though Isla Verde region is a little closer. We did not swim in the ocean but it looked to be a swimming beach with very small waves. A/C available in the rooms. Cons The neighborhood surrounding the gated community was pretty seedy - personally I would not leave the gated area. We saw a large police presence - to prevent crime I presume. Unfortunately this leaves you a bit stranded unless you take a taxi to other locations. The area with in the gated community was very nice. We noticed helicopter police scanning the beaches after dark and police boats patrolling during the day. We did not feel unsafe on the beach or at the hotel at all. We noticed a police presence near Old San Juan and Isla Verde as well, but not as much. There is no parking garage, we got lucky and found a place on the street. This place would be best for someone who plans on taking a taxi in and out. It's not too far from Old San Juan - maybe 3-4 miles. The building is concrete but the doors are wood with slates so we had some noise from neighbors who came in late. Its a small place so not lots of coming and going but if noise bothers you I would request a room without an adjoining door (to another room) and away from as much foot traffic as possible. Infrastructure. All older buildings in Puerto Rico seem to have water pressure and sewage issues. We stayed at three places in different parts of the island and all had issues with water pressure, lack of water, drainage (don't flush toilet paper down toilets). This place requested no toilet paper in toilet and had intermittent water pressure issues. Price: while we really enjoyed the food and bar services, paying approximately $25-30/meal would get tiring if we were staying for an extended time. The beach extended a long ways down from the hotel in both directions, perhaps walking down the beach would have yielded additional food/bar options. Rooms are a little small but with the balcony space was ample for the 4 of us. Lastly, the hotel is a little bit hard to find. It's a few blocks off of Loiza Ave, but the road sign is missing and you have to come in a different way anyway since it's gated. Just ask the hotel for directions before arriving if you are driving.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Decatur, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cDepends upon what you wish to do in San Juan\u201d", "Author": "redneckerson5", "ReviewID": "UR127492086", "Content": "The hotel is located in Ocean View, a large controll access area on the north shore. We (and another couple) stayed two nights prior to a cruise to the Souther Caribbean. An evaluation of the hotel for anyone requires decideing what matters most to you. On the plus side you have a location directly on the beach at a reasonable price, a very friendly helpful staff, and a good restaurant with a plesant bar area. Rooms vary in size, but some have beach access. Our was small with only a dresser, flat screen TV, tow end tables and a quee sized bed. The floor was concrete. The mattress, while comfortable sagged in sthe middle. On the negative side is location and noise. Getting to places other than the beach requires a $10 - 15 (each way) taxi ride. Dedicated walkers may find sufficient attractions within a 45-50 minute walk, but the primary tourist sites are not realistically walkable (NOTE: we prefer walking when possible). As to oise, the rooms are not well insulated. The short interior hall served as a megaphone. NOt only could we clearly hear other guests going to their rooms, but conversations in the lobby were clearly audible. Nose also came from the backside of the room which faced a courtyeard. In fairness, we shared the hotel with a large wedding party that celebrated into the early hours of each morning.

For this particular hotel, I had not expected such a six day nightmare...It is true that a location in the front of the ocean should be magnificent... But when you have dirty windows that barely protects you from the wind and its whistle through them and you have to compete with other guests for a chaise lounge on the beach, you end up quite disappointed. I felt trapped in that bad Clorox smelling room, when a very noisy function was taking place just one floor above. Outside it was raining and inside it was impossible to relax because the loud drums. The restaurant is windy when weather is not clement, and not very comfortable to stay too long time. While romantic at night, it is boring to wait so long for the waiter to assist you for whatsoever. They seem to forget about you, and are absorbed in other duties, even if you are the only one client. But the restaurant is what they have the best. And perhaps the neighborhood which is worthwile for a stroll, when you have no place to sit on the beach or you get pissed off by the poor conditions in the room. One day I discovered that the housekeeper forgot to lock the dorr of my room, after she had finished the cleaning of it. I got concerned, because the safe in the room is just a toy, not a real safe, not functional by size and by the impossibility to lock/ unlock, rusted and outdated. Despite the total price of 300$/day, The room was not provided with many expected items like hangers in the closets, hairdryer that functionned, even a glass to drink the few beverages left for client to buy at 5$/ can if thirsty. And, most surprising, no phone in a room at this price! The fact that the water pressure and the hot water in the shower was a problem, it did not upset me as much as the fact that there were not signes for hot/cold on the two faucets and one of the faucets was rotating with no limit, making you disorientd about how could you find some warm water to shower, beside having to wait for it. The \" eco friendly\" attitude should not be a pretext for getting a bigger profit for the business by spending less investment and time to check the rooms for what they need. On windy days there is a continuous whistle in the room made by the wind and due to the windows which do not close well because outdated and the door that has woody blinds, permissive for the draft from the open air commun hallway. Staff is always smiley, but when they were asked to come with me in the room to instruct me how could I be able to take a warm shower after 2 days of cold ones, I told them bitterly that one cannot run a businees with a smile only, you should provide customers with something more than your precious smile, if you want them to come again or to recommend the place to others. The woman owner was also only smiles, but it took me effort to respond with a smile, because I was unhappy with the stay. Like never before, we were inpatients to arrive back home for once. There are about 6 chaise lounges for which we competed every morning, that were in good shape.

The d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the common areas has obviously been updated recently and looks great. Unfortunately, one merely needs to look beyond the polished fa\u00c3\u00a7ade to see that there is need for a lot of improvement here. The best feature of our room was its incredible view from the private balcony. Otherwise, it was in serious need of general maintenance. All of the doors and windows had outdated, rusted mechanisms making unlocking, opening, and closing exceedingly difficult. On two occasions we needed help from housekeeping to get our room door open. The tiny, ancient safe in the closet was not big enough for the smallest of laptops and was nearly impossible to open and close. Half of the electrical outlets in the room were not working, including the one powering one of the bedside reading lamps. Only one of the two overhead lights in the room worked. One outlet in the closet was hanging loose in the wall with no cover, looking very dangerous for anyone with children. The towel rack in the bathroom was loose and drooping and the shower curtain rod would come crashing down with the slightest touch. There was some sort of hole in the ceiling above the bed packed with what appeared to be a wad of facial tissue and some random wood or a food wrapper. There was hardly ever any water pressure in the shower and fleeting hot/warm water. Most days the shower at full pressure gave just a trickle. The sink in the kitchenette had no hot water at all, not even a trickle. Located directly on the beach, it is no surprise the rooms eventually accumulate a fair amount of sand on the floors. During our 6 days in the room, housekeeping never once swept the floors. By the end of our stay we could walk around the room and get nearly as much sand on our feet as walking on the beach. Worse yet, it seems they would just shake out the sheets rather than change them, so our bed accumulated sand throughout our stay as well. There was also no consistency in the availability of towels. We could count on having two bath towels; otherwise we got a hand towel for one day and a washcloth twice. The hotel provides only 10 beach lounge chairs for all of the guests, and only half or less of these are in full working order. Others have broken webbing, bent frames, malfunctioning legs, and one even had rusted metal wire sticking out. With so few chairs, the guests get competitive and go out early each day to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reserve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chairs using towels or other items, and keep them that way for hours on end while away from the beach. The staff does nothing to stop this behavior. The restaurant downstairs is pretty and the staff is friendly. However, we found the service to be dreadfully slow. One night after finishing our meal we sat with empty plates and glasses for 15 minutes or more. Someone finally came over to ask if we needed anything else and we asked for the check. We waited 10 more minutes before a second person came over and asked if we needed anything. Again, we had to ask for the check. We tried eating there twice with similar experiences each time so vowed never again, opting instead for the plentiful dining alternatives in the nearby Condado area. This would be a great place with a little work: (1) Regular inspections and maintenance on the rooms. (2) Either fix the hot water/shower situation or warn guests ahead of time about the problem so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have unpleasant surprises. (3) Step up housekeeping efforts or at least provide each room with a broom so guests can clear away sand on their own if they want to. (4) Invest in new/more beach chairs.

It is noteworthy that while the hotel has been promoting itself as a destination wedding venue, and is hosting weddings on the beach, the PR department of natural resources requires a permit for any wedding taking place on the beach, and they are not easy to obtain.

Angel set us up with a tour guide who was very knowledgeable and led us on a 1.5mile hike through the beautiful rainforest. Great opportunity to take some nice pictures. Definitely checkout Old San Juan and the San Felipe El Morre Fort. About the only complaint we had with the hotel was the lack of hot water. We were there for 4 nights, and not once did we have any hot water to take a shower with. I had mentioned this to another staff member, but it seemed like this was the norm as the hotel's heated water comes from solar power. The staff memeber informed us that because of this, hot water sometimes quickly runs out. We tried showering at different times throughout the day, and even let the water run, but it still never turned hot, although warmed up slightly. To be honest though, it's so hot here, you probably aren't going to care if you are able to take a hot shower! Overall, we had a great experience, and would definitely come back. If you decide to stay here, I hope you have the pleasure of dealing with Angel, and if not, don't be afraid to ask for him.

This set the tone for what kind of place the Hosteria is. The room was perfect for the two of us. It was clean with plenty of closet space. We arrived about 2:30 in the afternoon the day before our Royal Caribbean cruise departed. And not knowing if our flight to San Juan would be delayed and the fact that we were going to board our ship around noon the next day we did not want to spend as much as the hotels in the Condado or Old Town were asking. And with Hosteria del Mar being right on the beach it appeared from the reviews, pictures and location to meet our needs for an overnight stay. From what you can tell we made an excellent choice. The reviews I read did an injustice to the location of the hotel because these reviews said there is nothing by the way of restaurants or activities (other than the beach) in the vicinity. A mere ten-minute walk takes you to many local restaurants and clubs. A fifteen to twenty-minute walk gets you to the Condado. We enjoyed the beach the afternoon we arrived. We ordered lunch from the restaurant at the Hosteria and sat at a table on the beach. The beach was clean and continuously groomed. What more could you ask for. The next morning before we left for the pier to board the ship we spent a good three hours on the beach swimming, lounging and taking a nice leisurely stroll to the end of the beach.

We stayed in a standard room while our friends stayed on the second floor with an ocean view. If we had stayed in their room, I'd probably give this hotel an additional star, but staying on the first floor was atrocious. The hotel is directly on the ocean, and the view is undeniably beautiful. Enjoying the \"beach\" however is another story. The sand is course and FULL of seaweed that the hotel does nothing to clean up. Swimming was always cut short when we'd finally get sick of unwrapping seaweed from our ankles (one local told us he didn't consider this area a beach as much as he did an oceanfront property; he also noted that there are some dangerous currents not far from shore in this area). The hotel only as 10 beach chairs for all of its guests, so space is a premium. No umbrellas available. They also ran out of beach towels on a daily basis, so we typically had to wait 20-30 minutes for towels to become available. Our room was comparable to a dungeon. It had one window that, if opened, faced a storage closet and set of stairs (which meant we heard all of the drunks going to the second floor quite easily at 3 in the morning). No daylight, no ventilation, no fridge. The room has a single desk lamp lighting the entire room, no overhead light (this, combined with no daylight, made for a very dark and depressing experience). The bathroom was dirty and BADLY in need of an overhaul. The sink was unattached from the wall, the mirror is stupidly placed five feet off the ground so my wife had to stand on the toilet to put her makeup on. The shower pressure is non-existent, takes 5-10 minutes to get warm water, and floods the bathroom floor when you're done. The restaurant and bar were also disappointing. The food ranges from mediocre to inedible and comes with Manhattan prices attached. Service ranged from friendly to indifferent and was universally slow (but that's common to San Juan in general). Beautiful views while eating help compensate. The bar was predictably overpriced, charging $10 for a single rail mix drink. We couldn't find any bars within walking distance, so reasonable drinks would have gone a long ways in easing our tension. I'm not sure what the business model is, but it doesn't seem to be geared toward attracting as many customers as possible. If the Standard Room is all that is available, DO NOT stay at this hotel. Ocean view rooms are acceptable, but nothing to write home about.

The best part of the hotel was having the beach right there and the great restaurant on site. We enjoyed swimming, watching the kite boarders, laying in the sun, and walking the beach. The location was fantastic in terms of the beach and the restaurant on site fantastic, but the hotel itself was not what it has potential to be. I can't speak for the other rooms in the hotel, but I felt we were paying hotel price to stay in a room that was not as high of quality as some hostels I stayed in while backpacking in Europe. There were not enough lights in the room. One light had an awful florescent glow. The window in the bathroom was broken but the fact was hidden by a bamboo curtain. Another bamboo curtain in the bedroom was broken so you could not pull it up. The light fixture in the bathroom was rusting and two double beds had been pushed together to form a king. The closet door was broken. One of the pillows on the bed was protected with a crinkly plastic cover. This would have all been fine if we were paying no more than $50-75 a night but we paid over $100. It is just a shame that fixes that could occur in a day had not happened. I read a similar review about the hotel but heard it was under new ownership so thought I would give it a try. Basically I would not feel comfortable recommending a family member or friend to stay here, but it is possible the other rooms are nicer.

More annoying was the continuous background music that went on till 11:00. It was mostly gentle music, but the sound ruined the experience of just hearing the natural sound of pounding surf. I could not get to sleep till they finally closed up. Early next morning I was awakened by the sound of a saw; my room was also near the maintenance shed. When I checked out I complained about the noise problems, and the manager Lois said that at this time of year they are getting ready for the season, and doing repairs. She offered me a free night's stay at a future date. I told her I would not stay there again, and would appreciate a discount on the room (which was exorbitantly expensive to start with).

For the quality of accomodation I experienced, the Hotel - properly a Guesthouse - would not be worth staying if it wasn't for the setting and the beachfront location. My Standard Room - see photos posted - was barely decent, somewhat rundown and old. The bathroom had issues as well with water in the shower taking long time to get barely warm and the toilet flush working poorly. All in all, the Hotel sets itself at the bottom-end of the midrange accomodation, and if you are not open up to live with some discomfort, you can start looking at some place else right away. The reason why you may want to stay here is the setting: literally right on the beach in one of the prettiest areas of Ocean Park, where the high-rise condos leave way to more quite and cozy residential communities. If a cozy place at the beach is what you are after, this Hotel may be worth considering. There is a beautiful patio right on the beach where meals are served or where you can just relax during the day. The restaurant, serving \"International Creative Cuisine\", (that's how they say on their website), is good in quality but pricey, and it is a kind of funny after your dinner to move from a four-star restaurant to a two-star motel-like room. Service at the Hotel is generally poor and you shall not have any expectations in term of efficiency. The Continental breakfast included in the rate is also poor and any integration comes at extra price. Getting to the Hotel is not straightforward since it is hosted inside a gated community whose entrance is few blocks away the address street. If you are driving it may take you a while to figure out how to get there (entrance through Calle Santa Ana, take note) and, in my case, the front desk that I phoned was not much helpful in giving me directions. All in all, per my experience, this Hotel will please those ones looking for a cozy place at a beachfront location not much demanding about the quality of accomodation.

We were on a budget, and the price ($140/night) was lower than that of nearby hotels, so we booked a room for 3 nights. The hotel is located right on the beach in a quiet upscale residential neighborhood which is gated off from the rest of the city. I find that a little weird, but it did contribute to my general sense of safety in walking back from dinner in Condado, the metropolitan area. Hosteria del Mar is nowhere near Old San Juan, but you can take the A5 bus, or a cab. A few blocks from the hotel is a restaurant called Pinky's with a yoga studio upstairs, amazing smoothies and a good sense of humor. All very comfortable, safe and fun for alternative and/or gay travelers. Back to the hotel. The entrance, lobby and restaurant at Hosteria Del Mar are beautiful - just take a look at their website. You can sit at a table on the beach, on the deck, or in the restaurant for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or anytime in between, and no one will hurry you along. The room was modest, but perhaps what you'd expect for that price in that area-? We have no way to know, since this was our first visit to Puerto Rico. The room was on the street side, not the ocean side, because we were told that would be quieter, and it was. To get to it, we had to cross an open, roofless area between the ocean side building and the street side building, and that area, floored in cement, seemed a little grotty to me. Not dirty, but as if much less attention had been paid to how it looked than the other common areas of the hotel. The room itself was relatively small, very clean, painted light pink, with large cool white tiles on the floor, two windows right next to each other - about the size of a picture window - and somewhat bare walls. It had a queen-sized bed, one night table, a TV, a decent sized closet with a tall, skinny wicker bureau, and a small bathroom with a shower (no tub). My biggest complaint has to do with the fact that there was only one night table - I had to keep asking to have things passed to me, or just leave them on the floor on my side. And there was one evening where the water slowed down to a trickle, so that we had to put off our showers a few hours, until it returned. Oh - and the string for raising the large shade covering both windows wasn't there...we held it up with a coathanger so we could look out onto the beautiful tree right outside our window. At night, we fell asleep to the sound of tree frogs and birds - very peaceful. The food at the restaurant was delicious, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. If you are very picky and have the money to spend on a ritzy place, come here for lunch or dinner, not to stay. Or get one of the more expensive rooms - perhaps the staff has lavished more care on them, in terms of night tables, window shades, etc. If you aren't that particular, or you're on a budget, and the combination of perfection and small annoyances I've described sounds like it will suit you, definitely make a reservation.

I must say that this particular stay was a disappointing one. The rooms (we stayed there on two different occasions as stop-overs to and from Culebra) were greatly in need of painting. They were not really clean--gritty-floor syndrome. The Ocean Park beach has declined in cleanliness to the point of un-usability! Not the fault of Hosteria, to be sure, but a problem nonetheless. The night staff were delightful, but the day staff tended to be on the grumpy side. The breakfasts were terrible! No fruit, over-cooked coffee, tough eating out on their wooden deck is still a joy.

The carved wood of the entrance and dining room is beautiful, the sand just outside the door is soft and inviting, the expensive restaurant serves still-excellent food. Past the lobby and dining rooms, however, buyer beware. The hotel is dying fast from a complete lack of adult supervision. The staff is made up of pretty 20-somethings, more intent on comparing tongue studs and tattoos than actually serving hotel guests. After we arrived, the indifferent teenager at the front desk gave us the key to our room and let us haul our own bags upstairs. When we opened the door, we found... other peoples' clothes and things strewn about. Oops! Back to the front desk, where the hapless clerk scratched his head for awhile before drifting upstairs to see what he could do about the situation. Twenty minutes and one very hasty clean-up job later we were again given the keys to the same room. This time it was empty, although we found a pair of sneakers under one bed and the pillows on the other bed still smelled of someone else's cologne. Oh well, too late to fuss over details -- our two small children and we settled down to sleep, after setting the alarm for the 6am wake-up we'd need to make our plane the next day. We were all sprawled half-naked and deep asleep on our beds when the locks on the door started rattling at about 1am. My husband just had time to spring up and grab the door before the couple who thought they were still staying in the room opened it with their key. Seems the front desk had forgotten to tell them about the change. Confusion ensued. But don't get the impression that this one incident has prompted me to write a disgruntled review. We were in the hotel for a couple of nights one week before this incident, and the problem was the same: clueless staff, absent management. The first impression is great, but the longer you stay the more you notice how bad things are. That lovely soft sand outside the door? Full of cigarette butts and people's discarded napkins and lemon rinds, cause the hotel staff can't be bothered to give it a quick rake every morning. The delicious though expensive restaurant? In the morning, guests are treated to a \"continental breakfast\" of coffee in styrofoam cups, individual boxes of Frosted Flakes, and red delicious apples. And yes, the carved wood downstairs is beautiful -- but those shiny poly bed covers and foam pillows upstairs are kinda hard to square with the hotel's upscale rates. I don't recommend.", "Date": "March 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn New York", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, compromise...\u201d", "Author": "cpworsham", "ReviewID": "UR4594987", "Content": "This place reminds me of going to visit poor relatives in a 3rd world country. You really get the feeling they are trying their best but with limited means. It's not a bad place to stay: The facilities and rooms were immaculately clean, the staff was very welcoming, friendly, attentive, and courteous. The hotel definately has its merits. A nice waterfall feature greets arriving visitors. For me and others used to traveling in 4-star and above hotels, however there might be some disappointments. There was no alarm clock in the room, but the staff was able to program an early morning wake up call. The rooms do not come with coffee makers (a trip down stairs staff gave me a cup), hair dryers, face(wash) cloths (available upon request), refrigerators (some units have kitchenettes), the floors are terra cotta tile with only one small rug, the towels were worn and a little threadbare. I really wasn't all that thrilled about the so-called \"complimentary continetal breakfast.\" I got there half way through it at 9am (the hours are 8 to 10) there was nothing to eat but bread, cereal (with no milk or bowls!), and bananas. They also ran out of coffee. The reason might have been that the morning I was having breakfast they seemed short-staffed so service was a bit sluggish. I returned later to try to dinner menu and was not disappointed. The prices seem reasonable for a fine meal ($25-30pp) in a major metropolitan area. No problems with the service or the presentation, the tip is included in the price. This is one of the finer restaurants in the area that seems to be frequented by the locals and tourist from this (and other hotels) hotel alike. The area was safe, gated community. I parked the rental car close and on the street. A plus for me was that they have wireless internet access in the lobby. Having it in the rooms with a desk of some sort would have been better but all things considered it seems they at least are trying (3rd world country) so one wouldn't want to complain because it is lucky to have access at all. Finally, as affordabilty goes, during \"high\" season, the rate that I was quoted ($209 plus tax) is probably in the lower third of prices for places that I shopped (lowest was $180 and highest was $400+). I also want to mention as an aside that there is a great bakery/restaurant right outside the main gate but to the left where many locals go for typical dishes and great food at reasonable prices. I always go there to get their ensalada de pulpo (Octopus salad) when I am in San Juan.", "Date": "March 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cVery Poor Service & Beware First Floor 'ocean view' rooms\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4356692", "Content": "We stayed here over New Year's and paid a highly inflated price for a so-called ocean view room with patio. In fact, the tiny cramped room had a view of the ocean but overlooked a 'patio' at which diners (smoking) were served meals. Avoid these rooms at all costs. We were then moved at a higher price to an apartment in the back. The air conditioning did not work, lights did not work, neither tv contol worked and while the management tried to address at least some of the issues, they did not succeed. Worst of all was the restaurant. The prices were way too high for decent but not great food and the worst service we've ever experienced. We were kept waiting a half hour after the reservation and served everything, if at all, horribly slowly. At one point, the so-called server came out to tell us that she had now had her dinner and let's see did you get your entrees (we had not). She asked for our dessert orders early to reserve what we wanted. Later, much later, when she brought them out they were all that was left and nothing that we had ordered.
