If you are visiting London for a couple of days, are on a budget and don't mind hostel-type accomodation and don't intend to spend much time in the hotel, it will be fine. Pros: 1. Close to Gloucester Road tube station, Picadilly and Circle Lines. Only one tube ride home from West End. 2. Located in Kensington, a very safe area 3. Can use the kitchen facilities including microwave, kettle etc (expect when breakfast is being prepared by the staff) 4. Exceptionally friendly and attentive staff 5. Very cheap for the area! 6. My daughter and I were upgraded from a double to a triple room at no extra cost. 7. The other travellers we met were all very friendly. Cons: 1. The room smelt damp 2. The single bed was so lumpy that my daughter and I shared the double bed. This was our original plan as we had only booked a double room so we weren't upset by this. 3. The room desperately needed a refurb - the toilet cistern lid was broken; the wooden veneer on the tv stand/cupboard was warped stood a couple of inches above the the top it was supposed to be attached to; and although the bathroom was clean, it had black mould growing in the corners. 4.There was no hot water in the mornings for a shower. Evenings seemed to be OK. 5. One of the plug sockets didn't work. 6.

They offered us the chance to keep our bags for the day for free, but we decided to leave them at Kings Cross instead as it meant less travel, but another excellent service on offer.

The sink's faucets were way too close to the back of the sink, making if very difficult to wash your hands. The location has a lot of street noise with vehicles going nonstop all night. You have to open the balcony doors for ventilation (no air conditioning). Yes, there is a balcony, but you share it with the room next door. You have to make sure the balcony doors are locked before you leave the room for security. And they were hard to open and close! Breakfast was included and served downstairs. We only ate there once, as that was more than enough! They had tons of fruit, but there were flies around it! And the father of the family keep pushing the fruit on us. Very annoying! This hotel is family run and they do try hard, but the building desperately needs updates and renovations. When we went to check in, our room wasn't ready yet. They stowed our luggage in the dining area and we went off to explore London. It was obvious they rushed getting our room ready because when we got back a few hours later, our sheets were still damp!

An agency at Victoria Coach Station found St. Simeon for that one missing night and for me it was okay. As it was on very short term I paid almost 30 pounds for a bed in a mixed shared room with three men and one woman. It would be too much for a \"normal\" booking in reasonable time but I read their regular prices on the website and I think they are okay and I would return to that hotel for my next holidays in London. The neighbourhood is very posh with several luxury hotels nearby. The hotel itself is in a house close to a garden and only two minutes from tube station Gloucester Road away. Near the station there are some fast food restaurants and bars and a small super-market. Some negative reviews (like dusty/small/shabby) may be right, however I did not have problems with that. I am not made out of sugar and dust has never killed anyone (and I have seen worse). Other reviews complained that the linen were dirty, but my bed was totally okay . The bedcover with floral print was old and worn out, as seemed all bedcovers, but not dirty. The staff was friendly and the fully English breakfast with fruits very good. I would recommend that hotel to travellers who need the hotel as a place to sleep and who can acknowledge the difference between a sterile chain hotel as can be found in every bigger city and a hotel run by a family and with a soul like St. Simeon.

The fruit, or fresh fruit as they call it was a nightmare. I'm not exaggerating. It looks like it has been sitting on those shelves for ages. It probably has. And there is the boss of the hotel, an ugly old man who goes around offering people that very same fruit... Horrific. Very pushy, by the way, gets insulted if you refuse to take it. AAAAArghhh...

After searching various hotels, we decided on the St. Simeon based on other reviews, location, and the fact that I could use points from one of my travel rewards programs to make the booking. Following our experience at the establishment, I am relieved that the reservation was paid for using my points, since the atmosphere at the hotel is not at all reflective of the web reviews and photos or worth spending any hard earned money on. Upon arrival at the hotel, the front desk employee was extremely overwhelmed and distracted and took a while to find our reservation and even provide us with the correct floor our room was located on. He then showed us to what I can only describe as a storage closet with two twin cots, dusty carpeting, a single lamp without a shade and tattered towels with several holes. We could not even fit both of suitcases in the room at the same time and one of our bags had to be kept in the space between the fire door, not just creating an inconvenience, but also a safety hazard. Upon check-in the staff member also went into great detail about how essentially how unsafe the hotel could be and to make sure we carried all documents and valuables with us at all times at they held no responsibility. This was not exactly a soothing message for two females traveling on their own or delivered with any tact. As I have been living and traveling through the UK this year, I have become accustomed to various types of hotel standards, but this room was not even fit for a single person let alone allowed to be advertised as a double. The remainder of the hotel was also poorly lit, riddled with random pieces of furniture and home improvement equipment in common areas and surfaces covered in a layer of dust. We did not even venture a chance at the breakfast provided and checked out early in order to seek out an alternative hotel. The only redeeming quality to this hotel was the location and my friend and I made the best of our stay. I have never had an experience negative enough to motivate me to write an online review and as a courtesy I did provide feedback to the 2nd hotel staff member upon our departure. He only offered a weak apology, an excuse about how we checked in too late and was more concerned about trying to convince us to allow him to book a shady cab ride for a good price.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry - this group of buffoons should not have a hotel to run. The price was excellent. Like for a rusty, second-hand Ford Mondeo. The location could not be better - right by the museums. That's what my kids wanted - the Science Museum especially. Anyway, I digress. Room: we had a room for 4, so we expected to be a bit squashed. I loved the room door - very studenty. The bed linen was washed by someone who needs to learn how to operate a washing machine. I mean, was it too much powder or too little, or just poor quality? Whatever it was, they were greyish. Yuk. The carpet was sticky ... double-yuk. Amazingly, we had our own fridge in the room - vital for us because we had some very expensive medicine we needed to keep cool. Less amazingly, it didn't work. The upshot of this was I got to know the owner a little and the kitchen more than I really wanted to. The owner was a charming old Serb who thought I was wrong about the fridge not working, but didn't see fit to prove me wrong. He promised to change my fridge, but one of his workers told me not to expect anything, as he's very forgetful. So, I stored the medicine in the kitchen fridge (there was a common fridge in the \"breakfast\" room). A bit of a GBP 3,000 risk, but I had no choice. The fridge was clean and the food was separated properly. The rest of the kitchen was splattered in bacon fat. Morning came - we felt good - quality mattresses. Truly. I noticed another mattress stored above the toilet annex. Bizarre. There was also various detritus scattered around the hotel - old furniture and broken office chairs on display. Breakfast - at this point I feel like the Commissioner in the Clouseau films, you know, giggling insanely. Dingey breakfast room, people crammed in. Bacon fat smoke smarting your eyes. Poor quality bacon - the cheapest stuff. Matched the baked beans. Service given by a char lady wearing the dirtiest apron possible. Ahh - the tea. OMG, I just loved that great big pot she poured from. Shame it dripped so much over every single table!! Toast. It was astonishing how they burnt every single slice - you can't fault them for thoroughness! Jam - no choice of single servings in plastic or the alternative of quality produce you sometimes get. Here it was cost-cutting par excellence. I fell into conversation with a middle-aged French couple sat cheek by jowl with me. Restaurant owners!! I could have cried. My wife did (because of the smoke). One good thing is that you have access to the kitchen daytime - so you can have tea and sandwiches ... and make yourself some unburnt toast as well.
