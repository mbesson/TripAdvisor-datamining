{"Reviews": [{"Content": "brief but lasting The hotel concept and location is for people spending a few hours in Amsterdam Airport (Schipol), but after reaching my destination I count the stay in Yotel as a pleasent and memorable. The booking is done through an automated machines (similar to ATMs), the room is a cubicle with everything available within hand reach. I stayed for 4 hours during which surfed the net (free wireless connection), took a hot bath (so pack some change clothes with you on the plane), wathced some TV, took a good nap and had my wake-up call from the recetion desk on time. the stay gave me a good jump start for my connection. Also everything is available within a few steps like McDonnald, Flower shop, gift shop, Sushi place,.......So, if you have these few hours in Schipol go ahead and YOTEL.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR997122180", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Moe_XII"}, {"Content": "Love the Yotel Concept       corridor", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR455975019", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Casualist"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1146311-r22881296-Yotel_Schiphol-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "1146311", "Price": "$71"}}
