{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely little hotel What a find! Just by accident we came by this small hotel. They have several rooms starting from $25 wich have cold water and a fan. We stayed in a standard room, basic but fine. Staff is very friendly and pool is nice. Included breakfast is basic, but for a very small amount you can order extra's. Drinks are pretty cheap. The beach is only 1 minute away.", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR995228391", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JonandMar"}, {"Content": "idyllisch, ruhig, aber Zimmer basic   showReview(22076714, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR782064447", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "naganaga"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d1205684-r21667660-Segara_Agung_Hotel-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1205684", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
