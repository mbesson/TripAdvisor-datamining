It has ample parking space, a lovely pool and a really fantastic restaurant with excellent food. The decor is elegant and the staff is very helpful and friendly. I would recommend it if you wish to relax for a while away from the chaos of the city but you would need to have a car. It's a good idea even if you are just looking for a great restaurant for a large family or group of friends. Their pizza is very good but you must taste their excellent pasta dishes!", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin", "Title": "\u201cAVOID THIS HOTEL!!!\u201d", "Author": "BerlinSven", "ReviewID": "UR68669981", "Content": "I stayed here for 4 nights and was counting down the days till I could leave for the airport. Very disappointing. I only booked this hotel online because it said there was a shuttle service to Rome centre but this turned out to be a disaster for me. I was always left waiting all the time to get to and from the station and it was a pretty unkind place to be waiting alone, or even if in a group. The hotel was spoiled by the staff and there was nothing to eat for breakfast except cherry tomatoes and stale biscuits. Very shady place to stay, avoid!!!!", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute Disaster\u201d", "Author": "Lewandphilippa", "ReviewID": "UR67886860", "Content": "DISASTER This hotel was a complete disaster from the very start. The receptionist was the worst that me and my partner had ever encountered. She was extremely rude and inhospitable- she simply did not care about anything except talking about herself and smoking. Anyway, onto the hotel\u2026 The location was worse than we had expected. We were told not to drive into Rome and so chose to use the hotel\u2019s free shuttle service to the local train station. This consisted of one of the hotel\u2019s staff (grudgingly) driving us in a tattered old car through the prostitute ridden streets of Pomezia. On one occasion the car was substituted for a scooter without a helmet (which is obviously ridiculously unsafe). We were also left to wait up to 1 hour on a number of occasions at the train station on the way home (which isn\u2019t a friendly place to wait around in), without ever receiving a call to say they would be late or any apologies when we called or when they finally decided to pitch up. When we complained about this service we were told to be \u201cGrateful for getting the shuttle service in the first place\u201d- which didn\u2019t make sense as it is advertised in all their hotel\u2019s publications. The room was small, and stuffy, but ok. However, our night\u2019s sleep was never uninterrupted. Having booked a hotel outside the centre of Rome we thought that we would have a peaceful and quiet stay. We are a young couple in our twenties and never expect absolute silence but this hotel really pushed the limits. The hotel allows restaurant diners to use the hotel pool and books outside parties in the hotel grounds. At night there would be loud music outside our window at 1am. We called reception the first time this happened and were sharply told \u201c20 more minutes, ok?!\u201d The fact that the hotel advertises itself as a relaxing stay in the countryside is completely misleading. The breakfast was totally random. Cherry tomatoes, cake and biscuits and watered down juice! There was rarely toast or croissants etc which we thought was strange. The hotel leaves the food out for builders and hotel staff to eat before guests so we soon learned that was why there was never anything left! Finally, the receptionist is the only go-to person in the hotel and is completely dreadful, rude and insulting. She smokes in your face when you are talking to her and is completely unhelpful. We were taken aback by her attitude and she really did spoil our stay to say the least. When my partner asked at the end of our stay for the manager\u2019s contact details to note our concerns with the false advertising, she told us that she was the manager! We later spoke to the actual manager who truly was dismissive and did not care because our room was pre-paid so he didn\u2019t need to make sure his customers were happy. All in all a VERY DISASTEROUS stay. We never usually write reviews and hate reading pernickety complaints but we really had to warn future holiday-ers NOT TO BOOK THIS HOTEL. Stay inside Rome and don\u2019t take the same chance that we did- in this case it does not pay off!!", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE!\u201d", "Author": "JennaandJohn", "ReviewID": "UR67802095", "Content": "If you have a family or are looking for a peaceful, care-free hotel, or are a couple looking for a decent sleep, do not stay here! The hotel makes it main income from its neighbouring restaurant, allowing diners to use the hotel pool and books parties by the pool daily. We were made to feel very unwelcome around the hotel, so much so that we avoided everything and kept to our room when we got in for the day. It was far safer to do this than to risk getting intimidated by suspicious characters by the pool (this happened to us on a number of occasions).We did not conceive of such issues such as noise when booking a countryside hotel. Fireworks went off at 1am literally outside our window and gave us such a fright, with loud loud music and cars revving throughout the night. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have children here. The hotel does not care about its paying guests whatsoever. We called reception several times to ask when the noise would end but were simply told to \u201cenjoy it\u201d\u2026! Very dodgy characters hanging around the hotel and its grounds day and night, we did not feel safe.
