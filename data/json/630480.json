The bathroom is enclosed in glass to let in the light, and it was well appointed with awesome water pressure. If you were planning to squeeze a second person into the slightly-larger-than-normal single bed, hopefully you won't mind watching them shower.Service was fine, but I didn't do anything more than check in and check out. I didn't ask any questions regarding sight seeing etc. so I can't comment on that.If you're anything like me you look for some clear directions in Trip Advisor reviews to find hotels, so here's some directions you might find helpful. A quick look on Google Earth helps as well!I grabbed the NEX / Suica option to get from Narita (a great deal). As it was an early trip in, I had to change from the Narita Express to Yamanote at Shinagawa, which is a smaller station so getting from one line to the other was a breeze.When you get to Shibuya, make your way to the West Exit. Plenty of signs point the way. When you exit, you'll face a number of bus stops - head left past the toilets and straight up the stairs which go across the road but below the overpass. Keep walking and head down the stairs in front of you. You'll walk along the road which has the red paving leading out of it. A short walk along this road will lead to an intersection - walk up the hill on the road which has the circular paving (it's on the right). The hotel is about 20 metres on the left.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR135195472", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Steve4750"}, {"Content": "Great Boutique-y Hotel in Tokyo The Granbell Hotel is a small, chic, boutique-y hotel in the heart of Shibuya.

The Granbell is conveniently located next to the Shibuya train station with easy access to all of shops and restaurants of the area. As opposed to an industrial hotel park, the Granbell is integrated into a neighborhood where you can get a feel for the daily rhythms of the people who live in the city. Similarly, the small number of units give the hotel an intimate feel as well. The accommodations live up to the brochure description as 'designer' -- I particularly liked the glass enclosed shower room with overhead shower nozzle and deep bathtub. Another feature that I found particularly welcome was the adjoining 'Plate of Pies' bar/restaurant -- a 24-hour hipster hang out that serves a limited menu and full bar.

It is truly an excellent value and I had a great stay for three nights in April 2008. The location is close enough to all the action of Shibuya, but just outside enough to have peace and quiet. It's definitely walking distance to the train station, and also walking distance to the famous cross walk that we all know Shibuya for.

Maybe it was because we had just stayed at the wonderful Ryokan Shiraume in Kyoto, but I found the Granbell disappointing. The room was a decent size, still small but not tiny like some in Tokyo. A fantastic shower with great water pressure. A very hard bed, little hanging space and nowhere to put suitcases except on the couch. There was construction going on (an annex being built till June '08) so we had no view but there was no noise either, they don't seem to start at 7am like they do here. The staff spoke very little English, and were very unhelpful with things like restaurant bookings and train timetables. The breakfast was definitely not worth 1000 yen, all you get is a black coffee and a ham and cheese mini roll, you'd be better off going to Excelsior Coffee or somewhere else down the road.Still, if you want somewhere reasonably priced and quite stylish to stay in a good spot in Tokyo, this is it.

Others have already commented on the trendy decor and absolutely perfect location. The station and Shibuya centre are five minutes walk, and we walked to Harajuku in one direction and Daikanyama in the other. There are many small eating places around the hotel which is on the quieter side of Shibuya station. Access is so easy - catch the limousine bus to the Cerulean Hotel (easier with luggage and skis than the train). With your back to the Cerulean walk to your right, past the steps to the station, turn right , and the Granbell is in either the third or fourth street on your right - you will have walked past the Family Mart and will turn right up the hill at the four- way intersection opposite the donut shop! Hotel is set back a little on the left-hand side. These were the directions we needed as we asked several people only metres from the hotel and no-one knew, even with the address in Japanese! The blocks are small and the walk is about five minutes.We booked two twin rooms so we could be together (twin and doubles are on different floors). The twin rooms have ample room for suitcases and clothes. Our rooms were the only two at our end of the corridor and perfect for a family.We had no problem with building noise as the annex being built was well below floor nine. Previous reviewer commented on this and it could be a problem if you were at eye level with builders (although we tend to be out during construction hours).Before booking I emailed the hotel with several questions and received prompt, friendly, helpful replies in English.We would certainly stay at the Granbell again.", "Date": "Jan 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR134835116", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ollie51"}, {"Content": "Great Location and funky rooms but watch out for the building works!

With all the sights to see in Tokyo, we didn't spend much time in the hotel. The hotel's location made it an excellent home base for sightseeing. Just a few minutes from the hotel is Shibuya station, a major subway and train hub. The JR line goes direct from the airport to Shibuya. The hotel is tucked away in a quiet street, yet so close to the action of Shibuya. The location is perfect!We spent 2 days in a double room, left for an overnight trip to the mountains (the hotel was kind enough to store our luggage), then came back and spent another 2 days in a single room for two people. The double room was clean, modern, quiet, and well designed. It had a comfortable bed, gloriously powerful shower, and the obligatory Japanese toilet from the future, as my boyfriend liked to call it.The single room (we booked late and couldn't get a double room for our second stay), was more what we expected from a Japanese hotel. Very small, but still well designed and comfortable. This room is more suited for a single person, as the name states. We found the room rates very resonable.Next time we visit Tokyo we will definitely be staying at the Granbell again.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful (they lent us a laptop to take to our room to use the internet for free and made lots of bookings for us).
