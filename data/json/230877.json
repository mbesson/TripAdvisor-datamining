Last year we stayed in the lavish Hotel Amrath but this year we went slightly down on our budget and got a very reasonable deal at the Nova. We were definitely not disappointed. The location was superb, within 10 min walk of Central station. Very near to Dam square, but on a quiet section of road. Everything is within walking distance, including a great supermarket if you want to bring a few drinks and nibbles back to your room. The room itself, on the 3rd floor was spacious and very clean, with a large, modern bathroom. We were facing into the courtyard, so not much of a view, but very quiet and full of sunlight. Breakfast was very good, plenty of everything, although the coffee could have been better. This can be remedied by buying a super coffee from the reception area for 1 euro.

We arrived into the central station and walked down the Damrak to the Dam Square. Turned right, then left, and then a couple of blocks down to the right was the hotel hidden behind a bunch of trees. The entrance is down a few steps from the sidewalk. Once you get inside the lobby is a good size with a couple of lounge chairs and sofa. There was a separate room off the lobby which was the communal computer room. The reception desk is immediately to the left of the entrance. We were greeted by the receptionist and we checked in quite quickly and were off to our room. Our room was on the top floor facing the street and it was hot up there. We arrived late in the afternoon and when we got up to our room it was hot! We opened the windows and went out to get some food and walk around and figured the room would cool down by then. It didn't. I headed downstairs to get a fan while my buddy took a shower (yes, there's no AC). Front desk showed us where they had some fans and said grab whatever we wanted. Yeah, there was no help, but we knew what to expect from a budget hotel in Europe. So got a desk fan and a floor fan and took them up the room in the elevator. The room was good size to be able to hold 2 twin beds on either side of the room a small desk and en-suite bathroom. The decor was outdated and the beds were not so good. The carpet was bit dirty. The windows were still a little cracked open at night to let the air circulate, but that only let in the noise from outside. All in all the room gave the impression of a 2 star hotel. Since we only needed this place to sleep for a night, we were satisfied with the hotel, but we will probably look for another place next time.

Asked for a quiet room and got one in back, and it was nice and quiet. Room was very clean. Room was normal size for Dutch standards, but small by American standards. Bathroom is clearly recently remodeled. Nicer than a 3-star I stayed at in Arnhem. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was reliable and a reasonable (but not big) selection. Note: The Dutch do not cook their bacon anything like Americans do (I found this at every Dutch hotel I was at on my trip), so I hope you like it salty and white (fat). If you dig around, you can find some pieces cooked well enough, though. The coldcuts are typical Dutch, but, if you are smart, you'll use them to make a sandwich and take it with you during the day, so you have a good snack -- and save $$$ and time on eating lunch at restaurants. Note: most tourist attractions are only open 10-5, so you need to be quick about lunch, or you'll run out of time. There's a grocery store a block North of the Hotel that you can get cheap food at -- cash only, though. Though the hotel was 2 blocks from the Red Light district, I felt safe out at night ... strong police presence in the RL district (horseback, scooter, bike, and walkers), so it's quite safe (at least until 10pm). Excellent location. Get a pass for the Trams. Get a map from the front desk (free) and don't buy one at Central Station for 2.50Euros. My only complaint would be the wireless ISP. I could log on but their network would drop me from time to time. Annoying. Would take many re-tries and several minutes to re-connect. The trouble is their router, which is not assigning a network address to your laptop. I pointed this out to the staff and he said he'd take it to their network guy, but some other reviewers here have mentioned (earlier) spotty internet wireless, so, I doubt they are doing much about it. Some comments/tips about attractions: Rijksmuseum is closed until 2013. Canal Museum delayed opening until 4/1. Stedelijk museum closed until later this year. FOAM museum is a bust. VanGogh is worth it. Verzetsmuseum (Dutch Resistance) is worth seeing. Amsterdam Hermitage museum was worth it. Canal tour was OK. The regular Amesterdam historical museum is worth it. When ordering meals, don't ask for water, or they give you a 10oz bottle of water that costs 5Euros ($6.50)... clearly specify TAP WATER. Otherwise food was not that bad (I expected horrifically expensive food). Service at restaurants is not as good as it is in the States.

The hotel is located just behind Dam Square and a 10-minute walk from Centraal Station, Most of the things you are likely to want to see in Amsterdam are within walking distance, but the hotel is also on a busy tramline. If you have been to Amsterdam before and you would like to do something different, a recommended trip is a visit to the small village of Zaantse Schans. This village is only four stops on the train from Centraal Station, out into the Dutch countryside. There you can get a wonderful view of a number of working windmills along the canal and you can explore a small settlement of traditional Dutch houses, including a cheesemakers, a clogmakers and various small shops and cafes.

The hotel also has free wifi and they provide the password in the binder of info in your room. The breakfast was good. It was your standard European breakfast. One thing I liked was that they buzzed you in. It made me feel safe knowing not just anyone would be walking into the hotel at night. The location was amazing. It was a street over from Dam Square. It took about 3 min to walk to it. There were restaurants and shops nearby. There are plenty of ATMs nearby as well. Its about a 5-10 min walk to the area near the train station for the canal tours and hop on hop off buses.

I had selected the hotel based on good reviews I had read about the hotel in Trip Advisor. I changed my reservation 3-4 times because of better offers by the hotel ( room price changed from 175 Euros per night to 79 Euros so I made a new reservation and cancelled the old ones each time they made a better offer which is quite normal in bookong a hotel that has no cancellation charge till 24 hrs before arrival . upon arrival I was told that My credit card was charged for the first night more than 10 days ago ! which was against what was advertised in the hotel site, they told me they did that because I had changed my reservations and they thought my credit card might be invalid !!!! I am a frequent traveler and this was the very first time this happened to me . The hotel is well situated near the Dam square with trams available from almost outside the hotel. although you can nearly reach all attractions by foot and we used tram very infrequently. On walking into my room we were impressed by the size of the room that was quite impressive for a european hotel with a window to the street , The bed sheets and the room looked clean. there was a fridge in the room that was very helpful to keep our drinks, etc in it, . Despite having the heating on full the room was somewhat cold. When I mentioned this to reception staff they said the heatings are off during the daytime and they work at night. The probable reason could be it was an attic room. My wife had tick bites on the body, something I had read in another review, but honestly I can't surely blame the hotel on it. The bathroom was sort of cold and smelt somewhat musty, the towels once smelt very bad, although when I called the reception about the problem, they kindly changed them at once, and the new ones smelt better . Breakfast was included in the room price ( unlike most hotels in Amsterdam) The contents of it was adequate and I specially loved the breakfast room,it was an old wine cave kept in the original form.The only complain is that the scrambled eggs and bacon were prepared very bad and I don't know why they do nothing about it despite all reviewers complaining about it !!! otherwise it was OK . Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful, they bought tickets for the museums,for me and they gave us city map on arrival.. The city is nice and I specially recommend Wind mill tours and Maddame Toussots and Van Gogh's meuseums to all those visiting Amsterdam. If you are on a budget and you get good promotional prices from the hotel it is a good place to stay in.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loughborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood one\u201d", "Author": "saronca", "ReviewID": "UR22537001", "Content": "Good Hotel.

The Nova Hotel is a nice place to stay if you are in Amsterdam. The english speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean, nice and the furniture is comfortable and in good condition. There is acces to the internet and the tv carries a variety of international channels. English and US channels are BBC1, BBC2, CNN, Discovery Channel and Euronews. English and US shows on the dutch channels are in english with dutch subtitles. The breakfast buffet is a typical hotel buffet of acceptable standard. The hotel is not suited for people with a walking disability. The nearest supermarket is on the corner of Nieuwjzids Burgwall and Paleisstraat. It is a large Albert Hein store that can fill all needs. Turn left outside the hotel and walk straight ahead. Newspapers and Magazines can be bought at Waterstones in the kalverstraat, American Book Center on Spui or the News stand next to the latter. You can also try the big kiosks at the Central Station. The nearest McDonalds is in Kalverstraat. We can recomend the italian restaurant at Paleisstraat no. 3, the french/italian cafe at no. 44/46 Nieuwendijk or the pastry shop at Hekelveld and Nieuwendijk. There are restaurants and cafes all over the area. All shopping needs can be filled locally due to the great location next to the Dam Square. If not you can take tram no.2 to the Leidsplein area.

Get the number 1,2 or 5 tram to Dam square and its only a short walk down, or get the same tram to Spui (one stop further on) and walk up Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal street. Hotel is Number 276. We got a 4 day pass that takes you on all buses, trams and metro for 17.50 euros, but you can get them for shorter periods. Get them from the information office just outside Centraal station, and this is where you get your tram from. If you don't want to take a tram you can walk down Damrak, into Dam square and then to Nieuwezijds street, but it will take you about 10 to 15 minutes. The reception staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. Our room was number 501, and you took the lift and then had a few more steps and along a short corridor to our room. Not difficult. the room was extremely large, clean, with modern decor, a comfy twin or double bed, dressing table, TV, table and chairs, fridge,digital safe in the wardrobe, and a hairdryer (contrary to someone's report). The bathroom was roomy with a shower. We did have to ask for a plug but this was soon supplied. (who takes all these plugs??) The room was warm, there wasn't a radiator in the bathroom but we didn't find it too cold. Our room overlooked the street and I was tempted to ask for one at the back after reading reviews, but we didn't find the trams a problem. Yes, you could hear them in the day, but they didn't keep me awake and certainly didn't wake me up. (needed an alarm clock for that!). The breakfast buffet supplied all our needs. when they ran out of something it was quickly replaced by 2 girls who worked really hard. We don't like a big English breakfast so fruit juice, yoghurt and fruit, cereals and milk, tea, coffee, bacon sandwiches, rolls and jam set us up. there is free hot water in the machine in reception, so if you need to take some up to your room to make a drink you can. I just took my travel kettle, and little sachets of coffee, etc with me and bought milk locally. You can leave your luggage in a locked room if you need to after checking out of your room (11.00am check out). During your staty when you go out for the day you hand your room key to reception and to get it back you have to show the small card you are given when you first register. This is for extra security.

Because of the water it does get pretty chilly. Attractions - Would recommend the standard high profile attractions but would also recommend, Boom Chicago for a good laugh. Also visit the Cannibis college for some interesting facts on hemp and to the see the garden. Food - The pancake bakery is a must and Chicanos if you like a good steak or racks of ribs.

This is the third time I've stayed in the Nova Hotel and it's the first one I thought of when I went on a solo trip this time. This hotel is central to everything but not in the busiest street. It also has the advantage of being quite close to one of my favourite restaurants, the 'Kantijl and Tiger', for yummy Indonesian food. When I arrived, I was immediately given my key and directed to the lift, which is tiny but very efficient. I had booked a comfort room and when I walked in........it was just lovely! Twin beds pushed together with white sheets and a big wooden headboard. Three huge windows, looking down onto the street. Bathroom, fridge, table and chairs, TV. It was an enormous room and very comfortable. Breakfast is a cold buffet of fruit, cereal, cheese, cold meats, rolls and toast. I found the staff, as always, to be friendly and helpful. I had asked for a smoking room and was given a non-smoking room but was promised a new one in the morning. They rang me before breakfast, to ask me did I want to move but by then I was attached to my room and couldn't imagine that they could give me a better one. Altogether I would recommend this hotel, although I was tempted to write nothing and keep it as much of a secret as possible, so it isn't booked up next time I go.....:-) I would say though, shop around online.

Talking of which there is no \"in-house\" bar, however the location is such that there is no problem with that. A resonable sized lift is available for the ascent to the rooms, The rooms where clean and tidy, the one we had was a bit crowded with a table in the room, twin beds pushed together, and a fridge as well as a wardrobe. tv in the room giving all the usual channels plus BBC1 and 2 a bonus for us Brits. the toilet was seperate from the Shower room making it better for two people when one is being used. Our room overlooked the back of the Hotel and as has been stated in an earlier review, a bit bleak, but no more so than any other in a tightly packed city centre. the room was surprisingly quiet, no noise heard of returning revellers during the night and only the cleaning staff allowing a fire door to shut broke the slumber (it was an acceptable 08:00hrs). This is not the cheapest hotel in Amsterdam, but a hostel it isn't. it is good value, excellent location, no more than 10 minutes walk to any major area, unless you started looking in shops.

Even though we are over 60 we walked from Central Station to the hotel in less than a half hour with backpacks and rolling, carry-on sized suitcases. I decided on this hotel based on location and TripAdvisor reviews. We paid a total of $365.58 for two nights in room 31 on the third floor including a good continental style breakfast, all taxes, and Hotel service fee. The room had two twin beds pushed together, a small table, desk, TV, and small refridgerator. The toilet was in a separate space (I barely fit in) from the shower and sink (no tub). Basic toiletries were provided. Good towels. Wash cloths are not common in Europe and were not provided. The beds were somewhat lumpy but we were always very tired from walking and we slept well with the windows open. The Nova was our first taste of European style bedding - no top sheet, just a comforter with a case on it. The elevator is very tiny and my wife and I (I'm 6'2\", 250lbs.) could just fit in with our small amount of luggage. We walked everywhere from the hotel - the dam, red light district, Chinatown, and even into the residential districts. We felt very safe at all times. The tram was riden twice, which stops about a half block from the hotel. Be sure and take a canal tour by boat! Our last morning we had to catch an early train at Central Station and were planning on taking the tram but was told it did not run at the early time we needed to leave so the desk clerk called a taxi and negotiated a price of seven euros for the short trip.

The hotel is undergoing renovation one floor at a time but that was not a problem. If this still sounds appealing then look for 2 star pricing on the room- not 3 star.
