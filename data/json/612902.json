This place got progressively worse. On paper it looked like a good deal to fill in 2 nights cheaply before going to a decent hotel. They have wifi - but it runs slower than dialup and couldn't maintain a skype call. They have private rooms - with beds so lumpy I'm in pain from sleeping. And they're itchy too, but I didn't see any bed bugs. The shower wouldn't stay upright. It's a solid walk from any train station, not ideal with luggage. The place is very shabby. On the plus side tho, and good brekkie. Maybe the other rooms were better. I dont know.

It's an old-fashioned place where the rooms are basic but comfortable and clean, good breakfast, 5 minutes walk to the Kurfurstendamm, is in Pariserstrasse where there are umpteen cafes and restaurants and you get front door and room keys. For the first-time visitor the drawback is actually finding the place, especially at night. Get the airport express train from Schonefeld airport to Zoologischer Garten station, then it's about 20 minutes walk if you haven't got a lot of luggage, or about \u00a35 in a taxi if you have. It's about 100 yards along the street from a dingy corner supermarket, then peer at the nameplates under a small 'Hotel' sign and you'll see it listed. Go in and take the lift to the 3rd floor and you should find reception. I've no complaints at all about the place for what I paid, which is the principal reason I stayed there.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ipswich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhatever you do, do NOT stay in this dump!!!\u201d", "Author": "BigBearinthewoods", "ReviewID": "UR35454364", "Content": "Having stayed in some really great budget Hotels/Pensions (simple but clean) throughout Germany at around 50 to 80 Euros, we thought this place looked good value at 60 Euros. How wrong could we have been? We had booked by email and were asked for credit card details to guarantee the booking. Nothing unusual there, except they wanted the 3 digit securitycode as well. I refused to give this info by open email and we compromised by me phoning through basic card details. We had looked at the website for the hotel and at these Tripadvisor comments and it looked basic and cheap for a capital city, but ok. On arrival last Thursday we were asked for the full amount of our 4 night stay in advance either on my card or cash. This was before we had even seen a room!!! We asked to see our room first and were given the key. We had booked a double with bathroom/shower and wc. The room was tiny with a shower cubicle not even my height (1.86m) in the bedroom. The room was very dirty with someone else's hairs (yes, the curly ones!!) in the wc and on the floor. The room stank of old cigarette smoke. Needless to say, we refused it and went back to Reception to complain. The unfriendly receptionist (eastern european) at first said they were full, but then when we said we would leave, offered to show us another room. As she opened the door, we all realised this room had not been made up at all, probably for several days. It stank even more than the first one. This room was located in the Pension Austriana which is apparently owned by the same person/company . There seem to be different bits of both establishments on all the 3 floors we saw. Obviously this room was not acceptable. We said we wanted to leave, but the by now thoroughly disagreeable receptionist said that if we did we would be charged the full amount for 4 days, and we would have to take the first room. She said we could only have cancelled up to 2 days before arrival. Difficult if you haven't seen the room!! I started to call Barclaycard/Visa to stop any payment when suddenly she \"remebered\" that there was one more room. This was on the 4th floor and was just about acceptable. It had big windows so that at least we could air the room. We agreed to accept this room, but for 1 night only. More arguments and telephone calls ensued. Eventually at our insistence, she called the \"Manager\" who agreed to allow us to check out the next day. This whole procedure took over an hour. We went out for a much-needed cold beer and some dinner. The area of Pariserstrasse in Wilmersdorf is just south of the Kurfurstendamm and was once quite lively, but is now looking a bit tired and past it, rather like the old Kudamm itself. Berlin Mitte, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg and other 'hoods in the East are much better if you are under 80 years old !! After dinner, back to the 'Insel. The room we had accepted was at least cleaner than the others we had seen, but the shower was not clean nor the separate toilet. Before going to bed, I checked as always to see where the fire escapes were, and the notices pointing them out. Silly me. There aren't any. Only the central main staircase that we had come up and this to serve 4 floors and God knows how many rooms/people in total. That night there was a large school group staying. No problem there as they were normal lively teenagers. But we all know what kids do on school trips because we did it ourselves. Yep, you've got it. Alchohol and Smoking. In a hotel 4 floors up with only the main stairs as an exit, very bad corridor lighting (the kind that should come on automatically, but didn't. You had to push a timer switch. Not easy to find in the dark. No signs in the rooms to indicate any Emergency exits or even the direction of the main stairs. I would think that in most countries that is illegal. Would you want your kids to stay here??? Next morning at 8.00 am we left without bothering with breakfast. The duty manager asked us what was wrong with the hotel. I decided life was too short to explain again. She said, \"But this is an old Berlin appartment house\". No problem there. Old we can do, even shabby. But not dirty, smelly, neglected by penny-pinching owners, and above all a potential fire-trap. We left. The tourist office guys at the Hauptbahnhof (Main train station) found us another hotel a little outside the centre but only 6 stops/10 minutes from Berlin Mitte on the U6. 90 Euros but worth every penny and it included one of the best German breakfast buffets I have ever tasted in travelling and living in Germany over many years. I will post a review of that establishment separately. So, please do visit Berlin. Fantastic city, fantastic open and friendly people. If you are on a Euro visit do not miss Berlin, BUT DO NOT STAY AT THE HOTEL INSEL RUGEN OR ITS SISTER ESTABLISHMENT PENSION AUSTRIANA. Instead pick a good hostel or book early with a modern budget chain like IBIS where you can get a room in Berlin Mitte for as little as 44 Euros and get your brekkie in any of the hundreds of good bakers shops in the city. We had an absolutely fantastic time in Berlin, so THANK YOU to all Berliners. Oh yeah, the U2 gig at the Olympiastadion was pretty damn special as well.

My 4-star rating is thus related to the general value of the place, and does not relate to any special qualities except from that - it is a simple budget hotel serving a good breakfast and it is nicely situated, but it is not the Ritz. The \"Insel Rugen\" is actually closely collaborating with the \"Austriana\", which is on the same premises. Apparently I was slightly upgraded, since I had well-functioning shower closet in my room, and I think I was given a room in the Austriana section, on the 3rd floor. The rooms presented in their Austriana brochure looked wholly different though, much more modern. A Danish couple I spoke with, however, had not been satisfied with their Austriana room, which was on the 2nd floor. My room was impeccably cleaned, and the breakfast was good and filling, never running short and with a few pleasant tiny variations every day. It was served on the 4th floor, but in the busy season they also have a breakfast restaurant on the 3rd floor, the one you see pictured on their website. The decor was old, spartan and very kitsch-like, but seems different in other parts of the hotel. There are many cafes and eating possibilities in the area, which has kept a pleasant and slightly aristocratic appearance with mansions, tree-lined alleys and quite a few Jugend-details, something you tend to appreciate when you experience the brutal modernism now dominating most of Berlin. The Kebab just next door keeps late hours and serves healthy food, and you can have a filling meal for 3-6 Euros. As a whole, actually, I found it easy to discover cheap eating in Berlin, which was a pleasant surprise. Especially lunch is often available for about 4-6 Euros in many places, and since I had decided to spend only little on my tour, this was most convenient, in combination with the hotel\u00b4s good breakfast. If you arrive bus bus at the ZOB station, and you don\u00b4t want to spend money for a taxi, the best thing is to take a bus straight eastwards to the Savigny Platz, currently Lines 149 and X34. Then walk down the Bleibtreu-Strasse, which has pretty houses. This means that you will have to walk 10-15 mins, but also that you don\u00b4t have to change and figure out a more complicated and time-comsuming route with the U-Bahn and S-trains, where you still have to do some walking as well. Whether the hotel can become too busy when groups come by during high-season and this might reduce its attractiveness, I can\u00b4t say. A large group of French youngsters were there for a couple of nights as well, but this did not cause any problems.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cLoved our huge bedroom\u201d", "Author": "Raahi", "ReviewID": "UR5929839", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights and our first night was terrible but the second night made up for our misery. We had booked a double bed with ensuite bathroom but were given a wierd room with tiny beds, a washbasin, shower BUT no toilet (it was in the hall). The place has automatic lights in the hallways and it took us some geting used to because the lights would take some time to come on and you would fumble in the dark for a bit. And to top it the light of the toilet in the hallway was not working. Since the front desk was on a different floor and the night clerk hardly spoke English, it was late at night and we were tired we put up with it for that night. Next morning, when we complained were told that we were given the wrong, lower priced room (but no apologies) and that we would be given the right room that day. The right room was a large room with high ceilings, toilet and shower cubicle ensuite and a window to the street. We loved it. Its good value for money and a good continental breakfast is included. The location is a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, the main commercial center and a short bus ride to the Zoo Station. The street itself has a few restaurants and is quiet.
