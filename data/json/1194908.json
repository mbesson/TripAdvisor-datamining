It is a large bedroom with a private bath in an older building. The unit has another small bedroom and both share a quaint kitchenette with a variety of healthy foods. The unit is clean, cozy and comfortable for one or two. It was affordable and located in a good spot. There were some great restaurants nearby and a laundromat. The hostess is multilingual, friendly and most gracious. It is a good spot if you want to be central and connect w/ a kind and friendly hostess/and host. They lives off site.

The room was large, comfortable and clean. It was just a short walk from Termini, and the directions were easy to follow. There was plenty of food for breakfast, and a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. The owner's husband (who spoke good English) let us in, gave us some excellent recommendations for restaurants nearby, and arranged for a shuttle to pick us up the next morning and take us to the airport for the same as it would have cost to take the train. He laid out a very nice breakfast for us and set up the coffee machine so we only had to press the button in the morning. The next morning, he showed up at our door 1/2 hour before the shuttle was to arrive, to tell us that the shuttle had cancelled because it was a holiday. So he walked us to Termini, showed us where to get the best price for train tickets, and saw us to the \"bin\" where we would catch the train to the airport. Service above and beyond expectations!! This would be a great place to stay if you were going to spend a week or two in Rome--it is conveniently located. Easy walking distance to many of the sights (we enjoyed an evening stroll up Via Veneto to the Borghese Gardens), and right by the train station bus terminal for getting anywhere else. Lots of good restaurants, internet cafes, etc within a few blocks. We would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cL'Altra Luna THE best ever\u201d", "Author": "UwontCme", "ReviewID": "UR87670443", "Content": "Stayed at L'Altra Luna for a week in November. Being a solo traveler, feeling safe and comfortable can make or break my vacation. As I walked from the Termini train station I thought that perhaps I'd made a mistake in my choice to stay here. But as soon as I arrived at the apartment and met Flora my doubts were put to rest. She is so friendly, welcoming and helpful. I felt as if I had arrived at a long lost relatives home for a visit. I can't stress enough how wonderful it was to stay there and know that if I had any problem, anywhere during my trip that I could call Flora. I walked everywhere and took the Metro or 70 or 71 bus back at night. The stops are about a block away from the apt. I was never bothered by anyone when walking in the area alone at night.. The bed was very comfortable, I always woke refreshed. The bathroom was very nice and updated. Having the kitchenette was a plus, always appreciate when I can make a cup of coffee or have a cold drink at any hour. Be sure to go to Il Forno at Campo de Fiori for Pizza Bianca... watch them make the HUGE plain pizza bead and serve slabs of it hot from the oven....my mouth waters. I truly loved my stay at L'Altra Luna and wish that I could find a place just like it for every vacation destination !", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLoved staying at L'Altra Luna!\u201d", "Author": "btcain", "ReviewID": "UR85857972", "Content": "We really loved staying at L\u2019Altra Luna. Overlooking an inner courtyard in a typical older Roman apartment building, the flat is very clean, welcoming, and quiet. The room is large and comfortable, with no TV or Internet, which was great! Very nice bathroom. The table in the kitchen was laid each night for a good breakfast, with yogurt and milk in the fridge and coffee ready to be made. Assunta also brought in fresh fruit for us. The flat has a great location, very near the metro, tram, buses, and train station, and we walked to the Coliseum. However, if you are flying into Rome with suitcases, do ask Assunta to arrange for a shared taxi/shuttlebus from the airport. It was only 31 euro for both of us, and they take you right to the door. It\u2019s quite reliable, and we took it to the airport as well. The neighborhood is an interesting one of mixed ethnicities, with a large covered market (fruit, vegetables, fish, etc.) a block away, and a marvellous gelato place\u2014Palazzo del Freddo\u2014two blocks away. The area felt very safe. Finally and especially, we had a great time talking with our hostess, Assunta.

A large, quiet room overlooking an internal courtyard meant good sleep. The bathroom has been particularly well renovated. Unfortunately our visit coincided with renovation noise from next door, but don't let that put you off - it's a lovely place to stay. The area is near the station, with a very diverse population, including students and minority ethnic groups, which means more Indian and Chinese restaurants than Italian in the immediate vicinity. The market, with wonderful fresh fruit and veg and some interesting bargains (including Italian-made suits, etc.) is literally yards away in the same street. Assunta, our host, came and went, giving us just enough advice on where to go and sharing a laugh in excellent English. If you stay there, take her advice about going to eat at the little wine bar where her husband cooks. It's the sort of place you wouldn't find as a tourist, and it's only five minutes' walk. The winelist is extensive and the handwritten menu is negotiable - on our second visit we asked for, and got, something we really liked on our first visit.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cTermini Station Area - not the prettiest section, but great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "msmo4461", "ReviewID": "UR60091392", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights in March, 2 consecutive and then one at the end of the trip. The area near the Termini station is not the prettiest, but it is very convenient if you are using public transportation. My suggestion when exiting Termini station is to go RIGHT and walk down about 4 blocks and then right again and over 2 blocks. We were travelling with quite a bit of luggage and we ended up going the wrong way too many times. We had no problems in the area and loved the convenience of the location. We walked to Termini to either pick up the Metro train or a bus to most all of the sites. The room was spotless and the Breakfast was delicious. Assunta - the owner, could not have been more helpful, although her sense of direction is not like ours in America. Just a short walk maybe a lot longer than we Americans are used to.
