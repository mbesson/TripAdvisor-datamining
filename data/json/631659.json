We did not expect much of the hotel as we just wanted a short night stay before we depart to Disneyland. Rambler seems to be the only choice which is located not too far from Disneyland. The rate is reasonable. Despite located next to a harbour making it a bit out of place and there wasn't much activities and attractions around, we have no complaints with our stay as the room was comfortable and clean. The 15 mins mini-bus ride from the hotel to Tsing Yi Shopping Mall the next morning for our breakfast was enjoyable seeing the locals along the way starting their days in this sub-urban part of Hong Kong.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR504503872", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "fun1223"}, {"Content": "Great pool, shame about the rest! We stayed here for a few nights in May and can honestly say we would never return.We had originally booked 2 rooms in the sister hotel, the Rambler Oasis, but on arrival discovered that all the rooms there face a very noisy, brightly lit container port, which while fascinating to watch would have meant little sleep (it's busy all night long, with trucks arriving/leaving via the road immediately outside and cranes beeping continually).When I explained that I hadn't realised that it was like this, the manager, Jesse, couldn't have been more helpful or professional, bending over backwards to show us different rooms. Eventually she found us rooms at the back of the Rambler Garden hotel, which looked out the back and were much less noisy. Nearly all this hotel's rooms face the docks as well - apparently that's what people like!The rooms are very small, but comfortable enough and the bathrooms are good although the toiletries are limited, with one product in a dispenser on the wall by the bath which was soap, shampoo and conditioner all in one!. Everything was very clean and tastefully decorated. There isn't anywhere to hang clothes longer than a shirt.The swimming pool (shared by three hotels) is beautiful, apparently it is the longest one in Asia, with lovely landscaping, but they charge 100HKD to use it., although the manager reduced this when we complained. There is free broadband internet access in the room, but they have to come and connect it for you each time you want to use it.The area is very Chinese, surrounded by apartment blocks in addition to the container port. It's a short bus ride to the Tsing Yi MTR station, airport express station and a nice shopping mall. There is a small shopping plaza underneath the hotel with a ParknShop, 7-11, and a laundry, so it is quite convenient.We had no real complaints about our stay at this point, other than the rather surly attitude of the staff, who were not exactly unpleasant, but apparently allergic to smiling or friendliness.Our problems started when we checked out, leaving our two daughters (aged 16 and 21) for an additional 2 nights because we had to get back to mainland China and they were awaiting their flights back to the USA.They came outside to see us off and on their return were interrogated by the hotel staff, who wanted to know why they'd left money in their room! They explained that they just hadn't put it away and didn't think it would be a problem since the room had already been cleaned that day so no-one would be going in there apart from themselves. In the 10 minutes they'd been away from the room, the staff had been up there snooping around and moving things about. This was very unsettling for the girls, especially when the staff (a manager and one other person) kept asking them why they had money in the room.Then during the night, they received a phone call at 4am, which went dead when they answered. The next day they went out to the nearby mall to have lunch and see a film at the cinema there and returned to be told that they needed to collect their things and be out of the hotel immediately because they didn't have a booking for that night. We had booked and pre-paid for the room for 2 nights for them before we left. They explained this to the manager, who initially didn't believe them and repeated that they must leave. Eventually, when my daughters persisted, they found the booking details and said they could return to their room. No apologies or pleasantness at all. their keys had been deactivated and they had to wait while the desk clerk got them some new ones. Once more, when they got back into their room, it was obvious that someone had been through their things.They called us to tell us what was going on, but we didn't feel able to complain for fear of what other intimidation the girls might face in retribution.This experience was very unsettling for them both and we would never return to this hotel or encourage anyone else to stay there.", "Date": "Jun 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR968857737", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "contentedcow"}, {"Content": "Tutto bene       La vista dalla camera", "Date": "Apr 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR793199076", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "joliebiel"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d631659-r20546781-Rambler_Garden_Hotel-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "631659", "Price": "$92"}}
