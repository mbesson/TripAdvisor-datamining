The Cafe 365 serves great coffee, pastries and sandwiches and is even open on Sundays. We also ate around the corner at La Flama and had a good experience there for very little money (hamburgers on baguettes were about 3 euros and they make the best pan con tomato we had in Spain). The metro is close and cheap and we used it a lot - it's also very easy to figure out the routes. The shuttle at the hotel doesn't run very often, but it's nice if you can catch it. We actually booked this hotel because of the free airport shuttle, but it was never running when we needed it so we took taxis which are easily available and run about $25 euros.

The biggest downside to this property is that, unless you want to fork out big bucks (or big euros) to eat in the hotel's restaurants, you're going to be pretty hungry. There are NO restaurants nearby--just a kebab place, a sandwich shop, and a small grocer. The nearby hospital has a cafeteria, but its hours aren't convenient. One solution is to eat a big midday meal in Madrid and then a sandwich or kebab in the evening. You should also note that the hotel does not have an airport shuttle. Even though it is very close to the airport, our taxi cost us over 20 euros, which we found shockingly excessive.

However, we saved at least \u20ac30 a night by booking here, and for three days the Metro journey into town and back each day wasn\u2019t a problem for us. Plusses are that there is a free airport shuttle (although the scheduled times are loose to say the least), friendly staff who speak good English, and a fabulous breakfast in the Hesperia Tower next door. Note that if you check in late or at the weekend you will have to use the reception in the tower. The Metro is a 5 minute walk away, although as other have noted you will be getting off a practically deserted train as the hotel is at the last stop. The car park is well lit though, and we didn\u2019t see any dodgy characters around. As we were constantly hopping on and off the Metro, we bought a three day card which worked out at a reasonable \u20ac5.50 per day. The only issues we had were that there was a funny smell around, although this seemed to be a general problem of the area, and not just our room. I think it was coming from the sewage system, and with our room window open it didn\u2019t unduly bother us. It also felt like we were the only guests in our block \u2013 great if you want peace and quiet but slightly disconcerting nonetheless. The rooms were well equipped, although with marble floors and no rugs we could have done with a cheap pair of hotel slippers. The shower also requires a science degree to turn on! As other have commented, the bathrooms are dark \u2013 didn\u2019t bother me, but my wife struggled with her makeup. Also, the cleaning ladies were noisy in the mornings as they chatted in the corridor. We were already up and about but it would have been annoying if I was trying to lie in! All in all we don\u2019t have any complaints considering what a bargain the hotel was. If it\u2019s luxury or a central location you are after, look elsewhere, but if value-for-money and access to the airport are top of the list then you are on to a winner (it looks easy to drive to too, right off the motorway \u2013 though give driving in town a miss, I have made that mistake before!). The Hesperia Tower next door looked great if the reception and restaurant are anything to go by, although it is definitely more of a conference than a tourist hotel. One quick tip: Book your Sagrada Familia tickets online at least a day before to save yourself a two hour queue when you are there!

Both are 5 star. I would say Apartment would be 4- 4.5 star. Very clean and spacious. We had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 3rd floor, Room 311. There is only 3 floors at the Suites. You need to book in at the Tower not the suites. Parking is underneath in the car park. Costs \u20ac24.00 per 24hours. We got a good deal direct with hotel. \u20ac222.00 for 3 nights not including parking. Apartments are decorated in black granite and light & dark wood. Queen size bed in 1 room and a single in the 2nd bedroom. Bathroom is huge, with a huge power shower with massage jets. Apartment is air conditioned, with plasma TV with English Channel - Sky News. Kitchen has a cook top with 2 elements, under bench fridge, toaster microwave, coffee machine but bare essentials for cooking with. Minimal cutlery and plates etc as the house keeping wash everything for you. Our only complaint is that it seemed housekeeping only washes dishes and cutlery etc under hot water as food and oil was still visible on plates and pans after they were left to dry. There is no tea towels or dish cloths or detergent for you to do this or even a cloth to wipe the bench from spills etc so we had to use the bathroom hand towels for this. There is a 4 seat dining table and separate lounge area. Free wifi in the apartment. Metro is a 3 minute walk across the road and trough a car park, and the train into Catalunya station takes 15-20 minutes and costs \u20ac1.40 one way. There is a grocery store right around the corner for food and essentials; also they provide a free shuttle into Barcelona city centre but not a return ride. Timetable for this free shuttle services is available at the reception. Staff are very helpful and fluent in English. Great place overall to stay just in the outskirts of Barcelona in a business district. Nothing really around her to see that is touristy but like I said it is close to the Metro. Would definitely highly recommend this accommodation and would stay here again in a heart beat.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York UK", "Title": "\u201cBest of both worlds, lovely relaxing stay\u201d", "Author": "au_contraire", "ReviewID": "UR67667856", "Content": "The Hesperia Hotel is just next to the 'Fira Suites' building (we had to check in/out at the reception there as they don't have one manned in the fira suites building out of season, but it's no trouble as it's right next to it.

It was really nice to be able to buy our own food and cook for ourselves some evenings, but because it's a hotel and not self catering, you get your washing up done for you the next day :). On the first night we arrived late and had room service and drank from the mini bar (not too horrendously priced). There was a very fancy shower with water spraying from here there and everywhere, nice if you like that sort of thing but i'm more of a bath person!! We didn't really deal much with the staff other than checking in and out as we tend to keep to ourselves but they all seemed polite and spoke good english. The location was an ideal base for exploring the city with a metro station just over the road, there are a few shops nearby but nothing much of interest in the district where the hotel is, so remember when you get back to the hotel that's where you'll stay!

We purchased a T-10 ticket for just under 8 Euros and shared it, so found the metro fast, easy and inexpensive. We don't do late nights, so didn't mind being out of the downtown area.

First of all, the Hesperia Fira Suites is adjacent to the Hesperia Tower hotel, so you check in there and get access to it's stuff, including a fantastic ground floor cafe with a yummy entrecote steak, and a Michelin-starred top floor restaurant, EVO, which I didn't try, unfortunantly. The suites are great. They are very roomy, with comfy beds, good decor and a great shower, though the AC never went below 22 degrees Celsius, which kinda was a problem for me, but I still liked it a lot. It's also close to the airport, and so this is a great choice for people who are flying. I highly recommend this hotel. My only regret was that Google Maps gave us the wrong directions to this hotel, so we did get lost trying to look for it, and almost gave up looking. So do NOT use Google maps looking for this place.

It is very much a business hotel and so impersonal. Many pluses: 1) The free shuttles to Barcelona centre and airport are very good, former enabling a full day in town and then return for suite cooked dinner in the evening (NB previous review incorrect - you can get the shuttle back from downtown but it finishes around 10 pm; the airport shuttle runs to a schedule - posted on the hotel web site but only the Spanish PDF downloads; hotel says it is starting a third shuttle to the beach in summer; shuttle to Plaza Catalunya takes 15 minutes in light traffic. 2) There are a number of shops - supermarket, fruit and veg, pharmacy; bakeries - and bars less than 100 metres/yards away in a square (walk down wide road in opposite direction to the hotel for just a few yards and look right to see a sign for the first of these shops - either walk right here or carry on a few yards for a wider approach, which is probably best at night (NB an earlier review mentioned social housing - correct but think ordinary working people rather than dysfunctional) 3) Suites themselves spacious and comfortable - good beds and reasonably equipped. e.g. 2 hot plates and a microwave for cooking. The downsides other than location are: 1) Very poor (even by Spanish standards) choice of English channels on TV - e.g. no BBC 2) Missing essentials (especially if you're used to American suites) - nothing to wash or dry dishes with, and now no in room coffee for the Nespresso machine (has to be purchased in main hotel at 0.7 euros a pop). 3) 12 euro fee for the pool/spa - though to be fair this is a separate facility (Metropolitan Spa) which Googling suggests is a level above the typical hotel facility", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms\u201d", "Author": "Cuddlemuffin", "ReviewID": "UR41584551", "Content": "Check in for the suites is inside the hotel next door and not a problem.

Yes as others say it isn't in the centre of Barcelona, but the metro is opposite and you can be in Catalunya within half an hour and down to the beach within 45 minutes (with one change over) The hotel is in a nice quite area, there are a few shops and cafes about, so not totally dead as others suggest - and several supermarkets which supply everything you need to fill your fridge. The staff were very polite and speak fairly good English - the shuttle is a brilliant way to get around for free, however it does only run at certain times, but the timetable is displayed in the lobby & the staff at reception are only at the end of the phone for any questions. The rooms are beautiful! To keep in theme with the rest of the hotel they're modern and lovely to look at. Within the room you get a small kitchen area with hobs, all kitchen equipment, dining table, sofa, 2 LCD TV\u2019s, a comfy double bed, wardrobes, safe, mini bar, coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, bathroom with the best shower ever! fresh clean towels every day, hairdryer and air conditioning. So everything you could need! We had breakfast included in our stay, this again was very good. It didn\u2019t have the widest spread of food but it had more than enough - cereal, bread, and pastries, fresh fruit, meats, yoghurts and drinks. And again the staff were always polite. We didn't try any of the other menu's offered at the hotel, but for no other reason than we were out till late most nights and as you would expect the centre offers much more variety. **TIPS** - As we expected we had to travel to get around, but this wasn't any hassel at all, transfers to the airport are about 20euro's, but do say to the taxi driver on the way hesperia tower (not many know of the suites) - Buy a T-10 it really does save you a lot of money and its easy enough to use (if your travelliing with a partner/others and aren't planning on using the metro much you can just buy one ticket between you) - If buying souvenirs, go to La Rambla but shop around as the gift shops towards the port are much cheaper than the ones closer to Catalunya - The zoo is really worth going to! (it looks a little run down outside but it is open) - The room includes a book called 'The Style' READ IT! it has everything you need to know in it, places to eat, things to do, where to shop, maps!! - Bus tours seem a good way to get around, but can be done on your own just as easy - Check in at the hotel isn't until 2, but you can leave your bags and come back if you arrive before hand - There is a gym and pool, but it does include a surcharge I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is going sightseeing or wants somewhere a little quieter.
