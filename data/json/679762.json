We Arrived at Barcelona Saurday 1.00am.The taxi driver could not find hotel in spite of SAT NAV (GPS) confirming we had arrived . We finally saw a small name plate on the side of a closed front door of an old shabby appartment building .This Hotel' was one floor in this building unlike what had been described when we booked through Internet .The room was so small we could hardly open a suitcase .The bed linen ,as promised, was Egyptian cotton but brown velvet cushions on top did not seem very hygenic .Double bed was small and no space even for a chair .Shower room was modern but wooden strips in shower tray not very practical to keep clean as they were full of hairs .Shower room/toilet reminded us of facilities on 50ft boat.Only tv stations available were in Spanish and most of them at that time of night were porno shows .Coffee making facilities which were promised on booking were non existent .No room service ,no mini-bar and as we arrived very late at night we would have appreciated some sort of drink.After my husband complained our room was changed the next day to a slightly bigger room, but still no chair ,mini bar or coffee making facilities. This hotel was advertised as 4 star and we paid euro278 for 2 nights bed and breakfast . Considering that the week before we had spent 2nights at the 4 star superior Hotel Ritz Roger De Lluri (just 5 minutes away ) and paid a total of euro281.40 bed and breakfast including room service we feel that Boutique Hotel Barcelona is not what it says it is and someone from the tourist authority should check how come it is rated as 4 star .Having said all this both yong men at reception were very courteous.Barcelona is beautiful and we can't wait to return .Next time we know which hotel not to book !", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR124050829", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AlessandraMalta"}, {"Content": "Nice staff, great location! My husband and I went to Barcelona to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and stayed at the Boutique Hotel after getting a recommendation from my sister, who had stayed there last year. The hotel\u9e93s atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for! Yes, the rooms are smallish, but that just adds to the feel of intimacy and cozyness. There is attention to detail that you don\u9e93t find in large hotel chains (loved the art books in the lobby). Staff was nice and friendy, giving us helpful advice on the city. We were just around the corner from one of the city\u9e93s main avenues (Passeig de Gracia--famous for Gaudi\u9e93s buildings and shopping) but you\u9e93d never guess that from being inside the hotel--the lobby and our room were always peaceful and quiet.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys personalized treatment and detail-oriented decoration and ambience.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR733869616", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jmathews2008"}, {"Content": "Well-Located, Friendly Staff The Boutique is a pretty nice hotel with a great location on Pau Claris, a few blocks north of the Old City, and has a lot to offer a discerning traveler. The rooms are small; if you have ever been in a suite on a cruise ship, you may be reminded of your stay. The staff is very accommodating and permitted us to leave our luggage there all day while we toured on our final day. They also provided us with a map and a nice orientation speech to Barcelona. My only complaint is that once we checked out, they were done dealing with us \u9225?we had to pay two euro for a small bottle of water to take on the train back to Paris.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR950932291", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AFiii"}, {"Content": "Not what I expected Not what we expected. Although I must say the staff were really helpful and we were offered 'a really nice room' this proved to be rather small with no tea of coffee making facilities. The girl on reception made us coffee on request, however I dont think this is part of the service. We had a balcony, however this overlooked the road and was far too noisy and smelly to open. The young girl on reception did offer to change the room, however I had spoken earlier to a couple who had an internal room and this had a small window looking at a brick wall with only a shaft of light coming from above. The lift was like something out of phsyco open cage type with room only for 2 people and a case. Breakfast consisted of the presentation of a wooden tray for the two of us with 1 yohgurt, 1 apple, dryed packet bread, 2 Croissants and jam. The website says there is a bar-not true. We did feel secure and safe. Location is ideal for shopping and was not too far from a tube station. We walked everywhere. We flew into Gerona(you are better off going to Barcelona airport) the airport bus cost approximately 22 euros return each and this was very efficient. First bus back 5.15am.The bust station was a tube of taxi ride away. I would definately return to Barc, however I would stay somewhere else.", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR460203851", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "jinnylongsibs"}, {"Content": "Petit Claris (also called Boutique Hotel Barcelona) mediocre and misrepresented I can certainly see why this hotel changed it's name. My wife and I have visited Barcelona many times, and seeing the claims of luxurious accomodation and reasonable prices this hotel made, we were charmed and booked a balcony room for 150 euros per night.First of all: This is NOT a luxury hotel. It has no restaurant, no patio, no gymnasium, no coffee-making facilities... and no natural light!The lobby is small, and dark with a pokey breakfast room/bar with a very limited menu. Continental Breakfast was a stale croissant, a cheap yoghurt and a couple of pieces of dry fruit. The pictures and mirror have not even been hung on the wall and just sit propped up against the wall or the empty bookshelves.The wifi and cable TV didn't work in our small, dark room that had a balcony so small and noisy that we couldn't even stand on it, let alone sit. The Luxury bathroom was the size of a closet, with a bath tub that would have barely seated a child.This central hotel is actually a 20 minute walk from the centre, and misrepresented in every way. The only saving grace was the friendly receptionist, who continuously apologized and tried to find solutions for us.Unfortunately, she couldn't. We left feeling cheated and lied to, and despite writing to the management several times, we have been dismissed and ignored.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR661614923", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "RigamanUk"}, {"Content": "Charming Hotel - excellent!

The building and everything inside it, is intricate and elegant, and the location extremely accessible from the centre of town. We got the train from the airport to just around the corner from the hotel. The place is small, and feels a bit like the interior of some elegant colonial house, with stained glass windows, dark wood floors and a really charming lobby. The room we were given was moderately sized with a balcony, which was small but pleasant, but the minute we opened it we were certainly reminded that a) that we were in the middle of the city and b) that the double glazing was extremely effective when the doors were closed! The bed was extremely comfortable and the d\u8305cor and fabrics, silken and velvet and very luxurious. The tiles in the bathroom appeared to be magic, changing color when wet. When I enquired in reception about this, I was told they were made of a special marble imported from the Maldives! Breakfast was simple but plentiful and the staff and service excellent. There was a good wifi connection throughout the place and interesting balance of the contemporary with decadent old world style. This place is the best of both worlds and if the standards are maintained, I imagine it will be very popular and frequently revisited.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR901897444", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "robizar"}, {"Content": "dommage   showReview(20451519, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR945562268", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "apprentivoyageur"}, {"Content": "Nicht wieder!   showReview(10328250, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR536204737", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Reisevogel72"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d679762-r20496110-Boutique_Hotel_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "679762", "Price": "$191"}}
