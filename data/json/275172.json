I actually live in Puerto Rico and had heard and read much about this place but never took the opportunity to stay until now and i do not regret it at all. Upon arriving we were immediately greeted by staff who took our bags and brought them to the reception area. There we were greeted by Mr. Wilhelm Sack. Extremely friendly and upon finding out he was born in Austria followed to have a nice conversation in German with him. The check in process was quick and flawless. We were told that our room might not be ready yet but would show us how to get there and we could have a drink while its getting ready. We arrived to the room and to our surprise it WAS ready. We walked in the door and it was breath taking. Beautiful old style rooms that just immediately gave the feeling of being at home. The dipping pool was incredible. The view from the terraze spectacular. The sound of the ocean waves crashing on the beach was exactly what we were looking for. This was only the first floor. Going to the second floor the huge beautifully appointed bathroom. Enormous bed. And even more breath taking views from the balcony. We feel in love right then and there and knew the 2 nights would not e enough. The food - lunch and dinnet were delicious. Tasteful. And filling. The presentation of the food was amazing. The first day we ordered lunch for room service and the waiter set the table with a white table cloth and made us feel like we were actually eating at a restaurant instead of our room. The staff is friendly. Attentive and very helpful. While on the beach i wandered up to the veranda and asked one of the waiters where the bar was. He asked me why and if i wanted a drink. I said yes that i would like a mojito and pi\u00c3\u00b1a colada. He said please go back to the beach as they are obligated to bring the drinks to us. WOW. The place itself is secluded. Quiet. Tranquil. And hidden away. As other reviews state. Dont expect to be partying here. This place is to go. Escape in the tranquility. Gather yourself and recharge. You actually lose yourself being here and forget even what day or time it is. It is pure relaxation. When we woke up Sunday morning the thought of having to check out and drive back to San Juan entered our minds and were deeply saddened that it ended so quick. Had Monday not been another working day we would have stayed another night no questions asked. Thank you to Mr. Sack and his entire staff for running such an amazing hotel with attention to detail. I can not say a single bad thing. I hope to be back soon and many more times to escape the hectic San Juan area.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southbury", "Title": "\u201cRelaix et Chateau hotel on the water lives up to its billing\u201d", "Author": "Happytrails1110", "ReviewID": "UR127460849", "Content": "Beautiful beachfront hotel with a very accommodating staff and two story attached villas decorated exquiaitely in Moroccan style.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat, but please pick up the trash on the beach.\u201d", "Author": "SharonHerrera", "ReviewID": "UR127157819", "Content": "Exceptional place, a good quiet retreat for a weekend away.

It is a place you would never want spoiled. It is true - it feels like your home. And as Anne Morrow once wrote \"I shall invite into my shell, only those with whom I can be completely honest\". It is quiet. It is resplendant. The management is perfect and personal - it is apparant that each guest is the personal responsibility of your hosts. The chef is stunning and the food is accordinly amazing. The enitre staff takes cares for you as if you are guests in their home - -for example - two hours after our arrival - as we were enjoying wine with our friends on couches in the bar/library - - the waiter came with a smile and a tray - and very gently announced \"excuse me, but it is important that we should move you to the terrace just over there - the sun is setting now - you should be there to enjoy it.\" And indeed we did.... Dinner was exquisite. We had opted for the meal plan - thus It began with a pureed mushroom soup, followed by salmon gravlax, then beef filet (I substituted roasted breast of duck) and then baked chocolate pie ( which my husband adored - I substituted chocolate cake with a molten coconut center and coconut ice cream on the side - exceeded only by a friend's rasberry souffle with cream anglaise and cinnamon ice cream on the side) - As our post-dessert coffee was being served, our waiter (without being asked) took a moment to explain to us where breakfast would be served in the morning - and a few other details - just as you would explain to guests in your home. The suites - a small apartment in fact - are furnished with incredibly beautiful traditional furniture - featured a living room, full bath, kitchen, espresso maker and terrace with lounge chairs, table, market umbrella and plunge pool downstairs - and a wonderful bedroom and sitting room upstairs - with a canapied bed, enormous bathroom, huge footed whirlpool tub, rainshower, 2 sinks etc - and balcony terrace overlooking the ocean....upstairs. Two larger pools with terraces and lounge chairs etc - - - one an infinity overlooking the ocean - were delightful. The building for dinner, lunch and breakfast - - with bar/library - featured open terraces -and intimate, exquisitely decorated air conditioned rooms - just incredible. This is a quiet place. Do not come here looking for a party - unless you rent the entire hotel for a group - - - and do not make a party - - those around you are relishing the peace and gentility. Should you want to explore beyond the hotel - there is much to do and enjoy in Rincon. For example, we chartered a catamaran from the nearby marina and enjoyed a morning on the water - snorkeling and looking for whales.

Went with our family over the Christmas break. Arrived Christmas night late and had requested a light dinner and wine in our room.

They brought something a half hour later (at midnight) which was ok, but they ended up charging us for the whole thing-most places I think would have comped something like that Fans for A/C in the rooms were so loud that we had to open windows at night-and it was quite warm, so our sleep quality was low. Breakfast the first morning took 1.5 hours. They do not provide activities, which is fine and very clear in their literature. There are two kayaks on the beach. Beach is small, but lovely. There was no snorkeling equipment, so one of the staff went to buy for us-they were very nice and really wanted to be helpful at every turn. One day we ordered lunch to be brought to the beach. After a half hour, I inquired about the status of the food and was told (at 12:30 pm) that the cooks were on break and it would be another 15-20 minutes. Food in nice restaurant was great, but wine list had no reasonable choices (starting at $75 and going up from there). The public space was very relaxing and comfortable-great sunsets. Two nice pools.

We just visited for our 5th anniversary and stayed 5 days. There have been extensive renovations to the property with new entrance and \"new\" villas on the left hand side of the property. There are now 22 villas which are 2 floors with 2 baths and plunge pool. The new villas are very nice and we stayed in one of these units with an ocean view. They have tile/marble and are furnished with antiques.to Another new development is the ongoing sale of the remaining 17 units-right hand side of property as the \"Residences at Horned Dorset\". Approximately one third of these have been sold with at least one resale on the market. The level of service and attention to detail that we experienced previously is no longer present. It's a subtle change but definitely noticeable. There was an \"owner\" on site and it seemed most of the attention of the staff was directed at them. I guess that is to be expected if you purchase a unit there. Our biggest disappointment was with Aarons the main restaurant. On our prior visit we had some of the best meals of our lifetime in this restaurant and were very excited with our return. The food was mediocre at best. Undercooked without much taste we actually sent a dish back to the kitchen. After 2 nights with similar quality food we canceled our meal plan and ate out on the island. We subsequently found out from the staff the Chef Aaron has the left the property. He is now working on Martha's Vineyard. I am not sure this is public knowledge as the staff member seemed reluctant to answer when I asked about Chef Aaron. Overall the Horned Dorset is a special place for us since we got engaged here. The hotel and surroundings are beautiful. Unfortunately the service has declined and it is unclear whether it's related to the development of the \"residences\".

My husband and I spent 7 nights at the Horned Dorset at the beginning of May for our belated honeymoon. I was less than impressed with the cold reception we received -- we arrived on a particularly rainy afternoon, and expected a nice warm greeting after our long, wet drive from San Juan. Instead, when we entered the check-in building, we had to shout to get someone's attention. The young lady came to check us in with not a single word of greeting or even a smile. Which is what it is, BUT the gentleman she called to help us with the bags was unwilling to carry our suitcases to our room until we insisted -- keep in mind the hotel is comprised of several buildings with several sets of stairs, and ours was the furthest from the check-in. Really surprising lack of customer service for such a hotel. In any event, once we were checked in, things looked brighter. The rooms are lovely, but enormous. Far more space than one couple needs (but we're from New York City, so....). The plunge pool is great, and the bath tub is beautiful and huge. I didn't love the location of our room -- it was literally right next to the stairwell, and the first room near the breakfast area. Not quite as intimate as I would have liked, but provided for easy access to the beach and the restaurants, which was nice. Speaking of the beach....perfectly nice, beautiful and tranquil, but never (and I mean never) cleaned during our entire stay! There were cigarette butts and broken pieces of plastic which I eventually gathered and stuck under my chair because they were such eyesores (needless to say, the pile of debris remained in that location). Just didn't understand why no one bothered to do some minor daily cleaning -- there were definitely plenty of staff available to do so. The food was okay -- we were there for 7 days, and ate at every restaurant multiple times. The food is definitely way overpriced, but you just have to consider it a sunk cost and not think twice about it. It was perfectly fine, but rather generic, and could certainly have benefitted from more seasonal, local and organic ingredients -- there was a dearth of fish on the menus, which I found surprising. I was also unimpressed with Restaurant Aaron -- again perfectly fine, just nothing to write home about. And the menus are small and did not change the entire time we were there -- we eventually ended up trying some restaurants in town to break the monotony. My husband took some surfing lessons arranged by the hotel with Ramses(?), and he was really pleased.

I really can't say enough about this resort - it is truly paradise! We booked our stay through Jetsetter and had been anticipating the trip since January. We arrived late on Saturday night. We chose to fly in to Mayaguez on Cape Air rather than driving from San Juan, which was a good idea. However, note that due to the size of the aircraft, delays for weather may occur. We took a car from the airport, which was arranged by the hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, the check-in process was easy and quick, and we were escorted to our Residence. We had originally anticipated that we would be in a Suite, but were delighted to be assigned Room 16, a large, beautiful residence with a big plunge pool and deck and unobstructed views of the ocean. We were impressed with the ornate yet comfortable furnishings in the residence. The rooms at the hotel are all about privacy - it was nearly impossible for anyone to see us while we were in our room or on the deck, and we noticed the same type of privacy in each of the other rooms on the property. Although it was apparent that there were many other guests at the hotel, we at times felt like we had the place to ourselves, which was lovely. If you're on Facebook, be sure to \"like\" the resort's page - it is consistently updated with upcoming events and breathtaking pictures. The service was impeccable throughout our stay - all of the staff members were friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast most mornings at the hotel, which is served overlooking the water (but which you can have delivered to your room). On our second to last night of our stay, we ate the best meal of our lives at Restaurant Aaron - we chose to get the 10-course tasting menu and were not disappointed. The service in the restaurant was wonderful and the wine pairings chosen for us were delightful. We never ate lunch at the hotel, but the menu for the Blue Room looked delicious. Since we rented a car for most of the week, we were able to explore Rincon and try some of the local restaurants. The people in Rincon were all very friendly and we ate at some wonderful restaurants, including the Rum Shack, Banana Dang, the Calypso Cafe, Tamboo, the Pool Bar, and Pizza Land. We would recommend any of these restaurants - all of the food on the island was fantastic! Although it was hard to motivate ourselves to leave our beautiful room and plunge pool, we took two day trips. We drove down the coast, ate lunch in Joyuda at El Bohio, and hiked to the Cabo Rojo lighthouse. We also went snorkeling near Descheco with the Taino Divers.

Although there are many superlatives that I can associate with that stay, ultimately it failed, because the hotel could not deliver one of the very basics: hot water. More later. But first, let me tell the story Our stay was in Escondida 29, a lodging styled as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Horned Dorset Residence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and which I perceive is one of the units that was part of the original property that has been sold as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. During the check in process, the bellman who took us to the residence allowed that he had never been in the unit before. I believe that this residence is only rented by the hotel during peak periods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so, most guests will be spared our fate. The Escondida building houses 4 units, and is the furthest unit from the main lodge building. That makes it very quiet (not that any part of the property is terribly active). We had a large living room, a full kitchen, a large full downstairs bath (shower only) and bedroom, a plunge pool and an ocean front patio. Upstairs was the master bedroom, ample closet space, and a very large bathroom with both walk-in shower and soaking tub. The master bedroom had a small balcony overlooking the plunge pool. The unit was nicely furnished \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit in a somewhat more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153designer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fashion than is my liking (most of the chairs were gorgeous to look at, but uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time). The air conditioning, while fairly loud when running, was extremely effective and the interior of the unit was always comfortable (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very picky about cool interiors for sleeping). The bedding and linens were of first quality. The master bed was comfortable, if a tad soft for my preference. The pillows were very good. We had wireless internet in the room, which my son used to stay connected with his friends back home. As a residence, our room also had a TV. Everything in the unit was in good repair (save an ice maker in the kitchen which did not work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just leaked water when turned on). The unit was very clean. With the sole exception of the bed-side lamps, lighting was good to very good. The bed-side lamps were very beautiful, but not very effective. The grounds of the hotel were well maintained \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not immaculate (as I experienced at the Hacienda de San Antonio in Mexico \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but then Puerto Rico labor rates are higher than Mexican labor rates), but certainly more than acceptable. It might be too strong to call the grounds beautiful, but the property certainly evidenced care and attention. The main lodge building houses the restaurants and the bar. It was comfortable and well appointed, with many options for seating. The restaurants are air conditioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the informal restaurant, The Blue Room, served meals outdoors on each of the nights we were there (and outdoors was certainly comfortable). The lodge had a gorgeous balcony on the lower floor which overlooked the sea. Housekeeping service was good, with only one hiccup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get slippers until the second night (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know enough to ask the first night). We did not use either of the two pools, one of which is quite large and has plenty of poolside seating, preferring the small beach. Because the hotel faces south, the waves on the beach are fairly small. Nonetheless, my son and wife enjoyed the water and the beach very much. That said, no one would describe the strong point of the Horned Dorset Primavera as its beach. The hotel has a number of sea kayaks available for guests, and the wife and son made frequent use of them. The strongest points of the hotel, from my standpoint, were (i) the restaurant staff, (ii) the manager, and (iii) foremost, the food. All of the restaurant and bar staff, without exception, were gracious, welcoming and provided high service. The manager, Wilhelm Sack, is a hotel manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c attentive, interested in the well-being of his guests, and present. I was most impressed with Mr. Sack, and very much hope he can work to solve the problem we experienced (which I discussed with him during our stay, and as to which he made a gracious gesture). The very best part of the stay, however, was the food. It is very rare that I am interested in eating from the same kitchen five nights in a row. At the Horned Dorset, I did. We had three dinners at Restaurant Aaron, and two dinners in the outside location of the Blue Room. Each of the meals was excellent. The food was not cheap, but worth every penny. Breakfasts were very good, with a number of options that kept us interested across our five mornings. The food was so good, that it almost overcame the great failing of our stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lack of hot water. This problem arose very quickly the first night, when my son attempted a shower. Running the water for 20 minutes resulted in nothing more than slightly less cool water. A phone call to the desk brought the suggestion that we also run the tub water full time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153draw hot water to the unit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nope, still cold. So, the wife, the son and I had quick, cold showers. The next day, I started the tub about an hour before we were to shower. The water actually got up to tepid. That said, tepid water feels cold until after you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been standing in it for 3 or 4 minutes. We were never able to enjoy the beautiful soaking tub, because of the thought of a tepid bath gave us shivers. At no point in our five day stay did we ever have warm water, much less hot water. The wife, in desperation, even walked in her bathrobe up to the gym shower to see if she could find hot water there. No such luck. From conversations, I perceive that the hot water problem is more pronounced in the older units, and may have more or less been solved in the newer units which are normally the ones used for hotel guests. And, since our unit is apparently almost never rented out to hotel guests, most visitors may not have to put up with the problem we did. But, given a room rate approaching $1500/night for the holiday season, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forgive a hotel that fails in one of the very essentials. Had I known that we would not have hot water, I would not have booked my stay. Be careful about which unit you book \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would focus on the newer hotel units, and avoid the residences unless you were assured that this problem had been fixed. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with sadness I can tell you that our stay was a failure, and a very expensive one at that.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westchester, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOne of the finest Hotels Ever!!!\u201d", "Author": "briancross71", "ReviewID": "UR102333936", "Content": "This by far is one of the finest hotels I have every stayed in, it was opulent :) The marble floors and Terra Cotta was amazing, I loved the plunge pool, I want to put one in my backyard now, The Semi-private beach was amazing and so was the infinity pool :) The steak from the restaurant was amazing My new bride and I had a wonderful time :) If you get the opportunity to stay here, jump on it......", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca, NY", "Title": "\u201cpricey but beautiful\u201d", "Author": "karylj2000", "ReviewID": "UR99239581", "Content": "If we could have afforded to stay here for our month long visit to Rincon, we would have.

If you are looking for the perfect mix of luxury and privacy, the Horned Dorset is your hotel. This is not a resort on a Caribean Island... Yes, you can have drinks by the pool, but you will not find yourself in a tacky all inclusive resort. You will be surrounded in a Mediterranean vibe, beautiful grounds and landscaping, amazing vistas of the Carribean, and the most romantic sunsets you could ask for. This place is amazing. Wilhelm the General Manager is such a kind, wonderful man. From arrival to the front office, you feel taken care of. Now, after all of these years and at least 1/2 a dozen trips, it's like visiting an old friend, being at home. Food - Rediculous... Aaron Wratten is a classically trained Chef who brings a french fusion flare to the Carribean. Dining at Restaurant Aaron is a 5* experience from serivce to food. They really do it right in so many ways. I love that the bill is simply taken care of and added to your room. The menu is always different, so it's hard to name a favorite. But if you opt for the tasting menu, you are in for a treat. If this restaurant were in Manhattan, it would give his old stomping grounds at Daniel a run for it's money. Drinks - They really make one of the cleanest, most crisp Mojitos on the island. Not too sweet, the right amount of mint. Perfection. Rooms - AMAZING! How many resorts in P.R. give EVERY GUEST ROOM it's own private plunge pool? Marble bathrooms, amazing imported fixtures from Morocco, the most comfortable 4 poster beds. I have never stayed in such spacious accommodations that were so well appointed, and for a very good value. For those with a little more to splurge, I can't say enough about the Residences. If you stay here, you opt into a meal plan and every meal is included. There is also a TV and Internet access for those of you who simply can't unplug. I really prefer staying in these rooms because they are even more spacious, right on the beach, and have larger private pools. The sounds of the waves crashing on the beach lull you into the deepest sleep. I love it!!

I seek out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). LOCATION: Great. Right on the beach but 15 mins by car to other restaurants. We were told you could walk along the beach for 90 minutes to another restaurant but this walk is not pleasant. The beach isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very attractive an there are tons of rocks with no sand making the journey not so fun. We turned around after about 7 minutes of walking. TYPE OF ROOM: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Ocean Front Residence BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Bed is very soft (perhaps a bit too soft for me). The linens are outstanding and the pillows are down and very comfortable. LIGHTING: Tons of lighting in the room. The difficulty is trying to figure out which switch goes to the light you want to light/turn off. BATHROOM/SHOWER: The shower is gorgeous. All marble and huge. 3 showerheads and 3 additional jets made for a very fun shower experience. Water pressure can be very hard. Would have been my best shower ever if the water could have been more hot. Definitely enjoyable still but the hot water issue still exists to some extent. Bathtub is huge and great for 2 people. Water in tub was able to get very hot. TOILETRIES: Seem to be of high quality but not a brand I am familiar with. Cotton swabs are not individually wrapped so you may want to bring some clean ones from home. CLEANLINESS: ROOM: is very clean but the wood walls were very sticky from the salt water and needed to be clean. The windows were way past their cleaning time as well as it reminded me of a window you would see on a very old boat in salt water that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been neglected. COMMON AREA: Filthy. I have never stayed in a nice resort that everywhere you looked was in need of major cleaning. The hotel appeared to have been shut down for 10 years and just reopened the day we arrived. Every outdoor light had many dead bugs in them. All walking paths need mopping or steam cleaning. Beach had tiny bit of trash that clearly had been there for a while. Loungers by the beach and on our private pool area were dirty and nearly all chair cushions outside of our room had stains. Linens used for the outside tables were dirty and the (at one time nice quality) napkins were stained. If you actually looked at areas for uncleanliness, you would find it absolutely everywhere outside of the rooms. This was not dirt from a few days of no cleaning, it is clear that this place hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned in a long time. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad the rooms were cleaned well or we would have left a day earlier (this discussion did happen regardless) of our 2 night stay. Our last day we noticed that the garden view room area was much more impressive (as I believe it is newer) and much cleaner. A/C: Worked well both upstairs and downstairs. CLOSET SPACE: Closet has no doors and would not be enough for two people to unpack. The iron and ironing board can be seen from the bed. STYLE OF ROOM: Excellent. Moorish design, 2 levels, beautiful iron spiral staircase. Loved it. Did think there is a bit too much furniture and chotchkies. There are 12 lamps just upstairs. In the kitchen part of the room, the cleaning supplies were in plain view (mop, broom, bucket, etc). COMMON AREA: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already discussed how filthy this place is. In addition, the place could use some painting as there is very noticeable rust on our balcony pillars. The pathways are lined with lights but one of perhaps every 5 lights are out and many have the wrong type of bulb so they look awkward. The umbrellas in the breakfast area are very dirty and the chairs and tables are in a gravel area which has no aesthetic appeal. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Our room was very quiet and we could block all morning light with the shutters. FOOD: Breakfast was very good so we had high hopes for dinner. The appetizers were $15 and entrees were $30-$45. The restaurant is definitely stuffy for a beach hotel but if the food was good, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about this. The food disappointed. The soup was equivalent to boxed soup we buy at the store. The lobster had the wrong consistency and little flavor, the crab cakes were mediocre. However the scallops appetizer was outstanding. These were all appetizers and we decided to leave the restaurant to eat elsewhere as we left hungry. At these prices, we would have accepted good, but just ok isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough. TV/INTERNET: Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the TV that is only available in the residences (not suites). Internet is at no charge and of average speed (upload speed may be the slowest I have experienced outside of Burma). SERVICE: Everyone here is very nice. Typically we would have to try to locate someone to get service and there is nothing that was truly done that was extraordinary. We would see lots of staff in areas not accessible to guests and I always wondered why they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaning the common areas as opposed to engaging in conversations among themselves. SUMMARY: Not worth the price. We were very kindly upgraded to a residence ocean front room from our resident garden view room. This made the difference and is the only reason why we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check out early. The room is amazing. The beach is not attractive with water that was the same color as back in California (although the sun was never really out). At these prices, there are so many other places that will have equivalent rooms with clean common areas and a nice beach. I would recommend this place only if they cleaned and reduced prices substantially. Anyone used to the finest of hotels & service will be disappointed but those that travel less may leave here being impressed (reason for the mixed reviews).

One of my favorite aspects was a welcome letter advising that the \"hotel has no planned activities.\" Although you can arrange day outings and in-room massages, the main activity is pure relaxation.

The staff, led by Mr. Sack, provide European style assistance -- they don't hover but are absolutely delightful and knowledgeable and ready to assist the minute you ask for anything. Our suite was beautifully decorated with mahogany furniture and an amazingly comfortable canopied four-poster bed on the second floor. Each suite has its own plunge pool and private balcony. The food, especially at Aaron, the more formal of the hotel's two restaurants, was wonderful (note: the formal restaurant is open only Wed-Sun). The night we arrived at the hotel, we learned that a special concert by a quintet of chamber music players was about to begin in the Restaurant Aaron. We dashed to our room, changed out of our casual travel clothes, and somehow made it to the concert on time. A wonderful dinner followed the concert.

The wonderful thing about trusting someone of Mr. Sack's experience and talents is that the level of welcome, service, and comfort is consistently the highest. Mr. Sack knows his guests and never forgets a name or a face. He and his superior staff make their hard work seem effortless as every need is attended to even before one knows one wishes it. For instance, the staff knew how much I enjoy an early morning before-breakfast swim and immediately offered to have a pot of coffee resting beside a beach lounge chair when I emerged from the water. It is this kind of individualized service that is a hallmark of Wilhelm Sack managed hotel. And in his assistant general manager, Ramon Serrano Mont\u00c3\u00a1s, Mr. Sack has found someone who also makes the guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comfort his highest priority. The cares of the world fall away at The Horned Dorset and much of the reason for that also is attributable to the remarkable Chef Aaron Wratten and his capable and inventive kitchen staff and welcoming wait staff. Local fish and produce abound, served exquisitely to show off their just-caught and just-picked freshness. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superb location on the western side of the island allows one to drive through what had been sugar plantation country. An indigenous extensive mango grove extends for miles along one of the roads. In fact, The Horned Dorset keeps on hand a list of the botanicals found on the property created by the Director of the New York Botanical Garden. The Horned Dorset Primavera is for the true traveler, for the traveler who appreciates that it is the deft skill of a hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general manager that establishes the greatest hotels as legends.

We stayed for four nights and, being off-season for the resort, we received an amazingly low rate for a villa (compared to their seasonal rates). On top of this, on arrival we were upgraded to a full ocean view villa, which blew our minds: two stories of beautifully decorated, clean and wonderfully set living space, with a fantastic four-post bed, and a spectacular 170-degree view of the ocean right at our balcony, surrounded by beautiful trees. It also had a small, secluded terrace with a private pool. Every day our stock of complimentary bottled water (sparkling or still, depending on your preference) in the suite would be replenished, and when we come back from dinner we would find our bed turned down and all bedroom windows closed for the night, which was a nice touch. Waking up to the beautiful Rinc\u00c3\u00b3n sunrise, with birds chirping and the ocean waves rumbling was a wonderful experience. (And this comes from a Puertorrican--I grew up in the Island and I'm used to its charms, yet the Horned Dorset still managed to impress and surprise me.) Being off-season, the resort was minimally staffed, but all present went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant and special as possible. The hotel restaurant served classic french cuisine with a touch of caribbean flair, and the chef even accommodated a special request to have chicken one night when it wasn't in the menu. It was succulent and delicious, and beautifully presented in spite of the short notice. The service was impeccable, and the entire staff was warm and friendly, and at a great disposition to serve us. Our only complaint, as others have mentioned, was that there appears to be no hot water. We were told to leave the water running for a few minutes--and we did, at times up to 30 minutes!--but it never got entirely hot, just slightly more than lukewarm. I don't know if this is due to cost-savings during the off-season, or if there really is an issue with the heating system; but in any case it is something that should be easily addressed with proper equipment and maintenance. That said, this very small detail did not affect at all our enjoyment of the place, nor will it influence in any way our decision in the future to return or recommend the resort, which we will do without question. All in all, it was a wonderful, relaxing experience, and we are definitely coming back to the Horned Dorset.

The Residence was gorgeously appointed. We had TV and internet and a Kitchenette. We also had great views. The restaurant Chef Aaron's was superb(we ate all our meals there). It was a secluded and romantic setting. Unfortunately, the resort itself seemed a little neglected. Our plunge pool was dirty with leaves and debris and the filtration system didn't work. The white cushions on many of the loungers were dirty (including the ones in our deck). The hot water was an issue as it took 10 minutes to get hot water and during peak times(in the AM and late afternoon)- hot water was no where to be found. I believe our residence was the farthest from the water heater. I would recommend they invest in a tankless water heaters for each residence, they are energy efficient and don't take up much space and never run out of hot water. The gym, while well-equipped, had no A/C. The units are there but they don't work!. I lasted about 30 minutes before I had to leave the gym. That is just unacceptable. The gym is useless without air-conditioning. There is little service in any of the public places like the pool. They don't even mention that they have bottled water for you at the pool. We found it by accident. For this price, they need to have at least someone to bring you water and or beverages or at least a poolside bar for you to get it yourself.

On many occasions, we felt as if we were there all by ourselves -- just what we wanted. Don't worry, though, there is plenty of staff for whatever you need. The Horned Dorset seems to follow a European approach to good service: the staff remain as quiet and low-key as possible but, as soon as you ask for something, they promptly meet your request. All of it adds to the sense of quiet luxury. Beyond the relaxing privacy, we were delighted to discover that the food there is excellent. As other reviewers will tell you: sign up for their meal plan -- it proves to be a bargain. Their chef trained at an award winning restaurant in New York City and it really shows.

We do high-end here and there, but this wasn't special enough for us to pay $350+++++++++/night. We stayed 3 nights in a garden view suite. Two-story suite was beautifully decorated in the mediterranean style furniture, but I learned that means \"uncomfortable\" furniture. Plenty of chairs and couches, but none you can get comfy in. I am a meeting planner by day, so you would think I would be well aware of the property I was going to. I knew there was no internet service, but somehow I missed that there were no TVs nor alarm clocks. Since there's not much to do in Rinocn late at night, a TV is really needed unless you are early to bed which we are not. As for the alarm clock, not really an issue other than I like to know what time it is if I wake up during the night. When one of the staff was in our suite fixing the safe (very fast service), I asked about the alarm clock. He said they offer wake up service. I had only found one phone in my few hours there and it was on the first floor, while the bed was on the second. I confirmed this with the man and he said they offer a courtesy door knock for wake up. Again, the door is on the first floor. I don't sleep that soundly, but since the A/C unit sounded like a jet engine (this is actually a plus to me), I doubt I'd hear the phone or the knock if I needed it. We just used our cell phone alarm on check out day. The A/C worked on and off. We found that if it started getting oddly hot, we shut it off for 5 minutes, turned it back on and then it was fine. This worked for our 3 nights, so we never reported a problem. Mosquitos, I agee, are bad, so bring bug spray and something for the itchy bites. The weather was very hot for us with no breeze, so being at any pool was not an option the first day. The beach was nice with plenty of chairs and great ocean swimming. No one around to ask questions of, but we got by just finelooking around for ourselves. On the second day, we were able to sit by a pool and were alone most of the time which was nice (it's off season now). We ventured out to lunch each day to see Rincon which is very different than the HD. When we got back, the sun was on our dipping pool, so we hung out there each afternoon. THIS WAS AWESOME!!!! Granted, we could see our neighbors' dipping pool on either side of us if we walked out on our grass (photo opportunities in the gardens) and they never had sun in their \"backyard\" area. We lucked out. We spoke to another couple in an oceanview room and they said their pool was pretty dirty from leaves from the trees, but we lucked out again in that area. The hotel advertises that they serve \"tapas\" each evening at 6:30. That would be singluar (one) tapas. When another guest was having drinks on the balcony the same night as us asked the waiter what was in the \"dip' he put out (man was allergic to shell fish), the waiter said he was pretty sure it wasn't shell fish that is was fish. (yes, that is what he said several times). I was shocked the waiter never went to find out what was in it, but the man ate it and lived to tell about it. Though it was nice to sit on the balcony at sunset, you may want to look at the balcony from the beach before you stand on the balcony. It is going to come crashing down any day now. Let me know when you see the rubble as hubby and I have bets on when it will be. As for my reference in the start of this to $350+++++++++++, the pluses are all the charges. There is a fee for general services on top of the room rate which is maid service, beach towels, free water bottles, etc. Again, I missed knowing about this charge until I made my reservation. Our confirmation indicated it was 12%. We were charged 15%. When we showed the reception person our confirmation, they did adjust it and explained it just went up to 15%. If you booked a while ago, you may want to keep an eye out for this if you want an accurate bill. As for reception, they are open 8am-10pm. If you happen to check in later than that (as we did), you are on your own. Key is at the reception and security showed us to our room. Thank goodness we were close to the reception area. Many rooms are down very steep, uneven stairs, so I couldn't imagine carrying our luggage ourselves as would be the case late at night. I assume there are bellman for that during normal hours, but don't know for sure. Yes, there are roosters, but they weren't near my room luckily. Each floor of the room has glass doors with beautiful wood shutters to close at night. Unfortunately, if you like it dark for sleeping, there are small windows above each door on both floors that let a ton of light in all night long. The fitness center was pretty good. We did not dine there even though everyone raved of the food, we wanted to get out and about in Rincon (go to Shipwreck if you want to dine out). Food ran about $30-$45 per entree at the hotel restaurant. Lunch menu was about $15 for a burger. All pretty normal for a high end resort, but so unnecessary in Rincon. Dogs are everywhere in Rincon, so being at the hotel seems reasonable. They didn't seem to bother anyone, but since we didn't eat there, I am not sure. Bed was great, linens, towels, bath tissues, etc - all great! It would take just a little bit extra for this place to be fabulous. I wouldn't go back for these prices and rooms just off the mark.

We stayed for four nights in one of the Horned Dorset Residences right on the beach. Let me start with the good and move towards the disappointing. Our residence was very large and, to my tastes anyhow, was very well furnished. We had two stories with the master bedroom on top and the living room (plus guest bed) below. I enjoyed the space, the Moorish design and decorations, as well as the size of our small private pool. The residence even comes with a kitchen replete with stove, fridge, microwave, and espresso maker (though, oddly, no ordinary coffee maker or kettle for tea--nor any pots or pans so that you could actually use the stove). When all was at its best, it could begin to feel like I owned my own well appointed condo on the west coast of Puerto Rico. In fact, I think the hotel is trying to find purchasers for the residences with some kind of lease-back agreement. Three more quick high points before we get to the bad: (1) We really enjoyed the food. We ate most of our meals at the Horned Dorset, and I do not regret it. There is definitely enough variety to eat every meal and keep eating different things for four or five days. (That said, unless you're going to eat a lot, I recommend against the meal plan, since for us it ended up making no financial sense). (2) The beach is very pretty, and, despite what some reviewers have claimed, it is indeed possible and even enjoyable to swim in the water. (3) Some of the staff are really nice. We love Pedro's pi\u00c3\u00b1a coladas. Now let's move to the disappointments, shall we? (A) No Cancha Del Cielo. As of May 2009, the HDP website still claims there is a tennis court, the \"Cancha Del Cielo\" (or \"Court of the Heavens\") with a \"spectacular view\". I eagerly packed our tennis gear. When we arrived, we were told the court no longer exists, but that the hotel could arrange for tennis in Mayag\u00c3\u00bcez. I have three words for that: bait and switch. (B) No hot water. For the first two nights of the stay, we had no hot water. From what I can tell, a number of the residences were without hot water for those nights. What use is the gorgeous bathtub you see in the pictures from other reviews when you have nothing to fill it with? The hotel offered to put us in another room, but one that was otherwise not nearly as nice (no internet, no TV, quite a bit smaller), all for the bargain of $770 per night instead of $880. (C) Mosquitos, lots and lots of mosquitos. In a four day period, I killed about 30 of them IN OUR ROOM. I could never keep them out, even after it seemed to me I had killed them all. There are also usually lizards and dogs roaming around the property. We generally like dogs, though the ones here urgently needed a bath. (D) Rocks and Sea Urchins. Though you can swim off the beach in front of the hotel, and though the beach is pretty and the water is lovely, DO NOT step on the rocks in the water. I accidentally stepped on a sea urchin and ended up with several spines in my foot. Do you know what you're supposed to do when you step on a sea urchin? Soak your foot in hot water. Whoops: See Disappointment (B). Wait, I have a Residence, can't I heat water on the stove? Oops: No pots. In fairness to the hotel, after we explained all of this to them they put an electric hotpot in our room. I hope for the sake of future guests they leave it there. I'll end the review with some rapid fire tidbits I think might be useful to people. *Our gadgets worked. All of our gadgets worked just fine in our room, including an iPhone, a Blackberry, and a Kindle. The phone in the room seemed to be a little on the fritz, so it was good that our phones were fine. * TV and internet connection in the room worked without any problems or difficult set up. * They have kayaks for one person but no double kayaks as of May 2009. Their double kayaks were stolen or broken or something. Kind of a downer for couples. * While staff are friendly, sometimes they can be hard to find. You end up walking around the clubhouse or beach gazebo just looking for people. It's kind of a hands-off experience, which is generally good but maybe taken a little too far at the moment. If I were to come back, I would be lulled back chiefly by the size and Moorish decoration of the residence and the food from the restaurant.

In my opinion, some of their problems are: there are many stray dogs all over the property - under your dining table etc., their more casual restaurant was closed so for dinner you could only eat in the formal dining room - while you'll read that others rave about their food, it is very expensive and NOT at all special. The private dipping pool was not heated - none of their pools are heated - kind of annoying, the beaches are narrow and not very nice.

Due to ease of travel to Puerto Rico, the Horned Dorset won out for this particular trip. After spending the night in San Juan, we made the relatively straightforward drive to Rincon, via toll and local roads. Once off the toll road, the pace slows; the closer we got to our destination, the narrower and twistier the roads got. Here, with smaller towns, less population, and more livestock (especially those dratted roosters who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know light from dark), I felt we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d finally arrived in the Caribbean. At last, we drove through the gated driveway of The Horned Dorset. One thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned through many years of travel is to manage expectations, because expectations that are too high are often dashed. Nevertheless, everything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen or heard about The Horned Dorset led me to think we were in for a superlative experience, so I placed myself at risk of disappointment. This time, however, my high expectations were exceeded. Simply put, the Horned Dorset Primavera is one of the most exquisite places I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever visited. The resort is sited on a luxuriantly landscaped hillside that slides into the surf, with a small, protected beachfront. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d booked a garden view \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Primavera Suite,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which had a foliage-obstructed view of the sea from our balconies. The suite, in a whitewashed building containing two suites, was 1,400 square feet on two levels. The first level featured an expansive living area decorated in Mediterranean style, small kitchen decked out in rare blue granite, and a marble-clad bath with shower. Two sets of french doors gave out to a greenery-screened private terrace complete with our own dipping pool. Upstairs, we had a huge bedroom and sitting area, equipped with a giant four-poster bed draped in mosquito netting, and an even more sybaritic full bath. One set of french doors opened onto a small Juliet balcony, with another two sets of doors opening onto a larger balcony. The fittings and fixtures included oriental rugs, wrought-iron chandeliers, and mahogany furnishings. For the time we spent at the Horned Dorset, we ranged between our own terrace, self-contained as it was; the beachfront, which is largely protected from the wind but can sport some rough surf; and the infinity-edge pool adjacent to our building. We were here for togetherness, sun, and warmth and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much more. In the late afternoon, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have sundowners on our terrace, before proceeding on to dinner. Our first night, we had dinner at the on-site Restaurant Aaron (as opposed to the more casual bistro-styled Blue Room). We splurged and ordered the multi-course tasting menu, having been assured that despite nearly a dozen courses, we would not need to be hauled out in wheelbarrows. What we got was a dozen little tastes of the chef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best offerings, enough to tantalize and satisfy (e.g. a single perfect scallop, or a demitasse of soup), but not so much as to overwhelm. From rabbit sausage to Kahlua souffl\u00c3\u00a9, it was just perfect. Service was lovely and friendly, though I suspect some of our well-dressed servers are surfer dudes by day. After our first night, we only ate on-site for one other meal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lovely oceanfront dinner at the Blue Room. Though we enjoy fine dining, we like local food and establishments even better, especially when traveling. So we enjoyed venturing off-property, having found the laid-back beach bars (often recommended by hotel staff) much to our liking. For our purposes, Rincon and The Horned Dorset Primavera delivered what we were looking for in a romantic wintertime escape. Our main goals were to find warm weather, a secluded seaside setting, luxurious accommodations, and fine dining (when we wanted it). That we could leave the gates of our hotel and enter into a funky, laid-back beach town made it all the more appealing.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cThe most relaxing environment\u201d", "Author": "hotelcollector", "ReviewID": "UR24371398", "Content": "If you are looking to truly relax on your vacation, this is the place to go.

We stayed at the Residences which are right by the water's edge (just a few feet) with private plunge pool and garden. The Residences also have TV and internet. This was probably one of our most relaxing and private vacations. And for that, we have the hotel staff and mangement to thank especially General Manager Wilhem Sacks and Assistant Manager Ramon Serrano. They were both on top of everything and dealing with any issues we had promptly. What makes the service here special is that its very personal and customized. Even prior to our arrival, we received a lot of personal attention from Ramon. He was very up to speed with any questions and requests we had. In October of 2008, we stayed at Sandy Lane in Barbados, another top resort in the Carribeean but we did not have the pre-arrival service that we had at the Horned Dorset. Sandy Lane was generally responsive however Horned Dorset went above and beyond to take care of us. We also stayed at the Regent Palm, Turks and Caicos in May of 2008 (skip it, this resort has no pre-arrival service and service here is automated/mass oriented). You def get the feeling that you are being looked after at the Horned Dorsett. Another point is that Mr Sacks is a part owner of this resort which explains his dedication to the hotel guests. This is not a big, mass resort that overwhelms with activity. It is a tranquil and small resort. While kayaking, swimming, snorkelling are available, it was very refreshing not to see any boats or jet skis in the water. It was lovely to be able to look out into the open unobstructed water which is quite a rare experience. Per some reviewers' comments re the beach, while it is quite small, it is secluded and has a lovely feel to it. It is never crowded which is such a treat especially over New Year's. We have been to other top resorts with powder white sand and crystal clear waters however the whole beach/pool experience was overshadowed by the crowds (Regent Palms!) especially over the New Year holidays. I personally prefer beaches that are in an enclave and protected versus ones that are very big and out in the open. On our third day, we spent the entire day on the beach. The waters are generally very calm, not too rocky and perfect for swimming. Sit near the beach attendant if you are the type that needs a lot of service. As mentioned, this is not a large resort that will overwhelm you.The attendants here do not come by with sorbet, spritzs or cold towels here. They tend to leave you alone so if you need something just ask and they will more than oblige. There is iced bottled water available so just ask for it when you want it.The infinity pool is stunning and I woud highly recommend taking a swim in it. The view is out of this world. The hotel has a lovely ambiance. Its surroundings are rustic and laidback while the accomodations are luxurious and very romantic. The Residences have a Moroccon inspired decor while the Primavera Suites have a Spanish/Mediterrnean feel. Guests that stayed at the Primavera Suites only had good things to say about it however i would strongly recommend staying in the Residences which are larger, closer to the water and have TV/internet. The breakfast and lunch area overlooking the beach is lovely yet very casual. Try the creamy gazpachio at lunch, we literally had it every day. It is also a good idea to rent a car to see some of the island. The resort is a little out of place in Rincon but that only added to the overall experience as we liked venturing out to see Rincon and returning to our lovely hotel. Whatever issues this hotel may have (hot water is not that hot, restaurant Aarons can be a bit slow), they will make up for it with their personalized service. Any issues will be dealt with immediately by management. The Manager/owner is extremely hands on and will ensure you have a good experience. The best thing about this resort (apart from the highly customized and personal service) is that special feeling/ambiance you get when you are on vacation. We loved the gorgeus two story accomodation we had with a private plunge pool only a few feet away from the water. Being so close to the water, it was a real pleasure to sleep at nite to the sound of the crashing waves. Most places in the Caribbeann are not this close to the water. There is usually a large garden between beach and the room but you are really just a few feet away at this The bedroom is ultra romantic and we now understand why so many reviewers say its the most comfortable bed they have slept in!!! We would whole heartedly agree with that. Horned Dorset is a special and tranquil place to getaway from the real world.

Truly I can't imagine having a single negative thing to say about this property or our experience there . . . we are both over-worked city-dwellers and the Horned Dorset was exactly what we needed to relax and re-charge in elegant perfection. We flew direct Boston to San Juan on American and rented a car to make the trip to Rincon. This ended up being an excellent option as we were free to roam around throughout the week and venture off the property for lunch every day. We took the Southern route there (via 52) . . . about 3 hours total. We returned via the Northern route (Interstate 22) about 2.5 hours total. The Southern route is prettier, if you don't mind a little extra time. Our GPS worked in PR, which was extremely helpful, but either route is simple and direct if you're just using a normal map. When we checked in to our suite, we couldn't have been more impressed. The space is simply gorgeous, and I fear that pictures do not do it justice. The bed may have been one of the most comfortable ever, and the private patio with plunge pool was our favorite part. We had excellent afternoon sun there, and spent a good portion of every day just reading and dipping at leisure. Fantastic! The infinity pool was another favorite spot, and we often had it to ourselves. Our two-floor suite came equipped with two full bathrooms (one of the largest tubs I've ever soaked in) as well as a small little kitchen area with a fridge and ice maker. The fridge was stocked with both still and sparkling water. (We added some beer to the mix.) There were also a few books, which I loved to see as I often run out of reading material on vacation. If you were in search of more books, you could wander over to the library bar located in the building with both of the property's restaurants. We invested in the Breakfast & Dinner meal plan, so spent a great deal of quality time there. Food was fantastic and service impeccable. Breakfast is served outside with the most fantastic view of the water. Dinner at the Blue Room (a new and more casual space) is also offered al fresco in the same area. Restaurant Aaron upstairs is more elegant, romantic, and formal -- but we loved having a choice to mix up the week. And -- it has to be said -- Pedro at the bar makes the best Mojito I've ever had . . . without question. We enjoyed lunching at some of the casual beach bars throughout Rincon including Tamboo, Calypso and The Rum Shack (at The Lazy Parrot). It was fun to check out the surfer culture and live vicariously through all the folks that moved to PR to follow the waves. One mistake I would avoid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we decided to make the 90 minute drive to Ponce to do a little sightseeing. Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made it sound like a charming and wonderful city with great architecture, etc. DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T DO IT! If you want to see something worthwhile, block out some time for Old San Juan (which is what we will do on our return trip). Ponce was not worth the drive, especially as the well-known museum there is currently closed for renovations. Bottom line -- if you're looking for a wonderfully quiet week with great food and amazing service, the Horned Dorset is ideal. Night life can be found a few minutes down the road (specifically at Calypso), but between the sun and the food we rarely made it past 10:30 p.m. If you go, be sure to give a good scratch to one of the many dogs on the property (specifically Jeffrey -- who was our personal favorite).

After discovering late that we had allowed our passports to expire, we were reminded that Puerto Rico did not reqire passports. Since this was such a special occasion, we wanted ultra exclusivity and privacy - and boy oh boy did we find it! We flew into San Juan, rented a car, spent the night at the Intercontinental and then drove about 3 hours to Rincon on the Western coast of the island. The drive is normally only 2 hours, but we ran into construction. But a beautiful drive. This is not a hotel. It more like 2 story villa's with private plunge pools overlooking the ocean. We had a villa that overlooked the ocean and the outdoor breakfast area. This room was magnificent. a true wow factor - and we've seen some places believe me! Our requested champagne was chilled upon arrival. Huge double doors opened to the ocean view surrounded by flowering trees. I'd say this place was over 1200 square feet. It was equipped with a kitchen area but did not have stove or microwave. Did have a refrigerator and an awesome espresso maker that used pods. The pods were replaced daily. Full array of dishes and glasses. Upsatirs was a massive 4 poster king bed with a canopy, sitting area, ceiling fans, balconies that you could stand up on but not sit on - and the bathroom...huge shower, bidet and the largest 4 claw bathtub I have ever seen... or been in. It fit 2 with plenty of room to spare! We spent hours in the plunge pool. It was about 4 feet deep and about 7 feet by 6 feet. The filtration system constantly circulated the water. We bought candles in town and lined them around the pool at night...that was great. Speaking of night, we were serrenaded by the local tree frogs that sounded like birds all night..never saw one though...but it sounded great with the pounding of the surf..... While we were there, we hardly saw anyone - and to be sure it was off season since Sept. is most definately hurricane time. But we lucked out, no problems with the weather. We had total and complete privavcy. Tracked all storm activity via the internet prior to coming over. The restaurant was fantastic too. It would be a bit costly to eat there all the time, since we had a car, we went in town a few times and we hit the grocery store to get local things and take back. (we do this everywhere - even Paris which was the best place...2 bucks for Bourdeax and pate....) I have to say though that the Fresh Red Snapper dish was the best fish I ever ate. A couple draw backs....not deal killers, but know them...to keep with its seclusion and privacy, there are no telephones, radio, TV or internet access. We did not have any problems with cell phone calls though - just watch the cost. But if you need a TV or internet access, you are out opf luck. We brought a crank up radio that worked great. I did not have a wireless card with me so maybe that would work...It bothered me a bit - no internet to follow my college football!!!. We ventured into town and found a Cafe run by Mike from New Jersey - Cafe Viejas..and I was able to get online from there (saw the NFL games too! PLUS a great hamburger) The only issue we had with the weather was humidity. For the 1st 2 days, wow - be aware, you will sweat, especially if you are drinking! But the Pool helped that.... there is no real beach and you can't swim....but they have plenty of chairs on the bluff which gets sea spray it's so close. This didn't matter to us...we were in the pool. Also, if you are a Rum drinker, don't come thinking Rum in Puerto Rico (home of Bacardi) is cheap! It wasn't, although you could get cheap rum drinks...not any more expensive, but not cheap either.

On vacations, we tend to be on the go, trying to experience as much as possible. The Horned Dorset was a wonderful place to collapse when we needed to catch our collective breath. The facilities are top notch. Our suite was really a two story villa, with an incredible amount of space in excellent condition. The king size canopy bed was so comfortable, it was the best week of sleep I have had in months (maybe years). A really nice touch is the small pool in the patio behind the unit (each suite has one). If we were to make an effort to find something to complain about (which is difficult to do with this hotel), my wife thought the chairs in the suite weren't as comfortable as she would have liked, so she did most of here reading at the beach. If you want to eat here, breakfast is served on a patio overlooking the ocean, dinner is provided in a spacious dining room (also overlooking the water, through large windows). The food was a bit pricey, but well worth it, especially the breakfast. As for the beach, it's very private. I read an on-line review complaining that it was rocky. Yes, there are some large rocks at each end of the hotel's stretch of beach, but if you're picturing the coast of Maine, this is not that. The beach is sandy. The hotel has beach chairs and umbrellas on the sand ready to be used. There are snorkling fins and kayaks that can be used any time. For those wanting to stay away from the sand and salt, there are two pools on the grounds as well. We found the entire staff to be friendly and helpful. The suite was always clean. Any needs we had were taken care of. The grounds are effectively fenced off by walls and vegetation and there is a security guard patrolling the parking lot and nearby grounds around the clock. We always felt safe and secure. There are some folks who might not want to stay here because: 1. You want to spend most of your vacation in the San Juan area. It takes 2 - 2 1/2 hours to drive to San Juan from Rincon. We drove back to that side of the island one day. It's not that bad a drive, but I wouldn't want to do it more than one or two days during the trip. 2. You want a TV or internet access in your room. There are no TVs (we missed the first week of the Beijing Olympics, but we lived). You can get on the internet in the hotel's office, which we used to check email from time to time. To be honest, though, if TV or the internet are going to be major parts of your vacation, don't go to Puerto Rico - you should want to take advantage of what the island has to offer. 3. You want a \"big resort\" type experience - you know, the kind of place that has multiple bars or restaurants on site, a gift shop, an arcade . . . The Horned Dorset is not that type of resort.

There is never anything going on. It just seems so out of place in such a warm, latin country full of vibrant music and flavors. Definitely do not come here if you are young, energetic and fun loving. It's geared more toward older folk or boring people.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "Coach2", "ReviewID": "UR18280672", "Content": "Honeymoon Vacation: June 25, 2008-July 2, 2008 Traveling from: Laguna Beach, CA The hotel is beautiful, the service is wonderful, the food is fabulous, the beach is soooo warm and clear with no waves, and the room was to die for. The owner, Wilhelm, chose room 15 for us. It is a two-story ocean view villa with a large patio and dipping pool. We enjoyed relaxing out there as well as at the beach kayaking. The entire hotel is soooo quiet; the only noise comes from the tropical birds, frogs, and crickets. The weather does not feel as humid as San Juan. It is clear every day until about 3:00 when it rains for an hour, so get started early. We actually did have a TV, phone, and Bose system to hook up to an Ipod. There were two bathroooms, a living room, a dining room, a kitchen, a huge bedroom with the most comfortable canopy bed ever, a walk-in closet, and an extra bedroom. The air conditioning is pretty loud, but it didn't keep us awake. The rooms are cleaned every day with turn down service at night. I would definitely eat at Restaurant Aaron for dinner at least once.

First, the good parts.... The setting, grounds and accommodations were spectacular. We felt like we were in Marbella, Spain. Looking at the property on line does not do it justice. The property houses guests in bi-level suites. The downstairs has a living room, kitchen, and bathroom with a shower. Upstairs is the sleepiing area with a large bathroom, shower, and huge tub. Each suite has a small private plunge pool and sitting area. The other very positive experience was dining. Whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner, the food was well prepared and presented. The wait staff was very professional. Unfortunately, we found that service and attention to detail at the hotel was seriously lacking. Personally, I'd gladly trade spectacular accommodations, for spectacular service. The downstairs bathroom had no soap. There was an Espresso machine, in the kitchen. In the afternoon, I made some espresso us, and put the used cups in the sink. They were still in the sink after we returned from dinner, although there had clearly been turn down service. If we wanted coffee the next morning, we'd have to wash the dishes ourselves. There was no bath gel to use in that beautiful huge tub. One morning I got up early and decided to go outside by our pool. When I went to look for the pool towels, which are supposed to left in the rooms, there were none to be found. There was no directory in the suite explaining how to use phones; which rarely worked, book sightseeing, spa services etc. There was a lovely infinitey pool, with a few lounges. In the same area, was an umbrella table with a wicker basket filled with towels. next to the table was a cooler with water. I asked one of the hotel staff if it would be possible to get an umbrella for myself. He just kind of mumbled that they don't do umbrellas there, even though there were several umbrellas in the storage area beside the pool. At least the towels were shaded and cool. If a guest wanted a drink or something to eat by that pool, there was neither a hotel staff person, or even a phone to make such a request. Every afternoon it would rain. No one bothered to cover the lounge cushions, so by the time the sun came out again, everything was soaked, and no one could sit outside. Although they were never rude, the staff was just indifferent. Soap, pool towels for our plunge pool, and an umbrella are not outrageous requests. I would not recommend this hotel, nor will I go back.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Quinta, California", "Title": "\u201cA truly unique hotel perfect for relax and romance\u201d", "Author": "LuvTravel007", "ReviewID": "UR18250242", "Content": "If you want to get away from it all The Horned Dorset in Ricon is a romantic french boutique hotel.

We cannot stress enough how much we love and miss the Horned Dorset. ROOM: We stayed in a two story villa with a private wading pool outisde. We anticipated having no internet, television, etc. and, to be honest, we would not have used it had it existed. This villa was spacious and beautifully adorned (and the bed was super comfortable). The bathroom was beautiful, with a spacious tub and separate shower. POOLS: Although there was more than one pool, we spent our time at the pool that fed into the ocean (infinity pool). It was always clean, had a gorgeous view of the ocean, and made for fantastic pictures. Towels were always provided, as were bottles of water in a cooler. BEACH: We can't comment so much on the beach, as we honestly spent zero time on the beach. This is not because it was not beautiful, it was simply because we had such a relaxing time reading by the pool that we never had the chance to explore the ocean. FOOD: We ate both breakfast and lunch outside overlooking the beach. We are foodies, and we would have left the resort if we felt the need. Needless to say, we didn't. The options were plentiful, the service was great, and we especially recommend the mofongo for lunch. We ate each night at the restaurant at the hotel. We were pleased but not enthralled the first night, and we thought it might be because we were staying during the \"off season.\" But our final two meals were fantastic - attentive service and delicious food. SERVICE: Service at the Horned Dorset was top notch. The owner honestly met us outside the hotel because we were having trouble finding the entrance. Everybody was incredibly welcoming and wanted to enhance your experience. We spent the second two nights on the veranda playing chess with our excellent bartender waiting on us. Additionally (and this might not fall under \"service\"), there are two awesome \"house dogs\" which make the experience even more intimate. ALL IN ALL: We spent six nights at the Ritz in San Juan following our nights at the Horned Dorset. While the remainder of the honeymoon was amazing, we could not stop talking about the Horned Dorset. We have every intention of returning there upon an anniversary. Thank you Horned Dorset, for making our honeymoon sublime.

The accommodation is great - on 2 levels and spacious. Would recommend the rooms with sea views as you can sit in bed with the shutters open and sea/hear the waves. The views are what make this hotel so special; the bar over the water faces sunset and there are the most spectacular cloud formations. The beach is really only tiny but the 2 pools are lovely. The restaurant food was excellent and the best we had on P Rico in 2 weeks - we ate there each night - all good. We dont always eat breakfast but it was worth getting-up for to sit on the terrace by the sea - and because the house is Italianate in style it reminded us of being by the Italian Lakes. The only negative comment is that there were no special touches; such as a bottle of wine on arrival, fresh milk in the fridge, something to read...

It's one of those places that you feel \"in the know\" for experiencing, like it is a long kept secret, a hidden door and that you somehow found the key. I came across the Horned Dorset website after a few days of extensive searching for a great place to take a quick, romantic vacation. It was not easy to find and I assume that is how they like it. However, once I did find it I knew we had to go. It can be a bit pricey but once you are there you realize it's a bargain for the price per night. Most 4 or 5 star vacation resorts, especially in the Caribbean will cost around $500/night (the disneyland-like Atlantis in the Bahamas does and all you get is a single, cookie cutter room with horribly cheesy bed spreads.) That being said we paid $420/night during off season for a two FLOOR garden villa with a private outdoor plunge pool and it was gorgeous. Working in real estate I can tell you this place is worth well more than that...but being that it is located on the west side of Puerto Rico I think that may bring the cost down. We seriously couldn't believe we had this all to ourselves. A living room, dining area, small kitchen (no stove), two full bathrooms one with a free standing tub and the most gorgeous wooden, 4 poster bed I have ever seen! The villa was meticulously appointed and fit in perfectly with the rest of the property. Decorated in a Mediterranean hacienda style you truly feel transported to another place in time, where there is no rush and relaxation is your only goal. Most of the property is crisp white surrounded by manicured palm trees and other vegetation. The main building where you can eat lunch, dinner or just play chess has red tiled floors and is decorated with hand picked ornaments and furniture. Pelicans fly by on a daily basis swooping down to grab a fish or two. These gorgeous birds are right at your fingertips putting on a show seemingly just for you. Okay I am rambling. The two pools on the property are great, the infinity pool which is visible from the entrance is smaller and not very deep, but when we were there we were the only people who sat by it so the size or depth didn't matter. We had the pool to ourselves! The pool by the main building is much larger and is very private and pretty. Most vacationers sit by that one. The beach is very small, almost non-existent on high tide days and you can't really swim in the water as it's quite rocky under the surf, but it's just so picturesque you don't really care. We spent a few hours each day after breakfast sitting out on the grass above the beach just reading and watching the birds. Again, it truly feels like your own secret hideaway. The best meal served there by far is breakfast. Sittting outside with linens, surrounded by sculptures eating from quaint dishware we felt like royalty. The creole french toast was out of this world and the service is more than accommodating. Lunch and dinner are served only in the main dining room and lunch on the porch of the main building as well. While the food is good it's a bit pricey and we didn't eat there for every meal. It'd be great if they expanded where they will serve you and the hours of service during the day a bit. But still not really worth complaining about. The location of Horned Dorset is a bit tricky to find as it's tucked away on a narrow, residential street but once you get acquainted with the small neighborhood it's easy to get around. Rincon is a small surf town and everyone there is laid back and LOVES their home. People from Rincon stay in Rincon. And while we were there we didn't want to leave either. It's a 2 hour drive to San Juan the bustling capital of Puerto Rico but we didn't care to make the drive, the west side of the island has culture, history and great driving roads. The whole experience was just phenomenal. The service at Horned Dorset was warm, welcoming and laid back. Everyone seemed genuinely happy. The atmosphere was the definition of peace and the style and appointments were pure sophistication. Horned Dorset is a truly special place that has a stolen a piece of my heart. We can't wait to return and hopefully one day own a villa on the Horned Dorset property to call home, aka paradise. If you are thinking about planning a trip to Horned Dorset and have any questions, do not hesitate to send me an email.
