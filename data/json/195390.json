As i walked into the room beside the receptionist desk i was met at the door my a huge rat which shuffled passed my feet and ran out on to the street. My girlfriend and i were horrifed at the stench of the room and not only this but the massive gaps in the walls as you will see from the pictures i will post caused by the infestation of rats in the hotel.There were droppings all over the carpet their were in fact maybe 3 or 4 more rats in the room where at this stage my girlfriend nearly got sick with fear. My friends were in the hallway still seething from knowing they had slept in a room which was not suitable no matter what the price for human beings! I spoke with the receptionist and he made a phone call to the other hotel which was full up and could not take us in for the night as their was no possible way we were going to stay in the hotel with the infestation of rats! I in turn asked him to cancel our reservation as at this stage my friends in the hall way were physically sick and my partner near to tears. I did not asked for my booking fee back i just asked for a place to stay which the hotel could not provide and it was at his stage that things turned nasty as the hotel manager came down and told me that if i canceled staying i would have to pay for the room for the night, even though they could not find us another room in another of their hotels, i was still 'expected' to stay in this room that was infested with rats! While i knew it was good value for money no human being in this day and age should have to pay to stay with rats. Remember it was at 1 o clock in the day when i arrived and at this stage i was just of the plane and tired i just wanted to settle down but being told their was no other room and i would have to pay for the room i was not going to stay in apart from givin near 12 hours notice.At this stage it was not even the money it was the principle! How were we expected to stay in a room full of rats and rats droppings and then to be told we would have to pay even though it was one o clock in the day was beyond reasoning! They would of had all day to hire out that room to some other poor unfortunate soul. I will be returning to london very soon as i had a wonderful time but i will not let this matter lie down. I agree you pay for what you get but you dont have to pay to stay with rats you can gladly lie outside bins any where for free and they will hang around. What i want is for people to know how bad this place was and from other stories in the area this was not the first time this has happened in this hotel! Since noone has asked even to see if i got somewhere safe to stay for the night i will present a full report to the health and safety board of accommodations and show them the pictures of the appalling state of earls court hotel.

I really wish I'd taken my digital camera to show you just how disgusting this place is. The only good thing about this hotel is it is right near Earls Court tube station so you can escape when you realise just how bad this establishment really is. If you are wise, please accept my judgement. Know that I am not exaggerating, and JUST DO NOT STAY THERE. Here is my story...... When I arrived the Greek guy on reception (who was wearing t-shirt and shorts) was too busy watching TV to notice I was there. I knocked on the window. He said \"hang on a minute, mate!\" and made me wait whilst he watched the concluding part of whatever he was watching. I thought to myself: \"I don't want to hang on. I've been travelling for 11 hours!\" After a very long check-in process I was given the key to my room on the first floor. I noticed that this \"non-smoking\" room smelled of stale sweat and cigarettes, as, in fact, did the entire hotel. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor must have dated to the early 70s. The flaking yellow wallpaper was impregnated with smoke. Despite there being an ashtray (a strange thing for a non-smoking room), the surface of the cheap formica table was pitted and scorched with crater-like cigarette burns. The dirty army green bedspread that covered the musty and unwashed blanket was also littered with cigarette burns. The nasty, ill-matched and sickly pea-green nylon curtains (I have thrown better away) were not made of enough fabric to draw across the window. The ledges, windows and pelmets were thick with dust. The carpet was matted with years of congealed dirt. Its original colour is anyone's guess....oh and the taps had brown rings of sludge around them. No kettle in the room. Instead you have to use a communal one downstairs. Not wanting to use the powdered milk that was there I ventured into the kitchen in the basement and opened the fridge......AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH a bowl of what was once tinned tomatoes covered in green mould sat on the mildew-covered shelves! No way was I going to eat here for breakfast! It is almost impossible to find words that can convey the seaminess of this place. To be hugely outdated is one thing, but to be seamy, dirty and sleazy is quite another. Went back up to the room for a shave. No towels, and no plug in the sink. Went down to reception and asked for a towel. The guy said \"oh sorry mate, I forgot,\" and gave me a towel (which, to be fair, was perfectly clean, thank goodness). As for the plug, he said: \"well it should be there.\" I explained that there wasn't, and he grudgingly went and found me one, so that was ok. The communal bathroom and toilet (which stank of urine to the point it made my stomach churn) was so dirty I had to buy some bleach and cleaning materials from the local shop and bleach everything before I used it. At least hot water was in plentiful supply. The extractor fan sounded like a pneumatic drill. The light switch was ill-placed and dangerous. I couldn't get to sleep there, and felt ill-prepared for the interview day that followed. I have stayed in hotels cheaper, yet far better than this. Everything about this place was sad, old, worn, decayed, unpleasant and seamy. It is quite clearly run by people who do not care. I half expected a dead body to fall out of the cheap MFI flat-pack wardrobe (from about 1975) that wobbled when I opened it. Just some old musty blankets and a cigarette pack in there.
