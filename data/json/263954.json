This hotel does not respect its own reservations!!!We were scheduled to visit the hotel and we received a confirmation via another hotel who assisted us, however by coming there the Centrum hotel did not want to recognize our reservation and claimed we had actually received an option number not a reservation. The hotel manager himself said he does not have rooms anymore and can\u9225\u6a9b help us. He did not care at all. He is very luck that we had this reservation made by telephone and he used the fact we did not have anything written. Amazing, how some people have no respect and will do anything for an extra Euro.Naturally, we recommend never staying in such hotel since we were dealing with the hotel manager himself\u9225?and always get a written confirmation from any hotel you go to.Happy life to everyone.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR346959298", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Thornordic"}, {"Content": "Nice Hostel for AMS Had no idea where to stay when I got to AMS. Took the train from the airport to Centraal Station. Asked at the local tourist stand where hostels were. Centrum is literally 10mins from Centraal. It's also around the corner from the Red Light. It's walking distance to anything you need in AMS. ANYTHING! Streets all looked the same so at first you get lost. Use the big monument/plaza thing as your base. I felt it was slightly pricey for a hostel at 50 euros a nite, but, all they had left were single rooms. Oh well. They have nice staff and you can come in and out all nite. Downstairs they have a raging club on the weekend, but the rooms are kinda soundproof. Kinda. Overall, nice place. BTW, the sex shows are not all that crazy. Go to the banana bar. 40euros comes with 4 drink coupons. Also, they had no AC but free porn in the room that runs on a loop.

Not at all any room service for 3 nights, TV remote broken, only 1 or 2 dutch TV channels, in the staircase water drops from the ceiling, dirt everywhere (but I didn't see rats). Breakfast very nice, but dont dare to come late, staff was very fast only when removing all breakfast items 2 minutes before 10 am. Ok, they call themselves a one star hotel and the rates are moderate, but much too expensive for what they offer.

Myself and my frind stayed in Room 30 on the top floor. My other 2 friends stayed on the 2nd floor.The rooms were clean from what we know but my god my friends on the 2nd floor got a raw deal! Location wise the place is perfect. However, they couldnt swing a kitten in there room! The 4 of us couldnt literally fit and had to walk sideways arould the double bed cos there was a 1 foot perimeter around the bed and that was the room! There bathroom was about 5x5 feet which included a shower sink and toilet and a little squidgy thing to clean the floor cos the water went everywhere. They had no window for light. The bed was 1 foot off the floor and the double mattress was too big for the bed so they kept sliding off the side of the bed! For th emoney they paid (45 a night each) it was NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY.Our room was more modern and more spacious so if your looking for somewhere very basic within good lcoation then book here but be sure to ask for a room on the top floor only. Oh one last thing the stairs from the 3rd to the 4th floor is litterally vertical and is about 3 feet wide so its a very tight squeeze (I nearly broke my neck with my suitcase!)", "Date": "Oct 4, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR578964398", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Reservation non respect\u8305e   showReview(7390005, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR953781925", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "limemil"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d263954-r6547087-Centrum_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "263954", "Price": "$114"}}
