I stayed there because, due to a trade show in Amsterdam, all the mid-price hotels seemed to be fully booked or to have doubled their prices. The alternatives were numerous places with awful reviews on Tripadvisor (dirty rooms, dodgy plumbing and bad service). So given this I was pleased with my stay here at the Campanile, because the rooms were clean, the plumbing was fine (lots of hot water in a reasonably spacious bathroom) and the service was good. Now, the rooms have a cheap feel and are not large, but there's a decent flat screen TV and there are coffee making facilities. The bed was comfortable. The room was warm (very important, as it was -8\u00c2\u00b0C outside). The rooms are accessed from the outside, motel-style, which might annoy the easily annoyed... Breakfast was good enough (although during my three breakfasts the scrambled egg and bacon trays always seemed to be nearly empty when I arrived....I assume this was just bad luck on my part). As for the location, yes it's a long way out of the centre, and beautiful it is not (but neither is it particularly rough or does it feel particularly dangerous). But it's very close (literally 100 metres) from the Gaasperplas metro stop on the end of the red line, with trains to Centraal Station every 10 minutes (and easy to get to RAI station, where I was working, with one change). I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I had to (because alternatives nearer the centre were fully booked) but in such a scenario I would certainly prefer to stay here than in some noisy, dirty dump in a more touristy area for a similar price.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel\u201d", "Author": "punitworld", "ReviewID": "UR124090014", "Content": "Misled by some good remarks and I booked this Hotel to find that this is a very average Hotel that is very close to public transport.

As I am writing this from the room I can confirm is has no comfort, the radiators are either too hot or cold and this chair is like sitting on a rock. That said is is better than a UK Travelodge, but that is not hard to achieve. This is winter and it gets dark early and the area around the hotel, Gassperplaas, is not safe for a white guy alone after dark, in fact one of the restaurant owners in the Centrum seemed quite concerned for my safety when I told him where I was staying. I think it would be fine in the summer as there is a lake and open space around it, but I simply caught the Metro into the centre each evening and only used the room for sleeping, but also did not come back too late either on advice from locals. The Metro station next door saves this, unless you are using it for a single night whilst travelling I would not recommend it, I have been here for a week and cannot wait to get out of Amsterdam, although I am not impressed with the city either, it seems focussed on sex and drugs and anything tacky related to it.

(a definate option for next time) The Campanile Amsterdam is a no frills hotel, with a very limited menu in the restaurant, not particularly fast service, and a bit of a laid-back atmosphere. I don't think I'm a particularly fussy eater, but there were only two choices I would have gone for on the menu. I plumped for the Lasagne, which was described as \"Bolognese Lasagne\", but I could barely find more than a few crumbs of beef between the soggy slices of pasta. There wasn't much other sauce either, plus it was extremely hot having come straight from the microwave. So I asked for a side-order of chips, which when eventually delivered, my pasta was nearly cold. If you are on a back-packing tour, this place is ideal.

It's on the edge of a gorgeous park, which was a nice peaceful place to walk around and relax a bit. We'd stay there again, especially if we had a car and wanted to stay on the outskirts of Amsterdam and take the metro in. Just make sure to plan to find food elsewhere and don't plan on popping back to the hotel in the afternoon for a break. The Campanile is indeed out in the suburbs of Amsterdam - about 15 to 20 minutes at the end of the Gaasperplas metro line. (You'll need 4 strip tix per person to get in or out.) But we got a rate of 44 Euros per night, which more than made up for spending a bit of time on the metro. We also wanted to spend some time along the coast by Weesp and take a trip to Utrecht, so we were well-positioned for both those. There are busses to Bijlmer Station and to Weesp from right outside the hotel, too. The rooms are small, but we weren't there to sit in a hotel. The room was clean and everything worked just fine. The coffee / tea and biscuit service is a nice touch. It has a set-up like a motel, where all the doors open to the outside, but you do have to go through the lobby to get to the rooms. There are blinds you can lower on your window which make the room very private and pitch-dark, too. One drawback for us was the lack of food in the area. There is a restaurant on the premises, but breakfast is not included in the room price. They wanted 11 Euros for a breakfast buffet, which we didn't want to pay. Unfortunately, there are no bakeries or other options close by. In fact, you can't follow along the streets, but rather the neighborhood has a series of walking paths between the housing developments. We had to go to the Bijlmer Station (where we caught a train to Utrecht) to find a shopping district with grocery stores, restaurants, etc. It didn't look that far on the map, but due to the windy paths and to some construction we probably took 40 minutes to get there. (The bus takes about 10 minutes.) There was a snack truck in the park where we ended up eating a couple nights, and he actually had several decent and cheap choices. Plan to eat in Amsterdam if you're going into town. One more note - I got a cold while in Amsterdam and we decided to cut our visit short by a day. The Campanile had no problem with this and didn't charge us any fees or anything for leaving early.

Our 3rd flr. rooms had shiny, wooden floors, & a large window facing a balcony which overlooked a wonderful nature park behind the hotel. I also liked the double-door,'vestibule' entrance to each hotel room. Fluffy featherbeds were especially nice & cosy & the large picture window of our room had a metal shade which could be lowered for privacy & security. There was an electric teapot, coffee, tea & cookies in our room each day. Upon check-in, when we found ourselves in a smoking room, the manager kindly switched us immediately to a non-smoking room with no problem! Our roooms were tidied each day of our 3-night stay. The hotel cafe was a little 'pricey' & had a limited menu for dinner, but it was fine for coffee & lunch and it even had a lovely outdoor patio seating area. The hotel location is at the end of the metro line at Gaasparplas - I liked being only 20 minutes away from Central Station (downtown Amsterdam). A word of caution, however, if you miss the last metro at 11:30 p.m. you'll have to take the night bus-which can be a very l-o-n-g ride! This wouldn't deter me from staying here again, however, as I found the hotel staff friendly, the hotel clean & the hotel clientele an agreeable assortment of adult leisure travelers, students & international tourists. The hotel lobby is locked after 12 midnight-which made me feel safe & the surrounding park gives one the feeling of the country-side even though you're quite near the city.
