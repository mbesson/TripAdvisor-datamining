Not long before we went,we attempted to find a cheap,basic,no frill hotel outside Manhattan,and were looking mainly in Jersey,Brooklyn,etc. I couldn't believe my eyes when I stumbled across a hotel in the Flatiron district for a mere $119/night. Surely, it was a typo,and certainly not available in late May. I called-it was. I read the reviews-much like others,they consisted of people complaining about the decor,worn carpeting,lack of amenities,dustbunnies-stuff I tend to take in perspective. After all,it was a cheap(by NYC standards) hotel in a great area. So what if it looked gaudy and didn't have turndown service? we were there for New York,after all!! When we arrived,we found the location to be prime(right around the corner from 5th/Broadway/24th). The desk clerk was helpful,allowed us to check in early,and informed us that we had been \"upgraded' to a jacuzzi suite. We were thrilled. As we ascended the staircase, another woman was standing there (a maid?) and encouraged us to ask her if we needed anything. Yes,the lobby was small and plain,and the red chandelier in the hall was a bit tacky,but who cares? It seemed as though the service was top key. We found our room,and sure enough,typical small room with one queen bed. My niece referred to the decor as \"dorm room like,\" with flowered comforter and tiny table,fridge. Oddly enough,the tub was in the room but was a typical tub/shower with jacuzzi jets and a curtain around it. The bathroom was toilet/sink only. We shrugged,figured we could take turns leaving the room when one had to shower,but still manageable. We did discard the idea of using it as a jacuzzi,though,when we looked and found it to be dirty with pubic hair in it. Nevertheless,we asked the maid about it and were assured that it would be cleaned. With that, we got ready and headed out to the city for the day. We didn't return until much later that night(around midnight). At that point we were exhausted,partially inebriated,an pretty much collapsed. As I drifted off, my niece noted that the door didn't have a deadbolt,only a chain lock,but we weren't yet concerned with safety-after all,there was a front desk clerk 24/7. It was during the night that the problems started. I should mention,the other reviews discuss hearing other guests sexual activities. If this were the case,it wouldn't have been an issue-you can hear that kind of stuff at the Hilton if you are in an unlucky spot. (Also,as my niece mentioned,those sounds would have been preferable-at least we would have known that the sounds were from people doing something of consent). No,what we heard was a lot of banging,and noticed that out little door seemed to shake off its hinges everytime someone walked by.it seemed as though someone could force the door open with a finger.We tried to sleep,but the room was baking,and we couldnt find a fan or a/c. Finally,I decided to venture down to the front desk and ask if there was a vending machine to get a drink,and to inquire about a fan. Stupid,stupid,stupid. The guy at the desk was nice enough-didn't notice any porn vieweing,but who cares? He told me to flip a switch next to the tub to turn on the a/c,and gave me two cups of water. I turned to go back upstairs,and then..... A man of questionable character strolled in the front door and headed for the stairs. I didn't think anything at first,but then the desk clerk yelled, \"Hey! You! Who are you and where are you going?\" I froze. The guy looked over his shoulder,said what room he was going to,and continued on. The desk clerk screamed, \"Get back here and stop hiding!\" The guy came back to the lobby. I tried to shrink to the side. Was it safer to stay or run to my room and chance that the guy saw where it was? I debated this as the guy tried to convince the clerk that he was visiting \"a friend\" in room such and such,and that he had been there before. The clerk shook his head. \"No,no. You're up to no good,I can tell. Its 4am,its too late to visit anyone.\" That did it for me. I decided to chance it and ran up the staits,closing the door quietly to the hall that our room was in. As I did,I heard the guy tell the clerk, \"Now I understand what you are saying,but here's the thing---\" And silence. I franctically ran to my room,relayed the story to my niece,and we both were frozen,debating what to do. She pushed a chair to the door in a weak attempt to block us in. the only window to the room was almost at the ceiling-we couldn't escape from that. So we tried to convince ourselves that it was no big deal and go back to sleep. After about 20 minutes,I called the front desk from my cell-luckily the clerk answered,so he was alive,,at least. Then we heard the thuds. Loud,bone chilling crashes against a wall,floor,I dont know. But they were heavy and silent. We didnt dare look at each other or acknowledge them. Instead,we prayed for morning to come and keep us alive. I dont think either of us slept much after that. In summary...yes,this hotel was cheap. But how much is your safety worth?", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cCreepy!
