The cons to this property are as follows: The rooms are small. The 3 of us just barely fit and I would not try to fit a fourth. The Murphy bed is not what the average person is used to. Personally I sleep on a king sized pillow top foam mattress at home. The furnishings are dated. Think Starsky and Hutch or Hawaii Five-O. No pool. No activities to speak of. The neighborhood is a little sketchy. That being said the rooms are OK for two people and they are clean. If you request an egg crate foam mattress topper the bed is quite tolerable. This is not a luxury resort where you would loll around and soak up the ambiance. As far as the neighborhood goes one must remember that Waik\u012bk\u012b is the tourist district of Honolulu, located between the Ala Wai Canal and the Pacific Ocean next to Diamond Head. Numerous hotels, shops, and nightlife opportunities are located along Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues. It is a popular location for visitors and locals alike and attracts millions of visitors every year. The attraction here is Oahu and Waikiki Beach. Like any large city (2011 census estimate over 936,000) you find the homeless, prostitution and crime. You also find this in Small Town USA. Due vigilance is required. Being central to all of the activities is the biggest assest this property has. The second biggest is the staff who embody the true Aloha spirit and bend over backwards to accommodate you. They have beach chairs, umbrellas, coolers and coolers available to rent which was very handy. I would not recommend this property to everyone. For the young party crowd it works extremely well. Even a couple if you truly are there to see Oahu and only sleep in the room. Overall I would give it a 2 \u00bd star rating and that high because of the location and the staff.

I never saw a cockroach & we evaluated for bed bugs and found none. Yes a night club is downstairs, but never heard a thing and we were directly above it. Hookers & homeless...yep saw them on Kuhio Ave. & on the beachwalk by the higher priced hotels. The place was dated but clean and everything worked in the room. No Shampoo/cond. but soap and towels provided daily. Hotel Security was always walking at night and you needed a seperate key for the outside door and your room. Yes it was the old style keys, but it is an old hotel. Beach towels available at the front desk but you had to keep them for the week. Washer & dryer available but always in use. Boogie Boards free to use at the front desk. Snorkel rental around the corner. Every place you want to eat right near your room. We saved a ton of money staying here and basically only slept in our room. We went to the North Shore and spend $300 on a room at Turtle Bay Resort which was really nice with an oceanview.....However, we felt like we needed to hang out in our room or at least at the hotel to get our moneys worth.

This place is not nice and we did find cockroaches in the room but no bed bugs as other reviews have mentioned....and we searched thoroughly. The carpet was old and very dirty as were the furnishings. The paint near light switches and doors was discolored from dirt and grime. Housekeeping only comes on Tuesday and they count and re-count every single towel and washcloth with stern warnings that you will pay dearly if one disappears. The nightclub/strip club on the ground floor is so loud some nights that the ineffective air conditioner is not even loud enough to drown out the noise. We did not even stay for the entire time we had the place reserved. We were out of there before sunrise and did not return until after dark. Waikiki beach was within about 4 blocks so it was easy to get to although crowded as usual. Not much good to say about the Kuhio Banyan. Several other guests that are affiliated with RCI told us that this place was hands down the worst RCI property they have been to....by a long shot. Other properties are within about 15 feet of his building and contain a multitude of interesting folks, long term renters I think. Each morning we were greeted by 10 or 20 minutes of coughing and hacking from one of the nearby chain smokers who had to clear a substantial amount of gunk from his lungs. The bus route is directly in front of the building and busy 24 hours a day making for lots of noise. Parking is awful if you rent a car and very expensive.

We did enjoy the close proximity of restaurants, shopping, beaches, things to do, and bus routes to our room.

I am a little surprised that RCI even lists this property. First let me tell you the bad, but please keep reading till the end. This property is old and is in desperate need of an update. I mean desperate!! The carpet needs replacing and the rooms need to be gutted and redone. at one end is a nightclub, it is close to a busy street and yes at night there are \"ladies of the evening trying to make some money out on the street. These rooms should only be listed as max 2 not 4.There are no views of anything pretty. The tv is small, there is no oven and it has a mini-fridge.

You are across the street from the international market, There is a Chilis, drugstore, gracery store, Starbucks, Dennys, Subway, ATM,ABC store and more restraunts all within two blocks.

My wife didn't like her pillow, we called the front desk and within 5 min they brought a new one up. They have a security guard at night and you need a key to get in the bldg at all times. I have never felt unsafe here. Hint; when making a reservation ALWAYS request 3rd or 4th floor and as far away from the nightclub as possible. We did and had no problem, we were on the third floor.

I had decided to go ahead and give the place a try. When my party and I, 3 total, first checked in, we were warmly greeted. They gave us two sets of keys, a tv remote, and a card key for the room safe. I was a little surprised to see each set of keys had two keys attached to the ring. I was told one was for the room, and the other was for the main door after it was locked at night. That's right; there is no 24/7 service here. Staff is there from 7am to 10pm each day. If you're out past 10pm, you need a key to get back into the place. Don't have it? You're probably going to have to call someone from staff to drive all the way out to this place and let you back in, which can be up to a 2 hour wait and a $45 charge. I made sure to have my key on my person at all times so I wouldn't end up in this predicament. The single elevator here is the smallest I've ever seen. It didn't smell when I got on it, but the carpet certainly looked old. Me and my group were squeezed tightly into the small space of the elevator as we made our way up to our room, which was on the top-most floor. Now the balcony leading to the room, there was a neighboring building right in front of us which looked like a residential building. I couldn't tell exactly if this really was Section 8 housing as another reviewer brought up. The entire time I was here, I didn't really see any residents out. However, there were two nights I heard a young woman arguing on a phone about some troubled relationship of hers. It sounded like it was coming straight from this residential building. This was around 4am in the morning. But this is nothing. There are a couple of bars nearby the Banyan, blaring music early in the night with people loudly talking and laughing up a storm. The first few nights I stayed here, I had trouble sleeping, but got quickly adjusted to it and it didn't bother me. Moving on to the room, when I first entered it, it was clean. The furniture and carpet seriously are old and worn, though. They're simply begging to be replaced. The bathroom was nice save for the grungy shower tiles. They looked as though they haven't been cleaned in a decade. I didn't dare step barefoot onto them but rather wore an old pair of sandals while showering. I did stumble upon a baby cockroach one evening in the bathroom. It scared the life out of me before shooting into a crack in the wall. Luckily, I had some boric acid on hand. I sprinkled a little around the cracks and didn't see another cockroach (I also made sure to keep the entire unit tidy as possibile). The entire place is a small step up from a Motel 6, but only by a hair. It was still comfy, so I tried not to make a fuss much. I didn't stay here too much, only as a place to sleep in mostly. The two things I liked about this place were the staff and most importantly, the location. The staff were very helpful in any questions I had, including different destinations and the different routes aboard the Bus. For location, many shops are so close by, as well as numerous restaurants. The beach is a short walk away, too. Although the Kuhio Banyan wasn't too far from many local attractions and the unit had a few extras such as a stove-top burner (pretty basic; see photos to get an idea what they look like), I'd be hesitant to recommend this place to others. To be honest, I'm drawn down the line as to whether I'd tell people to look elsewhere or to give this place a shot. The few perks of this place had won me over somewhat, but then again, the cons, such as that roach, the loud night noise, and let me not forget to mention that one bum constantly wandering in front of the Banyan, have me disliking this place. What I will recommend to travelers out there is to definitely do your homework and look for a good deal on a nice hotel. If by the chance you're not able to come across anything you like, only then would I recommend the Kuhio Banyan as a fair location to try.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cdon't go there\u201d", "Author": "allan11209", "ReviewID": "UR114422640", "Content": "The hotel is actually a old motel 6.

The floors were clean, the counters were clean, the refrigerator worked, the bathroom was clean. It isn't the Ritz. In fact, our home resort is beachfront on another island. But, if one is intent on staying in Waikiki, they could do a lot worse (we have in the past). The only drawback we could find was the necessity of keeping the air conditioner on 24/7, as there is no ventilation. Again, one is downtown so open windows aren't quite as nice as they are on a beach. The Kuhio Banyan is a couple of notches above Motel 6, without the pool. And, even most of the hotels in Waikiki depend on A/C, and dicourage open lanai doors. That said, TheBus is absolutely fantastic. $2.50 per adult one way anywhere a tourist would like to go and all of the routes from Waikiki stop directly in front. The 2 Bus travels to many of the most desireable locations and runs every 10-15 minutes (no way to really keep a schedule in that traffic). With public transportation like this, there is no need for a rental car unless you just have to have one - and parking is horrible. Spend $5 at the ABC store and get TheBus Map and Guide Book.

The location is in a spot where at 10:30 or before the street is full of \"very different people\" if you know what I mean. Take your money if you have to pay and get a room in a different location. There are lots of good deals in the area. Save your points if you are using world mark points and use them somewhere else. This hotel is disgusting and for World Mark and RCI using this location does not do anything good for the creditbility.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay in this hotel\u201d", "Author": "SiriusSam", "ReviewID": "UR94875644", "Content": "Unfortunately we took an RCI Cruise and Stay package.

Tapes?? Does anyone own a tape.?? The beds were like sleeping on a wooden slab with a grass mat. The place smelled badly. It was dirty. The carpeting must have been the original piece of carpeting invented and \"still in place.\" No shampoo and conditioner. To get to your room you had to go by an apartment building that had balconies with people sleeping on them. There is a strip club right outside the door with scantily clad girls trying to lure people in. Not a family friendly location. If you want an extra towel, it is $2.50. Don'tgo there if you expect any kind of amenities. If RCI sticks you there demand to be moved. We arrived on Sat. afternoon and they moved us on Mon. morning to a very nice place.

If your looking for an upscale luxurious hotel then yea you will be disappointed.

Out front is a court yard area, a night club, nail Salon and a Subway, on the corner of the block is an amazing Philly Cheesesteak Place with good food for decent prices. The staff were helpful and very friendly and the rental of the beach chairs, boogie boards etc was awesome to have.

Location of this hotel can't be beat for the price, though if you really think of all the fees you pay for maintenance fee on your own resorts, this is not a cheap stay. It is upsetting.......to say the least We looked at the reviews, but nothing compared to the shock when we walked in. I was in the military and backed packed quite a bit, but my daughter, you could see the disappointment in her eyes. What saved me the next day was the location. You are right on Waikiki, and I had the GO Oahu card, had arranged all the tours, therefore we only came in to sleep. Not the most comfortable sleep, a Murphy bed, with a TV that you can't watch once you open the bed, but we were so tired from our day out that it really did not matter. I only recommend this \"resort\" Ha ha ha......if you are on a budget. Staying here allowed us to do other things. Oahu is expensive, if you are traveling with kids, bring cereal to get you started on your day. A box of cheerios or Honey clusters is $7.00 milk $9.00 gallon........ peanut butter 3.00 for an 8oz as well as jelly same price. International Market across the street, thursdays is farmers market, lots of reasonable priced fruit, after paying 3.80 for two apples, 99cents for a banana. The staff was friendly, that and the location made up for the terrible accommodations. They should at least splurge on replacing the mattress and replacing the covers on the small couches. The bathrooms also need a lot of help. I had second thoughts about sitting on the couch. Ok for two people, but 4 would be impossible....... The 19 takes you from and to the airport, no need to pay for a shuttle unless you have lots of luggage. Roberts Hawaii dominates the sightseeing market and they are the most reasonable for airport shuttle, I think 15 or 16 bucks round trip. 19 bus $2.25 stops right in-front of the \"resort\" ha ha ha. No need to rent a car. The Bus and the trolly's take you everywhere. I would recommend this only if you are on a budget. Hawaii is over rated...... Oh! you have to pay, an additonal $70 something for the use of beach towels, chairs, and hotel tax. You have to \"sign out the blow dryer, iron, ironing board. No shampoo, and cheap soap so take your own. Sun screen is not expensive is the same price and you don't take the chance of the airport personnel keeping your sun screen...... Subway in the complex, as well as a Japanese take our fast food, pretty good and reasonable. Also they have a restaurant similar to Benihana's that was good and reasonable.

I called the front desk the first morning I was there and the foam was added to my bed and remade before I got back from the activities briefing --very responsive. The rooms are small --OK for two people --but would be crowded for more even though the couch and loveseat turn into twin beds. The closet is in the bathroom. The rooms were clean and the location is great with the bus stops just outside.

(THE BUS only takes what luggage you could carry on to a plane.)
