Hotel is very close to the historic center - it takes 10-30 minutes by feet to get to any central sightseengs (Forums or Basilica Sancti Petri), or 5 minutes and 8-12 euro by taxi. Very close to Villa Borghese. We appriciated very much the friendship of the hotel stuff. Also pay attention to very good rooms soundproofing. Breakfasts are rich, but quite expencive (33 euro) and it gets really crowdy sometimes in the dining room, so you can spend 10 minutes waiting for a fork or coffee.

Thinking that it may be a good idea to write directly to the hotel reservation to find out if any special rates could be offered, I set out the details of my family group (2 adults + 2 kids), the periods of our intended stay in Rome (for 2 different stays with a break in between), and the types of rooms we were interested in. The reservation responded rather promptly on the next day but the 'best rates' quoted were significantly higher than what I could get online by myself. For a 700 sq.ft Corner Suite, they quoted EUR 880 instead of their published online rate of EUR 720, or two interconnecting Deluxe Rooms for EUR 380 per room instead of the online rate of EUR 360 per room. I then wrote again to enquire about the discrepancies. They then came back in no time with a 'screen shot' maintaining that their quoted rate of EUR 380 for the Deluxe Rooms was correct, and further explained that their website had certain problems which failed to reveal the 3rd and 4th bed supplement charges for the Corner Suite (a total of EUR160 per night for two kids sleeping at the sitting area!). However, when I checked the online rate on the hotel's official website again, it still showed the rate of EUR 360 per room for the interconnecting Deluxe Rooms. I therefore captured my own 'screen shot' and sent it back to the reservation right away. I find this most disappointing because: (1) No customer will expect the rates published on a hotel's official website would be incorrect or not up to date. (2) No apology was offered for the wrong information published on the hotel website when they first responded (though they did apologize later when I showed them my own 'screen shot'). (3) No apology was offered for mistakenly quoting a wrong duration of my intended stay (though I had underlined the period of my stay and stating the number of nights). (4) Exploding a 'screen shot' in a reply email to a guest to justify a rate which was plainly wrong (or confusing to say the least) is simply unheard of. (5) If I were the hotel management, I would certainly have replied in a more apologetic manner and would have expressed my gratitude to the customer for pointing out such 'technical' problems on the hotel website. I must say that this experience falls far short of what I had expected as a result of my previous stays at Jumeirah hotels, a hotel group which has taken a great pride in opening and operating beyond 5-star hotels around the world.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cGrand hotel via veneto\u201d", "Author": "lucasstein", "ReviewID": "UR125495396", "Content": "We stayed last month for a long weekend!

They made us feel like we were traveling some different country (hope no offense taken). I mean no European attitude , just pure professionalism and kindness. Our room was cozy and done in beautiful colors. The bathroom was a nice size and had everything we needed including Bvlgari goodies I loved so much. The only one thing tho...The marble top of the bath was originally installed at the wrong angle, I think. So every time I had a shower large amount of water ended up under the bath window. But at the end of the day it wasn't a big deal for me, because we had a two time a day housekeeping. Our breakfast was included and had a nice variety from fruits to meats. It was a buffet style and they offered a prosecco at the time we traveled. There was a fresh coffee, tea and water available at the lobby for 24/7 and free of charge. Also we tried \"Time\"cafe and \"Magnolia\"restaurant. ''Time'' was always perfect for lunch or late bites and drinks. And \"Magnolia'' was an outstanding choice for our last dinner in Rome.

We had a room with an outdoor terrace that looked up the side street to the Via Veneto. One day my cousin from Grosseto (a nearby town) stopped in to visit us but we were out for the day. The staff welcomed hm and made sure we received the handwritten note that he left for us. Breakfast, which was included in our stay, was delicious. The staff - top notch! We enjoyed cappuccino and espresso each morning along with a variety of hot entrees (my husband loved the Eggs Benedict) all served in their beautiful Magnolia Dining Room. We were able to unwind each day in their beautiful SPA and relaxation room. The staff there always pampered us with hot teas, cool drinks and fresh fruit. The sauna and the steam room coupled with the salt water pool spa were a vigorous way to end a day of sightseeing and shopping! There were great restaurants within walking distance - be sure to try the fried stuffed olives and the hand cut prosciutto di parma. Walking to the Spanish Steps provided breathtaking views and fabulous shopping. The bar in the restaurant provided outstanding wine selections. We also enjoyed drinks in the evening right outside - sharing an apertif with visiting family one night...and just the two of us on other evenings....truly experiencing the Via Veneto and la dolce vita. Kudos to this fine establishment. We made sure when we walked to the Trevi Fountain (three different times during our stay) we threw our coins in so we can guarantee our return to Rome and to the GH Via Veneto. We are already planning our next trip! Thank you to the entire staff......you made our stay a most memorable one. Most sincerely, Theresa and George Licitra.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel & Location\u201d", "Author": "rayoflightcanada", "ReviewID": "UR116134181", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 1 night on my way back from Ravello, I found it great hotel and location, I walked in one night to Spanish steps, trevi fountain and piazza Della republica.

The rate which is not \"cheap\" is however interesting for the locaton and type of hotel, expecially if compared with the neightboring hotels, however i believe this is a kind of promotional rate so do not know until when it will last.

The hotel itself is very nice and beautiful, the staff is very polite and helpful indeed. But I have to say that even though when we booked a room we left a comment that we're spending our honeymoon in this hotel on arrival none of the staff congratulated us with marrige. We were not actually hunting for some benifits but some congratulation or some special welcome in the room would have been nice and it was some attitude one expects to get in a 5 star Lux hotel. And they also wrote a wrong name on all the cards and bills and on TV welcome. They didn't just spell it wrong but it was totally someone else's name, not mine with the correct surname written next to it. This was sort of an unpleasant discovery and I don't understand how could the well trained stuff write a very hard to spell russian surname correctly and put someone else's name that didn't even look like mine next to it. The location is perect I have to say because you're practicly in the heart of Rome and everything you need to see is in walking distance from the hotel. At the same time it's not noicy in there at all, the windows of our room faced the inner yard which was quiete and beautiful and you could easely leave your windows opened for the night to get some fresh air. The hotel has a beautiful terrace on the top floor but we didn't have time to use it as we didn't stay long. The breakfast room was very nice as well but as for breakfast itself we definitely missed some hot dishes like eggs for example and the buffet didn't have much variety of foods and they served same things every day. It didn't bother us that much as we were only staying for 3 days but if we were to stay longer it surely could have been an issue. Another thing we had a problem with was our bathroom. The bathtub had a glass door which was supposed to protect the floor from splashes but it was practicly useless because it was leacking. So taking a shower always caused a huge puddle of water on the floor which was the least to say unsafe and unpleasant. We were not very happy about the cleaning in our bathroom too. The wall, opposite to the mirror was stained with something greasy or oily right from the day we arrived and the maid didn't bother to clean this in the 3 days we stayed. And I don't beleive she didn't notice that stain, I mean honestly it was impossible to miss something like this. Last but not least you have to be aware of their sistem of paiment. They freeze money on your account the day you arrive no matter which way of payment you choose in the end cash or another card it doesn't matter. They freeze the total cost of nights you'll be staying and as I was told, if you choose to pay in cash or with another card the money from the card they preauthorized will be returned that same day. But in reality I had to wait for 1,5 months for my money to be returned. Overall I'd say it's a good hotel in a good location it has it's flaws and overpriced rooms are one of it. But if you're looking for a good hotel in the centre of Rome and if you manage to get the rooms with a discount, like we did, it's a good place to consider.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201c5 Star all the way\u201d", "Author": "Irfster", "ReviewID": "UR115385646", "Content": "This was our first trip to Rome and the hotel was the perfect choice.

The building, which I think was at at some point a Villa, is beautiful and rooms are large, immaculately maintained and the service is outstanding. Check-in is at a desk, not a counter, and before I had a chance to turn around my bags were already in my room. Everyone was genuinely friendly. I never heard loud banging doors or employees talking in the hallway. Breakfast was a nice buffet and room service food was good, although might be a little better for an upscale place. If there are negatives it would be a very, very hard mattress, which worked for my bad back but might be a problem for others. The hotel's decor is also unapologetically Art Deco, which makes the rooms less than modern looking, but interesting. The bathroom is wonderful, but it lacks a television which I guess some would think would make it a 5 star, and there were no in-room city-magazines or maps to browse through. The hotel is at the top of the Via Veneto, which is either a plus or minus. I liked being close to the Villa Borghese -- the Central Park of Rome -- but it is away from most of the big-ticket ruins like the Forum. It is about a 20 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. On the other hand, I found it nicer to return to the quiet and safe area of the Villa Borghese after a day of tourist-central. The metro is about a 10 minute walk away.

We were originally going to stay in the Rome Sofitel hotel. Upon check in our room was at least 85 degrees. We decided to take a walk around the area while they tried to fix our air conditioning. One block up the street was The Grand Hotel Via Veneto. We walked into the lobby and fell in love. Newly opened only three weeks prior, we walked into the most elegantly done Art Deco inspired lobby. Gleaming marble floors, beautiful furniture and understated floral arrangements-all perfectly complimenting each other. We asked to speak to the manager to see if there were rooms available....and the answer was \"yes\". When we asked if we could see a room, the manager was gracious and welcoming and took us up to a \"standard\" room himself. It was exactly the type of hotel we imagined when we originally booked our vacation. Clean modern lines, beautiful views and an amazingly beautiful bathroom. And the airconditioning could bring the room temperature down as low as we could possibly want. For the remaining week, the staff had the perfect recommendations for dinners, tours and sight seeing. Lastly, the location was exactly where we imagine everyone would want to stay........on the top of the Via Veneto, within walking distance of many of the sights of Rome and within easy distance of public and private transportation. A traditional Roman breakfast is included with your room. An admittedly expensive stay in Rome but well worth is if you want the most perfectly perfect hotel.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san Francisco", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait for opening\u201d", "Author": "Mandy_SF", "ReviewID": "UR7614747", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my trip to Italy, 3 days Rome, Florence, Amalfi coast for July and unfortunately I received some days ago a message from the hotel that it will not be open on time. Of course, it was a big surprise for us as everything is booked already, from the tickets to the private guide but I want to express my personal opinion in how this situation was treated by the hotel. They provided excellent customer service, offering an alternate hotel and booking for us all additional services like transfer, private guide, 2 restaurants. I would have prefered to stay at the 155 but at the same time they took very good care of my reservation and all my requests what is showing how professional they work. As soon as the hotel will open, it will be the first hotel on my list to try hoping to find the same persons who were taking care of my reservation now.
