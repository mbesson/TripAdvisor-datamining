It is only 10 mins by Taxi from Dubai Airport. We were served with fresh juice in reception (felt good) and checked in room by 11:00 PM local time, there was no drinking water in room. So, we called room service twice and again in reception for a bottle of water but it didn't arrived even after an hour. I was enraged and went down by lift to ask for water, then they handed me 1.5 liter bottle and charged 12 dhs (Seven times more than local supermarket price of 1.75 dhs). We paid around US $100 per night but even didn't get a bottle of free water that costs less than 50 cents... it was really disgusting! Room was good but bathroom fittings were not in condition.

New carpet and bath...but for the price and location I shouldn't complain.

We were 3 adults and 2 kids booked in two rooms. We tried but could not get adjacent rooms. The rooms where spacious, clean and nice. As the hotel was situated near the metro station , getting train was easy. The hotel being on main road helped in getting taxi easily. Just 100 mtrs walk takes to nice eating joins like McD and Pizza Hut. A Shopping mall is also situated very near to the hotel \u2026 and yes .. TAJ Hotel was opposite to our hotel of stay. Over all the location as great to be in. Though the Staff was just OK. Food was a disappointment. Not much option for Veg. One more good thing was that LAL\u2019s super market was bang opposite and open till late in the night (may even be 24 hous, not sure.) a small swimming pool on the Top with nice view of this part of the city. Do.'s Buy water on the way to hotel or from supermarket opposite Buy Metro ticket which are valid for 6 months. Good use as metro is well connected. Dubai starts late and ends late .. so plan accordingly. Friday is like a Holiday... Desert safari IS A MUST.

Taxis to the Deira Souks, Jumeira public beach and the Burj Dubai should not cost more than 20 dirhams (about 4 euros). Make sure you get a room high up away from the discos on the ground and 1st floors. We were on the seventh floor and heard only a mild beat - no problem. There is a lovely shisha cafe on the roof and an inviting swimming pool. The breakfast buffet was ample with all the Arab specialities, plus some Western titbits like beef bacon, French toast and baked beans.

They brought it a full size mattress to put on the floor for my 14 year old son. The living room was plenty big enough for both. There were 2 tvs which is always good with teens. The washer was broken so they did the wash for us. There is a grocery within a 10 min walk. They have a tour desk but we found the prices were slightly better through another company. We booked the desert safari because it was recommended by another traveler on Trip Advisor. It was ok but there was a lot of down time. We left at 3:30 & were at the site by 5 (after sand drifting & driving out there).
