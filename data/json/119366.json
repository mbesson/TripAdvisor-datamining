We are presently staying at the one on Yorkshire, ground level, and most of the reviews I read turned out to be true. We have had no issues with the management; they have addressed our issues (basically no internet service most of the time). We will have been here 11 days. Leaving tomorrow. I could not get another hotel around w/a kitchenette b/c I waited too long to book, that's why we ended up here. Yes, it is a 'Section 8' type of place. I would also recommend (I had forgotten about this review) a 2nd or 3rd floor apartment. The microwaves are brand new; everything worked for us (except internet, again). They (mgmt.) told us not to pay for it b/c it is down so much. There is an 'initial' shock.....my stepson, who lives in Phoenix, came to pick us up and said, \"man, dad, even I wouldn't stay here .... I locked my doors as soon as I pulled in\". That kinda says it all. Furniture is old, old, old and the bed is just disgusting. We wanted to park my stepsons truck in the parking area with the roof over it and mgmt. told us yesterday to make sure we park forward....do not back in ..... the police who come thru at night need to be able to see your license plates to run a criminal check. Again, that says it all. Pool is nice. I do believe drug dealers are there, but we kept to our own business and weren't in the room much. Take everything of value with you! The bathroom was okay; the tub needed a good scrubbing. Also, we requested a non-smoking room (there is even a sticker on the window that says non-smoking) and the room wreaked of stale cigarette smoke. Pulled out the nightstand drawer and someone had used it as an ashtray.....cigarette butts and ashes in it. My husband would not even let me walk out to the truck w/o him being able to see me. Please don't stay here if you have kids ..... there's an Extended StayAmerica in Peoria on W. Bell Road that is MUCH better, inside doors vs. doors that exit directly to the outside, for the exact same price! That is where we will stay next year!", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGoing cheap is not always a good thing\u201d", "Author": "60wildbill", "ReviewID": "UR123175619", "Content": "I am currently staying at the budget suite and this place sucks, the furniture is old and worn out the bed is as hard as a rock the carpet is in bad shape I need to move the cable back and forth to get good reception on the TV.

I planned on staying awhile so I rented the 1 bedroom/livingroom/kitchen on ground level. When I moved in the room came with internet, TV & microwave. When leaving in June 2010 I was paying for the internet,TV,&microwave on top of the weekly rent. I had 2 loads of brand new rugs taken from the laundry, 1 load of towels, and 1 load of my good clothes taken. I work on the internet selling things for ebay and Bonanzle but had 3 days of internet not working so I couldnt get online to work, In those 3 days I lost money because I couldnt get online and fell behind on my rent. They treated me as if I was there for the weekend and check out time is 11am. On the last day that i was there I went to get the money for the rent and was getting ready to go to office and someone who I had never seen before POUNDED ON MY DOOR, DEMANDING WHEN I WAS COMING TO OFFICE. Right then i deceided that i wanted out. I was not going to be disrespected. The office people have NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND DO NOT APPRECIATE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE. I repeatedly was disrespected, and charged different rates of weekly rent all the time. NO I would not recommend this place if you plan on being somewhere for a long stay. AND I WILL NOT RECCOMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE WHO I KNOW. All the girls in the office including the woman they just brought in for a manager all need customer service skills, and learn how to treat people.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay right in Central Phoenix!\u201d", "Author": "iluvphoenix", "ReviewID": "UR49764282", "Content": "I stayed at Budget Suites for two months and I was very pleased!

The location could not be any more ideal! There is a \"Fresh and Easy\" market right next door and the bus stop is right outside.

The hotel is close to some IT companies which was one of the reason apart from price for choosing this hotel. I booked this hotel by calling and confirming the booking. Key was given to me when I arrived and an attendant joined me to show show room and explain facilities. I was offered a choice for floor as multiple rooms were available. For me in the room kitchen was also provided where I can cook some food for myself. Kitchen had a 4 burner electric stove, Heater, fridge, microwave oven. Kitchen vessels were not there but I was fortunate that I had some with me. Room had a writing table, dining table, king sized bed and appropriate lighning. Room also had a TV with approximately 70 cable channes. Air conditioning was maintained by AC and heater which I used to adjus tas per climate conditions. Surroundings were pretty silent with out much noise. There's free internet access at reception. Four computers are kept so that you can access internet. If ypu have personal computer / laptop you can get wireless internet for free over here and speed was pretty good. Hotel is close to some shopping malls e.g. target, 7/11 and AMC theater, John C Lincolin hospital and some other shops like AT&T, Radio Shack etc. I didn't liked two things about the hotel. 1. Hotel charges ... although its cheap but they tell you different rate on phone which is basic rate and when you arrive they charge you extra for small small things seperately like bed linen, microwave oven etc. So my advice is check everything and get it clarified for this oven phone for your needs and exact room rate with these facilities. 2. Some what problem with room lightning. Although it was good but not so much impressive. There a chance they could have improved over here. Overall the staff was friendly and co-operative. Surrounding are free of noise and they are fairly safe as well.
