I would say the only downside to this hotel is the noise. It is right on the beach/main road into the little town and there are constantly pedestrians, bums, cars, tourists, etc. biking and walking along the beach/road. We didn't really mind the noise but then again we were there to party & relax so we weren't too picky. I would stay here again in an instant if I came back to Ocean Beach. In fact, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. As far as the surrounding community, it's mostly smoke shops, surf shops and bars. Go to the sushi place that is adjacent to the hotel. I don't remember the name but it's amazing.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201coverpriced but they allow dogs, people partying outside your window, in airport flight path\u201d", "Author": "Sparrowxoxo", "ReviewID": "UR114967871", "Content": "Ya know, honestly we had a good time but the place was definitely too expensive for what it is and you will not get much sleep. We don't mind being in a loud place with people having a good time and playing guitar outside our window so we enjoyed ourselves. If you want quiet this is not the place for you, nor is whole part of town. People are loud and rowdy in this neighborhood. We liked the lively atmosphere BUT I witnessed a shady drug deal and we saw a guy get arrested right outside of our room (separate incidents). It's an area where there are bikers and skaters and surfers (fun!) mixed with homeless junkies (not so fun). If you are a surfer you will love the waves here. The hotel itself was okay. We were traveling with our two dogs so our options for hotels were limited. The staff was very nice and the courtyard was pretty cute. However the room was super basic and bare and the towels are made of sandpaper. The pictures on their website make it seem like a much nicer place than it actually is. We got a room with a patio and it was $195 which, it was not a nice enough place to justify that rate. You can hear everything through the walls. It sounded like the people upstairs were moving furniture all night. And at about 6 am we discovered that we were in the airport flight path and I was woken by low-flying jets sounding like they might just land inside my room. So I really couldn't sleep past 6 in the morning. Another reason why we chose to stay in Ocean Beach was for the Dog Beach. The dog beach is actually a very very long walk from the hotel. But the dog beach (when we finally got there) was great and huge. There was a disturbing sign posted saying \"Warning! Run-off\" which we really didn't quite figure out what that meant. But no one else seemed disturbed by it (and I guess we are sheep so we just did what everyone else was doing and ignored it.) BUT the dogs had an excellent time! We would go back to Ocean Beach but we would stay in a quieter and nicer area and we wouldn't stay at the Ocean Beach Hotel again.

We stayed in the single Condo next to the hotel, and I tell you, there is nothing better that having your morning coffee and watching the surfers from your very own balcony, it was sweet!

After making the reservation, I asked for a confirmation a couple of times but never received it, and forgot to continue following up (bad mistake #1). On arrival we were told that they didn't have us reserved until the next night. Also, without a confirmation, the rate was now $220, quite a bit more than promised. We had just driven over from Phoenix with our dogs and thought it would be hard to find a dog-friendly hotel last minute, so we checked in (bad mistake #2) without first looking at the room (bad mistake #3). (Also, we fortunately discovered that most hotel chains are dog friendly these days.). At the promised price of $150, we would have tolerated the disgusting room conditions to take advantage of the Ocean Beach charm. At $220, this was robbery pure and simple. The supposed recent 2 million dollar renovation didn't include this room. You might ask what was wrong? 1) Paint peeling off the walls in several places. 2) drawer handles missing from the furniture. I guess handles weren't really necessary since the drawers were cracked and didn't really close anyway. 3) I put on white ankle socks which were filthy in 10 seconds. I realize that it's hard to keep things clean at the beach, but that was just gross. 4) Baseboards cracked and didn't come together with the door jambs. I guess the dirt was keeping them apart. 5) The \"patio\" had a table and four chairs, one dead plant, empty planters, weeds, and a chunk of concrete missing from the wall. 6) Missing faceplates and exposed wires on electrical outlet. We checked in and tried to get on online to find another place, but couldn't connect to the free wi-fi. After about an hour, we told the front desk clerk (in person because the phone did not work) that we preferred not to stay, and were told that they would be keeping the money for the night ($245 after taxes). No curiosity about why we were dissatisfied. We checked out the next morning (2 days early), and the same person who checked us in did not even asked why we were leaving. When looking on Trip Advisor when we returned, there was a positive review from some other people who just walked in off the street without a reservation less than a week before and paid only $130, a much better price.

First my trip setup: Was on a San Diego sightseeing trip with my wife and 2.5 year old. Planned to see the San Diego Zoo mostly. Arrived by car from Orange County, CA. Length of trip in San Diego planned 2 nights 3 days, actual 3 nights and 4 days (The Ocean Beach was the add-on night). Stayed for 2 nights at a Comfort Inn near hotel circle (the one next to a steakhouse). Room was nice, but called a queen size bed a King, free breakfast, free internet; ask for coupon deals for local sights. So we did the Zoo thing despite the rainy weather for that 16/17th Feb. Was paying 80.00 per night for a room/TV/fridge/no micro/view-hillside and train route. This being the scenario, I was ready to make the family happier. I searched for hotels by the ocean as I got word I could extend my trip and came across the Ocean Beach Hotel. The attraction was, close proximity to the ocean, and nearby Pier to walk out on. The posted pictures of the hotel were hard to visualize, and seemed out of date after the fact (good thing). Seemed like they might have had a recent renovation to Room 301, which was the one we stayed in, \"By the way is the best suite in the house\". For the Splurge traveler or ocean lover it's a nice spot. I did not view any of the other rooms so cannot comment on that. Room 301 is the closest to the pier and ocean, with balcony on the Newport ave. side(not so appealing), but (2) double French doors facing the Ocean(no balconies)(To be able to hear the ocean before sleeping, and waking in the morning was worth the low season rate of 200.00/350.00 high season). Keep in mind this is a beach community and not a Major hotel, as you will climb 3 flights of open-air stairs to get to your room. Room amenities were complete and other reviews were pretty accurate, but maybe did not apply to this room (this is the best room in the house). Toilet paper was as reviewed by another reviewer, but his solution was good by using a local store up the south side of Newport Ave. I have a feeling the garden view and partial ocean view rooms were not as clean or updated possibly. Air conditioner was a portable unit and no cooling was necessary. Small table with 2 chairs, a couch (could serve as a bed although not a sofa sleeper); armoire with TV / remote no pay per view etc., another table for 3 near foot of bed (perfect for relaxing/wine/sunset/internet research/etc.). Portable, faux fireplace electric heater (seemed out of place but functional, and impromptu romance prop with imagination)(came in very handy), King size bed comfy enough. The garden patio area is nicer than the photos, the archways at the ocean end are covered with Plexiglas to prevent intrusions and has a room-key access door to the beach very handy oh yes and the shower so you can rinse off before going to your room or relaxing in the patio. Handy as the beach showers are a fair distance away to rinse off. Nice not to be nicked for parking like most other places. Did not look for ice machine or soda etc. but did see a laundry area which would be nice for the extend stay. If I could afford it, I would stay in that room for every San Diego trip especially during the summer. I would say try it for a night during low season to see how you like it if finances is a factor. There could be other equals or better but I didn\u2019t have the time as this was on the fly...I just wanted to relax, hear the ocean and take the family on the pier for the sunset which we did. Note: 2 things re: the pier: There seems to be a small element of hippy type or housing challenged that were in the vicinity of the stairs to get to the pier level but appeared not to be a problem. Across the hotel/Inn/motel from Newport Ave is a public parking for the pier/beach with a police building in it (hours of operating is unknown). The other thing is if you have a young child walking out to the end you might want to have a stroller of some sort to pull rather than carry them back...your shoulders or back will thank you. There is also a nice spot ON the pier for drive in/diner food-unknown quality...They also rent fishing tackle by hours or the day kind of nice for the closet fisherman. Again I would've tried this but we had other things to do...If you're very flexible with your travelling plan on being there for a Wednesday afternoon/evening as they have a farmer's market type of street fair which closes off a portion of Newport Ave. Very walking distance for a 2.5 year old...there was even an inflatable jumper thingy for free that gave us a break. Ample restaurants and bars to keep a variety of ages entertained. We ate at a Mexican restaurant on the north side (forgot name), but had gotten very full eating and sampling foods along the street. It did provide for breakfast the next morning, which worked out very well with the micro and frig. I urged my wife to take our son for a walk along the beach (about .7? mile each way to the far breakwater) I needed to plan the day\u2019s activities so unfortunately I did not make the morning walk (this was a Thursday morning and no weekend crowds if there are any?). Cleanliness gave it a 4 since I always wear flip-flops in any room I book, but that room did appear clean. Service I gave it a 2 since I did not use any besides checking in and checking out, nor did I use the maid service. I did make my reservations over the phone (as I knew I wanted to book this special room not available over the net booking) and did not have any problems. Rooms was a 4 since I was unable to rate other rooms. Location a 5 for the beach across the street / above average pier even compared to Newport and Huntington beach / short walk to bars, restaurants, convenience store for supplies, and Wednesday street event / And last but not least is the sound of the soothing ocean sounds!...relaxing and priceless! If you expect your full money value to be in the room alone you might be a little disappointed, but overall value is there. Would have liked to's: Walk to the end of the southern part of beach to see tide pools at low tide. Fished of the pier. Eaten and had drinks at the pier diner (no rating on food sorry). Explored more of the general area for other hidden gems or hotspots. And last but not least is too sleep with the French doors open to fall asleep and wake to the sounds of the ocean (Didn't do this due to temperature and unknown bug/mosquito problems for my son).

From the noise levels to the musty bathroom, this place brings back fond memories of college. To be fair, though, one has to anticipate that certain type of energy from this place, located steps from the shore in the heart of San Diego's surfer-dude village. My boyfriend and I checked in on a Friday in July, not expecting the Ritz based on reputation, but hopeful that the very-friendly, helpful staff was a positive indicator that the facility might just surprise us in a fun, carefree San Diego kind of way. Nope. We arrived at our third-floor room and our jaws hit the floor when the stink hit our nostrils: eau de must, mold and cigarettes (in a non-smoking room). The bathroom was a stall-sized cell containing a stand-up shower (wear your flip-flops), toilet, sink (upon which one could rest their chin while enjoying a session, if one felt so inclined), as well as the most sinister-looking dust bunny ever seen peering down from the ventilation fan (see photo, though it does not do justice). The carpet was scary (wear your flip-flops). The a/c was portable, and though we could technically see the ocean from our awkward screen-free window, we could also see the back of a crummy condo, ample bird pollution, broken furniture, and two thankfully retired commodes (see photo, this one does do justice). The real fun started at 3am when the frat boys arrived to their room next door, though it could have just as easily been our room, since the walls are simply a formality possibly formed by wall paper over, evidently, nothing. \"Who's up for beer pong?!\" Not us. Though we were up. For the next six hours. Until we checked out after deciding that our fun, carefree, blissful vacation would be better spent in a hotel with not as much \u201ccool,\u201d a little more quiet, and a lot less chance of catching staph.

We actually enjoyed being AT the hotel too, thanks to the nice courtyard. We met friends and hung out in the courtyard under the sun more than once! Our room was on the corner at the beach, a fluke but probably the best room in the place. The hotel lets folks with dogs book rooms on the ground floor only, which is what I wanted anyway - that way the courtyard (sunny, teeming with blooming jasmine, comfy tables, fountains) and the ocean view were right there! The room was very nice- simple, but clean, comfortable, and with tiled floors to deal with the inevitable sand issue. We walked everywhere around OB for the four days we stayed- out the pier to relax, to music, beers, etc. I will definitely return to OB Hotel, and next time with my beach cruiser in tow! A note to dog owners, the beach across the road is not for dogs from 9-6, but Dog Beach is about five blocks away and HUGE. So there's plenty of places to exercise the pooches. My only complaints were about a) the patio- which was potentially cute but currently boring-it needed some plants or something, and even the little fountain wasn't working; b) the bathroom needed some more towel racks and hooks, and c) the staff was at times less than responsive. A small example: we had our own coffee grounds and filters (we were on a road trip!) and all we needed was hot water for great coffee. When i asked about hot water, all I got was the blankest of stares. Luckily, there are great coffee shope all around, but it still boggled my mind that there was NO access to hot water in the lobby, though there was coffee (bad coffee, but still) offered in the lobby!

Everybody who came from out of state had all these plans to see the other San Diego sights, but once they settled in, they realized how wonder it was just to stay in Ocean Beach, enjoy the beach, go to the Farmers Market on Wednesday night, enjoy the shops and restaurants of Newport Avenue, and spend lots of quality time with their cousins, etc. from all over the western U.S. Another important feature of Ocean Beach, especially for young families- or big families, is that the restaurants are very reasonably priced, including the wonderful family restaurant on the pier. Breakfast and lunch were inexpensive and then we would order take-out and have big family dinners in the courtyard of the hotel, making our own salads and having our own sodas and beer and wine. More time to spend with family and friends and much more affordable for everybody. The staff at the Ocean Beach Hotel is friendly, courteous, and incredibly helpful. They went out of their way to help with whatever we needed. Little did we (or they) know that we would be back 50 weeks later. This year was the wedding of Katie (from San Diego) who teaches with now-her-husband Matt in Honolulu. They chose the Thursday Club in Sunset Cliffs for the wedding and the Ocean Beach Hotel was the overwhelming choice for everyone to stay after our wonderful experience in 2005. I, of course, was delegated to handle the room reservations again. There were hardly any of the younger children this year, but lots of Matt's family and friends from the Pittsburg, PA area. I emailed them the website, but had them make the room reservations through me. Once again, the hotel staff helped immensely. It was great to see the reactions of the Pittsburg visitors. They said \" I know you said it was right on the beach, but it is really right on the beach!\" Once again, they had all these plans to see all the San Diego sights and then hardly left Ocean Beach.

However, we heard that the hotel changed ownership (which was true) so we tried it again. The place was totally redone, clean, the people were nice - whereas before they were barely coherent - and the community has dramatically changed as far as cleanliness, police presence and absence of the homeless folks.
