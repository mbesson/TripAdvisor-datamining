Security was good and the rooms were quiet and very comfortable. Service was indifferent - its a busy impersonal business hotel so not many friendly touches for guests. Our stay was also spoilt a bit as we mistakenly left a bag with shopping and souvenirs in the room on checkout, phoned the same day to query and the bag was gone - although completely our fault due to oversight, this is still theft as it was plainly brand new goods that were left by mistake and this left a bad last impression. Final summary - its a smart, comfortable hotel with super facilities and the location is perfect not only for business travellers but also for tourists - but it leaves a cold experience as the service is very distant and not hands on at all.

Hopped on the cable car to pier 39 and walked up. We took a the Gray Line Tour which had all of the main stops of San Francisco. It started at Pier 43 !/2 , walking distance from Pier 39. Did a historical overview of the city. Other tours also start there; such as Tiberon, Alcatraz, Angel Island, Muir Woods. Also took the ferry to Tiberon/Muir woods. Also leaves from Pier 43 1/2, The shops at Pier 39 are nice, kind of a tourist trap. Walk down to Pier 41 or 39 and you can catch the cable car. It will take you to China Town, Powell Street Mall, and Gharadelli Square. Visit the Gharadelli chochlotte Factory. Hunan Homes is a very good Chiniese eating place in China Town.

I ask to speak to a manager and the employee told me I would get an email or a phone call to follow. Of course I don't hear back and I had to email them several days later instead (anybody see their consistency with customer service yet?).

But when We woke up enough to remember we were too far down the corridor from the elevators to hearbthem we discovered the cause was the door bell on our room. It was going off on its own, sometimes just once, other times a dozen times in a row. It was 4::15 am and I called the front desk. A security guard and engineer eventually showed up, but doubted my explanation. Fortunately the door bell went on a ringing binge while they were still there. 45 minutes later they had silenced it and repaired the HVAC system. By at 5:30 am, getting back to sleep was not going to happen. Later that day the front desk manager promised to have the engineer recheck the system, but refused any billing adjustment. Moving to a different hotel was not a reasonable option, and our second night was clicking and dinging free. When checking out, the desk clerk begrudgingly gave us 20% off the first night only, saying that was the most the hotel did for any problems they caused.

The affluence of asian visitors to the hotel is notable and so is the hotel's Japanese heritage. In everything from the hotel's restaurant (ANZU) and the room furnishings, you can sense the Japanese quality flair. The hotel, however, has not greatly evolved and under new management changes recently, probably should refresh very soon. Some details tell the age and lack of attention to detail quite dramatically, such as the torn (and sewn) drapers, the 1980's sound system and closet doors, for example. The experience sums up as positive in great part due to the prime location, a few steps away from Union Square, Market St and many other relevant places in town. This is the kind of hotel where service goes unnoticed and happens behind the scenes. You almost never bump into service people, however, service is conducted impeccably. The quality of the food is very good, but probably not the best Japanese/Asian that one can find in San Francisco, and of course that will always be a challenge in a city with so much Asian influence and so many gourmet alternatives. The hotel's fitness center and pool are a highlight and very good to excellent. The lobby lacks charisma and sense of belonging. It transmits the ethos of an empty office lobby or train station, not much to see, do or enjoy.

This hotel was a pick based on location and price by my travel coordinator at the place I work. Bottom line up front: It\u2019s an average hotel, meeting all expectations, but it\u2019s probably more targeted towards the business traveler than couples and families. Hotel staff was nice and accommodating at the front desk, check in was a breeze. There are 6 elevators serving 22 floors of rooms and 2 floors of lobby and restaurant. We never had to wait more than 3 min for an elevator to arrive and the hotel was booked solid during our stay. The 22-24 floor are accessed only via room key in the elevator and come with access to the open lounge area on the 23rd floor. They have a free morning continental breakfast there and free drinks at happy hour times each day, but it is only accessible by guests staying on floor 22-24. Those are the VIP floors and it does come with an obvious increase in cost to the nightly room rate. Those rooms also come with a free breakfast buffet at the restaurant located on the 2nd floor, which everyone has access to, but only those staying on the 22-24 floor rooms receive it for free. It\u2019s a great buffet, lots of choices from your typical American breakfast offerings to traditional Japanese noodle and rice breakfast bowls. But it\u2019s expensive. $29.99 was the going rate for those in our group who didn\u2019t get a room on the 22-24 floor. Sure, average for a buffet, but considering Caf\u00e9 Mason, which is an awesome place to eat, and Lori\u2019s Diner were located right across the street from the hotel, many of them skipped the buffet and when there where they could dine for under $15 per plate. Entertainment \u2013 there is a small jazz bar/lounge located right off the lobby. It\u2019s a very small venue, so don\u2019t expect any big name people, but it\u2019s intimate and good quality music. It\u2019s usually over before 10pm so no need to worry about noise. The bar closes at 11pm each week night, no matter how packed it is. I\u2019ve seen bartenders keep places open past closing if it\u2019s packed because they\u2019ll keep making $$. Not here. We were there for a convention and the place was wall to wall packed, standing room only, and they kicked us all out at 10:50pm. Everyone went to a bar across the street, but I see that as a missed business opportunity and it was a real sore spot for many folks who just wanted to keep talking and drinking there. Location: Easy walk to Moscone Center for conventions, local variety of restaurants, bars, entertainment and Union Square. Powell Bart Station is 5 blocks away and an easy walk if your only luggage is a carry on. Price: Considering I wasn\u2019t paying for it you can take this part with a grain of salt. Floors 22-24 are the more pricy of the choices and run $250+ per night and they were pretty average. Nothing really stood out that made the room that much better than the lower floors other than the views and the fact it was farther from the street noise, which I never heard from my room. We did have 2 rooms charges that were not ours on the bill when we checked out. I disputed these charges and they were removed without question. I was really pleased with this because I've stayed at places who put up a fight when certain charges are disputed, but I guarantee you I did not eat those 2 packages of $8 peanuts from the room fridge. I'm allergic. Overall it was a nice stay, everyone was eager to help out, and it met all expectations for a hotel that seems to have business travelers as their target audience. When I bring my family back to the Bay Area for a stay we\u2019ll be staying somewhere else, and if it\u2019s just the wife and I there are more romantic places to stay.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "sbenus", "ReviewID": "UR125799673", "Content": "Stayed here 3 nights for a conference.

I recommend checking out the Irish House Pub/Restaurant across the street. It has great food/drinks and a great ambiance. Not hotel related but the taxi situation in San Francisco is terrible.

My room looked toward the bay/ financial district. There are many great things about the Nikko, and a few things preventing it from getting all 5's from me. Firstly the pluses. Wifi and breakfast is included with the club room; the wifi speed is good and the breakfast was excellent - some of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. Service was efficient. One morning, one of the light bulbs failed when I turned the light on, and without me having to report it, it was fixed by the time I came back to my room later. The gym is well-equipped, though you pay a one-off $20 fee, and there's even a Starbucks on the ground floor. The bed is also very comfortable with a selection of pillows. The only downsides for me? Well, Although the room had a decent TV, there was an old stereo system with no iPod doc. There was a bedside clock radio, again very old, cheap and nasty with no iPod dock. They need to ditch these as it dates the room. Better to just get an ihome-type bedside unit and do away with the wall-mounted modular system. Also, the great view out of the window was somewhat spoiled by the window needing cleaning (outside). And the window blind had seen much better days. Finally and most annoying for me; the cups at breakfast have a swirly handle that sprout on one side and can only be used in your right hand. As a left hander, I found this very annoying. Every morning I had to request a \"normal\" cup with varying success. The staff just didn't understand why it was an issue. For a city which has come to stand for the rights of minority groups, I found it uncomfortable to be made to feel so abnormal by my simple request! Rant over.

I had never heard of the Nikko brand before and i am used to staying at the Hilton due to my HHonours loyalty card but I gave it a go and found the service to be extremely good. The bell boys, reception staff and concierge all offered a smile during what was a busy time of the year. We spent new years eve and new years day at this hotel and stress levels would've been high but the staff certainly did not show it. We had a very nice lady at check in who offered us a deal. We were offered internet and one buffet breakfast for each of us (wife and I) for an extra charge of $30 p day which was decent since the internet charge on its own was $15 p day. What it did do however was bump us down from a deluxe king bed to a Queen which we weren't too thrilled about and although we did get a room on a reasonably high floor with a view, the bed was quite tiny. We were told that our deluxe King bed room would not include the internet and breakfast deal and we weren't promised a room with a view either so didn't really have a choice as such and we went ahead with the $30 p day deal. I think we might have paid a bit more initially to secure a deluxe king bed room so in hindsight from a purely economic/financial perspective, I don't think we really got an upgrade as such. However, besides that, our stay was wonderful. The mini bar is affordable. I found mini bars at some of our other hotels to be a bit more expensive than this one. The concierge was very helpful with restaurants. We wanted to see a bit of san francisco on New years day and they recommended two tour shuttle companies to us (I personally think the hotel might be earning a bit of commission on the sale of these tours) but I think the hop on hop off buses are good too if you want a bit more independence to decide what to do when. We used the hop on hop off buses in Chicago, and New York as well. The hotel is centrally located and so I probably would come back again however, if you are booking a king deluxe room, make sure you try and get one with a view otherwise the $30 internet and breakfast deal may lure you into downgrading to a queen like it did for us.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOk hotel at good price\u201d", "Author": "Kwun Yin C", "ReviewID": "UR122954285", "Content": "Went for the NYE weekend and cost of hotel was relatively inexpensive.

When I arrived, they offered me an upgrade to the Imperial floor at level 23 (which was actually 2 upgrades up from what I reserved), and I was only charged $12/night extra. Well worth it for the increased room size, beautiful view of the city, access to the various Imperial floor amenities, and of course reduced noise from the street. The hotel is very modern and clean with just about every amenity you can think of. Since I like to keep it healthy, I especially appreciated the atrium pool, hot tub, fitness center, sauna, steam room, and spa services. All of the staff I interacted with (front desk, concierge, room service, bellman, etc.) were extremely friendly and helpful. There's not much else I could imagine wanting in a hotel for this price range or even higher EXCEPT for free parking or at least at a reduced price from $45/day - an easy solution is to just park directly across the street in the self parking garage for half price.

At the time, I was afraid that the noise level would be a problem (based on other reviews), but we had no problems sleeping, but that could also be related to how high we were (11th floor). The staff was excellent. Each time we left the hotel or entered, friendly staff opened the doors for us and said, \"Hello.\" There was no mistreatment at all.

Union square is very close, as are the cable cars, and the mall. A little bit more about the room. I'm only including this so that I can create a more thorough review, because I know that this matters to some people: The carpet and some of the furniture was a little bit worn. It didn't bother my wife and I at all. Location:The location is the only reason I did not give this hotel 5 stars, but allow me to explain; if you are familiar with the streets in this area (as my wife and I were), and traveling the wrong way on foot is not a concern, then I give this place 5 stars. However, if you are not familiar with the streets, you could possibly go out walking into a bad area. You don't walk outside directly into a bad area, but if you walk a few blocks in the wrong direction, you can end up somewhere you really shouldn't be, and for this reason only, I give 4 instead of 5 stars. The solution is easy though: Simply make sure you understand where you're walking before you head out, and you'll be fine.

The prices of the mini bar are very high. Not even 1 bottle of water is free (7 dollars for water). The wi-fi worked great and was quite fast of a hotel wi-fi. The breakfast of the executive floor was sufficient. It had bread, cereals, one kind of fresh fruit, juice, coffee and tea.. It was not anything special but ok to get you going. The second morning we had breakfast at the restaurant on the first floor. This was a buffet with fruit, bread, cereals, oatmeal, eggs. It was a better buffet than the one on the executive floor, however, I have seen much better (we would not have paid for it but had two free buffet passes). The restaurant is very modern and clean. The waiters/waitresses at the restaurant (morning) were not giving the best service at all. They didn't notice you. The tables are quite small and if you had more than one plate each at the table you would have problems having everything at the table. The waiters looked right at us several times but didn't pick up the plates until we asked them to take it away (at this time we had 3 plates stacked). We also had dinner in the same restaurant. At night they seemed under staffed - we were waiting for 5 minutes to get seated because the hostess were running around though it wasn't busy. The food was really good and the service was fine (I wanted a diet coke on bottle which they didn't have but they picked one up from roomservice). But they could be much more polite - it wasn't a place where we wanted to spend a long time because we felt we weren't welcome. The gym is huge and has all the amenties you need!

If you do need to use the internet (and do not want to pay 16 dollars for 24 hours) you can use it at Starbucks, which is right next to the hotel exit! So don't spend your money on the pricey internet, have coffee and WIFI at Starbucks! Besides that we were very satisfied with our stay. If you need a fridge for cold drinks or food, you can just ask for it in the reception and they will install it in your room! Some reviewers say that the surrounding streets can be dangerous at night time. That is in some way true. There are (as in all over San Francisco) homeless people and tough guys hanging out on the street corners, but that is no different to big cities like New York, London or whereever.

A little noisy, due to lots of people in the area; if you don't like crowds, don't stay in ANY Union Square hotel (in fairness, the Hotel Nikko is not as near to the crowds in Union Square as a few others are).

Booked a double standard room and requested a fridge be placed in room as well. Arrived on Friday @ 12 and was immediately able to use room. Very nice room and fairly large for SF standards. Fridge was in room as requested which was fabulous since we were there to run a marathon and needed liquids! The only complaint that I have of room is would have been nice to have a large mirror in the actual room area to utilize as vanity. Hotel is located directly across the street from Hilton which was being picketed, loud blaring megaphones starting at the crack of dawn which is no fault of Nikko. Unpacked and headed to Nike tent for registration. Perfect location to Marathon starting line, not soooo close to be crazy loud but close enough to not exhaust our legs before a marathon. Loved the beds, super comfortable. Starbucks is located in lower level but the line was always so long didn't have patience to deal with it. Nikko also has a restaurant and a lounge/bar, didn't patron them but they looked nice. Nikko boasts an indoor pool/hottub/spa. After 26.2 miles of running we wanted nothing more then to soak in the hottub. Walked through the spa which was beautiful and hit the hottub which was lukewarm at best. We did call maintenance and within 10 minutes the water temperature was fixed and we were soaking our exhausted muscles. The hottub is a little dated but still did the trick. Staff was courteous and efficient. We are again heading for SF to run the Marathon 20/2011 and have booked the Nikko again.

I just saw the the average price for a Friday through Monday in August 2011(same timing during the week as my trip) is now $317! I obviously will see much more value in the cost of my four nights compares to someone who will pay more than double my cost. Anyway, the hotel is in a great location (in Union Square) and near many shops/restaurants and in walking distance to many different places if you don't mind sweating a little bit. We actually walked to Lombard Street (Crookedest Street in the World) room the hotel and then down to Fisherman's wharf since the cable car line was insanely crowded with tourists and on the expensive end. This enabled us to walk through China town and North Beach and take in the city. It was quite enjoyable. The hotel is also a couple of blocks away from Blazing Saddles, a bicycle shop, which is very convenient. We rented bikes @ 9 am and biked through the Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, and then over the Golden Gate Bridge into Sausilito. We then took a ferry back to Fisherman's Wharf and then biked the rest of the way back to the hotel. As far as the hotel is concerned, the room was on the smaller end as expected, but clean and comfortable. We were able to get a mini fridge at no additional cost. The hotel had a pool and fitness area available for $10, which included a nice steam room. As fat as negatives are concerned, showering left a bit desired as the water pressure wasn't great and the televisions are not HD - these things could definitely be updated. Also, we arrived Friday night, gave our baggage to the guy in the check-in parking area and then proceeded upstairs to the check-in desk with our baggage claim ticket. We gave the baggage ticket to the lady once we checked in and also asked for her to charge us for the fitness center and pool area. We realized after an hour (after not receiving our luggage) that the lady never told anyone to get our luggage. This was quite an annoyance as it took a little bit for them to track down he location of our luggage. Additionally, that same night, when we went to use our card to go to the pool area, we were declined access. The same lady didn't add this access to our card as we instructed. The hotel could have comped us for the inconvenience at the very least. The conceriege desk is excellent and they are very helpful and accommodating. WiFi is available at a cost of about $10/night. Parking is extremely expensive if you have a rental car; we found a local lot for about half the price. All in all, we were happy with our experience given the amount of money we paid for a four night stay in an expensive city like San Francisco, but would never pay $317 a night!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alameda, CA", "Title": "\u201cwonderful weekend getaway!\u201d", "Author": "CleanMomAlameda_CA", "ReviewID": "UR115913800", "Content": "The service was excellent and the location perfect.

Upon arrival, we used \"Super Shuttle\" from SFO which was about a 30 minute ride, efficient and convenient. The Hotel Nikko is located in the Union Square area but very close to the Tenderloin Area (Be very leery of this). Don't be surprised to see the homeless going thru the garbage cans and ash trays in front of the hotel, it's not only prevalent near the hotel but this seems to be the norm instead of the exception in San Francisco. The hotel is very convenient to public transportation, The Westfield Shopping Center, shopping, food and Walgreens. Again, the homeless are all around the city, sleeping in public areas, camped out in front of Walgreens and other stores with signs asking for money, or walking in the shopping area asking for money as you pass, this was a complete turn off for our view of San Francisco and would not recommend it for a family vacation. Not sure why this is accepted, however, it with the very low police presence observed, it gave us a very unsafe, unsettling feeling. As we were walking to the Cable Cars one afternoon, we observed a very dirt homeless woman walking thru the crowd removing her clothes, when she removed her shirt and was topless, another homeless male yelled at her to put her clothes but she continued walking. We did not stick around to see what happened. It was unsightly especially for children present. The city in our view was dirty; areas had strong smells of urine as we walked down Market St to the Pier area. The people of San Francisco are very friendly for the most part, but we encountered several young people (both male and female) on the \"F Line\" (Transportation to/from Pier areas) on two different trips using strong profanity and vulgarity along with littering and spitting on the Tram Car, we were appalled to see such disregard to their surroundings and the city. Back to the Hotel Nikko, this was a saving grace, the hotel is beautiful, the staff was awesome (friendly and very helpful). We stayed on in an Imperial Club Room (24th floor) which allowed us to take advantage of the evening reception of wine, beer, finger food, cheese and crackers nightly which was a great way to begin your night time activities. The room had a king size bed/pillows that was so comfortable and inviting, the room had all the amenities to make our stay relaxing and cozy. The bathroom was posh and large, we wanted to take the shower home with us, and water pressure was excellent which lacked nothing. The Imperial Club Room came with a continental breakfast (Bagels, pastries, fruit, and cereal along with coffee, tea or juice) which was sufficient to get started in San Fran. We took advantage of the breakfast buffet in the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Anzu, which was superb. They offered a full Japanese Breakfast along with a full American Breakfast with Grilled Salmon, Eggs, Sausage, Bacon, Miso Soup, Lox, Meats etc. (this was a gourmet breakfast). We can\u2019t say enough of the quality of our stay at the Hotel Nikko. Thank you staff and management! Back to the surrounding area, we stayed over 4th of July Weekend. During our stay, there was a shooting two blocks from the hotel (Tenderloin Area) and a Police \u201cBART\u201d Officer shot and killed an armed drunk a few transit stops from the hotel. Union Square is two blocks away (make sure you go in the right direction) where you can catch the open top sightseeing buses, we took the blue bus but I would recommend the red ones as we saw a lot more of them and more frequent pickups. You catch the Cable Cars at Powell and Market along with the \u201cF\u201d Line (Tram Car to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf), the Cable Cars are $6 per ride each way and the F and buses are $2 each way. You can buy a weekly transport card (Good discount is you plan on using public transportation) in the visitor center at Powell and Market. The visitor center is down stairs on Powell at Market St. Shopping in the area is no way up to par what you find in New York City. We found some good lunch options on the lower level of the Westfield Shopping Center and they have a Bristol Farms (Market) as well. We will not go in depth here for the sightseeing we did, but highly recommend: Alcatraz (a must, but get tickets on line before you go), Fisherman\u2019s Wharf (Touristy, expensive but fun), Muir Woods (Giant Redwoods) make sure you have enough time to spend there, AT&T Park (saw a Giants Game) and of course the Golden Gate. We saw what we wanted to see in San Francisco and more than we wanted to however, in our future we will go to cities that provide a feeling of a safer, secure environment.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Mindful_Travels", "ReviewID": "UR115070851", "Content": "This hotel is right downtown a block or two from the main shopping.

It was our first time together in San Francisco, and the first thing that struck me about the hotel was the location - very close to Union Square and the city centre. We couldn't have asked for a better location to be honest, each day it was only a few minutes walk to the square or down the street to get the cable car. To our surprise, we also found when we were leaving that our car hire collection was directly across the street - very handy if you're thinking of staying in SF and then picking up a car to travel on. There is a large shopping plaza less than 5 mins from the hotel, with a cinema, huge eating area and an abundance of assorted shops. We spent a few afternoons here and with the hotel being so close, it was nice not to have to walk a long distance with bags. The Hotel itself is large and very spacious. Our room was clean, well presented, and again spacious. All the usual amenities were present and everything ran smoothly; our room was freshened very day and we had no problems whatsoever. The staff were friendly and courteous, and check-in was quick. The hotel has a restaurant onsite - we didn't actually try this due to the abundance of other local resturants in the vicinity which we wished to try out, but their menu did look enticing! There is a Starbucks downstairs which is part of the hotel lobby, but with an external entrance .... handy for your morning coffee fix before hitting the streets. There is also an Irish bar (Foleys) just a few yards down the street, we ended up in here 2 or 3 times and found it a very busy place with great atmosphere - would recommend it for a few casual drinks. My only gripe with the hotel was lack of free wireless in the rooms - you had to go to the lobby area to pick it up. It seems strange that it wasn't also offered in the rooms, but perhaps this is typical of the hotels in SF city? In other areas we stayed in throughout California, free wi-fi seemed to be the norm.

Other interactions with the staff were fine. Location is fine though there are a lot of tourists here and the Tenderloin, with drunks and street people, starts a block or two from the hotel - doesn't bother me much but does not add to the atmosphere. Powell St. BART is very close by. Lots of small restaurants and fast food places as well. Not too far from Chinatown and I enjoyed walking down Market to the Embarcadero. What didn't I like? Mostly the internet connection. It was usually slow, often dismal, and from time to time (like 6AM) quite speedy. Just not a big enough pipe out of the hotel. I'd have been annoyed if I had paid for such (was included in my conference room rate). The room ventilation was sub par. Most hotels have a setting where you can just run the fan all the time and mask noise with the fan sounds. In this hotel, if you set the fan to \"ON\" setting it runs for a while, and then shuts off. Then it will go off and on, apparently with the cooling only - that is what the \"AUTO\" setting should do. And the maid always turned the AC off - meant I'd come back to a boiling sunny room. The hotel sent a \"hope everything is OK\" emali after the first night. Cute, but they never replied when I asked about the fan. I was glad I have my own micro white noise source.

The staff was friendly, courteous, and thoughtful throughout our stay. Often times it's the little things that count the most, and Hotel Nikko pays attention to them. A bit weary from several hours worth of flight delays, being greeted with \"happy anniversary!\" by the front desk upon arrival really served to boost our spirits. Finding a complimentary bottle of champagne and a card in our room to mark the special occasion was merely a beginning to the personalized care we received all weekend. On two occasions, we opted to eat in our room. Both experiences with room service - breakfast and dinner - were virtually flawless. The food arrived on time, was precisely what we had ordered, and was an appropriate temperature (not to mention delicious!). I was still asleep when our morning meal arrived and my partner later told me that the gentleman who came to deliver it caught on to that fact quickly and went to great pains not to wake me from my peaceful slumber. Our other dinner with the hotel was at their restaurant, Anzu, where we had an equally exceptional experience: fantastic food and exemplary service. After leaving the Do Not Disturb sign on our door for a couple of days, housekeeping called to ask if we needed anything. They did an excellent job making sure that our needs were met while respecting our privacy. And when I developed an allergic reaction to a piece of new piece of clothing I didn't wash before wearing it, the front desk staff worked efficiently to help me get some Benadryl in my system quickly. In addition to the wonderful staff and food, we enjoyed several amenities offered by Hotel Nikko. We stayed in a King Room on the Nikko Floor and our bathroom was impressive, with a separate shower and tub. As two women who tend toward the femme side, an additional vanity outside of the bathroom was quite welcome! Our bed was very comfortable and there were no disturbing noises at night or during the day. Since water is one of our favorite places to be, it was a given that we would try out the pool. Although it was a bit small and somewhat shallow - 4.5 feet on the deep end - we had fun and were even able to swim a few laps. There is an Enterprise on-site and they were able to quickly pull up our reservation for a car. The Enterprise staff also deserves a huge shout out here. Not only were they incredibly friendly and helpful at the start of our rental, they generously stayed an extra few minutes past their closing time as we desperately weaved through San Francisco traffic on our way back to the hotel. A couple of important notes: 1) It turns out that our visit was just prior to a 6-week renovation of the pool area - it's now closed and scheduled to reopen on April 4, 2011. According to a notice posted on the wall in the locker rooms, Hotel Nikko arranged for its guests to have the use of both an indoor and an outdoor pool at neighboring hotels during this time. 2) While the in-room stereo system was a delight, it didn't have any built-in support for playing music off of an iPod or other MP3 player. We came prepared with both a \"mini stereo to dual RCA\" adapter cable and - equally importantly - knowledge of how to connect it to the stereo. The hotel staff might have both the equipment and the know-how if you don't, but better safe than sorry. (The stereo did have a CD player, if you'd rather go that route.) Overall, our vacation was everything we were hoping it would be and more, thanks in large part to the fabulous staff at Hotel Nikko.

Upon check-in I asked for a quiet room as I explained we were on our honeymoon and were tired from travelling. We had booked a deluxe king room in about February using Expedia. Upon check in we were told that the hotel was fully booked (it was a Monday) and that they could only accommodate us in a queen standard room. We then very firmly stated that this was simply not good enough as we had pre-booked our room, were on our honeymoon and to give us less than what we had booked was less than what we had paid for and was misleading and deceptive. We then (at our initiative) had to haggle with the receptionist (who was incredibly incompetent, unfriendly and really needed to improve her people skills) to try and be compensated for taking the inferior, much smaller and cheaper room. We asked for continental breakfast each morning, wi-fi and use of the gym and pool (which quiet frankly should be included anyway) but no she simply could not give us all of that. She couldn't even guarantee that if we took the queen standard room for one night we could be moved to the deluxe king room for the 2 remaining nights. After arguing with her for about 15 minutes and standing our ground to say that we wanted the room which we had booked 7 months ago and paid for, and wanted to speak to the hotel general manager (who we were told was not available) we eventually got it. She told us that a VIP would have to be moved from that room. We did get one morning's free breakfast to 'compensate' us and use of the hotel's wine and cheese sundowner (which was pathetic to say the least) - which was big of them. Upon checking in to our room we were extremely disappointed. Gee I felt sorry for any 'VIP' staying there. Whilst clean the rooms are extremely small and dated. Having 3 suitcases, 1 carry on, 1 back pack and a piece of art we struggled to fit into the room comfortably. Lucky we didn't take the standard queen room otherwise our bags would have been in the hall way. After paying for wi-fi we checked out the Expedia website. There were rooms still available for the dates of our stay (including king deluxe rooms). We stayed at 8 American hotels during our honeymoon and this was by far the worst. We booked all our accommodation for our trip using Expedia and did not encounter any problems at all except for the Hotel Nikko.

I said UH-UH. NO. And I insisted that she charge my card then and there and process a credit for my guest. Horrible experience.

First, the good things. The location is exceptionnal, right next to Powell station, near all the public transportation, the cable cars, the busy Market street and Union Square; it's an excellent feel of downtown life in SanFrancisco. Lots of restaurants at walking distance, shops, museums, all you may need for a urban vacation. And still, quite quiet: no noise in our room, the bed was exceptionnally comfortable, we slept like babies. The room and entire hotel were spotless, the staff very courteous, the lobby inviting. No trouble at all getting cheked in or out, maid service excellent. Good bathroom with standard facilities and nice decoration. The buffet breakfast is a little expensive (20$ each...) but very good, there is japanese traditionnal breakfast (for adventurous caucasians who want to have salmon for breakfast!). fresh fruits, yogurt, pancakes, bacons, eggs, potatoes... real croissants, good bread, real orange juice and honest coffee . Didn't try the restaurant for dinner but happy hour in the lounge restaurant was fun and cozy. Now the other side of the medal... As previously said by other reviewers, internet is NOT free and costs at least 15$ a day via AT&T Wi-Fi (or 35$ for 3 days...). You also have to pay an extra 10$ to use the pool and exercise room during your stay (you pay only once for the entire stay). And the pool, is OK, not exceptionnal; there is a kind of plastic (?) coating that gives a bizarre feel and look to the pool, the water is too shallow (maximum 5 feet deep) and warm. Could not swim: no room, too hot. Aloso, the rooms are a little small (wich i don't mind myself) , but has no drawers to put your stuff in and only one night table and reading lamp beside the bed. The TV has no HD signal (we are spoiled by ours...!), but this is an insignifiant detail, i guess...

Reading through some of these reviews, the rooms must not be of the same quality. My room had two queen beds. The carpets were stained everywhere. I asked for a different room but was denied because there were no others available. I wouldn't walk on the floors without my shoes. I just couldn't believe how bad the carpets were. The furniture was all beat up - so worn that it looked like it was about to fall apart. The baseboards in the room were in terrible shape. There was at least an inch thick of dust on all the lights - especially the one above the TV. The bathroom was the only thing that was nice. It had been updated and was very nice. Bath products were a brand from London. Water pressure was strong. No complaints about the bathroom. The location is not very good. It is on the edge of a bad part of town. Be prepared to be bothered by people when entering and exiting the hotel. I saw a person get forced out of the Starbucks that is attached to the hotel lobby. Overall, my room was terrible.

You have to walk a few blocks to let your dog tend to the call of nature. The pet rules stated my little dog could not stay in the room unattended for any amount of time, even if she was kenneled!!! This meant I could not go out with my kids without the dog, so we ordered delivery from nearby restaurants only to get complaints from the delivery staff at how rudely they were treated by hotel staff. One driver stated the staff said, \"We don't want your kind here. You don't have money.\" The room I was given had horrible pet stains on the carpet which I have never experienced before in a pet friendly hotel room and the furnishings looked old and damaged. In addition to other reviewer's comments about no wireless access, even in the lobby (something standard in lower end chains!), there is also no microwave, gift shop, vending or washing machine/dryer. Don't dare touch the fridge or they will charge you, as pointed out in other reviews! Parking for hotel guests is $51/night but the giant parking garage across the street offers $29 for 24-hour parking, so like the internet pricing, I am not sure why hotel guests are getting overcharged for everything. This hotel caters to businessmen and Asian guests. If you do not fall into this category and are used to staying at lower end chains pampering you with warm cookies and fragrant Bath & Body Works soaps, you probably won't like this place. Don't forget anything, because they will charge you for anything you forget that other hotels give you as a courtesy.

We had previously been staying at a Hilton in the financial district which was also a 4 star hotel and we had a much bigger and more comfortable room, a better view, and free wi-fi in our room. At Hotel Nikko, the room was very small, the view was of another hotel, and wi-fi would have cost us $16/day. (For $5 you can sign up for free unlimited wi-fi at the Starbucks that is located in the lobby!) Our bed was a double and when we asked about upgrading as we heard was an option from other reviews on Trip Advisor, we were told that the hotel was booked for the weekend and there were no upgrade options. The sign on the mini fridge informed us that everything was electronically monitored and if you even moved things around to accommodate leftovers, it would charge you...unless of course you called the front desk, then they'd only charge you $2 to move the things around. The bottle of water in the room was $6. If we had wanted to use the pool/fitness center we would of been charged extra. The furniture in the room seemed old and we were left wondering how this hotel has a 4 star rating. In our experience 3 to 3 1/2 star hotels seem to offer a lot more services to their guests. We are not big shoppers so the major designer stores in the neighborhood did not attract us. Our previous hotel in the financial district was a much more attractive neighborhood for us- we enjoyed being close to Chinatown and North Beach. North Beach seemed much more authentic and had many more places to eat that weren't way overpriced. We got help from the concierge twice, one time he was very helpful, the other time not so much. The thing we did appreciate about Hotel Nikko was it's proximity to Market Street where you can catch most busses and the streetcars which will take you to Fisherman's Wharf and the Ferry Building.

Everything exuded luxe -- this, after a week in some too-idiosyncratic B&Bs! Staff was friendly throughout -- from front desk, to concierge, to bar, to cleaning staff encountered in the halls. Bed was terrific, the roomy bath a pleasure. Great location -- a block off Union Square. When I reported items missing in the mini-bar, so as not to be charged for them, housekeeping said they'd take care of it. When the items appeared on our bill, I simply told the front desk they weren't our charges and they instantly removed the charges. Our stay made us big fans of Nikko Hotels.

The worst part was that someone started pounding on the door of my hotel room at 2 am. I tried to ignore it, but the knocking continued. I finally got up and checked the peephole and saw a woman outside who appeared to be crying with her face buried in her hands. I yelled through the door to go away, that she had the wrong room. The woman then tried to engage in a conversation to try to get me to open the door. I wasn't going to participate in that BS so again I yelled through to door for her to go away. She then started screaming that I was a horrible person who doesn't care if someone is getting raped or murdered outside my door. Yeah, as if that makes me want to open a stranger in the middle of the night. I immediately called the front desk to have security come check things out. I never heard anything back from the hotel/security. I asked the front desk a couple different times about the incident, but no one seemed to know anything and didn't seem to particularly care.

Room Good sized room, 1030 I believe, with a king bed, desk, dresser, fridge and chair. We also had a large window to see some of the city from our side of the hotel. Bed I liked the bed but the pillows were horrible. They were so soft and gave no support at all. It was so bad my wife went and got a towel to put under the pillow for extra support. Bathroom It was huge and very nice. Our had a full tub and shower. Never had a problem with hot water and I also liked the pressure.

They got our cell phone number and told us they'll call us when the room is ready. We went to the concierge lounge and waited for their call which never happened. Finally, around 3:15 we went back to the desk to see what happened. As soon as the receptionist saw us, she remembered that we have been waiting for her call. Only then she checked to see if our room is available. They still didn't have any rooms available even thought it was after their official check in time. She asked us if we want to upgrade to a suite for $65 more?!!! Any other hotel, at this point would've said we'll upgrade your room since it's our fault that your room is not ready. We already had paid so much for the imperial level room and didn't want to pay any more so decided to just wait. This was just the beginning of their horrible service.

I banged at the door and tried to get their attention to open the door. Luckily, I had my cell phone so I called my husband. He called the desk and asked them to open the door for me. I waited for quite sometime and kept on knocking on the door but nobody showed up. Eventually one of the guests who was passing by was nice and opened the door for me. The hotel security never bothered to even call me to see if I'm out!! When we complained about the fact that they never called us to confirm if I got out of there, they were so unprofessional and rude.

I normally don't stay at large \"business conference\" style hotels, but I found a great rate (187/night) on a Club Floor room so thought I'd give it a try. All in all it was a nice stay that was a cut above a chain hotel Check in was prompt and efficient (at the time we were there at least; later on in the night there were some LONG lines), and the same lovely girl who checked us in also printed out boarding passes for us at the end of her long shift. I thought the Club Floor would have some exclusivity to it, but I think almost everyone in the hotel was staying on those floors! It was almost comical when a group got into the elevator, everyone reached for their keys for the club floor rooms. At any rate, expect a \"Grand Central Terminal\" kind of feel to the lobby and the public areas. The room WAS nice, but the entire design is a bit sterile. The king bed and bathroom were great. The view was OK, partial bay view but much of it was blocked by the Parc 55 hotel across the street. There is a complimentary wine and cheese happy hour from 5-7, we had to head to dinner around 4:30, I asked the attendant if we could perhaps have one glass early and a few nibbles of cheese as much of the stuff was already out.

The starbucks downstairs was a nice touch too! coffee and buns for breakfast! yay! Staff kindly helped us with our bags - they even let us store them in the hotel when we went off on a bus trip for a few days! They called us taxis and always gave us information on where to go and what to see. We stayed here for far longer than we had first anticipated!

The parking is trather expensive (45 USD per night, but the self parking is as much that price, with no in and out privilegies). The location is fantastic, central to everything, the restaurant is ok, I'm not a fan of Japanese kitchen: they have a sushi bar and a little menu with some western kitchen with Japanes names, but as I said no chichis.

In principle I focused on a Superior Room but during reservation process (thru Internet) I realised that for a small increment in the price a double room at Imperial Club Floor was also available. This Club is located at the top of the building, floors 22, 23 and 24. The price included complimentary breakfast for three people (a $60 total value!), access to exclusive facilities, newspapers, free Internet, Gym, etc. Now, back home again, I am proud to say that I made a right decision, all expectations were met, no doubt, and Hotel NIKKO fully satisfied all our requirements. Staff personnel are truly professional, all levels, including personnel at the Reception Desk and in the ANZU Restaurant (used for breakfast every day) and also a super efficient concierge staff (special credits for Mr. E. Cerrillos) when specific information, not necessarily typical tourist information, was required. This is a very clean Hotel, one block away from Union Square and Cable Car stop in Powell Street, one block also to the huge SFO Shopping Centre, an very good breakfast with high quality food including but not only delicious fresh fruits (what huge & very sweet strawberries, never tasted same in my life, even though we have plenty of them here in Spain!). Also important to note, all major Rental Car brands are around the corner, plus a huge parking garage (4-5 floors) in front of Hotel ($15 per night if you leave before 09:30 a.m., which is a very convenient facility when all the Rental Car offices close down at 18:00 or 19:00 in the best case, too early if you decide to pay a visit during the day to either San Jose (HP Pavilion, a great place for fun!), Silicon Valley, Monterey, Sausalito, Sonoma etc and you return after-hours and need to park somewhere in the vicinity). The price of the Imperial Club room at Hotel NIKKO (mine was 2209) depends on the date and actual occupancy, as usual everywhere, but in my case was something like $258 per night (plus local taxes) for 3 adults which is decently balanced (cheaper, I would say) compared to similar Hotels in big capitals in Europe. Of course, current favourable rate Euro to US Dollar also helps. The bathroom included both a spacious Shower cabin and a Bath tube, plus a flat TV set embedded in the mirror. Plenty of clean white towels, no problems at all. Safe box and a Pioneer Stereo Receiver plus a 5-CD player (even 3 CDs with easy listening music) were also available inside the room. All in all, should I have any future opportunity to visit San Francisco, I will not waste one second of my time looking for accommodation. Simply I will come back to Hotel NIKKO. I cannot say that there are no better Hotels in town. There might be others with probably similar or higher quality and price. But I am pretty sure that I will no take any risk and will go straight on for a safe & good decision: Hotel Nikko.

We didn't ask, nor did we pay more, but boy, did we luck out. The floor-to-ceiling window faced downtown San Fran and the ocean in the distance.

I didn't pay extra and the petite queen was fine but you should not take it if there are more than 2 people or you don't like close quarters. The room was small but efficient with a comfortable bed, desk, large flat screen tv, and closet. Check in was fast and efficient. If you are up for it, I walked from the hotel to the Wharf area but it is a rather long trek (about 20-25 mins) but it's a great way to see the city. Watch out for steep hills and homeless people! Other than that, the hotel is close to all sorts of great shopping in San Francisco with Market St. mere minutes away. Couldn't ask for a better location. If you want to use the gym or pool prepare to pay extra. I didn't and got plenty of exercise walking around. Internet is $10.85 for 24 hours. I got a free signal the first day but it was gone the next. There are some close corner grocery stores (Bush Market is one) close by if you need drinks or snacks. Great stay in a great city...very pleased with the Hotel Nikko! Just make sure you are prepared for a small room fit (barely) for two if you get this place on priceline.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel in the heart of Union Square\u201d", "Author": "fourseasonsOhio", "ReviewID": "UR31967355", "Content": "This is our second stay at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco in the last 2 years.

If you are looking for a clean hotel with a strong minimalist theme then the Nikko may be for you but we would caution that minimalist appears to have been taken to an extreme. Minimalist should not mean soulless. The lobby is dead, bland and empty. The hotel bar closed. The staff professional yet not very friendly. When we have stayed in other hotels, such as the Hyatt or Hilton the staff eventually recognise you if you are staying over a few days. That may not appeal to some but it adds a human touch, the Nikko staff were almost robotical. In the Nikko by day 7 of attending breakfast they almost recognised us. Hard to notice a family of four! Whilst it may be hard to fault the Nikko's rooms which are comfortable I guess the best way to describe our experience is an ok hotel, in a great location with no soul.

The rooms are nice, and fairly clean. -I came down with the flu that was going around, and front desk found out I was sick and sent me complimentary soup and tea. I was really impressed by this.

Had much better meals at restaurants in San Fran. Wouldn't eat at the hotel if I could avoid it. -The $10 a day fee to use the fitness centre is ridiculous. And the gym isn't that great considering you have to pay for it. The $1.50 newspaper charge is also annoying. -My biggest complaint though comes from my second stay. The room I had on my first stay was extremely quiet. On my second stay, I was on one of the lower floors (somewhere between 5-10) and it was HORRIBLE. There was a bus stop/loading dock outside my window, and I heard loud beeping every couple of minutes for 10-15 seconds all day and all night (2-6am was the only time it would stop).

I was booked into a junior suite on the 20th floor so my experience was not really representative. The suite was very nice--two large flat screen LCD TVs, a large sitting area with a couch and chairs and a spectacular view of the city, a big King bed, and a very nice bathroom with vitrine sink, granite vanity, and separate glass enclosed shower and tub. It also had a sound system which I did not try, and a rather silly minibar system which I did (the minibar is automated and automatically charges you, even if you just move things around to make room for a bottle of wine you bought down the street). The furniture and furnishings were generally very nice but nothing to write home about. A very solid 3.5 to 4 star hotel experience all in all. Service was very good, including the concierge who helped with printing a boarding pass. There is a Starbucks on the street level floor, which is nice. A big attraction is Anzu, the hotel's restaurant, on the second floor, which does Asian inflected eclectic fare.

Did not use any of the fitness facilities; it you are a runner, a great run is down Market to the Embarcadero, out to Fisherman's Wharf, and back--about 5 miles, maybe a tad less.

We were in the heart of restaurants, transportation - trolley busses etc. shopping - oh my gosh! and we live in Chicago. The hotel ran so professionally and smoothly. A great gal named POM, checked us in early and gave us a corner room due to our 6 night stay & celebration. Wonderful views of the water, mountains and city! Hotel was all about service with a clean rich contemporary marble decor. We walked to most everything. Had a number of great local dinners thru Restaurant.com (including a fine gourmet meal at ANZU) the hotels restaurant. We found simple breakfast places, and sometimes just enjoyed an apple from the workout center, where most of our days began. Not huge but it had a workable amount of equipment. Lovely pool and hot tub! We got a City Pass, avail thru a website and for $59 ea., had free transportation for 6 days, and admittance in to many exhibits and museums. We bought them from Alcatraz and that made our entry into Alcatraz FREE TOO! Even my new friend Alice the cleaning service gal that cleaned our room, was the best! She advised us on the \"real\" places to go in Chinatown! Our room was spotless after her visit and she always left our extra fluffy towels! To get to and from the airport we took city vans that make hotel runs. They charge btwn $11 & 17 per person, and things went smooth. To leave, the Nikko concierge ( I believe Anne?) did a great job of pulling our paper tickets and arranging for our pick-up van back to the airport. The rough area a few blocks away........no problem, they will tell you where not to go. People asking for $ are everywhere so take a sense of humor, as well as good walking shoes and some warmer clothes to layer.

Everything about this place is amazing, from their staff to the locaton to the rooms, this was by far the best hotel we stayed in during our trip. I had lost my credit card during the previous leg of our trip and the only means we had to pay for the room was cash (my travelling companion only had a debit card). Unsure of how to proceed, I called the Nikko before we left LAX and was assured that they would be able to work something out. Upon arriving at the hotel we were pleasantly greeted by the doorman and we proceeded to reception. There, we were met by Misumi who was absolutely wonderful. Within a few short minutes we worked out the payment and were given the access card to our room on the 19th floor. The whole hotel looked brand new, everything was clean and sparkling. I was surprised to learn that it had been there for many, many years. The elevators were fast and quiet. When we got to our room we were met with an amazing view of the city from our window. The bathroom was huge and the towels were luxurious. The bed was enormous and very comfortable with no shortage of pillows (I think I counted around 8 pillows in total). The room had a huge plasma screen TV with pleanty of channels (although we didn't make much use of it as we were there to see the city and catch up with friends). Internet access does come at a fee ($13 per 24 hrs) but it is fast and reliable. The room was clean, contemporary and comfortable. The Nikko is centrally located, just minutes from Union Square, Market street and public transport (Muni, BART and cable cars are just around the corner). We even walked to Chinatown for lunch a couple of times. There is a Starbucks downstairs and a restaurnat (Anzu). First time visitors to San Francisco should be aware of the locals that roam around the city. There are a lot of homeless people and pan handlers around the streets, but we learned from our friends who live in SF that this is common, particularly around tourist areas like Union Square, and these people (for the most part) are harmless. Any hotel around Union Square, whether it be 5 star or otherwise, would be subject to the same thing. It's just how San Francisco is and we were not really bothered by it at all. I must say that the service we received at this hotel was exceptional - far superior than any we have experienced at any hotel, anywhere. If you are planning to come to San Fran and want to stay in an amazing hotel in a central location, I have no trouble recommending the Nikko. I will most definitely stay here again.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Max013", "ReviewID": "UR21106664", "Content": "Stayed at the Nikko for 2 nights with friends after a cruise.

Being a bit short of time on the last morning, we ate in the hotel and what a rip-off. We both went for the 'continental breakfast'; the waitress grudgingly allowed us to look at the buffet (only sweet pastries on view) and when we ordered toast it was a good 10 minutes before the message came back that there was no brown bread, as requested, and the choice was white or sourdough. When it came, it was barely warm and the butter was rock hard. In the meantime, we had gone back to the buffet and each taken a small bowl of fruit (4 pieces of melon, in my case). My husband had to ask for a refill of his coffee (very unusual in the US) and I was not offered hot water for my small teapot.

First of all on check-in the staff were really helpful, as I had 2 colleagues who were going to be delayed but needed their rooms secured. This was sorted with no problems and I got checked-in very quickly. In my room I was dissapointed there was no mini-bar as had been advertised, but the room was pleasant enough, although dominated by the large bed, which itself was dominated by the huge amount of cushions. In fact, if there was an emergency you could strap them all to your body and jump out the window and have a pretty comfortable landing. I stuck most of them in a corner but the maid insisted on putting them back on the bed each day. As work paid I am less price sensitive and did order room service, where the menu prices weren't bad but the service charges make it very expensive. The food was good though and well presented. Internet was I believe $13 extra each day, which is not bad by some hotel standards but some may find too pricey. The room was clean and the en-suite perfectly acceptable. On several nights I hit the hotel bar for a glass of wine or two - the bar in the restaurant has the much better wine and on one afternoon when I popped in for a coke as I was thirsty they gave it to me free - and I also got a few glasses of wine free over my stay. All the staff I encountered were really helpful. It is reasonably well-located - with Union Square and much else walking distance (for an englishman - Americans will probably want to take a cab), although you should be careful as not far from the hotel (in the opposite direction from heading towards the square) there are some dodgy looking neighbourhoods with lots of liquor stores, etc. I'd stay here again, but would probably be tempted to try one a little higher up the rankings on this site. The ratings that give it 1 star though are way off the mark. I try to be fair with all my ratings, although my failing is that as it's often with work I don't pay enough attention to the costs.

Upon arriving at the hotel, the valet took our car and the front desk checked us in without delay. The lobby is outfitted in modern Japanese architecture; sleek and chic with lots of marble and water sculptures. We had booked an \"Imperial Club\" room for $268 which included a room on the 24th floor, free access to the Club Lounge and health club/pool area, and breakfast buffet at Anzu restaurant. The room itself was very nice with two super comfy queen beds (great mattress, nice soft Egyptian cotton sheets, and tons of pillows), a 42\" plasma TV, wet bar, coffee maker, robes, slippers, safe, and a dramatic view of the city skyline including a peek of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay. The bathroom was newly renovated with a contemporary white vessel sink and a television in the mirror behind it. Bathtub with separate shower and lots of towels and soaps, etc (Gilchrist & Soames). Overall, a very cozy and comfortable room with many modern upgrades and a terrific view. During our one night stay we used the indoor pool and workout facilities, which were both very nice and the pool in particular was appreciated by our son. The Imperial Club Lounge was a nice place to relax and enjoy a glass of wine and some cheese and crackers during the evening. The breakfast coupons at Anzu were a nice perk, the restaurant serves a decent buffet including breads, cereals, bagels, eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, potatoes, etc. Plenty to choose from and very filling. The location of the hotel was perfect for our quick getaway. We were able to walk a few short blocks to the Westfield Mall - a huge circular mall with the largest Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, White House Black Market, Victoria's Secret, Gap (across the street), etc., I've ever seen. Macy's was also a block or two away, as were several restaurants and convenience stores. Once the valet took the car, we never had to drive anywhere again until we checked out. Overall a very pleasant stay at a nice hotel. I didn't give it 5-stars because it wasn't completely up to the standards of a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons in terms of service, amenities, and decor.

Planned to stay in the city without a car so wanted a decent hotel in a central location. Hotel Nikko seemed to get lots of positive reviews from TripAdvisor and we initially booked a fully refundable internet rate on the hotel's website (approx. $200 a night). Later found a 30% off sale on Expedia of an Imperial Club floor room (floors 22-24) which gave access to a free (elaborate) continental breakfast in the 23rd floor lounge or the buffet in the hotel restaurant Anzu (normally $20 pp.), plus free beer, wine and soft drinks/cheese and crackers every evening from 5-7 pm (approx. $230 a night rather than $330). I booked it and never saw it offered again - half assumed it was a mistake it was such a good deal. At hotel check-in was informed that Expedia's message indicated one king bed rather than the two beds we needed. Helpful reception agent accommodated us and we spent the week in the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in - two queen beds, spacious, clean, modern (flat screen TV on the wall and a small one in the mirror of the bathroom!). Great view from the 23rd floor. NY Times delivered every morning. Can not say enough about the access to the 23rd floor lounge - so nice to walk across the hall to the lounge for a cup of coffee, read the paper, check the complimentary internet, etc. while rest of family slept. Great location - we bought week-long Muni passes giving unlimited use of cable cars, buses and streetcars. Since many bus lines pass w/i a block of Union Square we easily got anywhere we wanted to go. We used the historic \"F\" streetcars on Market a lot - takes you down to the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. The Powell/Market cable car is always jammed - go down towards the Ferry Bldg. to the start of the California Street cable car - no waiting! Wanted to do a one-day car rental (Sonoma, Muir Woods) and saw many Trip Advisor reviews not too positive of the Enterprise Car Rental w/i the Hotel Nikko. Checked around the day before we wanted to rent (on a Wednesday) and all the other car rental places near Union Square were sold out. I stopped by Enterprise and since I was staying there, they found a car for us - got it late morning but it was great, wonderful service from the manager. Also saw Trip Advisor comments about homeless in area - really was not a problem, we would just say \"no thanks\" and they would move on.

The views of SF from the floor to ceiling windows were stunning - Great for watching the mist roll in or the sun rise in the mornings.

At first I was a little surprised that there was a charge for using the spa as from my experience (At least in the UK) this is complimentary. However, if you intend to use the facilities it is definitely worth the small $10 charge - The pool, gym etc were all really clean and well maintained. The customer service was good especially from the concierge team who always seemed to be smiling when we walked past and genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs. I lost my cash card one morning and Michelle on concierge was absolutely fantastic in making sure I got the correct UK bank details and then calling to get my card cancelled.

We booked a room in their Imperial Club (upper floors, keycard access, etc) through Expedia, which turned out to be an OK deal on price. Location: Nikko is located one block south west of Union Square. The location is very good for reaching the stores around the square and also for reaching the interesting SoMa district, which includes among other the Yerba Buena Gardens and the SF Museum of Modern Art. There are lots of bums and panhandlers in the streets surrounding the hotel(the same applies for the next door Parc55, Hilton, Clift, etc.). We were not really bothered by this, but travellers made uncomfortable by this should opt for lodging on the east side of Union Square. The hotel's parking option is expensive. There are a number of parking options in the area, most at 30-40% lower daily rack valet rates than the hotel (but the hotel offers deals including parking which would reduce the price difference). Room: The Imperial Club room on the 22 floor was OK spacious, with a larger than usual bathroom (separate shower and tub). The room was carpeted (a minus in itself). There were some cigarette burn marks in the carpet and some detailing was a bit worn. Apart from that, it was decent enough. Although we had requested a non-smoking room, none were available upon check-in (we showed up at ca 2.45 PM). We accepted the room based on the front desks promise that it would not smell too bad, as even their smoking rooms \"were not usually smoked in\". We would describe the smell in the room as the smell found in the living room of your grandfather who smokes one or two a day. The minibar was stocked, the coffee on offer for the machine was good and the wireless internet was working. Some reviews of Nikko talk about mildew etc in the bathroom, we found none of this. It was well kept and 100% clean. Other: We had breakfast included in the rate, and could choose between the breakfast in the Imperial Club Lounge and the one served in the downstars Anzu restaurant. We tried both. The one served in the lounge is simpler (cereal, juice, coffee, croissants/danish, fruit salad) but is served in a more quiet setting, whereas the one below also features egg/bacon and a selection of Japanese breakfast staples. We did not try the gym or pool. The staff was helpful and courteous and all the common areas was spotless and well kept. Our opinion is that the Nikko offers good accomodation at a good spot. We would classify it as a 3,5-4 star hotel which at the $250 per night rate we paid offer good value for the money.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ynys Mon", "Title": "\u201cA great modern,comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "bronygraig", "ReviewID": "UR18760944", "Content": "The Nikko was a great place to stay.

There was a long queue to check in and a bit of a wait. In time I was shown the room. Obviously this is a Japanese hotel and Japanese make up a large proportion of the guests. Japanese tend to be heavy smokers. I had booked a non smoking room. It was obvious that someone had smoked in the first room I was shown which was a petite queen room. I therefore asked for another room. I noticed in any event that the furniture in the first room was very worn and the room did not have a good feel to it. My opinion of the room was that it was tatty with marked furniture which was not of the standard you expect from what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. The second room I was shown was in even worse condition. The furniture was even more tatty, the room smelt [but not of smoke - more like a faint burning plastic] and to my horror, I saw that a light socket by the entrance had been completely smashed in so that there was, in effect, a gaping hole in the wall. I was shocked as I was paying for, and expecting, a luxury hotel. The state of the room was totally unacceptable. I complained to the front desk about it and the gentleman who picked up the phone did not care less. I said the standard of the room was unacceptable - he said if I wanted a better room I would have to pay for it!! I asked to speak to the manager - they said he was in a meeting. I have never encountered such a rude individual on the front desk in all my years of travelling. In time the head of housekeeping came up. I said the state of the room was unacceptable and did they really think that a gaping hole in the wall was good enough in what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. She couldn't have cared less. At this point I left the hotel to return my rental car as it was due back, on the understanding that I would speak to the manager upon my return. When I came back the head of housekeeping had had maintenance in to change the light socket so that there was no gaping hole any more and had plugged in an air freshener. This was not good enough - I should have been upgraded to a better room immediately. As the phone in the room now appeared to be broken, and would no longer work, I had to go down to the front desk - to another queue and the manager was still \"in a meeting\". My experience at this hotel is that they could not care less about the satisfaction of their guests. The Hotel Manager should be sacked immediately for not having procedures in place for this kind of occurrence. At this point one of the front desk staff recognised that my treatment was unacceptable and offered to upgrade my room. However it was too late. I left the hotel and went across the road to the Hilton.

The hotel is nice, the rooms are nice--not spectacular--but nice. We did NOT like the fact that you had to PAY a separate fee to use the indoor gym and indoor pool! They really need to change that.

After working with the agency, we were booked for a 6 day/5 night stay in the Hotel Nikko. The hotel is nice . It's about 1 block to the cable car station and fairly close to Union Square. We drove to the hotel and ended up using their valet service. A word of caution if you have never been to San Francisco: it's a big city and parking tends to be a problem and expensive. It's no different here at this hotel. You can park in nearby city garages (which we were not sure how secure they were) so if you use the hotel's valet service, it's about $55/day. The food is quite expensive in the hotel so we opted for breakfast at the Starbucks downstairs or the little cafe accross the street on the O'Farrell side (I think that it was callled the Sunflower cafe). We decided to take in some time to walk around the sights of the city. We had kids with us, so instead of dealing with pricy restaurants, we went to the local grovery store and got fruit and snacks to take with us while we were out. There are plenty of \"kid friendly\" places to eat at in this city. This was easier than dining in the hotel's restaurant every night. The hotel has an indoor pool on the 5th floor. Apparently, you have to pay to use the health club/pool facilities and this was not included in the price of the room. We found this out when we went to the pool, and the lounge manager asked for our room and name. The beds are fairly comfortable and the rooms are sufficiently spacious.

Minutes from Chinatown on foot, and loads of restaurants (and shops) on your doorstep.

Really nice bar with mirrored roof which made for interesting photos!! Overall, may not have been delighted if we hadn't been upgraded, but a great hotel in a convenient location.

It was fleet week, and they had a large fireworks show over the bay that we could see from our window. As others have said, the rooms are somewhat small (but that is the norm for most hotels in the city) but they are well appointed. The bathroom was adequate but nothing special but there was good pressure and plenty of hot water in the shower. The rooms have plasma tvs and a Sony CD component system. However, there was no high def available and so all you could get from their satellite feed was the standard broadcast \"stretched\" to fill the Plasma screen. For most this would not be an issue because you don't stay at the Nikko to watch TV but our visit coincided with the Baseball Playoffs and I wanted to catch some of the games. It would have been great to have seen them in high def. Also, the stereo system is very nice but there is just a cheap speaker box above the Sony components which did not sound very good. There should be a speaker system built into the walls or ceiling to get the most out of the music. We didn't use the swimming pool or fitness center because they charged too much. That should be included at the room rates they charge. We also didn't eat in their restaurant but did have room service one night and found the quality and service excellent and not really overpriced at all. As others have commented, it's not necessary to pay extra for the buffet breakfast because there is a Starbucks downstairs and across the street is a fairly decent and reasonable coffee shop that serves breakfast. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Nikko. It was convenient to the buses we needed to take out to GG Park and we were also able to spend several hours over at the new mall that has Bloomingdales and Nordstroms. In the basement there is an excellent market that has many hot food offerings that are reasonably priced and looked very good. There are also several inexpesive restaurants to choose from. We ate here one night since I had a cold and had no taste buds so I didn't want to waste my money at the fine restaurants nearby. The Nikko is in a great location right near Union Square and close to the best shopping and also the theater district. The surrounding neighborhood can be a litte seedy if you walk down the wrong streets but overall this area is far improved from what I remember it being in the '70s when I lived in San Francisco. They didn't call it the Tenderloin because there were good steak restaurants nearby.

Taxi ride fare from Oakland to Nikko, (in financial district) was $52 with out tip. It was around $55 coming back. PUlled up to hotel and was greeted by bellhop, expressing hellos etcc.. Very nice appeal. You then go up an escalator to the next level to check in. It is a massive open lobby, with all marble ,whites, and massive area to read, sit, and people watch. Check in was a breeze and very polite, all Asian staff, and always smiles. Arrived at 3 pm, so this will probably be why check in was done so fast. Was offered a king, but not yet ready, or a ready queen. Took the queen as we needed to get a shower before we went out for dinner.The elevators are plenty. 6 to be exact, and waiting was never an issue. Our room was on the small side, having a bath/shower, all marble, but the pinkish tile and tub could have used some updating. Our room had a plasma, 2 safes, mini bar, coffee station, raio/cd player, phone in bath. The mini bar is triggeed to charge you by weight, so if you pick out a bottle of Coke, and put it back, you might as well drink it($4). Very well stocked. Used about $20 in room beverages. The bed was very soft, and made up very nicely. Many pillows etc... The air worked fine and heat was not needed. On the thermostat are 2 bottons. 1 for do not distrub, and 1 for making up the room. By pressing your choice, will make a small light turn on outside of your room to be seen by the maid service. Nice touch, and classy compared to paper door hangers.

What I found when I arrived is a hotel that is very uneven and inconsistent in its upkeep, maintenance and standards. The lobby is unmemorable and feels like the entrance to an office building. The walls and floors are mostly cold/80's looking white marble and brass, and a slightly random collection of chairs and sofas. The hallways on the room floors are a mixed bag - attractive new carpeting but old, dated flourescent lighting/wallpaper. I was booked into a \"deluxe king\", which apparently translates to(according to the fire escape floor map) one of four of the smallest rooms on the floor. Technically everything was there that was supposed to be (king bed, desk, easy chair/ottoman), but it left very little room to walk around. For exapmple, the drawers in front of the bed, when open, touch the bed. As I look through the candid traveler photos on here, it appears that some of the rooms in this category may be slightly larger, which is annoying (I believe all rooms in a category should be comparable). The remodeled things in the room are nice, such as an amazing bed that rivals the all the \"heavenly\" style beds at the big chains, and the massive plasma TV. The accent wall behind the bed also looked recently redone and stylish, and the climate control system was modern and easy to use. However, the room was only half-renovated -- the carpets are clearly 20 years or older, stained and dirty, and the bathroom is one of the sorriest/ugliest ones I've seen at a 4-star hotel in a long time. The pink tile on the floor reminded me of my high school locker room - old, ugly and grotty. The fixtures on the sink and the lighting are very old-school as well. The tub is small, and there was no seperate shower as advertised on the website (I guess they mean it when they say \"most\" and not \"all\" rooms). The desk and drawers were pretty large, but also pretty knicked and scratched. Also the \"desk chair\" is just a regular table chair, very short and stiff and uncomfortable. The lighting was poor and mostly very dated looking. The light on the desk, for example, is a classic late 80's banker's style light that doesn't really illuminate any of the actual desk. The lampshades on the bedside lamps are pretty knicked and torn in places. All in all it's a weird contrast of new (plasma, bed) and old (carpets, bathroom, lighting). It almost seems like they started remodeling and then ran out of money before they finished. A side note: The TV channel selection was very underwhelming - only one premium channel (HBO) and not very many regular ones (15 or so).

Japanese breakfast & restaurant are excellent!! The staff is kind. Central location in the heart of SF, close to Union Square and Chinatown. Rooms are clean. Nice view (if you upgrade to deluxe). They sell very convenient international phone cards in the business center. We stayed for 5 days and enjoyed our staying. NEGATIVE FACTS Concierge charges are not transparent. The concierge double charged us fot theatre tickets (330 USD for two tickets for the musical 'The Jarsey Boys', which would cost 160 USD if we bought them directly at the Curran Theatre, just two blocks away from the hotel). When asked for an explanation, they say they use a brooker.. So I would recommend never to use the concierge to reserve events or tours when staying at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco. Any extras are unreasonably expensive. A regular double is actually a single room (we needed to upgrade to a deluxe room). Continental Breakfast for two is 50-60 USD.

The room I had was clean; I found the size of the room to be acceptable. The bed was comfortable although way too many pillows which I had to cram in to the closet so they were out of the way, a small complaint really. The bathroom was a nice size, with a phone next to the toilet that I found to be a bit odd. The plasma TV was nice but there was nothing on to watch, the in-house movie selection was poor but that could be down to there not being many good movies about at the moment. I ended up watching stuff that I had brought with me on my laptop. With the right leads you might be able to hook your laptop up to the TV as there are the right plugs on the side but not sure how that would work, worth a try next time. The wireless internet worked well and I found the speed to be fine. One issue I did have with it though was if you forgot to turn off your wireless connection off on your computer before shutting it down, it effected by laptop when turning back on. Took up to an hour for it to go through the start up options rather than the usual 30-60 seconds. The view I had was not great, but not bad, overlooked the Hilton on the other side of the street, will ask for a better view next time. Room service was quick but the choice on the menu was quite limited and the food from room service was not the best in the world. The breakfast buffet was excellent value, you get a coupon to use if booked in to a Nikko Floor room (the cost of which I am sure is worked in to your rate) but there was an very good choice of food and set you nicely for the day. You can use the mini-bar fridge to store your personal items such as milk or whatever but phone the front desk first to tell them you need to have space in the mini-bar for this so that you are not charged for taking stuff out of it. I just used ice in the ice bucket and kept my carton of milk in that which worked fine, you just have to remember to put new ice in first thing in the morning and then again in the evening. Complaints: Windows did not open, which in other hotels in the area they do, the Hilton over the street where I have stayed before. Quality and choice of food via room service.

I tried this hotel for the first time for a last minute trip as my usual option wasn't available. I usually stay at nicer B&B's or business type hotels (Courtyards, Starpoints).

While my company will pay for extras, I just hate being \"padded\" all the time for things that should be included in the room rate. I'd rather they charge a higher rate if needed, than use a lower one (~$200 plus/night) to get me in so they can soak me later. What fees? Extra $45/day to park (okay, I guess that's part of being downtown, but still a bit steep); $10/day just to use the treadmill or any part of the gym, $10 day for internet. $6 for the bottle of water by my bed, $18 to use extra bath products placed in my room (shampoo, lotions, etc). When I checked in, I had to quickly shower before going to afternoon meetings...there was only one small bar of soap and small bottle of shampoo, conditioner, lotion in the bath. I used them up later that night after a shower from a run...barely anything left for the morning. I suppose I could call housekeeping for more instead of \"buying\" the package for $18 that is there out of convenience, but why should I have to go through all that. This level of hotel should stock plenty of bath products complimentary. I felt like a profit center rather than a guest. Another big difficulty was they were switching from ethernet to wifi during my stay. I have to have good internet access for business. 1st day ethernet worked great...next day it was all canceled and the wifi was nearly worthless for the rest of my stay. The switched from ethernet to wifi without a buffer of time during the switch. The internet was completely unavailable for half a day. Room service wouldn't offer anything outside of the limited menu despite the nice Japanese restaurant downstairs. (tried to get a plate of sushi, but could only get rolls) Room was okay but boring...some of the furniture was a bit beat up and carpet worn. The plasma tv was nice but wires were coming out all over the dresser attached to a cd player that looked very unfinished for a nicer hotel. Looked like a student's dorm room.

(get a Muni pass; $18 for 3-day pass vs the $5.00 one-way trip without it.) There's a Starbucks in the lobby and a great Asian style restaurant there, The Anzu, but its expensive. The concierges here were awesome and helpful. Hilda was life saver with reservations for hard to get into restaurants and tours on the fly. Rooms nicely appointed but small. Doubles are larger`than the king rooms. Plasma TVs, great ventilation (no foggy mirrors in bathroom) but there was a mildew problem in both tub areas in the 2 rooms we rented. Overall very clean however. The linens, top of line and plush, comfortable beds and great pillows. No safes or refrigerators in rooms, though. Rooms quiet. They charge $10/day for the health club and pool unless you stay on the club level. (Club Nikko). As with most hotels in SF, parking was $40/day. Some as high as $60/day. Leave the car home. Too hard to get around and park. Use public trans with a pass.You'll thank me later! Overall, loved the city, hated the huge homeless problem. This puts a stain on the whole feel of the city and can't understand why the taxpayers don't press this issue. Very little visible police presence even in tourist areas. This was shameful. For fun, do the night tour at Alcatraz. This was the best and worth the extra. Dress warm, its cold out there. Skip Pier 39 except the sea lions. Visit the Ferry Building. Nice shops and good food. Try the Red Door. Take a ferry to Saulsalito for a few hours or lunch. You'll want to buy a home here! But be prepared, a \"fixer upper\" will set you back 2-3 million! But what a gorgeous place! It's sunny there with the most awesome views of San Francisco. Had to pry my wife's fingers off the dock railing to get her to go back to the hotel! We wanted to stay there! You can't go to SF and not visit Muir Woods and then do a day in Sonoma and Napa. This was awesome fun. Nice, small, friendly wineries. If you're a \"big red\" fan you have to try out the Viansa Winery in Sonoma. This is an offshoot of the Sebastianis and tasted some of the best big reds ever! I couldn't drink (or carry) enough! Muir Woods for the redwoods. It was surreal, quiet and majestic. No one was even talking here. It was so peaceful and the ride up was super. If you love nature, you haven't seen anything like this. Deer wandered by as I was snapping a picture of a brook. Remember to dress warm. In June temp was in 50's in the morning and foggy alot of the time. You'll have great food here.

I seriouly researched a number of hotels on the internet and phoned them for questions. Nikko seemed like the best value for location, size of room, trendiness and price. The location was good. Close to Union Square, public transport, restaurants and shopping. And from the entrance, lobby, and front desk appeared to be nice, clean and modern. Our room was a different story. The size of the room was not bad, considering most hotel rooms in San Francisco seem to be on the small side. I think we had a Delux Queen room. The bathroom was small, fit for really just one person. My biggest complaint was that the bathroom was pretty grungy. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they had what used to be white tile grouting on the bathroom floor and sink, that was so dirty it was dingy dark grey. It made me not want to walk barefoot in the bathroom. You could still see where it was the original white in the corners. We had to ask for extra bathmats to put down to walk barefoot in the bathroom. The tub was also dingy. The carpet gave me the creeps too. Also, each day that the housekeeping staff \"cleaned\" the bathroom, there were stray hairs left behind in the white sink and tub. They clearly were not from my boyfriend or I, wrong color. I am not super picky, but a clean bathroom is something I would expect from a 4-star hotel. I could live with a not so perfect bathroom if it was at a motel, because at least then I would know I was getting what I paid for. And it rubbed me the wrong way that they wanted guests to pay for extra toiletries left in the bathroom. And you had to pay to use the pool and workout facilities, which is kind of cheap of them. An they were not so great anyway. Our bed was large and comfortable. A few other reviewers had mentioned that they could not get the internet in the room to work. We had the same experience. Complimentary in-room internet access was one of the reasons I chose this hotel, but my boyfriend could not get it to work from his company laptop, which he never has problems with anywhere else. The front desk and IT person they connected him to were no help. We never got it to work. Upon checkout, they attempted to charge us about $40 for mini-bar items, but we hadn't touched a thing. They took the charges off without protest, but there was another customer checking out the same time as us with the same complaint. Overall, it was too expensive for what we got. If the rooms are going to be grubby anyway, I might as well only pay for a Best Western. We will not stay there again.

I was given breakfast vouchers (which I never had time to use) and free internet access. The rate was a special 15% off for a 3 or more day stay. I was working in Oakland and wanted to find a hotel in the city, close to the Bart so I could get to work quickly, and in a lively evening area. Location: The hotel is located in a great spot. It is just a two block walk from the Powell Bart station, a five minute walk. It took me about 20 minutes (4 stops) on the Bart to reach the Oakland 12th Street Bart Station/City Centre. Between the hotel and the Bart I passed by typical stores found in the mall. Urban Outfitters, Aldo shoes, Sephora, Forever 21, etc etc. And the Powell station also has a entrance to the mall where Nordstrom and Bloomingdales resides among other upscale stores. If you're looking for shopping, this is the place. Stores close around 9pm so there is people walking around until late. Scattered around are some restaurants and late night pubs. A three or four blocks away is Union Square with even more shops and restaurants. Hotel Room: I checked in rather early at 8am. The King room I had requested was not ready and they gave me a room with two full beds and said the room would be larger than the King room. Upon entering, there was a small hallway which ended at a mirrored sliding closet. Bearing left and a short hallway, I found a large bathroom on the left, a vanity mirror at the end an the bedroom on the right. The bathroom was huge yet a bit outdated. Not so much that the bathroom was bad, but it certainly didn't match the scale of the rest of the room. The tiles were like high school gym tiles. The tub and shower were separated and the walk in shower was pretty large and glass incased. The bathroom had a little travel pack of toiletries on the first evening. I packed it away but it was never replenished. The vanity mirror was a cool addition. There was a pull out stool and three way mirror. Great for a girl doing her makeup. The room was very modern and despite earlier reviews, the carpet looked new. Keep in mind that the higher level rooms probably were renovated before the regular rooms. The bed was extremely comfortable. There was turndown service every evening and a Nikko chocolate was placed on the bed with a small fortune card. The flat screen TV (I think 42 inches) was on a pivoting stand so that I could turn it and watch from the bathroom in the morning. There was no HD reception but I didn't really care since I barely watched TV. There is also a dated 5 disc cd changer and receiver in the room that pumps out music from a solo speaker in the wall above the speaker system. Doesn't sound great but better than a clock radio at least. The room was directly across from the elevators but I never heard any noise. It might have had to do with the two hallways that I had to pass in the room before getting to the bedroom. When I arrived they were cleaning rooms on the other side of the elevators and those rooms didn't have the hallways, they opened up into the room like typical hotel rooms. I noticed those rooms were King beds only. I had a view of the city buildings and don't know if they have any overlooking the bay. Lobby: The lobby appeared very modern, bright, and clean. I personally like the modern look as oppossed to the lacy and floral decor so it was to my taste. There was a waterfall that ran along the stairs that led down to a Starbucks that was connected to the Nikko lobby. As a female, I was never accosted by any bums around the hotel as others have mentioned. It is obvious though that going in one direction leads to busy streets filled with people, towards the BART, and the other direction leads to darker and more desolate streets. Overall: I would definitely stay here again if the rate was as good as I received. Other recommendations: I have stayed at the Hilton Financial near Chinatown before.

Without exception, the staff was very helpful, smiling and gracious. We went to our room on the 8th floor. It was small, but not ridiculously so, although from the floor map it was probably one of the smallest on the floor. The bed was wonderful - very clean, fresh (no bleach smell), and comfortable. The color scheme in the room was neutral, calm and relaxing. The large, flat-panel TV was very cool, although I agree with the other reviewer who said that it should have been high-definition. The rug was stained, and I found a nasty dried-up spider on it, and the room just looked a bit tired in general. The bathroom was a complete disappointment. It was like a Holiday Inn from the '90s. The fixtures were so generic, there was mildew on the tiles, and the floor of the tub was stained. They really should put some money into upgrading the bathrooms. People expect it nowadays. Possibly most disappointing is the fact that no mention was ever made of the $10/day charge to use the pool/gym. I guess it's not a really big deal, it just seems deceptive to me, and I don't like that. This hotel is probably like many others, in that your experience may vary highly depending on what room you get. We got one of the worse rooms in the hotel, and I was not overly impressed. I'm sure the suites are beautiful and spacious, but they're beautiful and spacious in any reputable hotel. I'm more impresssed with hotels who go out of the way to make the experience a pleasure for EVERY guest, not just Lindsay Lohan. Overall, I won't be clamoring to return here.

Our work project was based in the hotel, and we mostly stayed in the hotel. The location seemed central and good (although we did no sight-seeing). The hotel is extremely popular with the Japanese (everyone here seems bilingual, and there are options to have Japanese v-mail on the phone). About half the guests are Japanese. Some fun touches (fortune cards left with turndown service). The rooms are relatively small (I was in room 2024), but fairly well equipped -- flat screen TV (not high def), stereo system (not just radio), nice clock, shower stall and separate bathtub, coffee maker in room, relatively inexpensive minibar. Bed was comfortable. Room seemed a little tired in some ways (tile on bathroom floor aging), but was quite clean and acceptable. There was no bathrobe supplied, and towels were a little scratchy. The bathroom was actually extremely large compared to the room. Lobby may seem sterile to some, but high-tech, sleek, and modern to others. I was in the latter camp. The healthclub on 5th floor is well-equipped. It costs $10 per 24 hour use. There is a lap pool and good equipment. If you get a room on one of the \"suite\" floors (for which special access with a card is necessary), you have access to a lounge where there is free breakfast, beer/wine in the late afternoon, cookies at night. Service is extremely good and helpful. If you called to have something done, it happened immediately, and the staff was very friendly. This is not the Four Seasons, but you aren't paying for that.

The location, being close to Union Square and the Tenderloin, can be a bit dicey for neophytes or those from less urban origins, but I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable. I've also recently stayed at the Parc 55 just a block away, as well as the Mark Hopkins and the Fairmont a number of years ago, so I have some basis for comparison. My room was small but very well done. I'd have to say that the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept on in a hotel. There was a large flat-screen TV in my room, which was a nice surprise. There was a large dresser with lots of drawer space and drawers that did not stick (a hotel pet peeve of mine).

The first thing that strikes you about the Nikko is the beautiful marble lobby. With its winding staircases and plush seating, it is one of the best lobbies in SF. Far better then comporable hotels such as Serrano and Hilton Financial. We booked the Nikko Floor rooms. The rooms are above average. They are the epitome of four star rooms. Deluxe amenities, oversize bathrooms with seperate shower, luxurious king bed, and wonderful \"small touches\". Small touches like a room light (which illuminates the majority of the room) right next to the bed. One touch and your room is all lit up. The rooms have a small honor bar that really utilizes it's space with soda, beer, wine, and snacks. Honor bar prices were very reasonable. Room was very clean as well. Kudos to Housekeeping. The views were very good, with peeks of the Bay Bridge and the water, and a full view of Union Square. Downside to the rooms, like most SF hotels, are the size. It is 420 Square feet, but a significant majority of that was bathroom. Since it was just my girlfriend, I didn't mind this very much, but I could see how a family of four would feel cramped.

Nikko really goes the extra mile for their guests.

The only reason this hotel doesn't get an \"excellent\" rating from me is that it isn't perfect, yet it is still a nice hotel. Tthe rooms are slightly tired looking. For example, the carpet is a little threadbare in places, the towels are not the highest quality, the t.v. is a little smaller than what most modern four star hotel rooms have, toiletry items are not highest quality. These are not really complaints, however, just an explanation as to why I didn't give this fine hotel the highest rating possible.

When we needed help or had a question the staff was more than happy to help us, with excellent service, but other than that they let us enjoy our stay without being bothered. One thing...maid service didn't turn the beds down and we had to ask for extra towels, as there was only one in the bathroom. The room wasn't olympic sized, but it's the perfect size for two people. We had ample room for our luggage and such and we never felt cramped. We were on the 18th floor, but unfortunately our view was of the hotel across the street.

I have stayed in this hotel in the past and enjoyed it immensely, so I was looking forward to a return visit. With a rainy January predicted, I looked specifically for a downtown hotel with an indoor pool. The only matches I could find were this hotel, Courtyard by Marriott, and the Palace. Of the three, this one is the most conveniently located to Union Square. Since my last visit, while this hotel is still nice, it is in need of some upgrading. I noticed areas of the room that could benefit from a fresh coat of paint. The mattresses are a bit soft. I personally prefer a firmer mattress. It is a pillow top that is just a bit soft for my tastes. The entertainment center could use a replacement, with space for a larger television. It's been a while since I've stayed in a hotel of this caliber with only a 19\" television. Because we booked this place specifically for the pool, our kids had a great time. The pool does seem to have some issues with temperature, though. The first night, the pool needed some warming up. The other days it was fine. The hot tub ranged from lukewarm to very hot. Some fine tuning on the spa temperature would be great. The sauna was in working condition, but there was this big bath in the locker room that I think is meant to be large Japanese-style communal bath that was non-functional. There is a room in the locker room called a kamaburo that I think is supposed to be a warm moist sauna, but either it wasn't working, or it's meant to be something else. It looks just like a room with rocks and a plank slab to lay on in a room that isn't particularly warm. If I had to do it over again, I would have probably selected one of the other hotels. The Courtyard is rated higher, but is in a more inconvenient location. The Palace is relatively conveniently located, but also more expensive.

First impressions were good - nice lobby & lounge area, clean looking, nice waterfall, chic and modern. Check in was pretty simple, and we optimistically headed up to our room - 8th floor, so a bit lower than we'd have liked. To begin with, the room was small.... the smallest we've ever stayed in. It was so small, that I called the front desk to make sure we did indeed get the 'deluxe' room. Anything below that could easily be called the 'closet' room. The whole room, including bathroom, was maybe 300 sq. ft, and that's probably being generous. They must like things to be small. There's a huge armoir at the foot of the bed, with the TV cabinet doors closed. Big enough to fit at least a 32\" TV, so I'm thinking 'cool, good size TV'. I opened the doors to find a 19\" TV in there, dwarfed by the massive cabinet it sat in! The bed was thoroughly mediocre. A king size bed, but a bit on the stiff side. The pillows were small, not very fluffy, and the sheets were white and just, well, plain. Not really rough, not really soft. Kind of Motel 6-ish. The biggest complaint was that the room was too grubby. Stains on the carpet, chipped paint on the doors and door frames, peeling wallpaper in corners of the bathroom. They made the mistake of using white tile grout in the bathroom floor, so all of the grout in the middle of the room was a dirty grey color. If you're going to use white grout, you're going to have to clean it! Same with the bottom of the tub - looked like lots of people have used it since it was cleaned. The shower was more like a greenhouse mister than a shower, thanks to the low water pressure and the shower head. Overall, we had high expectations, given the rating as a 4-star. No way. No way, not even close. Mediocre 3-star at best. Not to be completely negative, the location was good, near Union Square, with lots of good restaurants within a couple of blocks (which means short walks in the cold weather, and only a few homeless people to dodge). The one thing about all of this is that we booked the room through Travelocity, not through the hotel directly, so we got a great room rate.

As we approached the front desk to check in, the man behind the counter looked at us angrily and said, \"uh uh uh\" and motioned that we could not come any closer to the counter because he was in the middle of something else.

My wife whispered to me, \"we can't even go near the front desk?\" Finally, we were allowed to check in. The person that checked us in behaved somewhat arrogantly and condescendingly.

Because you realize sir that it is only one-thirty in the afternoon and our check-in time is three o'clock, so you will be lucky if I can find you a room at all.\" Needless to say, my initial impression was not positive. We took the elevator up to our room on the 20th floor. We had upgraded from a Petite Queen to a Deluxe room for a few dollars per night and then used our miles to upgrade to a Junior Suite. The room was spectacular and when we arrived there was a bottle of champagne and a card from the management wishing us a happy anniversary! The facilities were all above average. The room was very clean and in good condition although the fixtures, furniture, appliances, etc. had probably not been updated in 10-15 years. The fitness center and pool were also very nice and I have no complaints. Again, it was not the latest equipment, but everything was clean and in working order.

Well, it would have been included had we ordered \"the continental breakfast\", but since we checked the box for \"Japanese breakfast\" we had to pay an additional $80! The breakfast was tasty, but it cost more than the fabulous dinner we enjoyed the night before! Anyhow, we found our breakfast coupons later that day and figured out that we should have gone to the restaurant ANZU for breakfast or ordered a continental breakfast through room service. So I explained our plight to the front desk and they said they couldn't help me...I was S.O.L. and had to fork over the money for breakfast. I said, \"well okay, it was partly our mistake so could you just deduct the cost of the continental breakfast from our outrageously priced Japanese breakfast?\" ANSWER: No! So having seen Hotel Nikkos stock in our book appreciate at the rate of an internet IPO in the late '90s, I also witnessed it crash like one that got audited after cooking the books. So I left to enjoy the city again, rode the cable cars, did some shopping, ate some seafood at fisherman's wharf and gradually forgot about my breakfast mishap. We returned to the Nikko for an absolutely fabulous dinner at ANZU. I had aged beef served Japanese style and my wife had sushi. We were both very pleased with our dinner and the service at ANZU. Our opinion of Nikko moved up once again only to come sliding back down a few moments later at the concierge, who was sipping champagne with her friends (who had stopped by the hotel to razz her about having to work while the rest of her friends were celebrating something). We asked the concierge if she knew some good places to get a drink or if there were Japanese karaoke boxes in the area and she said that she couldn't make any recommendations. Imagine a concierge that is too busy with her friends to mention a tavern in the area or open the phone book to make a call about karaoke...So we had a couple drinks at the pub across the street and enjoyed the rest of the evening there. We checked out the next day and were fortunate to get a Japanese staff. Having lived in Japan I'm well aware that it has many drawbacks, but outstanding customer service is not one of them. She took care of everything efficiently, accepted our air miles without incident, and even discounted our room service breakfast. So our trip ended on a pleasant note and I can give the Hotel Nikko San Francisco an above-average rating without any hesitancy. Perhaps we had some misguided expectations that Hotel Nikko in San Francisco would be able to provide us with the amazing customer service that you receive at Hotel Nikko in Japan. In fact, the service at the Nikko was not bad by normal standards. It is in a good location and the facilities were clean and MOST of the staff were highly professional. So I can recommend staying at the Hotel Nikko, but I would avoid it if you have short patience.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3633623", "Content": "We stayed on the Nikko Floor.

They managed to get our rooms very close together which was a special request. The rooms were spacious and very clean. I am picky about beds but found the beds to be comfortable. The Hotel is no longer brand new but our rooms had lovely wallpaper and beautiful marble in the bathrooms. For the price we paid, we could not have done better in downtown San Francisco. We liked it better than the Fishermen's Wharf Hyatt where we stayed two years ago. (Being from Seattle, I require a coffee pot in the room and this bugged me about the Hyatt--no coffee pots in the room but Nikko had little coffee makers. And we received a newspaper everyday--I love that.) There are street people but I am from Seattle so we are used to this and it did not affect our enjoyment of the city and we walked everywhere. The location is perfect. I am also picky about noise. I could not stand a night we spent in the fancy Fairmont Olympic in downtown Seattle because of traffic noise. But the Hotel Nikko is very quiet. My only complaint is the windows were really dirty on the outside so the lovely view of the city was like looking through mud.

They sent the head of housekeeping to the room, who finally agreed with me and the front desk placed me on one of the Nikko floors (the top two floors of the hotel). The room was spacious and quiet and the furnishings and color scheme are quite nice. Bathrooms are 3 separate rooms: a toilet room, a bathtub and shower room, each with a door and an open double sink area. For the money, stay on the Nikko floors.

Once your there, the fee for valet parking is a little on the high side, but again this is San Francisco (not that charming) We were fortunate enough to be able to upgrade to a king suite. Wasn't too sure what to expect: Contemporary - Japanese???? The rooms were an interesting mix of contemporary furniture (clean lines, muted colors) with a obvious asian flare. The upgrade to a suite was a \"good thing\" as we had a corner suite with more than enough room for a party of two. The rooms had floor to ceiling windows with great views of the hotel across the street - the Hilton. Bathrooms were spacious and had all of the \"fixins\" a bathroom should have (complimentary shampoo/condition, lotion, mouthwash, etc) and free robes. The beds were surprisingly comfortable. The staff was professional and unintrusive. Cleaning staff kept the room clean and welcoming (chocolates on the pillow after the turndown). All in all, a nice place to call home for a weekend.
