Whilst the staff were helpful the facilities were poor and needed serious work. We were put in a dodgy room down the back which was dirty, damp smelling and with a bed that was incredibly saggy. It was also next to the pool bar which was noisy to all hours. We complained and were happily moved to a room away from the pool which was cleaner and quieter, This is a cheap hotel and it is difficult to see what it was like on the net. This would be the place to stay if you were drunk every night and didn't care about facilities as it was close to the main Kuta drag.

Its in a handy (but very busy) location although once you enter the grounds of the hotel you can forget about the busy street outside as the gardens are pretty. The staff are friendly and the massages, manicures and pedicures that the 2 ladies do in the garden are great and really cheap.The rooms are basic but the hotel is very cheap (\u62e214 a night bed and breakfast for 2 of us).Reception have a list of DVDs and when you request one, you can watch it in your room - it is shown in all rooms at the same time so if someone else beats you to it, you will have to watch their choice of film.Our one problem was that we booked the hotel car to take us to the airport at 6am but when we went to reception they told us that although the car was there, the driver didn't come on duty until 7am!!! Why did they let us book the car? At that time in the morning there are no taxis on the street so one of the hotel staff managed to contact a friend of his who had an old battered taxi and he took us to the aiport (but charged us the same as we were to pay for the hotel car) - at that point we weren't in a position to argue.All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Barong.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR187846822", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Angie-Bruce"}, {"Content": "the loud drunken louts hotel My wife and I have just returned from Bali.

Initially there was 12 of us and another 2 arrived later that night when the hotel was in Karaoke mode out the back in the restaurant. It was absolutely teeming down with rain but there was about 40 people in total all having a great time. The location of the hotel is brilliant, about 5 minutes walk each way out the front to the beach or the night life. The staff are very friendly and our older adult son  his friends had poor old Wayan running up and down the stairs all night with drinks from the back bar ( open 24hrs). Wayan or Wang as they called him became great friends with us all.The breakfast was nothing special but was adequate and if you want, there are numerous restaurants within a stones throw that have cheap breakfast.Some of the rooms are better than others, so don't be afraid to ask for another room if you're not happy with what you get. It's basically just a room to sleep for a few hours. The back area is better than the front and you feel miles away from the hustle  bustle out there.We moved to another good hotel ( already pre booked )near the Waterbom Park after 7 days which was much bigger and closer to the beach, but lacked the friendliness  closeness.

Because the Barong is the Best) and close to all the nightlife, shopping,beach,cafes).Bali is my second home, and the Barong is where i call home when staying there.Now on any chance you decide to book, with the Barong...... REQUEST a room at the rear section as it is Newer than the front. Note the pool and swim up bar is excellent. Speaking of bar......If you do stay there, Ask for Georgie and tell him MR.Browne sent you ......! can't miss him, as he's the bloke behind the bar, named bar Captain, OH.........and the brightest white smile that you have ever seen.Hope this helps your decision making, have fun and who knows ya might just bump into me aswell.", "Date": "Feb 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR514654572", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bwb123"}, {"Content": "Great Value, Fun Crowd My partner and I stayed at Hotel Barong in Dec 2005. We'd previously being staying at the Balisani Padma in Legian for a week (crap no atmosphere, no people, too many staff yet crap service - and I'm no princess! I dont need much) when we'd had enough and stumbled upon the Barong. Only wish we moved there earlier.There are two areas. The front pool with rooms surrounding this, then the back pool. Although you're in the heart of Kuta, you are in a lush area with a 24 hour pool bar, there are always people about. The back area is definately better to stay in. The front section is too enclosed and it makes for dark damp rooms.The room itself was very clean -although the 1st one we got was in a dark area and had a musky smell to it. So we got one on the 2nd floor over looking the pool with sunlight. It was great. Clean, a tv with movies running on a loop for those who need a chillout session awayf rom the hustle and bustle (you can request movies for the evening at front desk) There were a few Aussie yobbos about, harmless, having a good time. Occasionally embarrasing. That aside, We did meet some great people there, someone to hang with at the bar, have a laugh or play cards on thebalcony.Breakfast was included, not the gourmet bufffet you'd get at the Padma, but for the price you pay it was good. Main staples were: Toast, eggs any style, fruit, pastries, dredful coffee, sometimes bacon, pancakes, always an indonesian dish, either rice or noodles - YUM! Go local I say.All in all - it was a great experience, great value - haggle at the front desk. We paid USD$25 a night with breakfast.
