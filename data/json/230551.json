The rooms are modern and spacious, however there is no air-con in the rooms so you need to leave the windows open to get any bit of air into the rooms. As the weather was very warm while we were in Berlin (24C-30C) we left the windows open all day and all night! Location wise, the hotel is very conveniently located to Osbahnhof station (about 2 minute walk). This station is on the train line from the airport and only 1 stop away from the main train station (where you can get trains to Reichstag, Zoo, etc). It took us a few minutes to find the hotel when we got to the train station because the hotel is not on a main street. The area itself seemed safe and was very quiet. The breakfast was good, plenty of choice and plenty of food. The breakfast room is quite small given the size of the hotel though. There is a large garden with tables and chairs for guests to use. The bar is very expensive but I guess that's standard for all hotel bars! There is a Lidl and numerous other shops located in the train station. The only complaint we had about the hotel was that we requested a double room when booking and when we arrived we were booked into a twin room. We mentioned this to the person who checked us in and he said that our booking had come through on their system as a twin room and there were no double rooms available for the duration of our stay so we couldn't be moved. However, the next morning we mentioned to a lady at reception that we were booked in a twin room but had requested a double. She checked our booking on their system and said we should have been booked into a double room and changed rooms for us straight away!

Some rooms (not all) have access to the T-Mobile hotspot network which costs around \u20ac5 per hour. I did know this when I booked the hotel - but if they did have free wireless it would have made our lives a little easier. - The hotel isn't in an area with restaurants, bars, shops etc. The train station is very close (which has the usual fast food venues and a supermarket). The hotel seems to be in an area with homes and offices. I prefer to stay in a hotel that's within a 5 min walk of restaurants, cafes and shopping. The neatest cafe strip is apparently Boxhagener Platz which was 1.5 - 2km away. We didn't go there. - The bathroom does not have a door and the shower is a clear cylinder in the room. There is no privacy. This was no problem for us...but might be VERY awkward for some guests. - Irons are not available in the rooms.

They also let us print out a 14 page document for free. - Pretty good location - 5min walk to the trains - Good cheap markets nearby. - Very quiet. bad: - Strange square pillow design that I just could not get comfortable on. When asking for a different pillow which was a little harder at the front desk, they had none. - I think it is standard with European hotels but wireless internet was way too expensive - 8 Euros an hour! Lots of free wi-fi cafes in Berlin if you bring your laptop. - Bathroom is awkward - It has an open window to the bedroom, lacking a little privacy. - Room was a little tiny for a 4 star hotel. - no air conditioning and was quiet warm despite it being cool outside. Could control this by having the windows open. - It was advertised a double bed on our booking, unfortunately it was just 2 singles pushed together. It made it very hard for me and my girlfriend to get cozy with the big split down the middle. So all in all, I don't think this is a 4 star hotel.

The mini-bar was well stocked and the room had the usual internet, international TV etc which we also did not use. The breakfast was really varied, really good quality and fresh, serving a range of hot and cold items including the usual eggs, meats and fruits/cereals, savoury and sweet and a great range of drinks including to my satisfaction some vitamin drink tablets. The only slight draw back although it didnt bother us too much was that the lovely shower was over a bath that could be seen by a large glass panel from the bedroom, so unless you purposely averted your eyes or lied on the bed you could look at the other person showering.

We were in Berlin over the Xmas Holidays and returned home on New Year's Eve. Whilst this hotel is very stylish, chic and very clean we did experience only minor problems. Mainly the heat!! The hotel room was too hot and we had to push the window wide open even though it was below zero outside! The bed squeaked badly whenever you moved around. The gym was very disappointing with very little in the way of equipment and also the heat was on full-blast. The corridors were dark and you needed to put the light back on if you were walking through. It was like a maze to find the hotel rooms - more a fault in the design of the hotel. The hotel is built around a courtyard which in the summer I imagine is quite pretty. The hotel is also located next too some Conference Facilities but as this was in the middle of the Christmas and New Year period, this was not in use. I imagine during any other time of the year, this is quite full of business people. The hotel room was very nicely layed out but a bit office-ish with a large desk and a set of drawers like you find at work!! The shower was uber-trendy. Word of caution - do not go to this hotel and stay in a room who you are not intermit with. It is a glass cubicle in the centre of the room!! Literally! Not sure if all the rooms are like this but the picture on the web-site indicates so. The breakfast was of good variety with plenty of topping up of the buffet table though the staff did struggle as the hotel was fully-booked. So much so, guests had to eat breakfast in the bar area - and that was smokey. But it was so hot in the breakfast area!! Indeed in the winter you do tend to dress slightly warmer than if you are on a summer holiday but it was too hot to eat in comfort. We had 1 drink in the hotel bar on arrival and found this very expensive and never returned. The lobby area was also well heated - so the cold hit really hard when you walked outside. The hotel is located 5 min walk from the train/metro station and connections are very regular. 5 min ride to Alexanderplatz. Though we pretty much walked our way around Berlin, we used the metro to get us to our starting point each day. Not much going on in the area but very quiet with a few shops, a department store, a Netto and a small market in the square.

Absolutely no problems with the bed or shower/bath and the room was a decent size. I notice there was a door leading next door so you could book two adjoining rooms if you wanted to. Location: when you get off at Ostbahnhof station exit on the north side. To your left you will see a Dresdner Bank building. The hotel is in that building but you need to walk around to the north side to get in. Basically it's five minutes walk. I walked through the area at about 5am and it was a bit spooky but there were a number of all night diner places next to the station. Look up the hotel's website which has directions how to get to the hotel from different airports around Berlin. It takes about 5 mins by the fast elevated train service to get to Alexanderplatz and about 15 minutes to the Zoo. The journey to/from Tegel airport is about 45 mins. Shopping: there is a big department store right outside the station and there are also 2 supermarkets and a drug store, cash machines, fast food joints in the station building itself. For general shopping I recommend catching the train over to the west Berlin surburb of Charlottenburg where you can find a great range of high street shops. One of the reasons I chose Innside was because the description of facilities said there was a fitness centre on-site. Well that turned out to be a bit of a disappointment - basically there is a step machine, exercise bike, gliding machine and an abs frame plus a set of free weights and a bench. Enough for a maintenance workout but dont expect to add any muscle while you are there. Also in the fitness area is a sauna and a solarium which costs about 6 euro for 30 mins.

The location is perfect \u2013 don\u2019t let the fact that its in the Eastern part of the city put you off. Alexanderplatz is perfectly walkable, and in any case the Ostbahnof station is less than a minute away, so travel to the Western parts is only a 10 minute train ride (and trains seems to leave every 2 minutes\u2026). Overall, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go back to this hotel.", "Date": "October 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, England", "Title": "\u201cCutting edge design\u201d", "Author": "Malcolm R", "ReviewID": "UR2491332", "Content": "A blend of the old (the building used to be a textile factory) with the new (21st century shower \"pod\") make this an unusual place to stay.
