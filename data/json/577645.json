The reviews are not wrong.We have stayed in Venice a couple of times now and this has to be the best place we have stayed in in respect of location and the hospitality of the staff. We arrived early by water taxi( 70 euros from piazza Roma) which was nice and quick and arrives right out the front of the hotel. The staff were very nice and showed us to our room and gave us plent of advice as to the best restaurants and places to go. The superior room we had was located on the corner of the building with beautiful views over the canal. the hotel is very central and is between the rialto bridge and san marco square so it is very central and ideally located for anyone visiting venice. The apartment was clean and tidy and big for european standards and represented good value for our family of four - no breakfast included, free wifi which was good. There is a reason why the hotel is well rated on trip advisor and this is due to its great location and friendly staff.

The rooms were big and spacious. Centrally located and easily accessible. What I really must comment on were the friendliness and honesty of the staff members. Unknown to me, we're required to hand in our passports for verification upon checking in. I had a big note of EUR clipped in my wallet and without realizing, had handed my passport and my cash to the counter. It was only much later that I realized I didn't have my cash with me. The hotel staff were aware that my cash was with my passport and safe kept it for me. To which I am very greatful for. Also, a staff namely Maurizio were so kind to us.

The only drawback is it is noisy sometimes at night. People on the bridge over canal, yelling and clattering around at night. My girls whom are usually very sound sleepers were awakened 2/3 nights by yelling. I think this is not the norm based on other reviews. They have a fridge for your use and an electric kettle.

This worked out great as we got the bedroom and our daughter got the other room with a sofa bed (which was the best sofabed we've ever seen - it felt like a bed). It meant you were never falling over each other. You could pay extra 50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for them to unlock all the equipment in the kitchen to cover the extra cleaning. However they still leave you plenty of stuff without paying this - cups, glasses, plates and cutlery. Certainly enough for having some nibbles. I would recommend getting a watertaxi from the airport to the hotel. We had never been to Venice and really was a spectacular way to arrive at the steps of the hotel. The boats are beautiful and trip zooming across to Venice in the misty distance the through the canals even up the grand canal was something we'll remember forever. Another tip is t get a travelcard. Jumping on an off the waterbus is a great way to get another perspective.

The hotel is not far from one of the main Gondola Pick-Up points (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 we paid for a 45 minute ride and it took us all around, including the Rialto Bridge). Around the hotel there are some fantastic cheap restaurants - the hotel recommended us some fantastic places too - and there is the Hard Rock Cafe not far either. You can eat cheaply in Venice if you avoid the tourist traps, this hotel makes it much easier to eat on the back-streets of Venice. All the back streets are on our door-step which meant we could buy some lovely souvenirs and walk around the shops and soak up the atmosphere. We had breakfast in different places each day managing to find lovely food on every corner which wasn't too expensive. There is food everywhere - ice-cream, Pizza slices - oh I could go on - the food is fantastic there and I've never eaten so well! The apartments were lovely - plain in decoration, but lots of space (a big bed!) and very clean. We found the cleaners to be very noisy first thing in the morning which was a shame as we wanted to lie-in over the weekend - without noise! We found that we didn't use the kitchen for cooking but we did bring some food back so was good to eat this off plates etc. Beware; there is a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 cleaning charge for the kitchen if you do leave it in a mess. My only complaint about the hotel is that the check in and out times are rather inconvenient - 4pm checking in time and 10am checking out! You can leave luggage at the hotel and we found the reception to be helpful and knowledgeable about the area and were efficient in ordering us a water taxi (which we picked up directly outside the hotel). The water taxi is a must, we arrived at night and I would say to get a water taxi in the day when you can see where your going and enjoy the experience a bit more. My boyfriend felt like James Bond and loved it!! They are pricey though... Overall this hotel has a simply fantastic location for Venice and sight-seeing - we spend \u00c2\u00a3180 per night which we got though the hotel website, this is cheap for Venice and I'm happy to recommend this to friends. The hotel is a pleasant walk away from St Mark's Square and the main point to get the airport. We visited Doges Palace which was lovely - we got there early and there was already a queue so maybe early afternoon is the time to go. We didn't have much time in Venice and we spent most of our time walking around, eating and enjoying the beauty.

He claimed that his boat wouldn't fit in the small canal at the Grimani which we found out was not true (we were picked up by a water taxi upon departure). We were dropped at the Piazza San Marco dock and had to hoof it across the cobblestones to the Residence. We had backpacks so it wasn't a big problem but it would have been nice to go direct because the Residence Corte Grimani is not to easy to find the first time. We had Google Maps to help out but passed it twice! Keep your eyes peeled when you cross the bridge past all of the gondolas. If you pass the Armani shop then you have gone too far! The Residence Corte Grimani is very centrally located between the Rialto area and Piazza San Marco. My niece and I walked to the Piazza every evening and enjoyed the wonderful music at the Grancaffe Quadri until closing time. It was a short walk back and we felt very safe. The apartment was very large and very nice. Our only complaint was the noise from the apartment above us. It seemed that the guests were dragging furniture across the floor on a constant basis. This is not the fault of the hotel and I did complain upon checkout which was a bit too late. The canal below our windows was full each morning with gondolas and the singing and laughing will get you up in the morning. Who needs to sleep late while in Venice though? I would recommend the Residence Corte Grimani but would advise to complain about the noise if it's a problem. The front desk advised me that they would have informed the guests that they were too loud.

A small coffee can be as much as 4 euros (about $6.00). Very unique city but quite expensive. A once in a lifetime experience although if we hit the lottery we'd visit often. We highly recommend the Residence Corte Grimani and truly thank the management and staff for such wonderful service.

But nevertheless i shall write a balance review for the benefit of prospective travellers to Venice. The hotel is ubicated centrally less than four minutes walk from Saint marks square. This location as you can imagine is very convenient for sightseeing and also it is near the stops for water buses. The hotel is off the main street in a quiet cul de sac adjacent to a canal. Some previous reviewers have complained about the noise from a church bell. I heard the bells at about 8 am in only one out of a four day stay, but please remember that Venice is full of churches and you are likely to encounter this particular sound in many other locations too. On arrival to the hotel we were met by Franca who is one of the five concierges at the hotel. She was friendly and very welcoming providing us with tourist information when asked. The other three concierges i met were all equally helpful, friendly and very professional. The rooms were clean and towels changed daily. The reception area was small but on the other hand there was one free internet equipment available for the use of guests. The beds were comfortable and there was free use of a fridge, a kettle, microwave, two cups, two glasses and cutlery for two. We ate out in restaurants and cafes, but I can see people complaining about having to pay 50 euros for unlocking the cupboard with cooking utensils, another 50 euros to pay for the cleaning of the kitchen at the end of the stay, and 20 euros for the use of a washing machine. People who rent an apartment expect those facilities to be included in the price otherwise they would have chosen instead to stay in a hotel room. I would suggest that the hotel management increases daily charges for everyone independently of wether they cook or not and then get rid of those additional charges and make it all inclusive in one single price. In that way everybody will be happy. In summary it was a very pleasant experience staying at this aparthotel. For the price one pays i think it is excellent value for money and one should not expect or demand more than what you pay for.

We picked the apartment hotel based on the TripAdvisor reviews. Yet again, we made a good choice. Arrival and departure We came from Milan with train to Venezia. From the train station we hopped on vaporetto no 1, hopping off at Rialto bridge. From there we followed the hotel's directions (see their homepage) and the hotel was easy to find. It was a few minutes walk, and not too bad with two big suitcases, as the narrow streets are really lovely to walk along. Upon departure, we took the water taxi from front of the hotel, going directly to the airport of Venezia, at the price of 100\u00e2\u201a\u00ac in total. The hotel and the room The hotel is perfectly located. You find everything you need nearby. The gondolas are just over the bridge, a minutes walk; there are many clothing stores just around the corner (Armani, CK, Guess, Puma); as are restaurants (from Italian ones, to chains such as Hard Rock Cafe, Hell's Kitchen, Burger King...); and also a lot of historic sightseeing as well as boats leaving for nearby islands. The walls are rather thin though in the building, as also commented by the other reviewers. Thus we went for a room on the top floor (room 503), facing windows to the west (not facing the Goldoni bridge). This didn't bother us at all, as we usually came to the room around six o'clock, just in time to open all the windows, enjoy the beautiful sun, whilst drinking a cold glass of prosecco or beer. After sunset we headed back on the streets again, to go for dinner. The rooms were spacious, and very clean. Beds were typical Italian (read: quite hard). We had no issues with running warm water (as some other reviewers had mentioned), and we showered both mornings and evenings. Restaurants The first evening we went to a place recommended by the hotel owner. It was called Aciughetta. He recommended a few others also, but as this wasn't to our satisfaction, we never tried out the other ones (saw them from outside though, and chose not to go in). You got very basic food, one portion for each and one beer and one water for 39\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Additionally the portions weren't even tasty. We don't recommend this place. We also tried to have dinner at San Trovaso, as recommended by many reviewers, but the queues were extreme. There is a reason why everybody tells you to reserve a table in advance :) Unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to check this place out. We had dinner twice along the Grande Canal, by Rialto Bridge. Yes, a typical \"touristic scene\", where it is nice to see people walking by; the food, however, is not much to cheer for. You get two basic spaghettis, two glasses of house wine and one coffee for about 50 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac. The list prices usually don't include the \"servizio\", which is + 12% on top of list prices. Usually I love Italian food, and therefore the only disappointment on this trip was the cuisine. However, I assume Venezia is quite a tourist trap, so you really need to find the local, small restaurant gems, to get the typical tasty Italian food. We did find two very good restaurants though. One was on the island Burano, and the other on Lido (along Gran Valle Santa Maria Elisabeta). There we had our best meals and deserts, at also reasonable prices. Unfortunately I cannot recall their names. Things to see It's easy and fun to explore the streets of Venezia. My husband isn't much of a walker, but even he liked walking here, down the narrow streets, of which corner you always find something new and fascinating. Try to see as much as possible, from walks along Fondamenta Zattere allo Spirito Santo, to smaller silent streets of Cannaregio. If you want to see something outside Venezia also, we recommend Burano. It was so colourful, peaceful, cosy, with small houses and restaurants. You also find all the same souveniers here and groceries to get back home, but remarkably cheaper. Then we also recommend Lido for a stroll. You can also rent a bike, and bicycle the island from one end to the other (approx. 12 km). Bicycle rent is 7 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac per hour. To go to these places, or in general moving around with the vaporettos in Venezia, we recommend buying the \"boat card\". E.g. a 72 hour boat card was 33 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac. You can use them on all the boats, hop on and off, whenever and wherever you wish - very practical. These can be used also on boats to Lido, Burano, Murano... If you decide to go further away, you have car rentals at Piazzale Roma. Breakfast and snacks The only thing Corte Grimani didn't provide for, was breakfast (or other restaurant offerings). You can have breakfast at the hotel on the opposite side, at the price of 18\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. We decided though to buy the food we wanted from markets/ stores, and enjoyed them in the room, before heading on our adventures every morning. What most reviewers had written, was that it is difficult to find a store. We found several though, and here is the one we used three times: You can walk, or take vaporetto 1 from Rialto, two stops to Ca' D'Oro. You hop off, walk along Calle Ca' D'Oro, and then take Strada Nova to the left, walk over the bridge, and you'll find Billa on the right hand side. Instead of taking the vaporetto, you can also walk \"along\" the Grande Canal passing Rialto, coming over to Cannaregio. There was also one Billa when coming to Lido, on the left hand side, in the beginning of Gran Valle Santa Maria Elisabeta. From the hotel you can also buy drinks at good prices. Examples: 1,5 litre water for 1,50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 1 litre juice for 2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 33cl beer for 1,50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 33cl Coca-Cola for 1,50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, and 75cl wine bottles for 8, 10, 12 or 16\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Summary We loved visiting Venezia, but so far, no trip has beaten our trip to Cinque Terre some years ago. Venezia was nice for an extended city-weekend, strolling around the streets, watching people, old architecture and listening to performers on Piazza San Marco in the evenings. Know, however, that the streets get quite silent after ten-eleven in the evenings. Some areas have pubs, like around Calle Aquila Nera, Calle Galeazza and Calle Stagneri. The only downside of our trip was our restaurant experiences, but otherwise we had a lovely trip, and the apartment hotel met our expectations.

We flew from Liverpool to Treviso airport and caught the bus to the main terminal then the vaporetto to the Rialto Bridge stop. It's worthwhile visiting the hotel's website and printing off their map and directions although it wasn't too difficult to find. From the Rialto stop there are a couple of bridges to negotiate, not so easy with cases and kids but it it's only 5 minutes away. We arrived at the hotel in blazing sunshine and entered the cool air conditioned reception where we were cheerfully greeted and expected on announcing our name. After the formalities we were shown to our 1st floor, 2 bedroomed apartment (101) by lift and our cases were brought up minutes later. The air conditioning had been switched on in advance of our arrival and was sheer bliss after the heat of the journey. And what a room! The main room had a large window with Juliette balcony overlooking a narrow canal, beautiful wooden furnitute, TV, small kitchen area and large fridge as well as it's own bathroom. The main bedroom was large and airy with a double bed plus double sofa bed, elegant furniture and another en suite bathroom. It was beautifull. As we were getting married, we decided to have the smaller room with the balcony and let the kids have the other room. There was plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space along with 2 safes (one with a combination lock, the other a key). The kitchen utensils were locked up (except for the fridge) and could be used for an additional charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50. The location of the hotel is perfect, overlooking a canal and being in the middle of the San Marco district just 5 minutes walk from the Rialto Bridge to the north and 5 minutes from St Marks Square to the south. The hotel staff were informative and helpfull in every respect, offering advice on the vaporetto, directions and restaurants. There was free internet access in the lobby and a library of guide books and maps available. The receptionist and night porter were happy to bring drinks to the room at excellent prices - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.50 for a can of beer and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.00 for a good bottle of wine - very good prices for a hotel. At night we sat in the open window overlooking the canal as the night-time gonoliers drifted silently by with just the occasional cry of \"oyi\" breaking the silence. On the 25th May Carolyn and I married in the town hall on what was a magical day.

Initially, I did not consider Residence Corte Grimani because \u00e2\u201a\u00ac280 per room for two rooms would be a bit pricy. Then I read one of the reviews mentioning that some of the units in Grimani could comfortably accommodate four. So I booked an apartment unit with an extra room (which cost an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 for three nights). We were all thoroughly pleased with my selection: great location, spacious apartment by all standards, spotlessly clean, extremely affordable (for four). We took a water taxi from the Marco Polo Airport, so we have no problem finding the place. The water taxi ride, though a bit expensive, was a real experience. Besides, it went right to the door step of Grimani. I felt that it was a bargain when I saw people dragging their luggage in the narrow uneven streets of Venice. We had been to Venice twice before with some tour group. This time, we spent four days here on our own. It was a truly wonderful experience. Staying at Grimani has made a big difference. It allowed us to explore Venice till late at night. Moreover, an afternoon nap back in the hotel helped tremendously. I will highly recommend Grimani and we will definitely use it the next time we are in Venice. - Joseph from Toronto P.S. Here is some useful tips for someone using a GPS device after Venice. I got a new Garmin GPS device for a driving trip to the Hill Towns region (Marostica, Bassano del Grappa), north of Venice after our Venice stay and cruise. When I used the unit, it went haywired on me (telling me to turn into a one-way street with opposite traffic, not warning me before a turn, telling me to turn left on a highway). It was only after we returned to Toronto that I realized why. I turned the GPS unit to \"Pedestrian\" mode when I was in Venice. Then I turned the power off to save battery life. But I forgot to reset it back to the \"Car\" mode.

We picked Residence Corte Grimani on the basis of trip advisor reviews and their website. We were not disappointed! The location was incredible with a small balcony right over the canal which was on one on the main Gondaliers routes which passed by every few minutes. Chose Residence Corte Grimani if like us you want to be independant. This is a luxury apartment not a luxury hotel- there is a basic basement area for breakfast- and a small comfortable lobby. There is a \u00c2\u00a350 euro charge for unlocking cooking facilities but you can just use the fridge and sink free if you are eating out. We just loved having our meals overlooking the canal and watching people pass by over Goldoni Bridge and listening to the gondaliers singing. Plenty of small local shops selling all the provisions you need. Ideally placed midway bewteen Rialto and St Marks. 5 mins beautiful iwalk to either. Our Superior apartment had a very large lounge with dining table, sofa bed and kitchen area and bathroom. The second very large room had double bed sofa bed and independant bathroom. All very clean and to a high standard. It was hot in July but the apartment was very cool. Tip Be aware some streets are very narrow and cobbled. Dont come laden with suitcases. There are no taxis here other than expensive water taxis. A gondala ride is a must -unforgetable- Go from St marks Sq and you pass the Palace, bridge of sighs and beautiful backwater canals. Buy a vaparetto (water bus) pass for your stay and if you have time visit the nearby islands Burano and Murano. Venice is very busy by day but much quieter at night. Wandering through the sidetreets is a pleasure. ou never know whats round the next corner- we came across a Ferrari shop complete with an FI car!! dont ask me how they got it there! Venice - We loved it, the children loved it - what more can i say! Some people have said hard to find but if you directions no problem! From Piazzale Roma take Vaporetto number 2 to Rialto Bridge. As you get off turn right along the Grand Canal . Go along Riva del Ferro going by the portico of the palace on the Grand Canal. Cross the bridge and take the first street on your left (Calle Bembo); at the end of the street turn right on Calle del Teatro and then on your left until you reach Campo San Luca. From here take Calle Goldoni just in front. Go by boutique Armani and continue until Goldoni Bridge. Having reached the bridge look to your right and you will see Corte Grimani!!

We have 2 children, and as others said, the layout of the rooms is great for families. I think it was a great value for the location in Venice. The location was great for us- about halfway between the Rialto bridge and San Marco plaza- which meant you could choose to go either way to water taxi's, shopping, etc. There is a small canal adjacent to the hotel, so there is some boat traffic nearby but not much. Also the more expensive Bonvecchiati hotel is just across the way, and there was a singer most nights- so when we opened the windows we could hear the music lightly in the distance and it was lovely. Hard Rock Cafe was also close by (if that kind of thing interests you- we didn't go in) and a Burger King was just around the corner (great for the cranky kids). The hotel personnel were very friendly and helpful. There is a computer with internet in the lobby you can use for brief periods (printing is 30 cents per page I think), and a little lobby area with tables/chairs you can sit in if necessary. We had a standard room, which was actually two rooms (one with large bed, and one with sofa bed, table, and kitchenette). It was quite clean and had no odor, tiled floors if I remember correctly. I would not describe it as plush, but it was clean and comfortable. You have to pay 50 Euro extra for the stove and microwave, 15 Euro extra if you want to use the washing machine, but we didn't need these. Use of the refrigerator was included in the room rate. One note of caution: when we arrived at the train station, we decided to take a private taxi from there to the hotel, since the public ferries were on strike that day and only running intermittently, and thinking it would be easier with the bags, etc. We discussed a price at the dock and for 70 Euro, the guy promised to take us around a little for views of the grand canal and drop us directly at the hotel. However, a different guy actually drove us there and took us only straight to the public water taxi landing at Rialto. So we had to lug our bags ourselves on the same exact path we would have taken if we had taken the public water taxi for 2 euro each. This was a complete rip off, but we had no power to negotiate at that point, because it was only after we got off the boat that I realized where he had dropped us off. The driver said the bridges by the hotel were too small for him to pass under, but this didn't seem true. I told the woman at the hotel the story because I was still funing about it, and she said they usually arrange a water taxi through a certain company to avoid this kind of problem. I would suggest contacting the hotel for that information if you are so inclined, or taking the public water taxi #2 to Rialto and walking from there to the hotel.

The location is great as it is literally only a few minutes from St Marks Square and the Rialto Bridge. We paid for a basic apartment as we saved the money for spending as Venice is not cheap! I have read reviews of the noise above and yes you can hear people upstairs but I have had the same problems in some hotels and we did not think it was excessive. What would would have been nice was a tea towel & washing up liquid to wash up our plates and cups (and wine glasses - none are provided). We found a supermarket about 5 minutes away but I could not tell you where it was although we found it again after stumbling across it the first time so we stocked up on bread, cheese, salami etc so we could have a continental breakfast in the morning. The apartment is lovely and spacious and it was nice to wander around without being stuck in a room like in a hotel. The apartment is spick and span and it is cleaned every morning with fresh towels. There is a TV provided although you will be limited to BBC World Service, CNN & MTV unless you can speak French, Italian or German. The service was excellent and when you arrive there is a bottle of water in the fridge and some cookies on the dining table. If you do not want to use the kitchen (which attracts a cleaning charge of 50 euros if you do) then you will be limited to using the kettle & fridge but we did not find this a problem - there are cups, saucers, plates and cutlery provided free of charge and this was good enough for us. I cannot recommend Corte Grimani high enough - the location is just fantastic and if you can find a supermarket then it will be far better than a hotel. The instructions on how to get there are ok but I woud say that when you approach the final bridge you will find a hotel on your right called the Bonchietta (or something like that) and a bank immediately on your left - turn left down the side of the bank and Corte Grimani is then right in front of you. Now for Venice - a fantastic city and we loved just wandering around and it is so easy to walk round it. We explored all the points of the compass and did not use the vaporetto although our legs knew about this as they ached!! I would use www.veniceconnected.com as we booked our return trip form on the Aligaluna line using this website and some toilet passes which saved us quite a bit - to use the public toilets will cost you 1.50 euros and we bought 10 passes for 5 euros before we went so it saved us a lot (you do have to book 15 days beforehand). This website will also save you money if you want to do any musuems and you can also book tickets for the vaporetto. St Marks Square is a womderful experience and the Rialto Bridge is just wonderful to look at. We diod not visit any museums but the buildings are an eye opener and we loved wandering the streets just window shopping and looking at places of intererest. We did not have coffee in St Marks Square but we did have afternoon tea In Caffe Florian but this is not like a traditional afternoon tea here as there were no pastries and it is served with whipped cream rather than clotted cream - still an experience just the same. What I think is better than coffee in St Marks Square is we found a restaurant in the Dorsoduro region - go to the bottom of the region and walk along the Fondamenta Zattere and head towards the end which is opposite St Marks - you will eventually come to a restaurant all on its own called Linedombra (I think) and we had a glass of wine while just watching the boats go by and taking in the view - if it is anice day you just cannot top this!!! Eating out is expensive and I would recommend a place called Trattoria Stoica (or something like that) which we found near Campo Dei Gesuiti which did a fixed price Venetian menu rather than the usual tourist menu - the food and service was just great.

At time of writing it is number 3 of over 400 hotels in Venice, and yet the price is relatively modest. I would recommend it to anyone. It does have two negatives that are worth noting: 1. During our stay the water was never quite as hot as needed for a relaxing bath - tepid at best. 2. For some reason the hotel room was poorly insulated against outside noise. Late night revellers, and delivery boat engine noise could be clearly heard despite the double glazed windows - as if the walls were as thin as a sheet of ply. Sad to say, but sensitive folks should pack earplugs. Of lesser concern was the fact that this hotel did not provide restaurant facilities.

We are a family of four with two parents and two grown up children in our early 20s, and it was really hard for us to find reasonably priced lodging that could accommodate all four of us without being cramped and crowded - that is, until we found Corte Grimani. The apartment is very spacious and there was plenty of room for all of us to settle in and relax. Apartment Details: We rented a Classic Apartment, which could fit up to 5 people. The first room was very spacious with a queen sized sofa bed, a dining table for four, small flat screen TV and a kitchenette with mini-fridge, microwave and sink (they also have dishes and utensils, but you have to place a 50 euro deposit with the front desk first). The master bedroom is incredibly huge with a large bed, desk, two wardrobes, safe and a sitting area. We also had a nice and clean bathroom (good water pressure) and another small room with a twin bed. The apartment is very well appointed and well taken care of. Location: Location of Corte Grimani is fantastic! We took the Viaporetto from the train station, got off at Rialto, and walked about 5 minutes to CG from there. We were careful to follow the directions on their website and had no problem at all finding it (it is tucked away on a little side path along a canal). From CG, it's less than 5 minutes to St. Mark's Square, and you're very close to many delicious restaurants (and a lot of fancy stores, if that's your thing!) As CG doesn't provide breakfast, we were able to walk to a cute little bakery (~2 minute walk) for breakfast in the mornings. Fantastic croissants. Venice: Loved it. It's very touristed but so charming. My favorite part of the city was exploring it by foot -- we loved the winding streets, narrow canals and unique architecture. We spent a lot of time exploring the different areas, not heading to anything in particular, but popping into gelato shops and small churches that caught our eye and perusing the artists selling their work in the street. Our canal tour was scenic and fun too. I'd also very heartily recommend coughing up the 8 euro to go up the clock tower at St. Mark's. An absolutely breathtaking view of Venice -- we climbed St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and went up the Duomo and to Michaelangelo's Park in Florence, and I must say the view of Venice was the most beautiful. Also, I hate to say it, but I don't think you'd be missing anything if you didn't go to single museum in Venice. The museums in Florence and Rome absolutely blew away anything we saw in Venice, and I would say that Venice is better experienced on the streets than looking at artwork. :) Overall, I thought CG was fantastic and would recommend it to anyone! It's an excellent value for the location, amenities and quality.

I was anxious beforehand because there have been some terror stories, but you need not fear. And it kind of feels like an adventure or finding lost treasure, so you'll hopefully enjoy finding it as much as we did. Once inside, the hotel has a hushed, intimate atmosphere. You almost feel like you should be whispering or someone will stumble upon your great luck and kick you out. We were greeted by a brunette (I believe the manager) who made check-in a breeze. Loved that. The location is really just incredible. Go over one bridge and past some shops and you are in St Marco square. A minute or less if you're walking with energy, I kid you not. Rialto in the other direction is less than 5 minutes. Superb. A few little things: there are lots of books downstairs about Venice that I found convenient. The elevator fits two people with luggage or five without. Once out of the elevator, you have to press a switch in the hallway to get light. As with other European hotels, the electricity only works in the rooms when your keycard is in the outlet near the door. Also, if there is no one at the front desk at night, they lock the door and you need your keycard to get inside. The room- Very spacious and for the price, quite a bargain if you like some extra breathing room. Apparently, there were cookies on the table when we entered, but my sister inhaled them, so I couldn't tell you if they were tasty or not. There was also water in the fridge, which was a god send. The prices for water, etc. provided by the hotel were really decent, too. I must note that our apartment (on the second floor, without view) is dark. It brings to mind the scene in Sex and the City : The Movie where Carrie goes up to the gorgeous penthouse while apartment searching and exclaims, \"So this is where all the light is!\" There really is no light here but if you pay extra and get a room with a view or one on the top floor, it will be different. I wasn't disappointed with this quite as much as my aunt was. It also somehow zaps your energy and you end up wanting to sleep. It took a lot of gusto to get out of the room once we settled in. The furnishings are nice and functional, the sofa bed was comfortable and didn't sink in the middle. The main bedroom was spacious with lots of closet room and the mucho important safe. It smelled delicious in there. My sister complained that every morning, it sounded like people were bowling upstairs. She also said that if she opened the windows at night, she woke up with mosquito bites. These are things I can not attest to, since I was in the living room, but they should be noted. I myself heard the cleaning service early in the morning, but I am a heavy sleeper and it didn't bother me or my aunt. The shower is AMAZING. The bathroom is very nice. The room came with slippers, which I still love to wear. Also came with a vanity kits and some great soaps. It's really convenient to have a tea kettle as sometimes you just don't want to pay for a coffee. The only thing I can really complain about was an incident involving payment. There was a very nice gentleman who was helpful, but when I brought up getting a discount if I paid in cash, which I had previously emailed the hotel about and they had confirmed, he said that my room rate did not include this discount. I really did not understand why, but what he said was that since I had booked with the hotel directly, there was nothing that could be done. Working in the service industry, I can somehow understand where is he is coming from. There are cases of miscommunication or misinformation. He wasn't at all rude or gruff about it, which I appreciated. Well anyway, I had all my emails printed out in case of this very situation and showed him how no one had mentioned that only certain rooms or bookings get certain rates, and he happily obliged to give us the discount. I thank him for that but I wonder what would have happened if I had no proof. Probably would have left a slightly sour taste in my mouth. Anyway, if in cash, the discount was 5% (40 euros for us) and that's significant enough to be worth the trouble. A tank of gas as far as I'm concerned. Food- We had dinner one night at Ristorante Malibran near Teatro Fenice (not the main teatro). It was delicious and a great place to people watch all those attending the theatre. The waiter was also excellent, servicing ALL the tables by himself. He was like a whirling dervish. I had quadro formaggi pasta yet again and it was rich and decadent, but not overpriced. We never found the restaurant again, by the way. The magic of Venice, for ya. There is also a great sandwich-type place on a street parallel to the St. Marco square. I forget what it's called, but the sandwiches were grilled to perfection and so tasty. Surprisingly, the gelato at Cafe Americano in the same square was also delicious. I suggest the hazelnut gelato ten times over. The bar scene is pretty dead in Venice, but my sister and I ventured out to the bar in the Campo St. Luca, going toward the Rialto bridge. It is a trip to see owners drinking with their dogs at foot. Must be a great conversation starter if you speak Italian. The scene was really not us, though. Very hipster. But amusing and worth the trip if you're bored. If you go over the Rialto during market owners, you must get a pear of any kind. They are SO delicious. A little less than a dollar. Entertainment- We didn't do the Secret Itinerary Tour (but I would definitely do it next time) but you do have to prepay for this tour online, and I really didn't feel like doing that. Oh well, next time. My aunt and I attended a wonderful one hour Vivaldi: Four Seasons concert at the Scuola Grande De San Teodoro. The performers dressed up in typical Venetian garb and the music was wonderful. I wish it lasted longer and was a little cheaper but again, you only live once. I wanted to make one more note. If you are heading back to Marco Polo Airport by Alillaguna waterbus line, the ride is pretty rocky and not for the weak of stomach! You kind of collide with the docks at every stop so don't try to sleep if you have the window seat. The ride is 12 euro and don't bother taking the gold line. It's only ten minutes faster than the red or blue lines back to the airport. Also, you have to go down a few steps to get to the seating (with your luggage) so those who are handicapped might have a hard time. You can stow your luggage before you sit, but again, you have to lift it when you're leaving. The stop is slightly further away from the actual airport than I expected and there is no shuttle. It's doable but not fun after a tiring trip, I can say that much. Everywhere you turn, Venice is like a work of art. A new and heart capturing scene everywhere you turn. It really is a magical place and I would return a million times. If I were with my family, I would definitely return to Corte Grimani. If you are looking for other rooms in Florence or Rome for families of four or more, I suggest checking out my reviews on Hotel II Perseo in Florence and Hotel Madrid in Rome.

We got the water taxi there and back and although expensive would definitely recommend this to guests as it is so much more convenient than waiting for the vaporetto and dragging your luggage across St Marks. We were on a very late evening flight and the hotel staff were more than happy for us to make full use of the lounge, watch TV etc after a long days shopping.

I chose the hotel based on the reviews I read on this site, expecting a good value hotel with some positive points! But I really didnt expect to be blown away with such a great find! I had the most fantastic time in Venice and the whole experience was complimented by a good nights sleep in a clean and modern apartment, with great views over Venice and a location to match! The hotel is located just 2 minutes from St Marks Square in 1 direction and 2 minutes from Rialto Bridge in the other. Also, even though you are close to shops and restaurants in all directions, it isn't in a bustling area so you wont be disturbed by noisey neighbours or rowdy tourists! The staff were unbelievably friendly and very helpful... willing to do anything for you and didnt mind if you booked in or out later than the specified times! The maid even came back an hour later when we fancied a lie in one morning! If you're stuck for ideas on what to do or where to go, just ask the staff! The view from our 5th floor apartment (classic with view) was breathtaking, with St Marks Tower in the distance and a view over a canal where you'll often hear a singing gondaleer! Its a great thing to wake up to! Air conditioning worked a treat and was seperately controllable in both the living room and the bedroom. The bathroom had a good power shower, a heated towel rail and a hairdryer. The kitchen was adequate although we never opted for the 50 Euro use of it... perhaps more useful for longer term residents. There were even free cookies and a 2L bottle of water waiting for us for free! I cant possibly think of a bad word to say about the place. We booked a last minute deal direct on their website... best room for just 200 Euros a night... well worth it considering the standard price is 250 a night!

Just one thing to note, there is a particularly putrid smell at all time in reception from the nearby canals/ drains but once you get in the lift the air is somewhat sweeter smelling.

We had a two bedroom classic apartment on the second floor. It was absolutely spotless - and I mean spotless (not even a hint of mould, dust, stains or marks on anything) - it was in tip top condition and was very stylish - gold and cream everywhere. It felt like somewhere we should be paying twice the price to stay in. They provided lovely towels, bath gels, manicure sets and carpet slippers to pad about in. It cost us 140 euro per night as we had a cash deal. Our child stayed free. There are a few things that stop me giving this place five stars (and I'm probably being a bit picky here but I think it is useful for people to know these things): the smell of the canal wafting into the reception and also up the stairwells (that's probably why they had beautiful air fresheners in our room), the thinness of the walls (we could hear next door having a heated discussion and then the next night getting amorous at 1 am!) and the incidental things that they did/didn't do, like wanting to charge a supplement for setting the single bed up instead of the sofa bed that was set up for our son in the dining area, not having a tv in our bedroom despite the floor plan showing that we should have one and teatowels to dry the cups and saucers with (there was no charge to make hot drinks). I would suggest that if you have a child and want to watch tv in the evening ask if they can set the single bed up in the second bedroom before you arrive instead of the sofa bed at no extra cost. English speaking tv was limited to CNN - but they have so many nationalities to cater for I can't expect BBC everywhere I go! The staff were so friendly and helpful, the location was brilliant - we walked everywhere even with a 5 year old in tow. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel but if you are prepared to eat on the hoof at one of the many cafes or bars then you can breakfast much more cheaply. If you stand at the counter it's cheaper than sitting at a table. Try San Polo for eating and visiting - slightly cheaper than the central area, much less frenetic with less tourists and a more 'authentic' italian feel. You can walk it from the residence in about 20 mins via the Accademia bridge. Be careful of the trattoria Antica Capon in the Campo Sant Margarita! Very friendly front of house/head waiter and when we walked in they guided us to an outside table and then charged us 4.25 euros for a capuccino. We didn't get a receipt which you are supposed to get in Italy otherwise you/the owner can be fined. We'll know better next time. Nice little cafe opposite tho' on the bend in the same square who only charged us 1.60 euros for a cappuccino. We got the water bus from the airport to San Marco, cost 24 euro for both adults and it took over an hour. On the way back we walked from the hotel to Piazzale Roma and got the express bus to the airport. Took 30 mins to walk (really scenic too) and only 15 mins on the bus - cost us 6 euro in total. Despite the little niggles that stopped it being absolutely perfect, I would highly recommend the Corte Grimani as fantastic value for money.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bideford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTruly memorable\u201d", "Author": "Naishcombe", "ReviewID": "UR14409361", "Content": "Selected this hotel based on the previous Trip Advisor reports.

Like most reviewers here, I booked this particular hotel because of its rating on Trip Advisor. I had contacted the Grimani in advance and been told that a water taxi from the airport was 100 euro, whilst the water bus was 12 euros each. I thought the water taxi was a bit pricey, so did not prebook. However, when we arrived in Venice on Thursday evening, we found that the water bus is hourly at that time of night, at ten past the hour. To avoid a 40 minute wait, we did take a water taxi from the airport at 90 euros. It was a lovely experience in itself, and much better than the bus. This dropped us at the Rialto Bridge, and we had a short walk to the hotel through the shopping area. The path to the hotel from the shops, almost looks like you are walking into the canal. If you are expecting that, its not difficult to find. Upon arrival at Grimani we were greeted by an Italian man who did not speak any English. Whilst I fully accept that I should be the one speaking Italian ! and can't, it was disorientating not to understand what he was saying. We had apartment 502 which has a brilliant view over the rooftops, to the tower in St Marks square. It was very quiet and peaceful, and spotlessly clean. There was no information regarding breakfast arrangements in the apartment, and as our host could not speak English, I am not certain whether this was available during our stay. We certainly didnt get up in time anyway ! As previous reviews have said, the apartment had all the facilities you would expect, and a couple of wine glasses would have been a nice extra. Unfortunately I personnally found the beds and pillows uncomfortable, and did not sleep particularly well during the stay. I think it is worth mentioing that the apartment is excellent value for the money you pay, and the location is perfect. It is a good 3 to 4 star experience, and much better value that the luxury hotels. On the first evening we ate out at a small restaurant in the shopping area - Antique Carbonara I think. It was excellent. A seafood restaurant with lovely fresh fish, excellent service, and wonderful desserts. The following lunchtime we ate at da Fiore in the St Paolo area, which is recommended in all the guides. It is a bit of a trek, and dont get it mixed up with the one in St Maros area. I had tried to book in advance, but they required credit card details. Luckily it was not full on this Friday lunchtime. This was a great restaurant as well. There are 2 two seater tables beside the canal, and its worth asking for one of these if you're feeling particularly romantic. Over the next two days we ate at the Grand Canal restaurant in the Monaco hotel, and Canova in another 5 star hotel. It was pleasant enough, but I wouldnt necessarily return. Monaco was very touristy, and Canova was stuffy (in my view), although the service was very good. Our lunch at Canova was more expensive than we paid in the 7 star hotel in Dubai ! Grimani were very helpful in making bookings for us. We saw Vivaldi played in period costume at Scuola Grande di San Teodoro, which is 5 minutes from the hotel, and worth the cultural experience. That can be booked on line with Classictic before you go, and they email you the tickets. We also visited a Jazz Bar close to the Rialto Bridge. We were very surprised to find the Jazz consisted of a DVD being played on a screen in the bar. When it finished, they played the same DVD again ! It was a pleasant enough evening, but was full of tourists. There seemed to be little choice if you were seeking evening entertainment in Venice. Overall a great weekend break in Venice, and a good experience at Grimani.

Incidentally, watch your change when you buy your vaporetto tickets as we were short-changed (but challenged it and got a refund.) We used the directions given by other reviewers in Trip Advisor and found the hotel without too much difficulty. It's easy walking on to the vaporettos with suitcases, but be aware you will have to carry cases over bridges to get to the hotel. Used the vaporetto service to the airport when we left and this worked fine. The owners of Corte Grimani are very pleasant, and concerned with detail, and this is no doubt why it is so well-liked. They gave us some good restaurant recommendations too. We had a generously-sized two bed, two bath apartment (401) with canal view. Everything was spotlessly clean, and there were nice touches like disposable slippers. Also was one of the few places on this trip to Italy where there was a powerful hairdryer. To use the washer/dryer combination in the apartment there is a five euro charge. It was very, very slow. Ironing board and iron are free on request.

We rented a superior room, more space than two people would ever need, but felt that after two weeks of traveling (business and personal) that we could use some extra space. The staff, to a person, are friendly and seem to know everything. Their recomendation of the water taxi service saved us quite a bit of money, and when the taxi company didn't want to pick us up the day we were leaving because of the high tides, they observed that other taxis were getting by (the potential problem is that the high water makes it difficult to get under the bridges in the smaller canals) and called the service to insist that we would be picked up at the hotel. Indeed we were, and exactly on time. We didn't end up using the kitchen. Although Venice is extremely expensive, there are ways to eat out. Split a pizza and have a half bottle of wine for lunch at a cafe (for a couple), or pick up panini at a local tratoria. The hotel sells Coke for a mere E 1.50; it can run you E 4-8 in a restaurant! Dinner is another matter. It is hard for a couple to get away less than E 60 - 70 even if you have a 1/2 bottle of wine. Between the coperto (cover charge), the servicia (included 12% service), a salad, entree, and a cappucino it adds up quick. I can see where a family would definately need the kitchen. We were baffled by the washer/dryer combo. We finally did get one load complete, and that really saved us. We are not usually confused by small appliances at home; even with several degrees between us it seems we still lack the necessary skills to operate Italian appliances. The rooms themselves are sparely, but beautifully decorated. The location is perfection itself. We know friends who have spent much more for much less in Venice.

It is a little tricky in that the hotel is right on a canal and you turn right on a little sidewalk by a canal bridge. No problem after you have found it once. The second thing is remember to shut your rooms stutters at night or you will be up with the dawn. You need to open the windows and unlatch them from the side of the building.

The canal room was great people-watching and we especially enjoyed the gondoliers singing as they paddled by our room--talk about ambiance! The room not on the canal had just a view of the next building but was very quiet which we enjoyed after returning from a long day of walking around. Either way the location can't be beat! During our stay, we used the kitchen and the washing machine; this was a special treat during our two-week 5 city trip, however the washing machine was very difficult for us to figure out how to use and we definitely recommend getting assistance with it if you are unfamiliar with european washing machines (it was a wash and dry all in one but took about 4 hours per load). Someone was always at the front desk to help us, and they assisted us with arranging for an early morning water taxi to the train station. BTW, knowing the name of the small canal that the hotel is on or having the map they provide to you when you arrive is invaluable when arranging for a water taxi.

We got an immaculately clean and beautifully decorated suite, with space and comfort to spare. The bed was huge and very comfortable. I absolutely cannot fault the room - they even provided a bottle of water in the fridge, which is a nice thought. We also took breakfast at the hotel, which was standard Italian fare of meat, cheese, cereals etc, but with fresh hot brioche and excellent coffee as well. I thought it was good value and excellent standard for the 10 Euro charge, particularly bearing in mind some of the prices elsewhere in the city. (e.g. the wholly risible Florian - 13.2 Euros/\u00c2\u00a39 for a cappuccino if they are forcing dodgy jazz down your throat. There are very nice cafes in lovely locations in the city where you could have 5 coffees for the same price. Absurd, avoid, and with a bit of luck they will go out of business). The Grimani's location is simply unbeatable, being about 3 minutes from San Marco and 10 minutes at most from the Rialto. Being tucked away on a side canal though, it is blissfully quiet at night, and during the day the only noise you normally hear is the regular \"oy, oy\" from passing gondoliers. And the occasional burst of \"O Sole Mio\" from the singing variety ... And a word for the staff, who were unfailingly polite and helpful, ever willing to assist and make our lives easier. The major hotel chains really should take note of this kind of service. Venice, of course, was majestic. As soon as you are off the day-trippers slog between rip-off St Marks and the Rialto, which is unspeakably awful during the day, it is just wonderful. If in doubt, dip down a side alley - any one will do - and walk. You will find a peaceful and remarkably normal place that presents something fascinating at every turn. Don't miss the Dosoduro or Canareggio, which are noticeably different in feel to the San Marco districts. We also took a trip out to Burano, which was both visually stunning and very charming.

It is very confusing to get here: After taking the #1 stop on the vaporetti, go straight, turn right at your first opportunity and then left at your first opportunity. Go straight through courtyard continuing until you reach Timerland store.

Once you hit Bon Vecchia, Gucci is across the street, you can follow the hotel directions. When you see the bridge, there are stairs to the right of the bridge, go up a few steps off to the right around the bank and then you see it directly in front of you. I'm doing these from memory..you might want to check our BonVecchia's website for directions to their place and know that Corte Grimani is around the corner. I expected this to be more like some kind of efficiency since it was listed as an apartment, but we had maid service and the hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful!!! We paid 180 euros per night for two and they gave us a free upgrade! I was expecting very pared down efficiencies, but this is an old building that has been redone in the last couple of years and it was quite modern and nice. I had trouble finding the tiny washer and Donatella ran up to my room to help explain it quickly! They gave us good recommendations for dinners: Hotel Madonna and others. This is in a great location near San Marcos square and close to everything. Breakfast is an additional 10 euros per person so we opted out of breakfast. We enjoyed our time there and thought it was a great place! The lobby is quite small, but we were in Venice to see the city itself so it was fine with us!

The first thing I would say about the apartments is that they are excellent accommodation for a group of people. There were 5 of us in our party and we booked the superior apartments which came to a little over 100GBP each for 3 nights. The apartments were clean, newly decorated and a delight to stay in. Almost every window had a view of the canal and it was quite tempting to remain in the kitchen/diner rather than explore. Our apartment had two rooms: a very large bedroom with ensuite bathroom containing a large double bed (two singles pushed together) and a double sofa bed, and a separate kitchen/diner with shower room. All the bedding was clean and comfy, linen and towels were provided as well as slippers. The apartment is around the corner after a bridge and a little difficult to find on foot but if travelling by water taxi (the expensive option) you can arrive on the doorstep. The staff are welcoming and friendly although beware of asking them to recommend restaurants and just wander off on your own. We, along with guests from other hotels, found ourselves in an awful establishment on the first night (the name of which I cannot remember now). Thankfully, Venice is scattered with lovely restaurants, its just a matter of walking around and stumbling upon them. We had breakfast one morning, which was a typical continental affair. I preferred the small tapas type venues whilst exploring. It rained whilst we were visiting in February and the apartments provided umbrellas which was nice. As you'll find from the other reviews, this is a real treat in Venice and just around the corner from St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.

For an additional EUR 35, a cupboard filled with basic kitchen utensils is unlocked. Sufficient for preparing simple meals. As eating out in Venice is rather expensive (and the food is not always that great - for Italian standards), we got a lot of use out of the kitchen. - Location, some 200 m from Piazza San Marco and close to all the other main sights in Venice. The hotel is amazingly quiet considering the very central location. - Great value. We only paid EUR 90 per night and booked through the hotel website. Even though January is low season in Venice, we still felt it represented a very good deal when compared to similar Venetian residences and hotels. Some tips: - We found the hotel without difficulty by using the instructions on the hotel's website. Still it would be a good idea to arrive in daylight. From Piazza Roma we took the vaporetti #1 and #82 in the direction of Rialto/Lido/Valaresso. Then we disembarked at Rialto and followed the hotel's instructions. - Buy a 72 hours vaporetto/bus ticket for EUR 25. It's definitely worth it when you want to visit Murano, Burano, Torcello or Lido. - For those considering self catering, we can recommend the Billa Supermarket located at the end of the Zattere across the San Basilio vaporetto stop (Dorsoduro).
