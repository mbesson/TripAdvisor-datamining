This hotel is among the most economical in all terms: 1.

If you are just into shopping regular items, this is the place (Mustafa Center gate4 is at your doorstep for 24hours) 3.

Every time I believe I have seen the smallest room possible, I stumble across one where the pygmy builders have outdone themselves and managed to create an even smaller room. The room at arianna was tiny, and had no windows. The bed was decently sized (somewhere between a single and a double), wedged into a corner of the room. There was about 30cm of clearance in front \u2013 just enough to shove a suitcase in \u2013 and about 60 cm of space on one side. There\u2019s a mirror and a small shelf (20cm wide or so), a small fridge (!) and a couple of shelves with hanging space and a room safe. No bedside lamp. The ensuite bathroom was (surprisingly\u2026) tiny. A sink, a toilet and a shower are all crammed together with no room for even a shower curtain \u2013 so when you shower everything in the bathroom gets wet. There is also no decent ventilation for the bathroom so it remains wet and damp. On the plus side, the room was quite clean, and they also provide a kettle and some cups (with sachets of tea, coffee etc) and a hair drier. There was also a small LCD TV, which had a couple of English language channels. Wifi worked fine and was fairly fast (2mbps or so). Overall, could not get over the size of the room.

About the room: We got the room adjacent to the main road (can watch Mustafa Center from our window). Rooms were small, had some basic toiletries, water-heater, Hair Dryer, small refrigerator, locker, 22-inch LED TV but only local channels, Wifi was there but Internet was always down. Good things: Great Location, bang opposite Mustafa Center - 24 hours shopping palace where we can get anything you want. Good for many great & authentic Indian foods. Farrer park MRT is just 10 mins walk away. Bad things: Room floors were not clean. It was dusty. No Carpets. I told the Room Service Lady to clean the floor before I left outside. But when I came back the rooms was still dirty. There was construction work going outside, on the road (Added to the crowd noise in Mustafa Center). So it was very noisy the whole day. Also there was construction work going on inside the hotel also. Day-time whole day the rooms were noisy. Would I stay again? Maybe.

We stopped through Singapore for one night and had to leave for the airport on an early morning flight. So we chose this hotel for its convenient location and its affordable price. That said, getting to this hotel involves a 20-minute walk to the Lavender or Bugis MRT station. Rooms are small and narrow, or shall we say space-efficient. Amenities are basic and no-frills. The bathroom was a shower combined with a toilet. The advantage of staying in a budget hotel in Singapore is that we can be sure the rooms adhere to high hygiene standards. Also, because Singapore's tap water is safe to drink, the absence of free bottles of distilled/mineral water in the no-frills room was fine with us. Nearby Indian restaurants offer a wide range of both (very authentic) Indian and Chinese/Singaporean cuisine, with choices of any price range. Of course expectations have to be adjusted as this is a budget hotel. A bit more context: This is my 6th or 7th trip to Singapore and I have previously stayed in everything from the Shangri-La and St Regis to other budget options such as the YMCA. We were also two travellers sharing one room, and we got a good price even though we booked only 2 weeks in advance.

We chose this hotel because aside from it is cheap, we will be out of the hotel most of the time touring the city. The room has complete amenities, ample water supply, it's near the shopping center, and 5 min walk from the MRT. The room is tidy but not cleaned well. There was thick dust sprawling under the bed. It's not something you see once you walk in, unless you inspect. You have to know that since it is located in Little India, there are a lot of Muslims in the area. But it's really safe. You can walk around at midnight. One thing we didn't like is the ongoing construction which made it hard for us to sleep at night. And the location is not exactly downtown where the nice spots are. Wouldn't be booking here next time. Definitely we'll get a hotel where the more famous hotels and shops are.

Presented my name. The front desk agent looked me up and said, \"sir we weren't able to authorize your credit card and cancelled your reservation\". I shrugged and said, \"here you go\" and presented my credit card. The front desk agent laughed and said \"hold on\" and called someone secretly to discuss my reservation. He says, \"sorry, we couldn't authorize your card so we cancelled your reservation. We sent you an e-mail.\" I advised him that I had been traveling and couldn't have checked my e-mail. I asked him, \"would you check your e-mail if you were on a plane this morning?\" Again, he laughed and proceeded to recommend other hotels in the area. He precisely knocked his own hotel by saying, \"These places are much better-- not like this at all. You wouldn't like this place anyway.\" His sarcasm was lost on me. I insisted he go ahead and give me a room. He again insisted he sent an e-mail as if that eliminates any responsibility. He again declined to give me a room. When I asked for the manager or a General Manager he refused to provide it. I had to insist and he wrote the name \"Jerome\" on the card and informed me that there was nobody else there. I continued to stand there and expect a solution. This is when he made his admission-- \"Sir we are oversold by 1 room tonight which is why I can't give you a room.\" That is what actually happened -- they oversold the hotel and instead of walking me to another property, he decided to cancel my confirmed booking. I advised him he should still provide me a room and anticipate no-shows since my reservation is confirmed. He again declined. I did some research and later found out that my card company may decline a charge if they don't swipe the card. This is done as a security measure. Because the hotel attempted to pre-authorize my card before I presented the card, the charge declined. It wasn't a failure to pay. I hadn't even arrived yet. So, I checked my e-mail last night assuming I'd find this e-mail which the front desk agent said was sent to me. Was there an e-mail? Nope. In fact, I took a screen shot of my confirmed reservation still active as of 5PM that day. They lied. Watch out - this hotel does not know how to manage their inventory and will oversell and attempt to deny you a room. It cost me a lot of time and headaches having to seek alternative accommodations because of their failure to properly handle the situation. \"Jerome\" and his team don't know how to manage hotel room inventory and rather than accepting responsibility, they leave you on the street and laugh.
