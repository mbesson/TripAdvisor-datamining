The location for our purposes was excellent since we spent half of our vacation exploring the Mayan ruins in the nearby area as daytrips from PdC and the other half relaxing at the beach. The hotel is close to the bus terminal and also only a couple of hundred meters from the beach. Naturally, if you only want to stay at the beach, then a hotel with a seaside location would be better. But then again, there it is all touristy. (Well, in fact PdC is a town build for tourists, but from HMB for an example the taquer\u00edas with a mostly Mexican clientele are a bit closer.) The hotel was clean and atmosperic with its brightly colored walls and decorations. We ourselves also found the hotel peaceful, although a couple who stayed at the part of the hotel that is next to a night club claimed for the noise. Our room faced the street and we didn\u00b4t have any disturbance at all. The courtyard of the hotel was also a nice, serene place for relaxing and having a snack. All in all Hacienda Maria Bonita was a good experience for us and we will definitely go there again next time, when we visit Yucatan. I hope it won\u00b4t take too long, because the peninsula is the most amazing destination we have been to on our travels.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salisbury Ma.", "Title": "\u201cThe worst place in the Caribbean\u201d", "Author": "softy57", "ReviewID": "UR120441054", "Content": "I have stayed in Playa 4 times and in the Caribbean on 10 other occasions and this was the worst place ever.

We stayed there on our last days in Playa Del Carmen. The hotel is closed by to good restaurants (and NOT as expensive as those in fifth avenue), scuba diving operators, pubs, bank (atm) and small supermarket Oxxo. It only takes you less than 5 minutes walking to the beach and fifth avenue. The breakfast was okay - nothing spectacular. No wi-fi in the room. The swimming pool is very small. The hotel has very friendly front office staff. We had an issue with the bathroom in our room - it was so stink. We made a complaint and it seemed that they could not do much with the smell.

The staff was helpful but nothing extravagant. The pool is small but eh, one of the nicest beaches in the world lies a 200 meters away. There is only one reason why I would never, ever come back to this hotel: the infernal noise you get at night. Althought we had paid in advance for a full week, we gave up after 3 completely sleepless nights and headed for another hotel. That was after trying to change rooms twice. The whole building is adjacent to a night club that plays techno music from 10.45 PM to 6.20 AM (the volume clearly increases after 3AM) - guess why I am so precise on the hours... I usually have a relatively heavy sleep, but I could feel the vibrations from the bass through the bed - maybe the concrete bed frame didn't help either. Apart from that, you get that standard mildew smell, maybe a bit stronger than elsewhere, but I could have lived with that. You also get very hard beds and a noisy A/C. If you plan to party non-stop then it might be worth a look - although I have heard of better deals elsewhere in the center of Playa. In short, it is quite pricey for what you get and I absolutely do not recommend this place.

A block off fifth street and two blocks from the beach !! The hotel is cute from the outside. The pool and patio area are small and cute, do not stay here if you are looking for pool time, this is not the hotel for you. The rooms are spacious with tv's with quite a few English speaking channels and wonderful AC and ceiling fans. Although their was quite a smell of mildew and cigarets in our room. The bathrooms are nice with showers with wonderful water pressure and temperatures. The bed and the sheets where adequate, and the pillows, well adequate is being polite. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, nice and accommodating. The hotel is feet away from Coco Bongo, which you can hear the music playing on weekends until early on in the morning. If you are not partying with them ear plugs are a most. We had flight issues on the way down, they would not let us cancel one night of our reservations, we had to pay for the night we where not their. Something that is understandable in a small hotel, but on a busy weekend night and us still staying three more nights it would have been nice if they could have worked with us on the situation.

I've been to Mexico a few times, and I'm familiar with the musty smell and hard beds, and I get a little peeved when people complain about them, because it's just a regular part of a Mexico trip. But this smell was horrible! We tried to turn up the A/C to get the humidity out, but there was mildew that you could see right in the walls. Also, the beds were so hard that our hips hurt! Every time we walked in the room, the smell was outrageous. When we got home and opened up our suitcases, the clothes smelled! We had to put every single thing in the washer. Too bad, because I really liked everything else. But I could never go back there. Also, their website said they had a free continental breakfast or American breakfast for $3.99.

From the outside, it truly is lovely, with its arched gate entry showing a tantalizing peak of the interior courtyard. Picture book old Mexico. However our room was not as picture perfect. We turned on the room air conditioner and 2 hrs later, the room was an oven. The air conditioner was putting out hotter air than most heaters. After 2 attempts to fix it, we turned it off. There was a sliding door to the balconey and opening it did cool the stifling room, but also brought in all of the street noise. Another minor inconvenience was that we could not get hot water in the bathroom sink. However the shower did work well. But the absolute worst feature of the room was the king bed. Sleeping on it was pretty similar to laying a sheet on top of concrete...unfortunately a VERY accurate description.
