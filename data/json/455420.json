The area is overcrowded and very noisey and also known as the red light area Directly opposite the hotel is a bus station and petrol station and also conveniently located is the carrefour supermarket. Taxi's are very easy to get, just stick your arm out and they'll be there. Not many taxi drivers knew where the hotel was so take a business card from the reception just in case. The hotel rooms were cleaned daily, however the hotel has a weired 'currey' kind of smell. The hotel staff were very friendly, however the lobby area was full of local people in the evening often visiting the bar where they had live entertainment till late night daily. The hotel staff will help you with excursions and arrange for pick ups to and from. Taxi's are very cheap. The main attractions are far away from the hotel so you'll have to heavily rely on taxis! We were glad when we were out and about and out of Bur duabi - if possible avoid staying in any hotel in Bur Dubai - there are many good hotels in clean and better areas of Dubai and trsut me it will ruin your experience of dubai staying at this hotel", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "mumbai", "Title": "\u201caverage hotel....good for single business travellers with modest budget\u201d", "Author": "rockwiz", "ReviewID": "UR83428591", "Content": "very old hotel..nothin fancy about it...average food - service - rooms...lot of local noisy bars in the hotel..with local crowd roaming in the lobby...ideal for single travelles with limited budget...located near a bur dubai bus stand...near to market area", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reduit", "Title": "\u201cOK for a budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Yashwan", "ReviewID": "UR54561660", "Content": "Old hotel but still the hotel personnel was superb- helpful and friendly.

The buffet breakfast is what others have described, toast, one type of spread, one type of cereal and fruits. The rest is mostly Indian and middle eastern food but its fine for a light breakfast \u2013 especially as its free with the room. As also mentioned before, there is a nightclub on level one and we could hardly hear it on level three \u2013 I would still suggest you ask to be put on level 3 or higher though just incase. The only downside to staying here was being right outside a mosque, so 5 times a day you are greeted by loud prayers coming out of several megaphones on top of the mosque for about 20minutes. The only time its really disturbing is the one that wakes you up at 5am! We found the staff to be very helpful, and overall this is a good cheap hotel for travelers on a budget.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNew Penninsula or Old Penninsula\u201d", "Author": "rizla1979", "ReviewID": "UR6475448", "Content": "stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks in November, not a pleasant stay at all, on arrival I though what have I got my self into, looking at the build it looks very old and dirty and is facing a bus station, going into the main entrance the staff are friendly people, I didn\u2019t like the rooms that much as they looked very dull, air con was not working well toilet facials could have been better, also the wall in the room are built like cardboard, u can hear next door, even so they have a nightclub/disco which is on from 8pm till 3am, we where on the 2nd floor and u could hear the music, personally I would not go there again, avoid this place if you are looking for a nice clean quiet Dubai experience", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne Australia", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel suited my requirements\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5416484", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 weeks in March. It was one of the cheaper hotels that I could find. Hence I was not expecting the Taj mahal! I was a single woman travelling alone and often returning to the hotel past 11.00pm. I was never hasselled or harrassed by anyone. It is located near the Dubai Creek and textile souk. Some great local restaurants nearby. My room was not dirty as described by some reviwers. It was cleaned on a daily basis and the whole hotel was being refurbished while I was there. Re painted, new matresses and it sound like new carpets too. Heeding the advice of previous reviews I asked for a room on the third floor or above and was given one on the 5th floor. I slept soundly. No sounds of night life or prayer time. Breakfast was a mix of indian or western. Fruit, eggs of some description, yoghurt, I always found something that appealed. Not cordon bleu but adequate. I was staying in a budget hotel. The hot water was a learning experience. I experienced luke warm water for the first few days. Then I enquired at the reception desk if there was anything that they could do to fix this problem. \"Certainly madam\". The hotel staff showed me the hot water switch directly outside the bathroom door that I need to turn on 5 minutes before having a shower each day! Plenty of hot showers after that. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel at 3 star prices, this is not the hotel for you. If you're looking for the westerner hotel in a middle eastern country, this is not the hotel for you, If you're looking for a 3 star hotel at 3 star prices in vibtant quarter of Dubai, with the spice souk, gold souk and prefume souk just a short abra ride acorss the Dubai creek then I would recomend you book in!

On first arrival, I was a little uneasy about leaving my passport with the staff in reception, but they assured me that they'd return it to me as soon as they'd finished with it and as promised I had it bought up to my room within the hour. I found the staff at this hotel extremely pleasant and helpful, they were more than happy to advise me on which places I should visit, directions I should take and the best times to go. The hotel is located next to the local bus stand, where you can easily find a taxi, although the hotel staff always offered to get me transportation if they knew I was going out. It's located near to a Carrefour supermarket, so you never have to go without anything and there are small traditional restaurants within walking distance. It's a less than 10 minute walk to the creek, which is well worth a visit, as the Heritage Village is along here, and at night comes alive with traditional Arabic music, food and dancing, as well as small stalls selling goods. The hotel offers a excursion service, where by you are told what kinds of activities are on offer and their prices and If interested the trip will be booked and arranged for you. I went on the desert safari, which was one of the highlights of my trip. The hotel is situated right next to a mosque, which obviously will have Prayers said at sunrise and throughout the day, this is not something that troubled me, and as there is a mosque on virtually every street, is something you would probably find it hard to avoid no matter where you stayed. My room at the New Penninsula Hotel was nothing fancy, but had everything I needed to have a pleasant stay. The cold water is in fact warm water and I found this to be the case everywhere I went, so I don't think this is something you can fault the hotel on. The room was cleaned everyday and a free newspaper was left in the room. Breakfast is from 07:00 - 10:00 and the choice was fantastic! As there are numerous restaurants in the hotel, the music played at night can be heard from the hotel rooms and may bother some guests, I was on the third floor and assume I was far enough away for it to have not been a problem, but I can imagine that those guests on the floors below may have been kept up. I plan on returning to Dubai very soon and would not hesitate in staying at the New Penninsula hotel again.", "Date": "December 1, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "New Penninsula Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d455420-Reviews-New_Penninsula_Hotel-Dubai.html", "Price": "$60 - $144*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">P.O.Box 33502</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "455420", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/81/c1/81c1625d359b59f3239d75bf26132f3c3large.jpg"}}
