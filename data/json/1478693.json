It's a very nice hotel (beautiful decor - in the room and out) and the staff is quite helpful. We also liked some of the little touches, like the old bookstore (more of a library) on the 2nd floor and the gift shop of the Istanbul Modern (also on the 2nd floor). Also the wifi is free and very fast. We didn't eat dinner or lunch there but there are some nice restaurants across the street. But we did eat breakfast in the hotel, which is quite a spread. Also our views were just so-so (room 711 and then 603), but there might be others with better ones. I guess my only complaint is that the hotel is quite far north so if you are planning to spend a lot of time in Old Town this may not be the best choice, especially given how bad traffic is in Istanbul (when it rains it comes to a standstill). It's also fairly far from the airport. When there was no traffic (like 5am in the morning) getting to the airport was a breeze, but in the mid-morning rush hour it was quite long. Just something to keep in mind. Otherwise, I would highly recommend the hotel. Oh, one other note - we forgot to ask for a non-smoking room and the first room we stayed in (711) cigarette smoke was definitely noticeable (we didn't try airing out the room by opening the windows, but it probably wouldn't have made a difference as I'm sure occupants near by where smoking in their rooms). We then went to Cappadocia for a few days and when we came back to the hotel they put us in a non-smoking room (on the 6th floor) but it didn't seem to make a difference - the room smelled exactly like the one on the 7th floor. So if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke then perhaps this hotel isn't for you either.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "cypriotalien", "ReviewID": "UR127073825", "Content": "Stayed at hotel and attended a conference there.

Let me warn you first: If you aim to see the historic side of Istanbul, you're in the wrong part of the city. try to find a hotel in Sultanahmet district instead, which are typically within walking distance of historic sites. The hotel is ideally located for business traveler (very near and sometimes within walking distance of most large corporations or a short taxi ride away) within a nice neighborhood. you can easily take a walk on the street late at night comfortably and there are nice restaurants that serve seafood, kebab, Ottoman cuisine (no alcohol here), etc. Be advised, though, this part of the city is ALWAYS windy so it is wise to have your windbreaker with you all the time. Hotel is very modern, having built less than 5 years ago. Decoration is very modern and as the receptionist can tell you, it is the first \"Art-Tech\" hotel in Turkey. Reception area is spacious, with attentive staff that focuses on customer satisfaction. In about 5 to 10 minutes you can be in your room, unpacking. I stayed as part of a business package and had a French Executive suite. I don't know about the regular rooms but this suite is large, well decorated and designed with the business traveler's needs in mind. My package included free high-speed Internet access throughout the hotel, free access to executive lounge, business center, gym facilities, pool and Gamer club. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to enjoy these facilities so I can't comment on them but Internet is REALLY high speed and I didn't experience any disconnection or slowdown. Elevators are fast and efficient (read: first cabin with available space will stop at your floor) with a modern decor. Hint: there is no sensor in the elevators so the video being played is just a plain video; but watching it is really entertaining :) This suite has a large bathroom (again, beautifully decorated) with vanity supplements, very large shower stall with ceiling-mounted showerhead (a welcome difference than most hotels) in addition to handheld variety with steady water pressure and temperature. A full-size glass working desk with compartments to stuff your things was a nice complement in the room's decoration. If you're using laser or optical mice with your notebook, glass surface can be a hindrance, though. If you don't have a mouse pad or mouse mat, use any of the various magazines available on the table. Right beside the table is a patch panel, through which you can connect your notebook if you have required cables. Thus, if you want to watch a movie on the 42\" Sony Bravia TV in the room rather than on the (comparably) small LCD on your notebook, just connect your notebook to the patch panel via a suitable HDMI cable (you have one with you, right?), set the TV input, then lay down on the comfy bed and enjoy yourself! Or simply turn on your favorite music and enjoy it while shaving, since a speaker is also mounted in the bathroom ceiling. Nice touch! Speaking of movies and music, don't worry about disturbing the neighbors. The hotel has excellent sound insulation and I was never disturbed by the sound of elevators (my room was next to them!), other guests speaking in the corridor or whatever they were doing in their rooms. Same goes for outside noise. Even though you're right in the middle of one of the busiest parts of the city, traffic noise or city sounds simply don't exist in the room. This guarantees a sound sleep! The hotel sports a pillow menu. If you're like me and prefer a semi-stiff silicon pillow, you only need to tick your choice and leave the form with the reception. Housekeeping will bring you your pillow. Complimentary kettle with instant coffee and tea was available in the room. I don't know why many other hotels in Turkey do not provide this nicety (as many hotels in Europe and US do) but this hotel does. Minibar was well stocked with quality stuff and the prices were not very steep compared to other 5-star hotels. Another nice detail was the condom available in the mini bar, if you find yourself somehow unprepared. Hint: Warm it in your hand before using it ;) Air conditioning was another joy! Not only was that whisper-quiet, but also did a very good job of keeping the room at my favorite temperature. When I wanted to raise it, it complied and heated the room within a quarter hour. Being used to the air conditioning units that have engine-truck noise levels, this was a great surprise for me. It also handles cigar smoke very well, too! Unfortunately, no cigar ashtrays were available in the room, but that's just me being excessively picky. Another nice detail was the couch/luggage rest kind of thing. It is large enough to place your luggage on (it can easily seat two of them) and you still have enough clearance to walk freely. Or, if you choose, you can place your stuff in the closet, stow your luggage away and use it as a couch. However, the very comfortable leather seat together with its footrest and the end table (with wheels for a change!) right beside would probably make you want to use it instead. Lighting in the room was well designed. You can control lights from the panels available at the door, beside the table or beside the bed. Some lights have multiple settings and dimmer controls so experiment with them until you find the best combination. A Sony alarm clock/radio with CD-player unit was also available in the room. Nicest surprise was the presence of \"Lullabies\" music CD if you prefer to sleep to some great tune. Kudos! Now, the most important part: The Bed. This hotel is featuring Yatas SweetDreams line of sleepwear, which is very comfortable. Not very soft, not very stiff, it provides great sleeping experience. If you are one of those people that tend to have difficulty sleeping in a bed not your own, a book with tips to help you go to sleep easily is also present right beside your bed. Sheets were crisp and very clean. I don't know about the duvet, as I tend not to use it, thanks to the excellent air conditioning in the room. Room service was very efficient, kind and timely. Although their service personnel can use a little bit more of orientation, quality of food more than made up for it. Tip: If you order a beer and no bottle-opener was provided with it, prongs of your fork can be used :) Breakfast buffet was extensive, with many choices of cheese, cold cuts, hot food, fruits and corn flakes and m\u00c3\u00bcsli. However, I have seen more fruit juice types available in other hotels (only orange juice was available) and I'd like to see more doughware (Danish pastries and croissants would be great). View of the Bosphorus from the breakfast lounge is also breathtaking. Taxis are available right at the entrance of the hotel. Just ask the staff and a clean, yellow cab with a working meter will be there within seconds. You can also ask the driver for a receipt at the end of the trip :) Finally: Price! The price may sound a bit steep if you book through the hotel's own site. However, if you're traveling on business like me, ask your travel department for a corporate rate and get a French Executive suite like I did. It was really worth every single penny! I remember paying much more for the other well known hotel chains, both in Turkey, Europe, US, Middle East and Africa, for much less quality and worse experience. My only concern now is, having seen all the quality, luxury and great service in The Point Hotel Barbaros, I probably will be disappointed with most of the other hotels within tha same price range. Also, if more people who read this review tend to choose this hotel, room availability will drop :) However, I'm a frequent business traveler like many people who use TripAdvisor, and I believe we should help each other.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201ca must for gamers and not only....\u201d", "Author": "andynab", "ReviewID": "UR118733197", "Content": "I was there for a business trip in June 11 and as usually happen you have to find something before going out for dinner so I decided to accept a free hour for the game Zone floor.
