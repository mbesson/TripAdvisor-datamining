From start to finish this W property was fantastic! Check in took about 1 minute and the front desk agent asked if we were hungry and needed reservations at a restaurant. We did and she immediately called herself to a restaurant we knew of, and managed to convince them to take us at that late hour. The room was spectacular. Very well designed and VERY large, with a beautiful walk in shower, oversized and separate tub, and a great view of Montreal. I have to say that even the shampoo / soap / conditioner and lotion were above par (I actually took them with us!). We couldn't have been happier with it. We managed to also get a fairly decent rate because the hotel wasn't full that night. Much cheaper than some of the other \"lesser\" properties. The doorman was quick to get us a cab, we went to eat, came back and were immediately told that we could get line bypass to go to the bar for a nightcap. The bar is a hotspot in Montreal and was very crowded but we still managed to get some seating and talked to a few people. Definitely a younger crowd (and attractive) so be forewarned. Music was good and the people were friendly. I don't know why people complain on these reviews about guest being loud in neighbouring rooms, or that the bar was crowded. How is that the hotel's fault?! And who wants a bar that's dead? Our hall was dead quiet and we couldn't hear any street noise at all. The served us up a delcious breakfast in the room, very well laid out (you feel a little bit like a rock star there!) and we were off. They also have a VERY late check out (4 PM) which was great because we didn't have to be back at the airport until early evening. Overall, the entire experience was extremely enjoyable.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place !\u201d", "Author": "EricVanNguyen", "ReviewID": "UR127367039", "Content": "Went there a few times and love the place !

The first was the feeling of cheapness in this hotel. $35 for parking, $20 to buy a movie on the TV, a bottle of water for $5, and $20 for internet are all absurd. There is nothing worse for me than a hotel I feel is trying to nickel and dime me (with twenties) around every corner. It was blatantly obvious it was designed for corporate customers who aren't travelling for themselves and could care less. The internet thing is just absurd and the broadband wasn't even free. It's a rather dated and weak way to try to raise money. Luckily, we were offered a special! from the hotel upon check-in for cocktails (sounded nice). The coupons offered us two cocktails at the dramatically reduced price of $12 a drink marked down from $15. Not really an exciting promotion upon entering the hotel. Now on to the room. The decor is more of a personal taste thing. It isn't classy but it could be 'fun' depending on what you are looking for and I won't judge that for you. What was insane to me was the lighting. It was the worst lit hotel room I have ever seen and I am not exaggerating. Aside from there being no real windows (a view of other windows a meter or two away), the lighting in the room looked like prison lights and only lit corners of the room (no overhead light). I've never really paid attention to lighting in any hotel I have ever stayed in so this was something special. It was rather dreary (although did lead to sleeping until 11 in a comfortable bed!). The service was nice but it was amazing how bureaucratic it is within the W chain. We wanted something we saw online and the front desk basically said they can't offer it but if we go online and ask for it that way, we can get it. Without a computer this was a hassle. A really awkward and trivial ring to have to jump through but it is what it is. If you are looking for a big corporate hotel and want a change from your usual, this could still be your option.

The location of his hotel is great, especially if you want to explore Old Montreal. You're on the outskirts of Old Montreal, and a short-walk away from the downtown core, so it's the best of both worlds. If you walk 2-3 minutes south, you get to the corner of McGill and St. Jacques, which faces Square Victoria metro. From here you can either walk down St. Jacques to Place d'Armes and get right into the heart of Old Montreal (Place d'Armes Square, Notre Dame Cathedral), or you can head straight down McGill street, with its great restaurants, and go straight to the waterfront (de la Commune).

Upon our arrival we were greeted by an extremely helpful and friendly staff who were able to help us with our luggage and check us in quickly! We stayed in a wonderful room and it was absolutely incredible! The king bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was so clean and everything about the room was just incredibly designed. I know a lot of people have complained about the noise at the W but honestly, I didn't hear a thing. I just got back from a trip in San Diego where I stayed at one of the Starwood Luxury Collection hotels and I must say it was much louder there, so the noise at the W was definitely not a problem! During our stay we took advantage of the Acura service which was perfect, especially since it was sooo cold and coming from the DC area, I was not used to the freezing temperatures. Speaking of the cold, another great feature about the W is the underground metro access right from the hotel. This is very convenient when you aren't ready to face the cold but want to venture out of your wonderful bed at the W. I cannot wait to come back to the W this spring during my spring break from college, because 3 nights here was just not enough!!!!! I love the W and they continue to impress every time I stay there! One tip though: Parking with the W is around $35 for every 20 hours, which is a little bit ridiculous. So if you don't mind parking your own car instead of using valet, you can park right across the street.

The Square Victoria metro is right across from the hotel, a short 1-minute walk away. The room was spacious with modern and tasteful decor. The bed was clean very comfortable. The washroom was also a good size, but with a walk-in shower (no bathtub). One peculiarity is that there were no curtains to cover the walk in shower, which is only separated by a tinted glass wall from bedroom. So perhaps good for couples, but not so ideal for someone looking for some privacy while showering. The hotel itself has a bar (wunderbar) and lounge area on the second floor. Good ambience and ideal if you want to have a \"night out\" without actually having to leave the hotel. However, the bar/lounge may cause the occasional problem on Friday/Satuday nights, as party goers staying at the hotel & shuttling between the lounges and their rooms may yell loudly and slam doors, forgetting that there are guests at the hotel who may be sleeping at 3am in morning. This happened to us, and we were woken up a couple of times by some unusually energetic guests who also seemed to be running back and forth in the hallway. In any case, the beds were so comfortable that we easily fell back to sleep. Overall, a good hotel in a great location, but beware of Friday/Saturday nights. Tip: You can take the 747 Express bus from the airport to within a 5-min walk from the hotel. The ride takes about 45 minutes, and the stop closest to the hotel is \"Union street\" (stop #6). Follow the signs to Square Victoria and hotel will just a short walk downhill. The bus fare is $8, but keep in mind that you can pay with COINS only. The ticket you get includes a 24 hour pass that can be used for buses and the metro.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Albans, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCool W, Cool City\u201d", "Author": "Matt O", "ReviewID": "UR123480755", "Content": "Sadly only got to stay one night at this place - but it is everything that W is about.

Instead of putting my comments directly on Tripadvisor I wrote a letter to the management to give them a chance to make things better since I know that glitches sometimes happen as a natural human thing.

The concierge service with Daniel is excellent, his advice is very good. But thats about it. Service in other areas is poor and from the entire proclaimed \"WOW\" experience I did not feel anything. Even though I stayed as \"difficult guest\" I was surprised how many of the same things went wrong again. I was not assisted by the door man on arrival, had to wait 20min to check in and other minor things.

It's really not worth your time and money given that there's many other great hotels within less than 5 minutes walking distance. This review is based on a 4 night stay. 1) Let's face it, for the money this hotel charges you can stay at 5 star hotels, this hotel is 4 stars, but I have no idea how they managed to get that. The rooms are below average (think frat boy meets ikea), some rooms have no windows with natural light and the service is mediocre at best. 2) I was aware it was going to be noisy on the weekends due to the \"club\", but even on floors 6, 7 one can feel the bass and hear all the music (btw, get a new \"DJ\" 'cos the music was just terrible). I initially thought people were whining about the noise, but it IS really bad (and terrible music too; no skills). 3) Service? What service? As soon as you arrive they ask if you want 1K points instead of having them clean the room every day. I generally don't want them to clean the room every single day, but I do need towels, etc. so that sounded like a good compromise. Getting towels, etc. was a bit tricky though since nobody is EVER at the concierge area. I had to call back 3 times to get a person on the phone. I thought this place had staff on site 24x7? Leaving messages wasn't useful 'cos the times I did they never bothered to listen to it but just called back (then why have voice mail?). 4) Everything is terribly over priced, nothing is included and (again, emphasizing) service is poor. I have no problem paying $30 for breakfast, but I do expect the food and service to be great. Here I am waiting for someone to take our order and I can see our waiter is busy texting on their iphone. Really? Every time I was waiting for something, I could see him text. (I mean, at least go somewhere that I can't see it; I would have assumed you were busy handling the 2 other tables; yes, there was 5 staff, 3 tables used; yet, it was near impossible to get our server's attention). I do apologize if I was wrong, perhaps he was playing angry birds instead of texting. 5) The only great thing was that they were able to get some decent champagne sent up on new years eve; we arrived late after the regular stores closed.

Further, I work in the hotel industry at a NYC hotel. I mention this as hoteliers often have more patience/ understanding when things don't work out as planned and it takes A LOT for me to write a negative review. My boyfriend, who was with me this past weekend at the W is also a Starwood Gold member, he too has been loyal to the brand and travels frequently. In my travels I have become a fan of the W's and have frequented many of the properties. The W Montreal unfortunately misses the consistency mark, typically exemplified by W, by a LONG shot and as it is now, should be a hot button for the Starwood brand. There's too much to list about my negative experience here this past weekend. I will just lay out the basics: 1. Arrival to the hotel to a raging party on the 10th floor. We arrived past 12am and this party continued to 3:30am- sleep was not an option as you could hear everything happening outside the room. There was a security guard on the floor who was a W employee and was fully aware of the event. (which didn't prevent him from stopping it) 2. The \"window\" in our \"wonderful\" room was tiny and the room felt like a jail cell. *I understand that the W can't do anything to address this issue but I thought it was important to point out for potential guests who want a view. 3. Breakfast came incomplete without toast and tea and boasted a price point of $120 for 2 people. The hotel was very generous to provide us with a complimentary breakfast for the troubles with noise however this service recovery turned into further frustration once the breakfast order came up incomplete. 4. Upon check out we were charged 2 mini bar fee's for over $100 and $60 for items that we never consumed. Frustrating... dealing with a hotel charge for something you didn't have with two separate phone calls. 5. Requested posture pedic pillows that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive until our second night. An IRD order that was never delivered etc etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there were other details of the stay but I think you get the picture. On a positive, I will add that while the W Montreal definitely misses the mark on many points they are lucky to have the services of Bridgett Noel, their front office manager. After a poor experience with noise on Friday night, I told Bridgett about our night and gave her the opportunity to change our experience. She was empathetic, professional and beyond helpful. She did get us into a room with a window, got our postuerpedic pillows and did send the complimentary breakfast which was very appreciated. Bridgett is the star of the hotel and a true hospitality professional...they just need more people like her working there. While she tried to fix our experience the staff was unable to deliver and too many things fell through the cracks.

Cons: 1) Dirty (jam found on door; hair found in the bath and shower; shower not clean under the shower curtain; dust everywhere in the room and on the glasses/bottle of wine; fingerprints everywhere on the window) - we had 2 rooms, both were the same! 2) Very expensive valet parking (35$ a night plus taxes!!) 3) Very expensive room service (120$ for 2 persons breakfast - not the extensive ones: coffees, bagel and jam, eggs and potatoes and 2 toast! not even an orange juice... 4) Food very disappointing: you order fruit and yogurt, one day you get full of fruits, the other day, because it is later during the day you receive 3 berries and 1 strawberry (I am not joking!) and 2 berries had mold on them. I called room service to have more fruits (it is FRUITS and yogurt, right?!? for 14$... I want some.... and the room service guy almost threw the bowl into my face....?!? I was very polite, promise, I don`t think they should react like that and the food should be the same, day after day, right??) 5) Very loud hotel, when you are tired or with young children, that is not the place to go. Very dark at night like a bar and very loud music. People drink everywhere, you really feel out of place... 6) My beautiful bath did not hold the water in!!! So sad, I planned my night to take a nice quiet bath without the kids, and the water did not stay in, so disappointed! 7) Not an extensive choice of free supplies in comparison to other 4-5 stars hotel 8) very expensive spa with not an extensive choice of services (if you want a massage, ok, but they don`t do nails, facial or any other aesthetic treatments) 9) small room 10) expensive movies (16$ and more) for new release. So, in review, I don`t think the regular joe should stay there. If you don`t have an extra $ to spend, go elsewhere, because you will find the bill at the end quite difficult to swallow!

The lobby was beautifully designed but it was not as large/welcoming as other W Hotels (for example, W Hollywood, W Washington DC or W San Diego). It was more like a comfortable waiting area than somewhere you'd lounge around with your friends. Additionally, the Concierge seemed to be overwhelmed as there was perpetually a line of guests waiting for advice.

Not a big deal if you're with your wife/husband, but obviously an issue for non-couples sharing a room. The bed was amazing as you'd expect from a Starwoods property and the design was stylish and modern. Could have used some more outlets to recharge your phone/laptop but not a big deal. Also, the internet was C$20 for 24 hours (set start/end times of 12PM-1159AM). The 3rd floor bar is where you want to be to start the evening and the hostess was very helpful securing a seat for my wife and I even if many of the seats were taken. We didn't make it to the ground floor bar but they had the velvet rope and clipboard out for the standard weekend party crowd. Also for Americans, you can get by without using any Canadian dollars (except for Taxis). The W staff said they can call specific taxi's that accept US$ but we just walked everywhere. Also if using US credit cards (Canadians have a special chip in their credit cards), some restaurants allow you to tip after charging the card, but oddly enough, many others don't so you should have some Canadian dollars to tip just in case. Most of the time, they accepted US Visa and Mastercard, but smaller places (for example: Tim Horton's) didn't accept either.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat Weekend Getaway\u201d", "Author": "Passport-Kid", "ReviewID": "UR117567414", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in may 2010 and found it was a great weekend getaway as a couple.

A second server returned about 10 minutes later only to leave for another 10 min to ask if the bartender could make a cosmopolitan martini. Shockingly the answer was \"no\" however they could make a cosmo drink - go figure. Similar confusion over a request for a blood orange martini - even though they could make a blood orange margarita. We watched the bartender talk to patrons rather than mixing drinks. After just over 1/2 hr we got our 3 drinks with a $45 bill. Not once did the server say hi, apologize for the wait, or be friendly.

Great customer service. Julie-Catherine, Pauline, Lucas, Kristine, Joena, Nicholas, Dorine, Jason, Catherine, Alan, and Gabrielle at the front desk were attentive to my needs and went above and beyond the \"WOW\" standard in accommodations and awesomeness. My wonderful stay started with Julie-Catherine and Pauline. These two Front Desk Angels not only placed me on a cloud (best room), but continued to look after me for the past 2 weeks. These two individuals prompted me to pay attention to the rest staff of the hotel. They really did go \"Above and Beyond.\" I was amazed at how organized each department was and the attention to detail applied in their day to day tasks/actions. FYI, Pauline knows the best desert place in Montreal. Alex, Max times 2, Karl, Mathieu, Patrice, Carl, and Jose who are Ambassadors/Valets coupled with Daniel, Mireille, and Max (the Concierge) provided the best Whatever/Whenever experience. They dropped me off several times to Chu Chai (restaurant), pick up deserts, and even took me to La Banquise to get some late night food when I was hungry. The Ambassadors at this W are down to earth, super friendly, and wonderful people to just spend time talking with (especially about the city of Montreal). Daniel, you have been an amazing concierge. I really enjoy talking with you. You make everything fun. I would also like to thank the Welcome Desk Managers. Francois H, Francois P, Alexandra, and Brigitte for taking the time to say hello and taking care of me ninja style. :). You guys are the best. The communication line between the departments make this a desirable place to stay because everything is so smooth starting from check in (it has been for me every time). Even if I haven't had the pleasure meeting everyone in the Style department, I wanted to thank you for the super clean operation you have going on here. Thank you Kevin, Xavier, Lucille, and Brenda for managing such a wonderful team. The rooms I've stayed in are super clean with no problems what so ever. I also love the sticky notes the style department leaves behind after cleaning. Special thanks to Audrey for making up my room and leaving a super nice sticky note. Macy from Accounting was super cool playing the credit card game. Even though she doesn't speak with guests as often as the front desk, she was super nice and accommodating.

Mr. Jean-Francois Pouliot. I personally would like to thank you for a wonderful experience. I was surprised, shocked, and flattered (SSF'ed) the GM was making sure I was enjoying my stay. Talk about service. You have an absolute diamond of a group here. You and your team make this W hotel Shine. It's been my pleasure staying here.

The service is always excellent (without any of the pretention one might reasonably expect in this type of hotel), and the hotel has a (cultivated) fun but functional faux nightclub atmosphere that makes it perfect for a weekend away. It feels chic and cool while other W hotels can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite pull it off and seem to be trying too hard. The extremely dark elevators have mats that are changed from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bonjour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdto \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bonsoir\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the appropriate times of day, and there is a signature scent in the public areas of the hotel. Any problems we have had (a malfunctioning in-room safe on one trip and a drain-stop that was not keeping water in the tub on another) have been remedied within minutes by calling the concierge. On one of our stays, we were offered an umbrella at check-out due to particularly heavy rain. We have stayed mostly in Fantastic Suites, which are large and open-concept; the bed area is separated from the sitting area by the television. The deep soaking tub is the centrepiece of the open bathroom with two sinks and a large walk-in rain shower (though we prefer the greater pressure of the Westin showers), as well as a separate room with the toilet. The bathroom can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closed off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the rest of the room using a curtain. We have stayed once in a Mega Room, which is slightly smaller and for which the open-concept bathroom is less of a focal point of the room. Each time we have stayed, we have had a park view looking out over Square Victoria. When the hotel had a promotion for spa services, my partner decided to take advantage and get a massage, which he found extremely relaxing. The room layouts we have seen are particularly well suited to couples, a fact that we have enjoyed enough to return to the W just for a weekend out of town. During one stay, however,friends of ours stayed in a room with two double beds and found that the shower layout provides a little less privacy than would be ideal for a group of friends. I would be surprised to see families choosing to stay at this hotel. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bars are fun, but they also attract local scenesters, meaning that there is often a line-up in front of the hotel on weekend nights. Hotel guests can still pass through to the lobby without any problems, and we have never had any noise issues while staying here. A word of caution: all Montreal hotels are basically locked down for New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve (all breakables, carpets, etc removed from common areas, some pools drained, and the like) because Quebec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower drinking age and Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party image and proximity to the border attracts an onslaught of American teenagers for the holiday. New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve in Montreal is still absolutely worth it, but be prepared for some rowdiness. The hotel has direct(with guest key card) indoor access to the Square Victoria metro station, which makes getting around the city a breeze, regardless of the weather or traffic. We have found the Acura service at the W to be flexible and useful for getting around town, as well. At the end of the day,this is a very fun hotel with fantastic service.

But my favourite feature above all is the bed which is beyond heavenly. I think its even better the Westin's.

The following is a list of problems and areas that this W hotel has issues with. I am from Miami and go to the South Beach W hotel frequently as well as many other W Hotels around the world. This W Hotel is nothing like any other W Hotel. I would have been better off staying at a Holiday Inn in all honesty 1. No Computer access available- there business center was shut down all week for unclear reasons. I do not travel with a laptop so I was wanting to use a computer like most hotels offer. 2. They don't accept US currency at the bars/restaurant etc. This is the only place in Montreal that I have ever come across( and I visit Montreal frequently) that does not take US currencey. It is a major inconvenience for guests. 3. The A/C in the room made a ratting noise non-stop- which made it rather difficult to sleep. 4. The bathroom sink was completely clogged so it would fill up and almost overflow if I didn't shut it off. 5. The Wunderbar which is so publicized, was completely empty on a Friday night- actually at midnight I think there were three other people there. On Saturday night there were a few more people but nothing like other W hotels( I would not stay there for the nightlife aspect- as there are much better bars in town). The staff there was also not the most friendly. and spent the entire time talking to each other( one bartender kept complaining to all the other staff about a guy who was unhappy about a drink she made) They have a very poor beer selection - the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout was the only good beer on the menu.. The entire hotel seemed rather empty as well- last weekend in May I thought it would a bit busier. 6. As some others have said the room ( and the rest of the hotel) was extremely dark. Dark to the point of barely being able to see my clothes. The shower as many have also mentioned is poorly designed if you are staying with friends. 7. They charge 2 dollars to make a 1800 phone call each time. Don't make 1800 calls from the room. For the price I paid I would expect much better service than the above.

The Hotel is nicely located near Old Montreal, a five minute walk from Notre Dame, and a short cab ride from just about every other neighborhood.

The amazing restaurant, Au Pied Du Cochon, and 2, Dieu Du Ciel! Brewpub. With only two solid stops I knew I needed back up. We approached the concierge and asked for advice. My girlfriend are both in our mid-20's. At first glance the Concierge told us all about the club scene, outdoor parties, etc..However, once he found out we were serious about the food scene ( a la reservation at Au Pied Du Cochon I made a month in advance) he pulled out all of the stops. Right away he gave us a LIST of local brewpubs and microbrasseries along with his beer recommendations (all of which were spot on). Followed by a LIST of amazing 'foodie' restaurants.

The W is one of the many hotels that no longer put a coffee pot in the room, which is incredibly annoying if you are like me and require a cup to get the day started. They do offer coffee in the lobby, but I'm not usually presentable when I want the first morning jolt. My flight was delayed and I arrived after midnight. The appearance of the hotel is really not that of a normal hotel. No drive up, check in area. I drove around the block several times before calling and asking where the main entrance was, it's the appearance of an office building and the valet was nowhere to be seen. It was late, and when they appeared they were very cordial--albeit I was cranky from being late and wishing to get a workout in before bed. I made it to the gym and was sorely dissapointed by what they offer. It's better than most Hilton gyms but offers a few free weights and cardio--not as much as I had hoped for. I am a fit traveler and would gift the gym 2.5 out of five stars. The room does have a DVD player, so I'll use that for my evening workout w/a DVD I brought from my fitness collection. I also went in search of some hot water for tea an hour ago. I found a bar but they said they couldn't help me--I guess they don't have hot water to go ? I went to the front desk, but they were too busy. I called and asked if someone would bring me a pot of hot water, it seems like it should be easier. They said they'd send it up.

To the naked eye, the place looks amazing--all modern design, minimalist decor, and unique ascetic touches. It doesn't take long, however, to realize this place has virtually no functionality. It may LOOK appealing (or at least interesting), but it's not exactly a cushy home-away-from-home by any stretch of the imagination. The lobby--misleadingly referred to by the oh-so-comfy moniker \"The Living Room\" in all W literature--is a dark, strangely-arranged cavern that, like the rest of the building, defies the simple logic of functional space. Not only is it oddly laid out, but the whole oblong room is kinda creepy. I fully expected to see bats swooping down. And be aware that there is a nightclub--an ear-splittingly loud, bass-pumping, techno music nightmare kind of nightclub--right in the heart of The Living Room (don't all living rooms have nightclubs?). You must pass this club every time you want to get to the elevators, which means, at the appointed partying hours, the place is a maze of clubbers gathered around a velvet rope in the middle of The Living Room, making actually getting to your room quite an ordeal. The room itself, like the rest of the building, is bizarrely designed with no thought to practical, logical, daily use. I booked a Wonderful Room (their wording, not mine), which is the size of a glorified walk-in closet. We had a view of the interior hallway across the atrium. (So far, pretty \"wonderful,\" huh?) There is no bathtub in the bathroom, just a shower with a wall made entirely of glass, which faces the entire Wonderful Room, which means you shower with an audience. The bed, while moderately comfortable, is unusually small, especially considering the price of the room; it barely sleeps two people. While it doesn't say so in the W literature, this room is clearly designed for one person--unless you like to watch your loved ones shower and sleep virtually on top of one another. Which I don't. On the second night of our two-night stay, our entire floor seemed to have been taken over by clubbers from the nightclub downstairs. It was a nonstop party on the ninth floor, with endless noise and drunken revelry. After a series of phone calls to the front desk, the issue was finally resolved...hours (and much lost sleep) later. Now don't get me wrong, the employees of the W Montreal aren't impractical like the hotel in which they work. In fact, the employees are the only reason I didn't give this hotel a \"terrible\" rating. While they aren't an outright, smiley-kind-of-friendly (which, let's face it, can be annoying), they know how to give good customer service, and that's all I care about. Every time I called the front desk about the noise on our floor, I honestly got the feeling that the person on the other end cared and was committed to doing something about it. It may have taken awhile to get resolved, but that has less to do with the W Montreal staff and everything to do with the disrespectful oafs with whom I was unfortunate enough to share the ninth floor. And just as an added note, there was an exceptionally friendly (and very cute) doorman, whose name I unfortunately did not get (there's nothing as gauche as nametags at the W), who went out of his way to be friendly and helpful to us. Thank you, Mystery Doorman. The most frustrating thing about our W Montreal experience, however, was the cost of the weekend. Now, I'm no pinch-penny, and I'm happy to spend good money on a luxury hotel--as long as that luxury is provided. And with the exception of decent customer service, there was nothing luxurious about our stay at the W. In fact, the entire W experience is designed to milk as much money out of you as possible. As another reviewer pointed out, there is a price-tag on practically everything in the room. Wireless internet access is unusually expensive. Phone calls are expensive--even toll-free numbers incur high charges. Parking is expensive (tip: park in the civic center parking garage just behind the W; it's a fraction of the price, much more convenient, and just as safe and secure). And room service--forget about it. On our first morning at the W, it was snowing very hard (which I didn't know till I actually went outside because our room had no exterior-facing windows or natural light--how \"wonderful\"), so I ordered a pot of coffee and two orders of toast to be brought to the room. I knew it would be expensive, but I had no idea HOW expensive until I saw the bill. $37 for a pot of black coffee and two pieces of dry toast! Everything at the W Montreal not only has a price-tag, but surcharges and \"administrative fees\" are tacked on as well. Be very, very wary. I was honestly scared to utilize the ice bucket or use the shampoo in the peekaboo shower because I thought I would be charged. This is not an unreasonable assumption to make considering two nights at the W Montreal, when it was all said and done, cost nearly $600.

The Hotel was really nice, clean and in a great location. It was only about 5 blocks to old town and the entrance to the metro right in the front of hotel . I recommend you get a pass to use the metro for a week its much cheaper and great to get around in the city. The staff at the hotel was great, friendly and helpful. The only staff that wasnt to friendly were the guys that work at the front of the hotel at night that guard the door to the wonderbar. They were intimidating and not nice. Its annoying when you want to come in the hotel at night and their blocking your way. You greet them and they dont even respond. There were a few things I didnt like one the shower, there was no privacy and the water pressure was weak. There is no free wireless and the internet service is outrageous, I payed over 100 bucks for 6 days of service. I never odered room service it was just way tooo expensive for example a sandwich would be 25 dollars plus service charge of 5 dollars and they add 18% grautity do the math. You could spend that much on lunch for two people at a cafe down the street from there. The restaurants were way to expensive also, we never ate at any of them. Spa services were also outrageous. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels where room service and restaurants are more reasonable. I dont consider this hotel a five star, Id give it 4 stars. Oh and you can forget about taking anything from the minibar. Water bottle $6 beer domestic $10. Go to the grocery store and buy your own drinks. For the price of what the hotel charges stay at the Westin or St. James. Now what I did like about the hotel was the cleanliness and their staff. The front desk, the bell hops and the room attendant were always very nice and courteous. Always had smiles on their faces and would help you with anything you needed. The bed was really comfortable and had nice clean sheets.

She immediately informed me that, much to my delight, I had been upgraded to the Park View room. She called 5 minutes after I arrived in my room (surprise) to ask if everything was to my liking. The room exceeded my expectations and then some. Muriele the concierge was helpful and very knowledgeable about Montreal's best sights - and the map she provided was indispensable. I also felt taken care of as I explored the fine city - she provided her business card with the instruction that I could simply call at any point if I needed assistance while out and about. The nightlife, music, atmosphere, bar drinks were all outstanding. Again, I felt like a celebrity in such a special and exciting venue. On the next day after I checked out, I left my baggage and explored the city. When I returned before catching my train I thought it would be nice to freshen up. Receptionist Johanna offered me a room in the spa (with a shower!) to use... what a nice added touch! I left the W for my train refreshed and stylish, and ready for my return.

We took the train from Quebec City and arrived at the station, took a cab to the W, which is only a few minutes away. First impression was that this is NOT like other Westins. We are Starwood Preferred members, and chose this place for its location, which was very good; however, the property is definitely geared to the younger set (maybe teens to twenties, thirties) except for the prices, which are still pretty high ($6 for a bottle of water in the room, $40 for a very modest in-room breakfast). The decor is very modern, but kind of cheap-looking. They have a very trendy bar and we had to pass 3-5 large bouncers dressed in black to get into the hotel every night. Additionally, at night, the music was so loud, we weren't able to talk until we got into the elevators and the doors closed. We stayed in room 915, which was nice, but had a large glass shower which made up one wall of the room, this meant that anyone in the room had a front row seat to watch you wash. It was weird, unless you enjoy that kind of thing. Also, their signage and slogans were flippant and to my mind, somewhat tasteless. Everything was full of innuendo, even their email survey form titled \"How was it for you?\" All that being said, the location was nice for walking everywhere, and the concierge and staff were very friendly and helpful (and young--didn't see anyone over 30). Also, they use Bliss products, which I love, and really comfy beds. Not at all like the luxurious Westins we've stayed at in other places, but perfectly fine for younger folks looking for a hip place who are not too particular about level of finish and amenities.

Among all the big chain hotels, I always prefer Starwood and Hyatt and this quirky W at Montreal did not disappoint. Location: Right on Square Victoria near the World Trade Centre and main railway station. Despite being at a more commercial area, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to the shopping street, old town and to Rue de St Catherine. Montreal is a very small city and this hotel serves as a good base. Room: Paid extra to upgrade from Wonderful room to a Mega Room. The room was of decent size, with a big bathroom room (very deep tub and big rainshower). Well stocked bathroom with Bliss amenities and very functional. There was a big flat screen TV, DVD player, super king size bed and all the typical W goodies (excellent bed linen, good mattress, soft pillow, etc). The only downside was the chargeable wifi. Public Area Very funky lobby and bar area (Plateau and Wonderbar). Probably the coolest place to spend the evening in town. Plenty of sofa in the lobby and upper ground floor. Service: Prior to arrival I received few email to confirm reservation, notify weather, etc. Very personal touch. Most staff members were very friendly and helpful. They always have time and energy to chat to the guests. Among all the lady who helped me to store my luggage and the chief at concierge impressed me the most.

CONS: The only issue during my stay was the noise level. The room was well insulated and you cannot hear the street noise at all (the windows can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be opened). However as I had a room on the 4th floor facing the Victoria Square, right above the trendy Wonderbar, the room was very noisy and literally you can feel the vibration from the loud music from late evening until early morning (2-3 am). If you enjoy partying this will be no problem but as I tend to go to bed early and was staying for only one night, this was a bit annoying. Overall this is an excellent hotel.

It is the first time we looked forward to that great time between a long day and late dinner to NAP! NO question or request was too much, and each person answered the phone fast, delivered quickly, responded nicely, and provided us with constant enjoyment and comfort. The concierge (Daniel) even traveled 20 minutes away and back when I realized I left my Canadian money in an envelope in a store -- 2 hours before we needed to leave for the airport to go home!! I do NOT as a general rule bother to rave -- good or bad -- on sites, but the W is your best bet for Montreal - or anywhere (anytime).", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, NS", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Staff - Thanks Alex!\u201d", "Author": "Musicfan_NS", "ReviewID": "UR66180435", "Content": "My new place to stay in Montreal!

However, this one will go down in history as my worst W experience. First the good news: the hotel's location is very good. Literally minutes from the Old Town, and next to a metro station. Furthermore, I was upgraded to a wonderful room (506), with a bath, walk in shower and view of Victoria Square. Very fancy, and two out of three nights I had no complaints until the nightclub Wunderbar kicked off on my last night. I was on the fifth floor, but felt as if I was smack in the middle of the dance floor! As the noise didn't stop at 2 AM, I called down to find an apologetic receptionist offering to ask the club owner to lower the bass, and send up some earplugs. Unfortunately that didn't work - turns out only rooms near the elevators are bothered by it. So at 0230 I was moved to another room on the 9th floor, which did help, for the three hours that I had left of that night. When checking out, I again brought up the noise. It seems the costs of soundproofing the elevator shafts were too hefty for this property (according to the receptionist). And on my question why they didn't warn me beforehand, he said that they never knew who was bothered by the noise in advance,... even suggesting that the fact that I was a 'light sleeper' compounded the problem. Apart from apologies, the hotel didn't offer me anything out of their own initiative. I had to bring up that I didn't want to pay full price for that night. The receptionist, who did remain friendly to his credit, had to sort it out with his manager- who didn't even bother to show herself to apologize and offer me the 50% discount (which I did get). Very disappointing experience for a hotel of this caliber and price range. I would expect nothing but gracious apologies, followed by a swift discount and a personal send off by the manager on duty. If you can't handle complaints - you don't deserve praise. One other tip: be careful with the wifi in your room. They charge you per IP-address, apparently. So if you use your iPhone and your laptop to go online, they expect you to pay the same fee twice. It was sorted out in the end, but not after the receptionist affirmed that they would normally be two charges - which doesn't make sense, since they charge you for internet in the room. Shouldn't matter how many appliances you use. Cocktails at the bar are very good, food at Otto's is lackluster yet expensive, and certainly doesn't meet the expectations raised by its website.

The front desk staff found me a cozy place to work since my room was not yet ready.

The bathroom is exposed to the entire room so not somewhere to stay with someone you aren't extremely comfortable having see/hear everything!

It was fabulous and I really appreciated the upgrade. Even as a platinum starwood member, very few places will upgrade you to the nicest suites, so it was very nice of them to do it on my cash and points rate. PROS The location was great and we were able to walk all around Old Montreal to see the sites. I highly recommend the Notre Dame Basillica, it was maybe a 5-10 minute walk from the Hotel. The train station is also really close as is the Montreal subway. The staff was really great. The hotel was extremely clean and everyone we asked for help was extremely accomodating. We ordered room service for dinner, and it arrived very promptly and the food was delicious. The upgrade to the suite was great, and when out room wasn't ready, we were given two free cocktails at the bar which was a nice gesture. The restaurant was superb.

In the meantime they sent us to \"Bartini\" for complimentary drinks. Here we chatted with Dani who filled us in a bit about the \"W\" philosophy.

I have a thing about those horrible polyester hotel bedspreads, so picked the W as it mentioned duvets on their room amenities list. The bed was extremely comfy with feather bed, down pillows etc. Loved the oversized velvet chaise for reading and the turquoise tafetta drapery. Very quiet. I found the valets to be really helpful and the staff pleasant but not too kissy-poo. Did not like the 18% surcharge on room service on top of the $5.00 delivery. Internet in hotel like this should be complimentary as should a coffee maker in room. It is those little things that make the difference when I select a hotel.

It was an amazing experience. We stopped by planning to extend our stay in Montreal by one extra night. It was a Wednesday around 11:00 a.m., and Pauline at the front desk was not just helpful, she was exceptionally helpful. We needed a room to check into right then, because otherwise we would have had to leave our bags at the desk or in the car as we grabbed a late breakfast/early lunch, and she found us a room right there on the spot. And her chatting with us about why we were in town - my birthday - was really sweet, and it was even sweeter when she set a small tray of chocolate covered strawberries up to the room with a \"Happy Birthday\" card as well. And the room. I think that in an ideal world I will someday have that room as my oasis / bedroom. The bed was crazy comfy, the layout and styling was beautiful, and the bathroom was really neat. There were big curtains that shut the bedroom off from the bathroom, and a second curtain in the vertical rain shower. The toilet was a separate small room in the back, and it was the only weird thing about the room, as it was all dark brown with little light and a blown up photo of a dandelion head on one wall. It gets points for style but was a little less comfy-luxury and a little more artsy club bathroom stall. We tried two of the bars while we were there, the ultraloungey Wonderbar and the Plateau Bar. The Plateau was nice, but they were out of Wild Turkey and tried to substitute Jameson, something that upset my scotch-loving fiancee a bit. \"You can't just take bourbon and replace it with whiskey; they're entirely different drinks, you see,\" he said to our waitress. She didn't quite seem to get it, but was very polite. I had an amazing Brazilian liquor drink the name of which I forget, but it had that refreshing and intoxicating quality that you only get with a great blend of liquor, lime, and mint. Highly recommend it, if you can figure out what it is from this slightly generic description. We hit Wonderbar later in the night, and it filled up like crazy and was exactly what you'd want an ultralounge to be - loud and packed full of fabulous people. It was neat to be able to bypass the line and pop right in there because we were guests of the hotel. I can only imagine how awesomely privileged you feel when you do this on a Saturday and not a weeknight. The W's location right on the border of old Montreal is choice. The concierges were very helpful when we needed a point in the right direction for food. We didn't even give them very much help the first time, when we stopped by and asked for a dinner recommendation. \"What type of cuisine are you looking for,\" he asked. \"Not steak,\" I said. My fiancee asked where he liked to eat dinner, and he immediately recommended Barroco, about six blocks away. We chose to walk, as we'd done a bit of driving already, and had an amazing meal. (If you go, get the short ribs. Holy moly, they fell right off the bone.) And their quick breakfast recommendation the next morning was great as well. The valets were all very nice and quite fast, and offered to wash our car when we arrived. We declined, as we had gotten it dirty on purpose offroading in Vermont, and thought the mud looked great over the bright yellow Jeep Wrangler. As we were leaving to drive back home, the valet that day gave us a few bottles of water for the road, and thanked us for staying.

I'll summarize below: Staff: The staff were friendly, but not amazingly friendly. No acknowledgement made by staff when you walked by them in the lobby; that was a little disappointing. We were celebrating our 5th anniversary and they'd sent up a little tray of chocolates, so we really appreciated that. Otherwise, no one was rude. Rooms: We were in an accessible room (not-needed?) on the ninth floor. It was a corner room, so there was extra space which we liked. The room was by the staff stairwell or something, because we heard a loud door opening and closing a lot. That was very annoying. Other than that the room was nice. Big king size bed, nice flat screen tv, and a modern bathroom. Because we were in an accessible room, it didn't have the \"voyeur\" shower open to the bedroom like the rest of the rooms do (so if you're not up for the see through shower, ask for an accessible room, I guess). Housekeeping: Didn't run into any room attendants, but our room was \"styled\" nicely every morning. One morning I was in the shower when he/she came to clean the room. Instead of trying again at another time, they slipped a card under the door that asked me to dial \"0\" when I was ready to have my room cleaned. I thought that was a nice idea instead of them trying to guess when a better time would be. Area: The W is located just a little out of the way of \"downtown\", but we walked pretty much everywhere we needed to go. It's about a 10 minute walk to St. Catherine street where we did most of our shopping and eating. We didn't mind the walking at all, it was kind of nice to tour around. Amenities: The downside to this hotel was that there was no pool. We knew that when we booked, but I still found that disappointing. Also, their fitness centre is pretty small, but adequate. There are two treadmills, two ellipticals, two bikes, some weights and yoga balls. There are little TVs on each piece of cardio equipment which is nice if you find work outs boring and they even provide earphones for free incase you forget yours. Didn't go see the business centre, but I heard it was nice. No free high speed Internet, but it's free in the lobby. I think it's $20 per 24 hour period for Internet, so we just opted to go to the lobby when we needed Internet. Restaurants/Lounges: We didn't eat in any of the outlets at the W. The restaurant \"Otto\" looked very nice, but we decided to go out and try other places. The \"Bartini\" is a small bar with about 5 stools, pretty cute. We didn't go to the \"Wunderbar\", but it seemed to be pretty quiet on Saturday night. We didn't try the lounge upstairs, either. Transportation: Like I said, we walked pretty much everywhere. We went to La Ronde on Saturday, and to get there we took advantage of the complimentary Acura shuttle provided by the hotel. The concierge said it was normally out of the service area, but because it wasn't too busy, they drove us anyway. I thought that was pretty nice of them. They only do drop offs (no pick ups), so we had to take the metro back. It was very quick, easy, and cheap to use the metro, so I highly suggest that over cab use. The Metro station \"Square Victoria\" was right across the street and it's on the orange line. Not sure what else I'm forgetting, but overall, we had a nice time at the W. I'm not sure if I was expecting more, but I just wasn't blown away.

Provided below is a breakdown of our stay, along with some honest feedback about all areas. CHECK-IN Checked in a little earlier than planned, but was welcomed by a very pleasant worker at the front desk. The lobby is pretty frunky, and has a young, hip, and \"club\" feel to it, complete with the red mood lighting and music. Following a conversation earlier that week with their hard working concierge Patrick, we were upgraded to a WOW suite. THE ROOM The room itself was INCREDIBLE! 20 foot ceilings with a whole wall of windows, opening up on the terrace, our two-story WOW suite was on the penthouse level of the hotel. There was a great living room and 2nd washroom on the main floor. Walking up the stairs to our loft bedroom was great, the coolest feature being the bathroom on the second floor which has a shower that opens up to the living room on the first floor! Very sexy, indeed! Bed/pillows was great and very soft! ROOM SERVICE We had an amazing worker on our floor (Penelope) who took GREAT care of us! She brought us a bottle of champagne following our arrival, and was very pleasant. She had taken care of all arrangements for setting the room up for a special reception we were having the following night, so we had absolutely nothing to worry about! She arranged to have all of our bottles put on ice, and set up the entire bar area for us. The price for the juices/soft drinks we had ordered were on the expensive side (typical of room service everywhere, though it seemed much more expensive at the W than I've seen elsewhere) but still, the convienence of having them worry about it/get it all set up is worth it! SPECIAL REQUESTS The W prides themselves by offering their whatever/whenever service, and it's totally true! When I realized that I forgot my iPhone charger and panicked when my phone was almost dead, another friendly concierge (Mireille) recharged it right at her desk. Calls to the front desk for special amenities/requests that we wanted to the room was always brought to us promptly by yet another hard working/attractive staff member. The concierge also recommended a great place to eat, and arranged our reservations in record time! WUNDERBAR A few years ago, the Wunderbar at the W was the place to be. It still is.

Arrived on a sold-out weekend (which is very common at this property), from the moment that I stepped in, I was instantly \"in-Love\" with this hotel. Check in There were only 2 clerks so there was a bit of line but it is not as bad. There are signature W drinks, Apples, and some cheesecake bites for you to enjoy during certain times of the day. Its located on the side of the Welcome Desk. Room/Suite I received Fantastic Suite. In this property there are Extreme Wow, Wow, Fantastic Suite (junior suite), Mega room (with 2 Queen Beds), and Wonderful room. Fantastic Suite is very nice. Its a junior suite with swivel TV between the living room and bedroom area. Large chiase sofa and working desk in the living room portion. I love the bedside table. Its the laminated blue color (see picture). I asked the concierge why there are so many blue color in the room. He told me the blue is the official color of MOntreal so the hotel used alot of blue to decorate. Bathroom is very big open plan bathroom (with see-through showers). There are curtain to divide the living room and bathroom area but I know this can be an issue to family. However, not an issue for me. The Bed was very clean and sheets/liens were all in the perfect condition. Pool No Pool at this property Spa/Fitness Center Located in the basement level. The \"Away Spa\" is located in the SS1 Floor offers some massage n facial services (no steam room / jacuzzi of this kind), due to limitation of spa facility size, there is no Bliss spa at this facility. The Gym (Sweat) is located a level below that. There are only two elevators at this hotel but only one goes down to the gym so you have to either take that elevator (on the right) or u have to go via spa entrance. Gym is equipped with modern gym facilities and its very well-kept clean. Staff/Valet The valet and staff were excellent. Most staffs were very friendly and seems like to enjoy their job. I had an issue where my aerobus driver forgot to pick me up. They were really helpful and trying to contact them for me and offer me alternative solutions to the airport. Location Located right across street from metro station (Victoria Square). Easy access to everywhere in downtown Montreal. Easy 10-15mins walk to old town Montreal. 10 mins walk to the Shopping area in Montreal too. Montreal is VERY SAFE to walk at night (I am a solo traveler and couldn't feel any safer). Overall This got to be the BEST hotel in Montreal (for young generation) and I did run into some business people who had the meetings there, and a family. They all LOVED this hotel! This hotel's occupancy rate tells you how much people love this place. If you want to have a wonderful getaway, this is the place to be! *** I have to add that Concierge Daniel was the best concierge I have met so far. He was very knowledgeable , professional yet humerus. I believe the staff /service is the big factor to make a hotel to be \"good\".

He gave us a brief run down of the hotel and the \"W Experience\" and was extremely helpful. After we finished talking, we headed to the check-in desk located to our immediate left. We arrived 3 hours prior to check-in time, but this did not seem to be a problem. The front desk agent was neither outstanding nor terrible, but managed to politely smile throughout the process. The best thing about the W is the rooms themselves. The design is very modern; yet still intimate and cozy. I had a \"Wonderful\" room facing a office tower. This was not an issue for me since I usually keep the curtains down whilst in a hotel. The rooms are also sparsely lit. There is no blaring overhead light. Even with all the lights in the room on, it is definitely much darker than most hotels. This was a plus for me, but others may find this as a aversion. The bathroom is the nicest hotel bathroom I have been in. Housekeeping did a great job since everything was immaculate. My room did not have a bath, but it did have a shower that was large enough for 4. Just a little warning: all rooms seem to have see through showers; so be sure that you're comfortable with whoever you are staying with. The W is situated right on top of (and connected to) the Square Victoria Metro station. Access to the waterfront, old Montr\u00c3\u00a9al, and St. Catherine street is quite easy.

We were pleased when we arrived to find we were right between St Catherine's street (the shopping district) and Old Montreal so we did not need our car. However, parking was not convenient to the hotel and we had to walk a fair distance with our suitcases. The doormen - and all the staff - were very friendly and welcoming. The decor and atmosphere are very sleek, modern - dark with lots of chrome and waterfalls - unlike any hotel we'd stayed in before. Our room was not very spacious. There was nowhere to put our luggage so we had to leave it on the floor - taking up precious real estate. There were nice touches - the ipod dock, the DVD library, lots of magazines, big windows, fantastic Bliss body products and even a funky faux fur blanket. There was no mini bar - it was a FULL bar, which we did not touch because were were terrified of the prices. Having said that, the bottled water in the room was $8 for a small bottle, there was no coffee/tea maker - just a card saying coffee could be purchased from the hotel cafe, the internet access was $19/day, room service came with a $5 charge and 18% \"fee\", there were no vending machines near the ice machines where you could buy a reasonably priced bottle of water or pop, in fact, everything in the place had a price tag attached to it. The Bed: The bed is the most important part of a hotel room to me and after staying at Sheraton's with their fantastic Sweet Sleeper bed, this did not compare. We both woke up with sore backs every morning and the funky decor caused the bed frame to blend in with the black carpet. I stubbed my toe on the frame five times and had to put a shoe next to it so I would make a wide turn around it (hard to do in a small space). The Bathroom: very trendy. But totally impractical. The shower is completely glassed in and open to the whole room so unless you want to see every bit of your travelling companion while they shower, you'll have to do what we did and take turns going for coffee in the morning. The shower is supposed to be a 'rainforest' shower coming straight down from the ceiling, which is nice if you are just standing under it but useless for shaving your legs, washing your hair, etc. If you're just there for a romantic weekend, it would probably be great but we weren't and it was a pain. Our other complaint was the concierge was gone by 7pm on our first night (a sunday) and there was nobody to give us restaurant recommendations. Overall, this was fun experience and pretty funky but if I had to actually PAY for this room, I'd have been really ticked off... the value is not there. I don't mind an expensive hotel room but I expect it to be comfortable and the service and details should be flawless and I shouldn't feel like I have to open my wallet every time I turn around.

Unfortunately, we were told they needed the room until 4pm as they were overbooked with cleaning, and would call our other party's room once ready. Did not hear. Finally called the front desk at 6pm and they said the room was ready already for the past hour, and didn't call because of a communication breakdown with shift changes!!! So get into the room.... the tv is not working. It took 2 visits from the tech people to get it working properly.

Not only that, if you did want something... say the bottle of water on the nightstand.... the price tags were ridiculous. After checking out the room (very different with the completely exposing shower)... was actually looking forward to the large tub.... until I noticed the pubic hair. Yes- the PUBIC HAIR laced at the bottom of the tub. So crossed off 'taking a bath' from my to-do list. I would say it was one of the worst hotel experiences... especially for the price paid. I will give the doormen a positive review for their friendliness. They were great. The maid service barging in the room though, (once while taking a shower, the other while sleeping) I would leave off the 'good service' list.

Every staff member, from front desk to concierge, was not only eye candy but genuinely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. (e.g., we could have upgraded to a bigger room the first night, but our check-in person warned us that the room was right above the club and could remain noisy late into the night. We got excellent brunch/restaurant advice and recommendations.) We opted to wait until the following night, when a quiet room was available, to upgrade. One weird and hilarious thing about this hotel: there are velvet ropes out front at night, and when we drove up there was already a long line of 20-something hotties waiting to get in, and we -- in our dowdy road-trip clothes -- had to practically fight our way through the crowd out front, as bouncers looked at us sketchily, to demand to be immediately let in. The bouncers were really nice and helpful once they learned we had a hotel reservation. After we checked in, we wanted to see what the hype and frenzy was all about. The club on the ground floor turned out to be half empty!! There is a fairly large chi-chi bar/lounge on the second floor/mezzanine, and it was sparsely populated, too, with patrons. The same thing happened the following night -- line of people outside not getting in, but a club and mezzanine bar that were even emptier than the first night inside. The bouncers obviously were keeping people out unnecessarily, to project an appearance of exclusivity.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cHip Hotel, tiny, tiny room\u201d", "Author": "WmCT", "ReviewID": "UR17564293", "Content": "My companion and I recently stayed at the W Montreal for one night.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the W. Service: This is where the W really shined. Several days before I called the concierge to ask about dinner reservations for Saturday night. I explained exactly what we were looking for and we ended up with a reservation at a great restaurant that fit my request perfectly. When we arrived we visited the concierge desk to ask about breakfast places, transportation etc. and the information and recommendations we got were great. Daniel, the concierge on duty, even gave us a card with his number in case we had questions on the way out. The rest of the staff was great as well from the overly friendly check-in to the gentlemen out front who got us taxis and gave us bottles of water to leave with. Room: Our room was great. Even though I booked the room on points, we were upgraded to a corner suite on a higher floor (I am SPG Platinum but don't always get the suite upgrade when I travel on points). I received an email from the hotel manager several days before our arrival and was asked if I had any special room requests and my request for a quiet room on a high floor was granted. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was like all Ws, a little \"clubby\" and trendy. I liked the decor a lot. Since I am pregnant, we didn't visit the bar or the lounge but they looked like what I would expect from a W. Facilities: This is really my only major drawback for the hotel. The Sweat gym is really lacking. There are multiple cardio machines in decent shape and some free weights but no weight machines and only one weight bench. As compared to gyms at similar hotels, this one was smaller and had less equipment. Also, like most hotels in this class, many of the \"extras\" (internet, bottled water in the room, coffee in the room etc.) cost a pretty penny. I'm used to this but it still frustrates me. Location: The location seems ideally situated if you are traveling to Montreal on business. However, it was also in a great location for tourism. The Square Victoria Metro stop is right across the street and the Old City of Montreal is a very short walk away. We were able to get everywhere we wanted to go (except the airport obviously) via walking or the Metro.

At first we wanted to go somewhere warm, you know the usual choice when you live in Canada and want to get away from the 10 month winter, but looking into it more, I threw out the idea of taking in a Canadiens game in Montreal, something different than what we had originally decided upon. He lost it, and we began planning right away. Not even a month before he had been watching a program on tv about various hotels and such and had seen a clip about the W chain of hotels. This being the first trip we had taken together, we decided what the heck, lets do it. So we booked the room online through the website as soon as we could and immediately began receiving confirmation letters and personal letters from some of the staff as we had asked some questions and stuff after confirming our reservation. I was impressed, we didn't wait any more than a full day to hear back from someone about anything we needed to know. So that in itself was great. Upon arriving at the hotel, we no sooner got out of the cab and someone had our luggage in the lobby on a cart and ready to go. Simon checked us in and he was more than pleasant, making small talk and asking us how our trip was and so on. He told us everything the hotel had to offer and made a point to explain to us the \"Whatever/Whenever\" service the hotel prides itself on, which by the way is Exactly what it sounds like. Instead of just taking our credit card and throwing our keys across the counter, he walked himself around the desk, shook both of our hands and was more than happy he got to welcome us to the hotel. Another gentleman brought our luggage up to the room for us, set it up on the luggage stand and in the window, then took roughly 10 minutes to explain the different stuff in the room. Absolutely anything and everything we could have asked him about he told us, from how to use the telephone to where the hairdryer was located. I can't remember his name but he made quite an impression on both of us. The room was amazing, we stayed in a Wonderful room. It was like living in a dream.. the king bed was feather everything, we've never slept so well in our lives, the shower was Huge with more than enough room for both of us and the shower head which is located at least 10feet off the ground was amazing.. it was like being caught in a rainstorm every moring. All in all it was a truly 'Wonderful\" experience. Not only was the service at check in awesome, and the room absolutely amazing, but the concierge service was Unreal. We dealt mostly with a gentleman by the name of Daniel Mireault who was not only absolutely hilarious and down to earth, but did everything in his power to help us with any questions we had. He told us all the best restaurants to go to, the easiest ways to get around the city and answered any typical tourist questions we had. He provided us with maps, booked restaurant reservations without us even having to ask, and even with all the people staying in the hotel remembered us by name. My boyfriend even asked him if he knew how we could get ahold of some tickets for a second hockey game and he took care of everything for us. He got ahold of a few people, made a few calls and when he had all the information you could imagine took the time to call us on our phone, ask how we were doing and how our day was, and let us know the steps we needed to take in order to get the tickets. When you come from a small town of roughly 17,000 people that barely make eye contact with you, service like this blew our minds. We will definitly go back, and hopefully get to see Daniel again as well. Overall just the experience at this Absolutely Amazing hotel was enough to get us hooked on the beautiful city of Montreal. Every single staff member at the W Montreal was not only approachable, but nice enough that you actually wanted to stop and talk with them just to see what they had to stay. I wanted to take Daniel home with us to meet the family!!! Everyone was extremely knowledgeable about different things to do, where to go and how to get there. If ever you want to stay at a hotel that is way different than anywhere else, this is the place to stay. I felt like royalty the entire week, and was extremely sad to go.

I've visited this hotel before for their bar and lounged and loved the sophisticated vibe here. We booked a mega room and were celebrating a special occasion. The room was fantastic (i wouldn't call it a suite though) with a huge king bed and a huge sofa that is almost as big as the king bed (length and width). The bed was amazingly comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud with comfy pillows. The bathroom was awesome with a bathtub that had more than enough room for two adults (believe it, it's HUGE) and a wonderful rain shower. I don't know why others found that it was hard to shower with it and that water pressure was low because we did not find it to be the case. It was wonderful and we alternated b/w the bath and shower. There were curtains seperating the main room from the bathroom. The best thing about the W is the service (whatever/whenever as they refer to it). Before we arrived, my bf gave spoke with them on the phone and requested some things (some of which other hotels probably wouldn't have been able to do) and they all were there in our room waiting for us to check in. Our room was ready early (at 10:00 AM) all set up with rose petals scattered strategically everywhere. They told my bf that whatever he wanted, they could arrange, even our own private helicopter if we wanted. Yes, its true that this hotel has a clubby vibe and may not be for everyone. We are in our mid twenties and like staying at hotels that don't have the typical hotel chain feel. Although we were on the 6th floor, we heard the music from the bar in our room although very softly and we found it was nice ambience. It is definately not for families, especially with young kids. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels and usually like the upscale elegance (aka Fairmont chateau laurier or chateau frontenac) but loved the W for it's \"different\" feel. We didn't go to wunderbar this time but we love the Plateau lounge (love their mojitos and martinis, especially the A La Rose) although drinks are pricey (12-15/ drink) they are quite strong!

We had been warned about the shower and how it separates the room by a glass wall. We thought it was unique, but definitely not a room you would want with people you didn't want to see you naked!

Sadly, although it was a gorgeous hotel (and conveniently close to Old Montreal) the service was extremely disappointing. We arrived in Montreal around 10am (an early flight) and went to the hotel to see if it was possible to check in early. They said no but that they would have our room ready by noon and that they would hold our luggage. When we returned at noon someone else was at the desk and said the room was not ready but offered to take my cell # and call us as soon as it was. Well, by 3pm we hadn't received a call so went back to check in at the normal time. Yet another new person pulled up our file and seemed surprised to see the note about calling when the room was ready because she had not and it had been ready for a while. Again, the room was beautiful but over our 3 night stay we had NO HOUSEKEEPING. None at all--no clean towels, no tidy up, no making the bed, nothing!! And frankly, paying almost $300 a night I didn't feel like it was my job to remind them. It became our running joke to see how long we'd go without any housekeeping--talk about a bad punchline. When I complained to management I was told it was somehow my fault because we had been in our room during the housekeeping hours--which must have been 4pm-6pm because that's the only times we were at the hotel apart from sleeping. I was amazed that a hotel that sells itself as having \"whatever whenever\" service couldn't figure out a way to check back on the room at a different time or leave us a message saying they missed us.

Several reviewers commented on the shower. First, I didn't find any problem with the ceiling mounted rain shower, in fact I quite liked it. Second, staying with the right person, the fact that the bathroom doesn't have a door or privacy was fine with me too. I didn't find the Bliss Spa toiletries anything special but they were ok.

They don't have anything available. You're required to call downstairs and then it may or may not show up. When ours did show up, it was lukewarm at best. It took three visits by three different \"Whatever/Whenever\" reps to change the lightbulb in my bathroom. I ordered room service for a dinner and breakfast. The food was very good, if very expensive. The service was ok. There was very loud music that started about 3pm and continued into the evening that actually drowned out the TV in my room. The highspeed internet was useless. I had to call their service many times as their server kept \"timing out\" and resetting my screen to their welcome message.

Chaos started brewing from the moment we checked into the hotel. First, we found out that the room we reserved was not the same one they showed us on their website; in actuality, the room was about 200 sq feet smaller than we were told. My best friend Sam and I were too busy staring at our reflections as we grinded to the lobby's techno music to make a fuss. We decided to just accept our fate. The good: Once we got into our room, we decided we could manage with the smaller space since the room was clean and sleek. The bed was big and extremely comfortable. In fact, I may ask my fiance if we should purchase one. The view was great. The towels were big and fluffy.The walls were relatively thick as I don't remember being distracted by outside noise. The furniture was modern and the area was clean. After a look-through with my magnifying glass, I did not find any bug legs, dustballs, or mystery stains. There were plenty of mirrors so we could all line up and stare at ourselves with mocked anguish (while secretly admiring ourselves). The Bliss body products are heavenly so ask for as many samples as possible. It's your right to use as much lotion as you want since rooms can cost b/t $599-$3000 a night. If you stay at this hotel, massage your whole body with their body butter lotion. I personally used one bottle per body part. Then I washed it all off in their voyeuristic shower and reapplied. Remember, there is nothing wrong with pampering yourself. You paid for it. Body butter. Body butter. Body butter. We all love it. We wanted to throw our samples on the lobby floor and wrestle for them but we didn't have time. The bad: The hotel lost our luggage which contained our passports and privileged legal documents. Our documents floated aimlessly through the hotel all day due to staff negligence. The hotel did not seem to think that losing passports and client files was a big deal and told us that the bags were not lost, just \"missing\". Inviting your guests to quibble over semantics is not an acceptable way to spend the day in Montreal. We finally received our bags about 8 hours later. The hotel agreed to comp us for the room due to the inconveniences we incurred as a result of being deprived of identification, client information, and clothing all day. We of course spent this newfound money at their restaurant. As we left the restaurant, someone called Sam and I \"lesbies\" so that sort of made up for the slipshod service we received earlier. The ugly: Showering in front of friends can be pleasant under the right circumstances but showering in front of family hardly ever is. If you value your modesty, bring blindfolds for your roommates so you can shower in peace. Even if you manage to create a makeshift door with their towels, everyone can still see your silhouette so be prepared for questions about your posture in the shower. And if you are one of those people who only pretends to wash her hair, you can just forget about it. Everyone can see you so you better be prepared to explain your lack of hygiene. Overall, we had a good time last weekend but we were ready to head home. They were ready to have us leave too based on how quickly they threw our bags out of the hotel. One of the hotel guys practically smothered me with my own hood and shoved me into a cab. For a second I thought I had fallen victim to a kidnapping or hostage situation. As I caress my collection of sample sized body butters, I am unsure about whether I will stay here again. To be fair to the hotel, maybe we were not the best guests. But they were not the best hotel staff either. The one thing we can all be sure about is the fact that Bliss body butter is the best. So if you want some free lotion, this is the place to be.

Overall we were very pleased with the hotel. Design wise the hotel is as modern as you can get with Sexy lighting and music throughout the hotel. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were quiet. I had read on here that people could hear noise from the bar downstairs. We were on the 7th floor so we did not run into any problems with noise. We also never heard a peep from our neighbors except for the occasional door closing, but it is a hotel so what do you expect. The room size is exactly what you would expect from a downtown, big city hotel. Any one who has frequented hotels in large cities will find the size of the rooms to be comparable to hotels elsewhere. The staff was extremely helpful and polite. They were truthfully one of the most attentive hotel staff's I have delt with in a while. The concerige was also excellent and showed no frustration with my wife and my difficulty in deciding where we wanted to dine. He ended up recommending a restautrant that was excellent and exactly what we were looking for. The location of the hotel is excellent by being on the edge of downtown and old montreal. A few blocks one way is old montreal, a few blocks the other way is mid town. We could not have asked for a better location. There were only two negatives I had with the hotel. First, while the rainfall showers are \"cool\" and a neat design concept, they really aren't great for actual showering. The water \"falls\"more than it sprays making the water pressure very light by the time it gets to your legs and feet. Also because the water comes straight down it is difficult to rinse arm pits etc. I think they should have tried actual showering in the showers before deciding to instal them in each of the rooms. Also, unless you are staying wih your spouse or significant other you probably won't appreciate the window that is in the shower. When someone is in the shower everyone in the room can see. Be warned. My second complaint isn't a terribly big deal but it is somewhat annoying. On friday night of our stay the hotel's Wunderbar was packed with the typical velvet rope and line of people waiting to get in. I found it annoying that I needed to wait for the distracted bouncers to finish doing their VIP club lists to look at me so I could show them my room key for entry to the hotel. There is no reason as a guest staying at the hotel I should have to wait at all to show my room key to a surly bouncer to gain admittance. The W really should provide a seperate entrance to the club as I found this to be a problem. Otherwise the rooms were great, the location was great, the staff was great (with the exception of the club bouncers) and the price was right.

The room is smaller than you average room, I was a little disappointed with that, but the decoration easily makes up for it. The bed is truly wondeful and the service was distant but nice enough, no complaints. Be advised that the \"wall\" between the shower and the bedroom is actually a glass wall, so it's see-through. I'm not talking opaque, translucent or shaded here, I'm talking clear glass. Great for couples, but just be aware of that if you're taking another kind of trip. Not that this is a family oriented hotel, anyway. Another note on the shower: the water comes from the ceiling, instead of coming from the wall in an angle, like everywhere else.

In fact, as far as the rooms go, this is among the best W's that I have stayed at. I must admit I haven't ordered room service or been to the bars, spa, or restaurant. But the rooms are great. I often reserve a room slightly above the basic room, either by choice or because I make my reservation at the last minute and regular rooms aren't available. Both rooms had comfy beds, great work space, good lighting, and well-made modern furniture. The mini-bar is well stocked, but a little pricey. The bathrooms, however, were a trip in both rooms. Both had some sort of \"peek-a-boo\" aspect. The first, a glass wall between the shower and the bedroom area. The second had just a curtain between the bathroom and the bedroom area, plus a \"window\" above the bath looking into the desk/closet area. I was traveling alone, so no biggie, but with a travelling partner this would have been annoying. I'm not necessarily modest, but prefer my privacy while washing my privates, so to speak. Both times my room overlooked the square in front of the hotel with big windows and versatile window treatments (semi-transparent roller blinds with light blocking curtains). If I remember correctly from my first summer-time stay, the windows open to let in fresh air. (Sub-freezing weather on my latest trip dictated I not bother trying to open the windows on this trip!) The staff have generally been friendly and helpful. My arrival on this latest trip in March was very late due to weather-related flight delays. I arrived at 2:45 AM on a Wednesday night (er, Thursday morning I guess). The door man was cool to me, but saw I had luggage and let me in. Immediately I realized why they had a stern-looking door man. The bar was *packed* and *loud* -- on a late-night Wednesday. Go figure. (Thursday night it was much quieter, by the way.) The person at the check-in desk look dubious when I said I was there to check in. But he got friendlier when he realized I had a reservation and I was a member of SPG's platinum or gold or diamand club or whatever they call it (stayed 10 nights last year at SPG properties. Once I was in my room, it was much quieter. Although the neighorbor woke me in the morning. I could hear his alarm clock through the closed, locked connecting door. Then his alarming lung-clearing hacking coughs. But that was the only noise issue. (The door was definitely the culprit, as opposed to thin walls -- maybe ask for a room with no connecting room?) Other front-desk staff were always friendly, providing directions, etc. and were happy to speak English in French-speaking Montreal. The doormen were friendly as well, including a particularly chipper doorman who helped me with a taxi at 6:00 AM on my way back to the airport.

The room service food was good but not amazing and a little on the expensive side, but we had expected it. But they were always quick at getting the food to our room. The staff were great and always helpful. They would ask us how our day was going, and as we were both smokers the fact that they always had matches on them was a plus for us. At the reception they had a hot chocolate station set up and it was by far the best hot chocolate we had had. Our only problem we had was with the restaurant that they had at the hotel. Though they are not a part of the hotel so I don't blame the hotel it self. We waited almost an hour for our food and they kept bringing us the wrong food, I'm not a very picky person but when you ask for a fruit bowl and they bring you eggs/bacon and hash browns they were a little off.

It's not like everyone had already checked in at 1:30pm! She snarkily replied that I should have asked when I made the reservation in the first place. Well, we made the reservation for both rooms at the same time; did they expect that we wanted to be as far away from each other as possible? Then our room.... beautiful as expected with two double beds, huge bath, shower and the whole Bliss product line as I've come to expect from any W hotel. Unfortunately, our view looked over some kind of courtyard/office where I could see people working away and going up and down the elevator. At the bottom of this atrium is the W bar. Neeless to say we heard the music until the bar closed, sometime around 3 am. Unforgivable, especially that we had our 10-month old daughter with us! My friends had a few issues too. First the barking dog somewhere on their floor (dogs are accepted here). No little chiwawa here, somekind of big dog. But considering, that was probably a pleasant noise compared to the people next door who were enjoying their honeymoon for everyone to hear. So beware paper thin walls are to be expected. Finally, we ordered food from a local reataurant but they forgot plates. I called the front desk for 4 plates. This is the 'Whenever, Wherever\" service you famously here about; they will fulfill any of your desires (within limits of course). The lady at the service desk tried to charge me $8 for the four plates! What?! A bit of negotiating and she let go of the charges.

The W Montreal is all you could want from a sleak modern hotel. First the Good: The staff is absolutely tremendous. They pull the ever difficult trick of being trendy with out being pretentious or snobby. In fact, they are the exact opposite. Every single person on the staff was very friendly (w/o coming off as fake), greeted us coming and going and didn't hesistate to help with anything we needed. The concierges (both Daniel and Marielle) were great with giving us directions, restaurant options, and things to do/see around the city. Bellman were also great with hailing taxis and making us feel very comfortable. Definetly get a pampered feel here. Now to the property itself: It is what you would expect from a W. Nice bar downstairs (although a bit small). They had parties going on Saturday and Wed and had the velvet ropes out but we never felt like it was intrusive. We stayed on the third floor and didn't hear any noise at all. Theres also a more wide open bar on the second floor that plays the same music as downstairs but at lower decibels. Good spot if you want to take a more low key approach or meet someone downstairs and want to take it down a notch. Rooms are very small. Nicely appointed and the bathrooms really make it. Very sexy feel. Again very sleek. Location: Easy walk to old Montreal and all of the touristy sites including the Notre Dame church which is not to be missed. Also very nicely situated across the street from the metro. Montreal's metro is very easy to use as there are only a couple of color coded lines. 10 minute ride to the Plateau section of the City. Now the not so good (much smaller list): The hotel is extremely dimly lit especially the rooms. I know this adds to the look/feel but rooms could have used a little bit more light. Our window faced another building so we kept the drapes closed most of the day. It felt like being in a tomb. You seriously had no idea what time of day it was. Of course, this could be a plus too if you are partying all night and want to sleep all day. As I mentioned the rooms are very small. There seriously isn't much room on either side of the bed. Small even for NYC standards... Valet parking is $37.50 a night. The service was very good but this is a bit much. As another reviewer remarked, $37 is acceptable for NYC but to much for Montreal.

As a Starwood Platinum customer, I normally stay at the Sheraton downtown just off Rene Levesque, but the spectacularly superb location of the W near Old Montreal made this worth trying. It's a great hotel, but there are two major caveats that you need to know before booking there: First, if you have any sort of visual handicap, DO NOT stay here. The low lighting in the lobby, the elevator and the halls on the room floors is brutally low. It's part of the W chain's \"look\", and that's fine. However, I didn't know that until I got there, and my wife is visually handicapped after diabetic retinopathy laser treatments to her eyes over the years, and the result is that low-light situations essentially render her completely blind. (She can't drive at dusk or at nite, for instance). The entrance to the lobby is comprise of black marble steps, and there's no handicap access in the front door. I had to guide my wife into the hotel very carefully so she wouldn't hurt herself by tripping on the steps. Second, the noise from the \"Wunderbar\" night club just off the lobby is brutal. We were on the 5th floor and could still hear it, though thankfully it was muted by the white noise of the air conditioning. I'd guess that anyone on a lower floor would really have a problem with that thundering bass from the club sound system. On the up side, the food was outstanding, the bed was incredibly luxurious (although I could have done without the faux fur blanket....in fact all of the room furnishings were so retro-high tech and retro-stylistic I felt like I was on the 1967 version of the Starship Enterprise with Captain Kirk, except that the cheesy blanket suggested Kirk and I and a Romulan were there to make an outer space porn film).

It is great for couples, and adequate for business travellers but I wouldn't recommend it for families. The Wunderbar was hyped as the \"it\" place but didn't exceed expectations, and the restaurant had great service, delicious food and an extensive wine list but you are looking at ~$250 at least for 2 people. The in-house spa is a nice touch too. In terms of the staff we were treated well 95% of the time, although upon checking in the front desk attendant really only told us our room number and the policy for checking out early - which is never a good sign - but from then on no complaints.

This is not the place i would have chosen myself, so it was very nice to experience something else, on someone elses dollar. The Hotel has a great lobby which is in line with the type of thing you will find in your room... very... unique! It was a great first impression, and fortunately overshadowed the poor service i received during check-in. I arrived at the hotel at approximately 10:30pm and didn't get checked in until about 10:45. Oddly enough there was only one person in front of me, but because there was only one person checking folks in and because the person ahead had all sorts of questions, I pretty much had to stand and wait my turn. The young man checking me in apologized when i walked to his counter, and promptly checked me in very quickly. There were two bouncers manning the door to the \"club\" attached to the lobby who were slow to move when i tried to pass them in order to access the elevator. I looked back as i passed to apologize as my bag got too close to one of the bouncers when i walked by. He was in the process of giving me a dirty look which he did not think i would see. FORTUNATELY, the uniqueness of the room quickly made me forget about the lobby experience!! I opened the door to the room and i was very suprised at the pleasantness of what i found. I was greeted by the sounds of a CD which i guess they have playing for each guest, and i began exploring the room. The bed was absolutely amazing and facilitated 2 excellent nights of sleep! Once i figured out that i could seperate the open concept bathroom from the beds by pulling the curtain closed I began to wind down for the night. UNFORTUNATELY, the second night was party night and the music playing from outside the hotel made it very hard to fall asleep. Good thing the bed was so good that it made up for the hour of lost sleep, listening to a song i didn't quite understand.... :-) The room was amazing!!

Lastly, the most frustrating was when i checked, luckily i checked the bill, there was a $50 dollar charge for the minibar which i did not use. they reversed it. However, about two weeks after i checked out i recieved another bill stating that expenses were incurred after i checked out and charged my credit card $580.00 dollars again for mini bar charges........ the whole mini bar would not even equate to the amount. secondly when i called to complain and get the charges reversed, on hold forever, and when i left messages no one called back. it's a nice hotel but don't believe the HYPE.... there are way better hotels in Montreal and in wayyyyy better locations.", "Date": "February 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cFollow the advice of others...\u201d", "Author": "Davidbignose!", "ReviewID": "UR4445739", "Content": "We stayed here in the first week of January and having read other travellers comments I booked in with a few particular requests.

The room was very comfortable, and as ever the bed first class. The room price whilst not cheap (I am a Starwood card holder) was competitive. What i found very impressive was that the staff all seemed to enjoy their jobs. A few minor things irritated me (such as the free paper not arriving even when i requested it, they went out and bought one!) but their attitude was 100% customer focused. Our friends found their rain shower to lack force and the large clear \"see through\" shower room wall (a sight indeed from the bed!) was a bit of a disappointment. More style over substance. I would go back but like any hotel if you get a crowd of night owls in, the corridors could echo the noise. The weekend we were there we slept very well.
