The hotel rooms are clean and modern - brilliant shower. Rooms could have done with being a little bigger but this is not essential as we spent little time in the hotel room - why would you when there is a beautiful city to see. The beds were a little hard, but this did not disturb our sleep and actually slept very well every night. The reception staff were very friendly - especially the night receptionist.

We decided to stay at the Hesperia Del Port hotel for a couple of reasons, firstly good value and secondly a reasonably good location away from Ramblas but within easy walking distance. When we arrived we were pleased with the hotel, the surrounding area was a bit run down to be honest, but this didn't matter too much. Reception doors were kept closed and entry was via the receptionist letting you in. Was this a sign of trouble we thought? We checked in, through a nice reception with friendly staff and were allocated room 702. Top floor overlooking a park and the road. now I was a bit concerned that the noise from the busy road would be a problem, but I needn't have worried, the windows and the height of the room shut out practically everything. Smallish room, large metal framed bed that squeaked badly with every movement, very small LCD TV. Bathroom, had bidet, toilet, bath sink and shower. Room was clean had a safe (which was not bolted down), a fridge and a wardrobe. A/C was available, although it didn't work, being December you could argue that it wasn't necessary but with the sun shining through the front glass most of the day and it was very warm in the room. There was a reasonable view over to the Olympic stadium area and we did walk there one day, it took about 10 mins up the back roads. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, it was available for \u20ac12 pp so we went down the road where there was a nice cafe serving roles and coffee at a good price. The rooms had free wifi and was great for a few days. the lack of any area except reception with sofa or comfortable chairs mean't there was no real point in being in the hotel for any time longer than necessary. Turning right out of the hotel, leads towards the Apolo theatre on av de parallel. Also any of the side roads on the right side would lead to rambles areas and beyond. Turning left out of the hotel leads down towards the port and the point where cruise ships and ferries arrive. I think this hotel is great for couples on a city break, or businessmen. There are metro stations a short walk away and the taxi cost from the airport was \u20ac35 and \u20ac40 on New years day. As there were 4 of us it was the best way. If it was 2 of us, we may have found an alternative way to the airport if cost only was the important factor.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cCan't faut the location or value\u201d", "Author": "mkh1966", "ReviewID": "UR120499388", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in November.

The room itself was fine, a little on the small side but not a problem if you're out all day sight-seeing. Excellent location, close to the port and two streets away from the bottom of La Rambla so it was ideal for all the major tourist attractions. Breakfast was included in our stay and was ok but it probably would have been better to avoid paying the price and gone to one of the many local bakeries in the surrounding streets. Barcelona generally was fantastic - amazing city, lovely food although if you're in the touristy areas the food and drink can be quite expensive. Also disappointed by the lack of fish restaurants considering it's a sea-side location and considering the quantity of fish available in the local markets. Definitely worth visiting the Mercat De La Boqueria (just off La Rambla) - the whole thing is just breathtaking.

We were enroute to join a mediteranean cruise. We arrive early before check in time and room was not ready. The staff was friendly and kept our luggage until the room was ready. We were able to leave our stuff and explore the city. The location was excellent, literally a five minute walk from the main square and La Ramblas (market with street venodors, entertainers, and shops and cafe). In the main squre you can catch a tourist bus that takes you to all the main attractions around the the city. However we preffered to just walk. Everything was within walking distance from the hotel and if not the subway (metro) was just a 1 min walk away. The hotel staff was good a providing clear explaination and directions. Also they are sure to warn you about pickpockets. SO hold on to ur purses and watch ur pockets! The rooms were very simple, but clean. There was a tv with only one english channel. The Beds were hard and the room was very noisey. At night you could hear ppl talking in the hall or hear ppl flushing their toilets. I was too jetlagg to let it keep me from sleeping though. Our hotel did have a european breakfast however it was not included in the price of our room. Nothing to shout about, just bread, pastries, juice, coffee, butter, jam toast. Thats about it. It was 4 euros per person. For 12 euro you could get cereal yogurt and cold meat, boiled eggs but we didnt bother as we were boarding a ship later that day. Check out was simple at 11am and they kept our bags again so we could explore the city a bit more before boarding the ship. They even called a taxi for us, unfortunatley our taxi ripped us off on the price to the dock as it was only a 5-10 min drive. You could actually walk, but again their are so many pickpockets and its all uphill. So think twice. About a 40 min walk to the ship dock (royal caribbean) The bathroom was modern with shower caps, fresh towels and bar soap. All in all, if you only need a place to stay for one or two nights this place is good however it was a bit expensive for a 3 star but the location was great.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel if you are taking a cruise from the port in Barcelona!\u201d", "Author": "Traveler640", "ReviewID": "UR55079630", "Content": "We stayed just for one night- the price was incredibly cheap for the cleanliness and modern design of the hotel.

The hotel is also right near Las Ramblas, which is a famous tourist shopping street in Barcelona- just keep your wallets close because there are a lot of pick pockets! The only downfall to the hotel itself is that because it is modern in design with tile on all floors and walls; any talking, walking, or closing of doors in the hallway echoes through your room and may prevent a sound sleep if you are a light sleeper. However, if your stay is just for a night or two and then you are cruising, it's a great hotel because we were able to walk to our cruise ship- it was a 45 minute walk, but doable and safe. If you are staying in Barcelona not for cruising but for the city itself, you may want to stay in the heart of the city because there is more shopping and interesting streets that look a lot like Paris in the other section of the city, including the beautiful Gothic Quarter.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Culver City, California", "Title": "\u201cIf you can spend $20 more-avoid this hotel\u201d", "Author": "perely", "ReviewID": "UR49489116", "Content": "The location of this hotel is very close to Las Ramblas (only 5 min to walk), which is good, but doors to the hotel are always closed and are open only by maintaining visual contact with a receptionist.

When we did arrive the receptionist was extremely helpful and her English was definately better than my Spanish. She had plenty of maps and information on where to go which came in really handy. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location. About 400 yards from the metro Paral-lel which gets you to all the major tourist attractions as well as being the place to catch the funicular up to the cable car for a great view over Barcelona. Walk the other way out of the hotel and it's a 2 minute walk to Las Ramblas or the marina. The room we stayed in was room 603 and the one and only negative comment I have about it is that the aircon didn't work very well which wasn't a problem for us in March but if you stay in the summer, it definately would be! The room isn't massive but is ok as a sleepover point. The bathroom had a great power shower cubicle in it which was great after hours of pounding the spanish streets. Other reviews haven't been complimentary about the area but to be honest we had no problems here whatsoever.

When I complained I was told that 'Booking a double is not guaranteed, it all depends on availability. If you wanted a double you should have noted it in the comments on your booking form'. Firstly, the room I selected on the website was a double so why would I need to note in the comments. Secondly, they didn't think the fact that they couldn't accommodate our booking correctly warranted prior notification? It was after all Valentines - two single beds, not exactly romantic! I was then told that they would most likely be able to move us to a double room the following night. After no attempt to offer any compensation, I suggested that maybe we could have a complimentary breakfast due to the inconvenience. The receptionist said she would need to contact her manager and to cut a very long and frustrating story short this began a series of back and forth between several staff members as they referred the situation to others. The major lack of service and constant passing the buck made for a disappointing and frustrating experience at this hotel.
