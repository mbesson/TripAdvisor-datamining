After booking I emailed the hotel to see if I could upgrade to room 602 which was a superior room, they did this at a discounted rate of only 20euro per night. It was amazing it had a oval shaped bath in the corner of the room, a king size bed and walled mount TV with a few English films we managed to find. Cleaners came in everyday, tidied around, refilled the toiletries, changed the towels and also would changed the sheets if you left the note. This room has a huge balcony as it is right on the top floor (6th and there is a lift) it has great views of the roof tops and a table and chairs which you could eat breakfast on if you asked for it to be delivered in the morning. We went downstairs for breakfast, which had croissants, pain au chocolats, bread, cake, crepes, cereals, scrambled egg, sausages, fresh juice, bottle water, coffee and tea. When you were going out the hotel requested you left your key at reception, this is just for safely so keys are not lost and they are quiet heavy with the unique keyrings! The location of the hotel is amazing it is 1minute walk from Opera Metro and also 1minute walk from another metro. Walking distance to Louvre - 10mins, start of champs Elysees 15mins, shopping centre -5mins and plenty of places to eat and shop around Opera. We did not eat or drink in the hotel we always were out, we did try Drouant which is just down the road which is so good! especially the lamb! Would certainly stay here again in future.

So tried again and was welcomed with a thankyou for my review...sigh of relief I did not have to remember everything I said..............except that the review for which I received thanks dates from 2005! C'est la Vie!, still 9 people liked it so lets see if I can do better this time. In fact having re-read my 2005 comments I am not sure if there is a great deal to add, except that nothing has really changed, the hotel still has the nicest staff I have ever encountered, the rooms are constantly refurbished, and the overall feeling is that the owners really care about the welfare of their guests. I was there in early January, for once with my partner (who has insisted on writing her own review) and the room and service were once again five star. I mentioned in my earlier review that I use the Noailles mostly for business. On my last trip in 2011 I failed to reserve at the Noailles early enough and I arrived from a Transatlantic flight to find that Paris was completely full (if you ignore rooms at the so called palaces starting at 1100 euros a night). I had no choice but to curtail my Paris stay and head for the UK later in the day on the Eurostar. What did the Noailles do? They stored my luggage for the day, found me a room for a couple of hours so that I could have a shower and provided me with one of their great breakfasts. I managed to get to two of my meetings and got my Eurostar, tired but very relieved. Service like that is simply gold dust and is one of the reasons why the Noailles continues to sit at the top of my list of places to stay in Europe.

I was not sure where to stay in the city, what area was safe, and read that Paris had many trashy hotels and I do not speak French. I hunted hard to find a hotel with high reviews and this one had so many. The bad few reviews clearly came from customers that must have been in a bad mood because the staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable every chance they could. Our flight was changed so that we had to arrive at 8am putting us at the hotel at 9am. I knew the chance of a room being ready this early was highly unlikely but we thought we could leave our bags. After being greeted warmly by the front desk person, we were told they had a room but it needed to be cleaned. We were told that they would send housekeeping to our room immediately and the room would be ready in an hour. We chatted in the lobby with the staff and the room was ready as promised. The hotel has a charm to it (charm does mean small) but it was so comfortable. The hotel is on a quiet street, just one street each direction to anything you need or want. Super high end shopping and typically shopping is just a few blocks, a short 10-minute walk to the Louvre, and less than \u00bd mile to most anything. Cafes are less than a 2-minute walk and a great breakfast pastry shop right across the street that puts out fresh pastry every morning. The room was on the smaller side but I have stayed in smaller. The room had a queen bed and about 2-feet on either side of the bed. The room had two steps up to walk behind the headboard that led to a large opening door that looked into the courtyard. I slept with my window open every night as the weather was so fantastic. The bathroom is spacious with an oversized stall shower with a wonderful rainfall shower head, separate toilette room and the whole room had amazing lighting. The room had a large Samsung flat screen TV. The TV had two English stations but I did not spend much time watching TV. The hotel also offers a lovely lobby bar and a bartender from Sri Lanka. He made an a fantastic drink and helped with local directions and information on the Metro. I only have nice things to say about this hotel and I would return and recommend it to anyone that asked. I always felt safe, welcome and slept so comfortably in my quite room and amazing shower. I am sure you could find larger rooms but from what I understand, it is hard to find a large room in Paris unless you can pay a super high price for the space. The funny thing, a few nights later in London we stayed in another beautiful but larger hotel and I kept thinking about how I loved the space in Paris and the way it made me feel. My boyfriend said that it was the charm and the staff that made it special not the square feet.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cStay at Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles\u201d", "Author": "Maria Christina f", "ReviewID": "UR123170903", "Content": "Excellent hotel!!! amazing staff!!! a hotel with charm, fantastic location, and mainly full of class!

Situated in the very heart of Paris, near the Opera, the famous shopping centre Galeries Lafayettes and the Louvre, Opera de Noailles is a haven of peace where you can relax and unwind. Being an art lover, I was thoroughly impressed by the ultra-modern design combining art d\u00e9co and the japanese zen both in the rooms and public areas. Upon arrival, our luggage was picked up immediately and sent to our room while check-in was a matter of minutes thanks to the efficient staff at the reception. As soon as we stepped into our room , we were speechless. We really felt like staying at a contemporary art museum, yet. reminiscent of Stendal's Le Rouge et le Noir! Only an artist could have decorated room 307 combining with skill the basic colours - red, black, white - in a modern design. This amazing decor goes hand in hand with comfort. Cleanliness in the room was impeccable! Breakfast was served in a cosy dining-room and consisted of a wide variety of French cheeses, croissants, rolls, pancakes, fruit and cereals, apple-pie(!), jams, scrambled eggs and sausages. Two smiling ladies welcomed us there every morning and made us feel like staying at a friend's home - not a hotel! Some of the best restaurants in Paris are situated at a short walking distance from the hotel-such as Le Petit Colbert which we loved and the japanese restaurant Nikko next door not to mention a wide range of bistrots and bars in the area. We would have loved a gourmet restaurant in the hotel, though. We would like to thank all the staff for being so kind and polite making our stay such a great pleasure.

There is also a sign on the fridge - \"do not use the fridge for your own personal use\" ummm arnt we paying for the room and the facilities? Ohwell the fridge wasnt even cold anyway. The third morning we woke up to no hot water in the room. I called reception and was rudely advised it was a problem across the whole hotel. There was no apology. This was not rectified for 24 hours and we were not offered a discount or a breakfast or anything. The next day I needed to find a department store to buy something, and asked where it was and for reception to call a taxi. The man at the counter was extremeley rude and told me he would not call me a taxi! I asked why and he said it was a 5 min walk. It was actually seven stops on the metro. Next time I will just walk to the taxi rank myself. For other travellers to know- there is nowhere to get breakfast before 10am on weekdays around this area and weekends hardly anything open. Maybe try to get the hotel breakfast included- that was the only highlight and the staff were welcoming.

We had two standard rooms with modern decoration and very quiet with nice beds. These rooms were very tight on space for two people. The shower area was separated from the room by only a frosted glass screen with curtain and the floor was a bit slippery when wet. Nowhere to hang towels. The main irritations were:The double doors on each of the two wardrobes fortunately had no handles, so with only a slot in one door so we were constantly having to open that door in order to reach inside and open the other door. There is no space for handles so why don't they put a slot in each of the four doors so you don't keep breaking your nails? Inside, the safe door opened in the opposite direction to the wardrobe door necessitating opening both doors to get to the safe. A stylish but clumsy chair took up much of the room and would not fit under the desk so I left it in the corridor for all of our stay which actually allowed us to walk around a bit! I moved the desk along the wall so that the wardrobe doors could actually open without hitting it! Too many light switches were confusing and the bedside lamps were hot metal which caused me to burn my arm. The window (with sunshade) opened inwards so anything on the window sill got knocked off by it. As we had to put one suitcase on there we were constantly fighting the window and suitcase. Room design was clearly made for show and not practical use. Our rooms were nice but a very tight squeeze so I suggest that you get a slightly larger room. We couldn't as the hotel was full.

We had just come from London on a long vacation, and as a result had several pieces of luggage and lots of other stuff that a family gathers when traveling with small children. The hotel itself is ok -- albeit VERY small rooms compared to what we in the US are used to. It is located on a really small and narrow street and the taxi van had a hard time unloading our luggage, as he was blocking the entire one lane road. Check in was fine. The staff did indeed politely help us with the internet connection (which is somewhat unwieldy). Families should be aware however that there is no real room service at this hotel. Our kids like to eat what kids typically eat, and we also have a severe allergy in the family to a certain ingredient in food, and the hotel front desk attendant told us there was no way to order anything special as the hotel has no kitchen and just brings food in from surrounding restaurants. That was annoying, but not a deal breaker. The biggest and most shocking problem came at checkout. First, they were extremely aggressive in making us check out at noon -- a hotel employee literally chased us out into the street as we were heading to breakfast on the morning we were due to check out and flagged us down over a block away from the hotel to rudely remind us that we MUST be out by noon. Next, we were traveling back to London by train and needed a large taxi (probably mini-van) to take us to the train station after check out as four of us and five bags were not going to fit into a small taxi. I spoke to the hotel front desk at 7:00 am -- and was told that they would gladly book some outside car service to pick us up that afternoon at 3:30 so we could make our 5:00 train. A few minutes later they called back and told me that they could not get any car booked in advance and we would instead have to be back at the hotel about 15 minutes before the time we wanted to leave and they would call a taxi for us then. I didn't like the sound of that but I was repeatedly assured that this was NOT a problem. We returned to the hotel after lunch and made sure we were there by 3:00. When I walked in, they would not answer my questions about the cab, and instead insisted I pay the bill, which exceeded 2,000 Euros (thus this is not a cheap hotel). I did so. The woman at the front desk then told us to wait in the lobby and she would call the taxi. After about 20-30 minutes she casually walked over to us and said, \"Its Impossible. I have called two companies and there are no cabs.\" I was stunned and VERY angry. I asked her what she suggested we do with our young children and our luggage and our non-refundable, non-changeable train tickets. Her response was to that we should all walk to the area near the opera (which was three blocks away) and flag down a cab for ourselves! I told her that was unacceptable, as we had found it nearly impossible to get a cab at all during our four days in Paris. She could not have cared less. It seemed quite apparent that since we had paid our bill, she was done providing us with any type of reasonable service. I have travelled pretty much around the world and have never gotten such horrible service at the most critical time in a trip -- to leave us with our kids and luggage just stranded in Paris with the clock ticking on our train tickets was a complete disgrace! There are many, many hotels in this area that all seem just as nice if not nicer than this hotel, and I suggest that if you are going to Paris for your first trip, or with a family, or if you need anything other than a closet sized hotel room with no view, then you should pick somewhere else to stay.

There are two main bouelvards within 10 minutes walk with probably 30-40 restaurants. You can walk to most attractions and Paris is quite a poretty city.

He booked our trip back in December of 2009 for May of 2010. We booked first class for a treat and I picked out this hotel for it's reviews and location. When we left Canada, we were so excited to get to Paris. When we arrived at the hotel, they told us that the agency that had booked our package with had cancelled our hotel reservations. The hotel even called them when they received the cancellation to make sure and were told yes.(Strange that we had 1st class airline tickets to France with no hotel room). Anyway, with no sleep and arriving at 9.30 am on a Saturday in Paris, we could do absolutely nothing until the agency in Canada opened up 6 hours later. The staff at the hotel took us in, locked up our baggage for us, offered us breakfast and let us sit in the lounge area. They could have said \" We are sorry and can\"t do anything for you\", You have to leave, but they didn't! We waited until the agency opened in Canada and were told that there had been a glitch made in the computer system cancelling our hotel. They would try to find us another 4 star hotel in Paris. We waited and waited and waited, they couldn't re-book at this hotel because they were full. They couldn't find anything else either in the area. By 8 o'clock that night, we were still sitting in the lounge area of this hotel with nothing from the agency. We hadn't eaten because we didn't want to miss a telephone call from the agency. By this time, I was so exhausted that I started to cry! (Which I never do). Luckily for me a staff member contacted the Hotel Manager from the Golden tulip Opera de Noailles on a Saturday. She came by and tried to console me(us). She said that they had no room that night but maybe could try to do something on Monday when things opened up. She hugged me and told me not to worry. In the meantime the agency called the hotel and asked to speak to my husband. They had finally found us another 4 star hotel in another part of Paris for 3 nights. We took a cab over there. Now when you compare apples to apples it should be the same! This other 4 star hotel (you would think would be almost the same) was a dump and I mean a dump! There were no places nearby to eat and on top of that, I told my husband never mind, let's just go to the bar and have a drink. Trying to relax sipping on a beer (it's now 11.00pm in Paris), what do I see running across the floor: a mouse, a rat , call it what you want! When I told the worker there about it, he just shrugged! We tried to sleep, with all of our clothes on, on top of the bed, because it was so dirty, but of course sleep alluded us! We got up first thing in the morning and we decided to go back to the hotel Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles to maybe get lucky and be able to sleep there (even if it was on a Sunday). There was no way I was staying at that other hotel regardless of whether or not they could take us! We went back and luckily for us, they could fit us in for at least the next 9 days of our trip. We were told that on the last 2 days they were fully booked and that we would probably have to move again, but they told me that the Manager would be in tomorrow and would try to take care of us! We were so relieved! They showed us our room, which was a dream! Clean, a marble bathroom, Zenly decorated with a garden in the middle of the building when we looked down from our windows (that opened). After showering, my husband and I passed out until around 8.00 pm that day! We never heard a sound while sleeping all afternoon either. On Monday the Manager and her assistant came to see us at Breakfast, hugged us and told me that they had arranged it with the agency to be able to keep us for the whole next 12 days of our stay! What angels, I have never seen service above and beyond the call of duty as I have with the people at this hotel! On top of it, about 1 week into our stay, I realized that the Manager and her staff had upgraded our original room from a standard to a Deluxe without telling us and doing it without having to! The whole time we were guests at this hotel, the staff called restaurants to make reservations for us, the Management suggested the best places to go to, for what we were looking for, they booked sight seeing tours for us and again, everyone from the cleaning ladies, to the waiters, to the desk clerks up to Mangaement were so polite and helpful that we felt truly special! I know for a fact that our trip was a wonderful experience because of them! I will go back to Paris next year with my adult daughter and I will definately be staying at the Golen Tulip Opera de Noailles! They say it is a 4 star but compared to the other 4 star hotels in Paris, for us it is a 20 star hotel!

I must say the Golden Tulip chain has a reputation for being a top class hotel, and this trip proved just that! Situated down a small narrow road, the Golden Tulip is a hidden gem, opposite is a Gym (for all you fitness fanatics), and a couple of cafes surrounding it. Entering the hotel, the reception are more than friendly, spoke perfect english, and allocated us to ur rooms. There is only one lift and is really small, maximum 2 people, but there were also stairs that spiralled upwards. When located to our rooms (we booked two rooms), we found that we had in fact been place opposite each other (perfect!), which also had a door with a lock in the hallway which seperated our rooms to the rest of the other rooms on the floor (even more perfect as we didnt have to keep our bedroom doors locked, we could just go in and out of each others rooms lol!) Both rooms consisted of twins beds, dressing table, built-in closet and a flat screen wall mounted TV. Plenty of space for two people - 3 would definetly be a tight squeeze! The decor was modern, keeping neutral colours: cream/grey. The bathroom had to be the most perfect thing about the rooms, built with glass doors surrounding it (of course not seethrough lol), with one room having a HUGE walk-in shower, and the other having a bath tub! Everything was centrally located, so and central station was a 3 minute walk away! The tube stations are pretty simple to get your head around (like London's) and workers were more than friendly! There are a number of internet cafes around the Hotel, also the Hotel provided Wi-Fi for a fee, I think based on hourly rates (can't quite remember!)

The air conditioning works well, and we had four great night's sleep; despite the central location, the hotel is quiet. However, that pretty much sums up the hotel's entire offering - a quiet place to sleep. There is no atmosphere in the hotel at all, and this means that if, like us, you see the hotel as part of your holiday (rather than simply a room with a bed in) you're going to be disappointed - especially when the rate on the door is over \u00a3250 per night for a standard room. There is no hotel restaurant, so don't expect to eat in here. You can get breakfast for an extra \u00a315 per head, which is hugely expensive and not worth it - cereals, fruit, croissants, etc. The hotel bar is tiny, only open until 10pm and possibly the most expensive we've ever seen - a Jack Daniels & Coke, and a Whiskey & water cost a staggering \u00a330. The staff are helpful, professional and friendly - but given they've got nothing to do other than hand out room keys, they must also be incredibly bored.

We noticed that the hotel was named the Hotel of the Year by the Golden Tulip chain, we could see why. Our courtyard-facing room had two twin beds pushed together as a king, and it worked perfectly. Great feather bedding and very comfortable mattresses gave us great nights of sleep. The courtyard protects the interior rooms from the city noise, and it was so quiet that we were able to sleep with our windows open every night and enjoy the great spring air. There was plenty of closet and drawer space as well. The bathroom, while small, was servicable and had a hairdryer and all of the toiletries one needs. One random tip for the ladies - the water in Paris is very hard and it made removing eye makeup with soap and water a very frustrating and difficult task. Taking along some makeup remover is highly advised. The only thing that we missed in terms of the room was having an additional mirror outside of the bathroom to make it easier for two people to get ready at the same time. Having an elevator was terriffic and much easier than hiking the stairs. We did not eat at the hotel, as there were many cheaper alternatives closeby, but we did buy wine several times from the bar and enjoyed it in the courtyard before bed. One block over there are many restaurants to choose from, as well as a market to pick up anything you may need. Cassa Bella was one of our favorites - delicious Italian food at a reasonable price. We also tried the Chinese restaurant on the next block and it was great as well. Although it seems wrong to eat fast food with all of the great food in Paris, a McDonalds is very close and was an easy place to stop for drinks and snacks when we were in a hurry. Internet access is available through a PC in the lobby on a pay-as-you-go basis - and we were glad that we hadnt lugged our laptop over with us. It was much easier to just pay the nominal fee for the 15 minutes a day that we needed. The staff was very kind and was able to help us with directions, reservations, and cab service whenever we needed it. Overall, this was a great hotel and we would return.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Juneau, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cClean, conveniently located--but there are better choices for budget travellers.\u201d", "Author": "akpenguini", "ReviewID": "UR27479167", "Content": "I chose this hotel for a one-night stay in Paris based on Tripadvisor reviews and its proxmity to the Roissybus stop near Opera Garnier. It's a perfectly nice, clean hotel with polite staff. Personally, I didn't care for the Japanese decor, with its hard surfaces and partial partitions between the bedroom and the bathroom (the toilet is in a separate, closet-like room but there's nothing to deaden sound between rooms). What I liked least was being nickeled and dimed to death for extras like breakfast (another 15 Euros per person) and Internet use. Since Internet access was a major reason for selecting this 4 star hotel over the many 2 or 3 star options nearby, I was disappointed and annoyed. I also thought it was rather tacky to provide mini-fridges in the rooms posted with big signs indicating they are intended only for the in-room bar, not for the convenience of the guest. Choose this hotel if you really enjoy the novelty of Asian decor (or if it feels homey to you) and for its convenient location, cleanliness, and polite English-speaking staff. Avoid it if, like me, you are undismayed when staff in French hotels primarily speak French; are comfortable hauling your own bag up the stairs; and could feed yourself opulently for a day on 15 Euros invested at the local marketplace, provided you were permitted to make use of the room's refrigerator.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Deffe", "ReviewID": "UR24311077", "Content": "I booked this hotel in early februari, when planning a romantic getaway with my girlfriend. The staff was very friendly, immediatly showing us around a bit in the lobby, pointing out where the elevator and the bar were and offering to carry our luggage despite the fact that we only had one rucksack and a sports bag with us because our trip would only last two days. When checking out we had the ability to leave our luggage in the bagagerie (luggage room) for the rest of the day. The hotel room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom (which accomodated a toilet, sink and a bathtub with shower) was very pleasing. The only negative thing I found was the lack of a shower curtain, but this isn't much of a problem as long as you take care not to splash around too much. There was a widescreen tv in our room, with a ton of French tv channels but also BBC World and CNN. As a Belgian neither really appeals to me, but I can assume Brithish or American visitors would appreciate the ability to keep up with affairs in their home country. There's also a possibility to have wired or wireless internet in the hotel, provided by Swisscom. You can buy a voucher for this at the reception desk. The breakfast buffet consists of a variety of things you'd expect to see in a typical French breakfast. There's a possibility to have breakfast delivered to your room as well. On a sidenote, there's a leisure club across the street where you get 30% off as a guest in Op\u00e9ra de Noailles. Smokers will be happy to know that there's a tobacco shop down the street as well (Five euros a pack). Smoking in the hotel is obviously prohibited, but there's a little courtyard where you can smoke if you must. Getting to the hotel from the Gare du Nord is pretty easy using the metro using lines 4 and 3, stopping at Place de L'Op\u00e9ra. Actually, practically anything in Paris is easily accessible using the subway system, as long as you follow the signs pointing to the various platforms properly and learn how to read the maps that are posted around the subway stations.

It's in the heart of a very nice and live full, luxurious area of shops and restaurants, and very close (15 minutes walking) to the Luvre and the beautiful Tuillery gardens. It's convenient location allows you to get to most of the sites by foot, and it's friendly area allows you to come back even late at night and to feel safe.

The bed is big and comfortable, there's a lot of closet room for your things, and everything looks very good. We were very impressed by the room when we got in, you can tell that the standard is very high. The rooms are air-conditioned, and well furnished. The bathroom is also impressively decorated and clean, with 2 exceptions: 1. The door between the bathroom and the room itself is made of glass (even though you can't see anything), so be prepared for a little intimacy boost :) 2. Our room didn't have shower curtain and shower-head holder on the wall, but we understood from the reception it's like that only in some of the rooms. All with all, it was a great room to come back to in the end of the day. Breakfast, Staff and Facilities: The staff is very nice and English-speaking. There's always someone at the reception, and they are willing to help with everything. The breakfast was a very pleasant surprise - it's very rich, with lots of cheese types, cereal, meat, croissants, etc. And all is delicious :) Definitely a good way to start your day. We highly recommend to take it (Our deal was 170 Euros per night, including breakfast). You can have breakfast in the room with no extra charge.

They weren't being intentionally noisy, and the noise couldn't be helped, but it wake us up. Alright if you are planning on getting up at that time, but not if you want a lie in!

I saw the hotel owner helping another American tourist whose passport had been stolen. As the tourist was panicking, the hotel owner calmed her down and assured her everything will be ok.

On arrival our greeting was not terribly warm and it took a considerable time for our booking to finally be acknowledged and to be shown to our room. Obviously the building was not designed as a hotel so there is only a tiny lift or narrow staircase to use. Our room was very small and functional with no real sophistication or specific quality although there was a great balcony. The real issue for me was the bathroom - this had been crammed into the room by putting a very thin and simple dividing plastic/glass wall! Not only did this make the room even smaller, but being frosted plastic/glass it didn't exactly allow for much discretion! The bath and shower itself was also old, tiny and unimpressive. In short the room was terrible in my opinion. Two other issues I had were the fact that the bar closes at 22:00 - the bedrooms are not nearby so I just couldn't see the logic and the breakfast was simply awful!

While the room is small, it is in step wityh European design, it is clean and wonderfully designed to make it livable. The staff is friendly and accomodating. They were truely human. The beds are comfortable and lighting in the room is perfect. Did I say how clean everything was? The elevator is small and you get to meet the other guests. The shower is a challenge for Americans, but we were able to keep clean without too much of a mess. We ate at the cafe on the corner and saved a bit of money. With the American dollar in the tank it was worth walking the 15 steps. They were friendly too. There is a Metro Stop a block away, it is closer than Opera and is the 4 Sept. station. Coming out of the Metro go left one block and make left and you are there. Buy the ten trip Metro package. There is a great bakery up the street too. Shopping is three blocks away and there is a bus that goes to the airport nearby. I love Paris, my oh my do I love Paris because of my stay at this Tulip hotel.", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co Down", "Title": "\u201cLoved GT Opera De Noailles\u201d", "Author": "mcat19", "ReviewID": "UR6347864", "Content": "Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles is perfectly located in central Paris. From CDG take the Roissy bus (approx.\u20ac8) and it is only a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. Opera is a fantastic area for cafes and restaurants and shopping is only a few minutes walk at Haussman/Gallaries Lafayette! Opera Metro is nearby. The hotel is clean, warm and safe and is perfect for a base in Paris. While the triple room is small for three people it is sufficient- we stayed three days and it was more than fine. Breakfast is good and plentiful! Unfortunately, work is ongoing on the Spa facilites (but no noise disturbance) and it was closed, but will open again soon. A brilliant place to stay and a good base to see the sights! Staff are helpful and friendly, rooms are clean and quiet and location is fantastic! Recommend to couples, families or business travellers. Will certainly use again on next trip to Paris. It is worth remembering four star in Paris is not quite four star elsewhere! 8.5/10", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cGood value, nice hotel, kindly staff\u201d", "Author": "David38", "ReviewID": "UR6314719", "Content": "Perfect location, quiet, nice new and old furnitures.

The decoration of the room, the atmosphere of the lobby and the quality of the breakfast made the stay unique and the price was incredibly reasonnable compared to the standing of this hotel.
