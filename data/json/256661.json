We picked it based on its location; it was only a few hundred metres from the hotel to the main part of town where the triathlon was running (and swimming, and cycling). We were pretty happy with the place - the shower was a little temperamental and would have benefited from a wipedown with some bleach to get rid of a little mould that was growing in the grout, and the bed was a bit harder than we'd have liked, but it was clean enough and for the money (booked through Wotif) we were happy. No cooking facilities apart from a jug and microwave but we didn't pay for that. Apart from being close to where the tri was held, it was in just a few minutes' walk of Sydney's main shopping areas as well, and we were happy to discover the free city shuttle bus, which you can get from the bus stop round the corner at Martin Place.

If you're looking for an elegant hotel to relax in while on holiday, this would not be a good choice; however, if you are looking for an affordable (for Sydney) hotel that's within walking distance of many attractions, then this hotel is a wonderful choice. Our room was pretty basic, but very clean, very quiet, and a decent size for our family of three. We loved that it had a built in kitchenette, with a small fridge- perfect for having cereal with milk and juice in our room every morning. The bathroom was nice, with the best water pressure that we have ever experienced at any hotel- not sure if this was a fluke, but we loved it! There's a free downtown shuttle bus (the 555) that is just minutes away, at the back of the hotel- it takes you to the Circular Quay, the Martin Place shopping district, etc...we enjoyed taking it for a full tour on the first day, to get a feel for the city. Just note that it only runs late morning until late afternoon, and can get a bit crowded. Note also that there's a nice little food court just minutes away, underground at the Martin Place station entrance behind the hotel- perfect for coffee and a snack, or breakfast. Best of all, the service here was wonderful, with a very friendly staff. One of the staff members was so helpful, as she tried to find an alternative tour for us after ours was canceled the night before. Also, they offered to do a few loads of laundry for us when the guest washing machine broke down- we were very grateful!

We booked direct with the hotel and paid a little over A$200 per night. We had our 7 year old daughter with us and the room had a double bed in it and a fold out sofa bed. The room was quite small and with the three of us plus our luggage it felt very cramped as there is only a small chest of drawers and a very narrow wardrobe space. There were quite a few issues with our room which given the price of the room we were a bit annoyed about. First, when we opened the sofa bed we discovered that the sheets on it were dirty as they were full of food crumbs and hairs. Second of all, the shower when turned on screeched and groaned and was so noisy plus the actual shower head had to be held up in a certain position as it kept dropping down while you were showering. The bathroom floor was a bit dirty too in the corners and beside the toilet with bits of hair and debris. Our air con did not work properly, it wa set on 17 degrees Celsius but there was no way that the room was that cool, it was cooler in the corridors than the actual room and at night it felt hot and stuffy in the room. The blanket on the bed is one of those itchy woolen types and the bedspread had a large brownish stain on it in a very visible spot. As we were only staying at the Travelodge for 2 nights we did not bother to complain, we really only needed a place to sleep as we were out all day anyhow. But, for the price of the room I certainly expected a better standard as I have stayed all over Australia and overseasin hotels in a similar price range and experienced much nicer and better maintained rooms. I would not stay at the Travelodge again nor would I recommend them to anyone. The only saving grace was that the staff were very pleasant and helpful during check in and check out and that the hotel is located in a quiet street in a good location to transport and sightseeing in Sydney.

I got an inside room facing a covered courtyard and apart from not seeing what the weather would be like on a day-to-day basis, the room was darkish. Furthermore, there were no refreshments in the mini fridge on arrival, whereas at Wynyard, there was plenty (coffee, tea, biscuits, chips, chocolate, water, wine, etc). I paid $25 extra a night to stay at this hotel than the Wynyard one (granted I got the Wynyard deal on special) and I feel that I did not get my money's worth. Room service consisted of placing an order with an outside restaurant (the hotel does not seem to have a kitchen, the Wynyard one does) and then waiting an hour and a half for it to come (wrong meal delivered, but not the hotel's fault). On the positive side, the hotel is centrally located and close to the shopping precinct and only a 15 walk from the harbour. Also, there didn't seem to be a fan in the bathroom, which got very sticky. I left the bathroom door closed when showering as I didn't want to set off smoke detector alarms.

I am confused by another review who was on the same 8th floor as my room and at the same time, because I never once experienced the smells they noted in either my room or the hall.

The climate control system in my room worked perfectly. Location was spectacular, right beside parks so you can go running down towards museum and botanical garden with only hassling with a couple of lights. Everything seemed to be within reasonable walking distance. I did not use the NSW club that takes up the bottom floors at all. I most highly recommend this hotel to a budget minded traveler who wants a nice, convenient, clean, quiet room.

It was very quiet indeed and we never heard any noise from outside. The room was fairly small and was mostly taken up with the king bed but there was room for an armchair and a small table and 2 chairs to eat at. But there was no drawer space and only a very small cupboard to hang clothes in. Everything was clean and looked to be fairly new. The nice bathroom only had a shower which we find preferable to climbing in and out of a bath to have a shower. Plenty of hot water with good pressure.

That's fine at this price point, as, even if you're a tourist, it's still convenient. The ground floor doubles as the entrance to a gaming club so don't expect any glitz or glamour in the lobby (but again, that's in the price!). Check-in was ok, though rather spoilt by being told there was a 1.5% surcharge for using a credit card. Very cheeky, and the first time I've come across this in a first-world country for decades. The clerk mumbled something about \"banks\", but all banks charge merchants the world over for credit card charges - it's a cost of doing business - and it's unacceptable for a hotel to chisel an extra charge from its guests for this. It's like levying an extra charge for clean laundry. The room was perfectly comfortable, with a small kitchen area and good work space. There was a kettle, but no long bath (only a shower - however, an excellent shower with lots of power and stable hot water flow). The bathroom and the room were both well lit. The LAN port (clearly marked \"data\") didn't work, and neither did the phone. I had to schlep down to reception to sort it out, to be told (in a \"sigh... some people just don't understand technology\" tone of voice) that if I connected a data cable to the data port it wouldn't work, and would disable the phone to boot. Annoying. The wireless internet is slow and expensive (A$20/day) but it does work. Given that you're face to face with office blocks, you need to use the net curtains unless you feel like some performance art to entertain the office workers! There are also good blackout curtains if you're jetlagged or terminally hungover. The windows don't open but the aircon controls worked fine. The first bill the hotel prepared for me charged my three times for 24 hours' internet connection (for an overnight stay). Although they fixed it quickly it would have saved time and paper if they'd checked first.

The location can't be beat as you are a half-block from busy Martin Place with a subway station, and Circular Quay is also a short distance away (5 mins by bus, 15-20 mins walking). In fact all of downtown is pretty much within walking distance. The rooms are slightly small but very nice and clean. I stayed in 2 rooms, one on the 9th floor and one on the 7th.

If you like rugby, there is no doubt this is the place to stay as you can rub shoulders with people involved in the sport! The in-room internet was a little pricey at $12/hour so I used the business center computers instead which cost $6/hour.

It didn't seem to affect my sleep, but beware. Also, this area closes up early and there aren't a lot of dinner restaurants to be found.

It was clean and the furnishings were modern and did not look worn. The carpet seemed new - deep, soft and clean. The water pressure and hot water were good, and the shower/bathroom had plenty of room. The shower floor is flush with the rest of the bathroom, which may improve accessibility for some people. The was some longer-term dicolouration of the grouting in the shower, but despite this, it looked very well cleaned. Everything in the kitchenette looked spotless (no stray crumbs in the cutlery drawer or spots of other guests' dinner in the microwave). The kitchenette is basics only - just for reheating a meal, not for cooking up your own (e.g. the implements are eating cutlery only and there is no toaster; no can opener either). The fridge was small but clean. You could fit a few ice blocks in the freezer, but nothing big. I really liked the fact there was no in-room mini-bar. The bed was basic. I hate those super-soft hotel beds you get in 4- & 5-star places. This was a firm bed with no sagging, covered with a thin mattress protector. It had crisp, clean sheets and a good-quality but well-used wool blanket. At home, I love these blankets, but not so keen in hotels, where I assume they are re-used between guests. That said - the blanket looked clean & I couldn't fault it. The pillows were newish, big and soft. The whole bed was covered with a modern but unobtrusive coverlet, with some extra throw pillows for day use, and the whole effect was clean and modern. The TV was flat-screen, with the basic free channels (but not their free digital counterparts) plus Fox Sports, plus a couple of other Fox channels. It didn't work when I arrived, so I called the desk and within 5 minutes the receptionist had come up and fixed it for me with no fuss (just a cord that had come out when the room was last cleaned). The lighting in the room is excellent. Sometimes the mood lighting in hotels is no good for working, but there are good strong lights above the bed, which is where you have to work because there is no desk. This is the biggest drawback of the room for business travellers, but working on the bed was not too bad. There was a power outlet next to the bed. The lack of a desk speaks to the smallness of the room. It wasn't claustrophobic, but was on the small side. I didn't find it detracted from my visit. Internet was expensive. You can use the in-hotel wifi or ethernet for approx $11.95 (?) per hour, or Telstra wifi for $5 for 15 mins, $8 for 30 mins (Telstra is slightly more expensive than the in-house provider for an hour). I used the Telstra service for short bursts and it worked well. You could control the heating and cooling in your own room with a digital thermostat/fan control. This worked well in my room and I was very comfortable. It was not too noisy - a sort of white noise in the background that made me feel like I was on a spaceship on an episode of Star Trek. I requested a quiet room if possible, and they listened. I was given a room at the very end of a hallway, far away from the lifts, and with only one neighbour. The room was fantastically, serenely quiet, with just the odd bit of noise when someone nearby opened/closed a door. The view I had was of offices on the opposite side of the street - pleasant and inoffensive. The location is great. I didn't have time on my work trip to sight-see, but could see quite a few sights just by wandering near the hotel on my way home in the evenings. The hotel is smack-bang next to a Lindt chocolate shop & cafe (joy!!) and the Channel Seven studio is 100 metres away at the end of the street (you know, where people peer in the glass at Martin place and make faces behind the Sunrise crew). The next street over has St James' church, Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney Hospital, NSW Parliament - just a beautiful spot to stay. The hotel seems to be in the legal district, and since Phillip St is not too wide, there wasn't too much traffic. There are a couple of supermarkets within 5 mins walking distance, and it's close to a couple of train stations (Martin Place and St James) if you want to get there from the airport on the train. Highly recommended - I will definitely stay here in future. I would even recommend it for personal trips where you are going to be out and sightseeing a lot. It's not the place to go for a romantic break where you want a bit of luxury and to spend a lot of time in the room, but it's great value for other purposes.

We were quite nervous about booking 3* hotel but were were on an unexpected trip to Sydney and hence on a very tight budget. The staff were very good and helpful; they had met special request we had made for a quietly sited room. The hotel was very clean and the small kitchenette was good and helped with our tight budget. I consider this hotel to be more 4* than 3* in terms of the service it provides. Really liked the \"wet room\" style bathroom. Room/bed comfortable and there was adequate storage for our one week stay. The hotel is in a very good location for both walking to central Sydney main attractions, and for public transport to head further out. High speed internet available at a reasonable cost. Main Tips: Walk just one block down to find the Circular Route \"Free\" bus which takes you through to Central Station (when we were in Sydney the bus ran from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm but 9.00 pm on Thursdays). If visiting Blue Mountains on an independent trip, buy your ticket at the local tube station just beside the Hotel. This return ticket will then take you right through for the same cost as making your way to Central Station, then buying your Blue Mountain train ticket. The \"Convenience Store\" just along from the hotel is convenient but a bit expensive.

I would never stay there again, nor would I ever recommend it to someone else. I arrived at around 9pm and found an unprepossessing entrance to a Leagues Club (for our international visitors, think of a very noisy, dingy bar with a rows and rows of poker machines). Reception was off to one side, and the entrance to a cafe was next to that, so that anyone dealing with the receptionist on the left had to move away from the counter any time someone wanted to enter or leave the cafe. I soon wished that I had nevertheless been served by the left-hand receptionist, because the right-hand one told me that they had decided to book me into a different hotel in an adjoining suburb and would call me a cab, as they did not have a room for me. However, the left hand receptionist just kept checking people into rooms. When I pointed this out, my receptionist said that the hotel had tried to call and tell me they were putting me somewhere else. I know for an absolute fact that this is not true. I was in my office all day and had no voicemail, the same applies to my receptionist, and any diverted calls go to a business unit which is staffed so that phones are never unattended. There were no calls from the hotel (which also had my mobile phone number and email address). I said that I was tired, it had just taken me an hour to find the cab that brought me there, and that in any event I had only booked this hotel because of its proximity to the meeting, so it was not acceptable to move me to another location. On top of which, the room had been paid for in advance and I had the hotel's faxed receipt and acknowledgement with me. For literally thirty minutes the woman kept me standing at the counter while she rang various people asking if she could give me a room. Finally I said I would accept a room elsewhere if it was within a two blocks of my meeting. She then kept me standing for another thirty minutes while she rang various other hotels. As the left hand receptionist checked more people in. I asked why there were rooms for other people and not for me and she could only say that the hotel had tried to call - which as I say I knew absolutely was untrue. Finally (I was very tired and hungry by now and tired of standing in heels) I asked if I took the room in the suburbs, would the hotel pay for the taxi back to my meeting in the morning. The recptionist looked shocked by this suggestion. She then went back to a small room, made another phone call, and came back and told me they did have a room for me after all. By the time I got into my room, therefore, it was after 10pm and the hotel restaurant was closed. The room contains a menu for a restaurant delivery service but that too closed at 10pm. There was no minibar or any similar amenities in the room. There are some vending machines on the next level down so I used the last of my change to get a packet of chips for dinner. So I was now starving hungry as well as thoroughly cranky and tired. The room was quite hot and dark and the furnishings very basic. The bathroom was quite big but had no bath and it was not as clean as it could have been. Towels were quite small and the only amenities were a single small cake of soap and a bottle of hotel shampoo. Absolutely no way is this a 3.5 star hotel - it's barely a 2 star. I had a shower and then tried to watch TV, but the remote didn't work (the batteries were operating, but it wouldn't move from the movie menu). So I read the book I had brought with me but as the bulb in the bedside light was out there wasn't that much point. (I did at that point wonder if the room was in fact out of commission for repairs etc and I had been put in it for lack of another, but in that case I should have been told and offered a discount. The bed was quite hard and uncomfortable, and the curtains do not adequately creen out light so that the glare woke me early that I would have liked. When I checked out, the morning receptionist insisted the room had not been paid for. Again I could show her the faxed receipt and acknowledgement from the hotel to my company but she insisted in the face of this that the hotel had no record pf payment and insisted I sign against my credit card and she would check later whether my company had in fact paid. With misgivings I signed, as I did not want to be late for my meeting, but in fairness I am able to say that my credit card was never charged.

The location is excellent - as others have mentioned, it's above the RSL on Phillip Street so well placed for shopping, sightseeing and entertainment. There is a little street noise but I believe this is the is acceptable when staying in the city centre. Nothing that will keep you awake for hours. The room itself is clean and tidy, everything one is likely to need when spending most time elsewhere. Staff are friendly, and overall this Travelodge is recommended. One thing to note - car parking in the city centre, the deal at this location is very good but still expensive at AUD32 for 24 hours.", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value at Travelodge Sydney Martin Place\u201d", "Author": "sburns57", "ReviewID": "UR3942765", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in September 2005. We were very pleased with this hotel. The room was immaculately clean, and the bed very comfortable. There was a small kitchenette with a sink, microwave, fridge and coffee/tea making facilities. The room also had a table and chairs, an easy chair and flat screen TV. All of the furnishings were in good condition. We were on the 7th floor and did not experience any noise from the other rooms. The NSW club is on floors 1 - 4 and is very rowdy over on the weekends. As hotel guests you can go into their bars and facilities, but we did not. We did go to the Phillips St. Bisto located in the hotel. Excellent value; fairly good food and low prices for Sydney. Their Thai restaurant is on the 2nd floor, but is only open for lunch I believe. We didn't try it. The location of this hotel could not be better. We took the airport train to the Martin Place stop, which is 1 block from the hotel. We also took the Sydney & Bondi Sightseeing busses which have stops 1 block away from the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly and again our room was spotless.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cCentral Location Noisy Rooms\u201d", "Author": "drflight", "ReviewID": "UR1127639", "Content": "Excellent central business district location. Hotel is situated within the NSW Leagues' Club and guests have access to club facilities. Rooms are nicely fitted and have kitchenettes. Light sleepers should avoid this hotel. The bedrooms have studboard walls and you can hear the noises of not just the rooms next to you but rooms two or three away! This applys in particular to the inner facing courtyard rooms as this means ALL four walls are studboard. Shame really as the rooms are nice and the staff friendly.
