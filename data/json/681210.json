We have always been lucky enough to stay in time-share with my parents when visiting Orlando and so was a little apprehensive when my father-in-law booked this resort, but oh my goodness me!!! It was fantastic!! It is as good as some time-shares that I have stayed in. The townhouse that we stayed in was 3 bedroomed with a spacious lounge/dining/kitchen area. It was spotlessly clean, well equipped and just lovely. There is a washer and tumble dryer, wi-fi and even has hair dryers in the bathrooms. The clubhouse was lovely with 3 computers that you could use FOC, a small bar by the perfect pool area which was tended by two really friendly welcoming gentlemen - Adam and Tino. We had an added bonus of visiting raccoons every night, Blue Jays & Red Cardinals in the trees right outside our house and even a couple of ducks came to visit!!!

We arrived at Lucaya villiage resort in December and were expecting a pretty average experience and that was what we got. The houses are in a gated development, in a quiet location in Kissimmee, it is about 15 miles from the airport and around 5-10 miles from the major parks. The resort had a pool which looked very nice, but we simply didn't have time to use. The house we were expecting was a 3 bedroomed, 2.5 bath but we were given a 4 bedroomed, 3 bathroom house which was very spacious. The houses are well equipped with microwave, full oven, coffee maker, blender etc but they were slightly light on cooking pots and pans - they had the basics but you wouldn't be cooking a three course meal there even if you wanted to. The licing area had 2 sofas and a table and chairs that sat 6 which made it a little small for a house that sleeps 10. The bedrooms themselves are very nice, good quality beds, linen and lots of spare blankets, sheets and towels. Each bedroom had a TV with a good number of channels so it was good for the kids in the morning, We had two double bedrooms and two twin rooms and there was a sofa sleeper in the living room so plenty big enough for most families. This is a quiet resort with little noise even coming from the busy roads surrounding it and everyone we met was very friendly. The downsides of this resort are that there is no outdoor space for your house, our doors opened right onto the walkway - which is fine if you are using it for a base to visit the parks but is not so good if you have small children you want to let run around or for drying washing (although a drier is provided which is very effective). The upsides are the facilities provided - laundry soap, dishwasher powder and even a welcome basket full of tea, coffee, popcorn, crisps and candy - which was unexpected and very well recevied. I would recommend this resort if you are coming to Orlando with a largeish family and want somewhere safe, clean and comfortable to stay.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay in Kissimmee\u201d", "Author": "phasmid", "ReviewID": "UR122070150", "Content": "We booked a four bedroom condo at Lacaya Village based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we were not dissappointed.

The house was spotlessly clean (including steam-cleaned carpets) on arrival and quickly felt like a home from home. There was a strange smell in the large cupboard that stored some ironing and cleaning things that we never managed to identify but it just meant that we couldn't use it for storing shoes or clothing. Storage space was ample though and a fully equipped kitchen with everything we needed, including dishwasher tablets. Other people had commented on the beds being uncomfortable. They were quite creaky, but each one in our unit was used and we all found them very comfortable. We booked with Holiday Genie as a package and think we got a great deal on flights and accommodation. This was our 7th holiday in Orlando and the location was the best we had ever stayed in for nearness and easy driving to attractions, restaurants, shops etc without having to hit the usual bottlenecks where traffic jams occur. However when we were inside the gated property we could've been in the middle of nowhere - it was SO quiet! Polynesian Isles Boulevard is a quiet road just off the 192 with a good range of restaurants at one end and the Lake Buena Vista Factory stores at the other. We never had to travel far to eat. The clubhouse was an added benefit and although the pool area, clubhouse and fitness room were all quite small, they were never busy and very clean and inviting. The air-conditioned clubhouse was a welcome relief when the sun got too hot around the pool! One of the men who sat at the reception desk (Rafael, I think), was extremely helpful and friendly; the other one not at all - quite the opposite.

Since then, it has slipped to No.10 and now I think I know the reasons why. The standard of accommodation is not up to standard at all and it's a very noisy/party type place. Before I start, I didn't realise that the resort units are split up and owned by different Management Companies therefore not all units may not be the standard that we experienced. So, we checked into our 3 bed unit to find the carpets were so disgustingly filthy - everywhere. So of course, you go looking for other dirty things too and there were many stains on the sofas, curtains, towels, bedding etc. \"We are not staying here kids!\" So after a complaint, another villa was found for us with even bigger stains and the whole unit was so dark you would need all the lights on all day. Very depressing. So, more complaining and we were upgraded to a 4 bed unit. Much better (all carpets and furniture had just been steamed cleaned) and much brighter. But I have to say that everything was of a very low standard (pillows, bedding, cushions, towels etc) had all seen much better days. But keen to finally start our holiday we just tried to make the best of it. That was until night time came. OMG! It was like staying in a teenager party palace. Screaming, shouting, swearing, very loud music, fighting - all of which went on till way past 4am and right outside our window. I can't tell you how depressed we all were only managing about 2 hours sleep. So, after yet another complaint we decided that we just couldn't stay there any longer.

When we got there, the temp inside was 82 and the A/C wasn't working. I got the clubhouse attendant named Pedro to come down and check it out, and when he opened the circuit box outside, sparks jumped at him and hit him the eye, burning off his eyelashes. Needless to say, things weren't starting well. We tried then to get him to change our unit, but his hands were tied, so we tried calling HotelBeds.com and said they couldn't do anything but try to reach the management company....so involved in this thing was the Lucaya property attendant, HotelBeds.com, Gemstone (Property Management Company), and the owners themselves---whoever they were. With no luck reaching the management company, we were later told that an A/C guy would be there in half an hour and to be at the unit when he got there. An hour and a half later, there was still no one that had arrived. After travelling back and forth and fit to be tied, a guy finally showed up at 10:30 that night and fixed the problem and we have been loving the cool life in our condo ever since. This place was advertised as a resort and it is definitely NOT, but instead a gated condo complex with a very modest pool and clubhouse. The saving grace in this whole experience so far has been Pedro...what an outstanding gentleman that knows how to treat people!

Everything worked, and we were able to make a good meal for the children in the kitchen. The location is quiet, and it is even possible to take a walk around the small landscaped pools in the grounds (I saw a venomous cottonmouth here: very pleased to see that the Florida wildlife struggles on through the urban concrete-scape). The place has an excellent location, right by the strip which leads to Disney. Nice pool too. All in all, we loved this place, and could have stayed longer.

Some owners were there, and even stopped to say hello and ask us how we liked staying at Lucaya. We were happy to say we have been repeat customers, and look forward to coming again next year, bringing more of our family with us. The 3 bedroom condo was a bargain, so we would have plenty of room to bring the grandkids and kids. It would cost us the same price for each hotel room as this place charges for 3 bedrooms in one. How can they do this so inexpensively? The kitchen was fully equipped, but we really only used it for breakfast and to make sandwiches for later in the day. That really helps out on stretching our vacation money - have you seen the price of food in the parks?

I was a bit apprehensive at first staying in Kissimmee other than Orlando - but it is absolutely no problem! Our stay at Lucaya Village did not disappoint us! Lots of food, supermarkets & shopping closeby and the resort is gated! We arrived a little early and our accomodation was not ready after having checked in, so we had to wait a bit which was not a problem. They have a big clubhouse where you check-in and in there you also find a fitness center (did not use it) and business center with lots of brand new computers and printers which you can use free of charge! Have never seen anything like it! When we entered our townhome it smelled a bit strange (from the cleaning, but that was gone after leaving the door open a while) and we noticed the carpets in the complete house were still wet. So this probably meant the house was really cleaned top to bottom and yes, it was spotlessly clean! Also, I have to add: the complete resort area was exceptionally clean! The townhome was huge: from the front door you come straight into a living room with couch & TV, dining room, kitchen. On this floor you also have a master bedroom with king bed, huge bathroom with tub and a safe. Upstairs we had another bedroom with a king bed as well as a bedroom with two beds and a separate bathroom. In the bathroom upstairs there is also a washing machine (was amazed to even find washing powder!) and a dryer which comes in very handy! The place is huge! We used the kitchen a lot and it had everything, even coffee filters, salt & pepper shakers as well as dishwasher tablets! We did not have time to use the pool but it looked very nice and it was never crowded during the time we were there. Actually the whole resort was never crowded although you saw a lot of parked cars at night. We also loved the beautiful walkways throughout the resorts which were decorated with lots of different plants - our own private jungle which also came with lots of cute geckos everywhere! All in all we had a great time and would come back again!

I had already reserved a room at the doubletree in Orlando when TripAdvisor sent me an email saying that it appeared that I was going to be visiting Kissimmee and then listed the top reviewed hotels in Kissimmee. I had done research but was looking in Orlando, not Kissimmee. When I checked out the reviews for this place, I quickly looked for availability. They had a 2-bedroom on their website for even less than the travel sites listed, and it was awesome! It was out quiet oasis of peace while we were on vacation. With palm trees swaying out front of our door, and a quiet walkway leading to our room, I felt relaxed every day as I approached our condo. We had our own bedroom and bath, and the kids had their own bedroom and bath. We had a full washer and dryer and full kitchen with granite countertops. They even provided coffee filters for the coffee. We found the wal-mart close by and made frequent visits to pick up supplies. FL allows the sale of wine and beer at walmart, so that made it easy to stock the fridge in the room. The pool is pretty straightforward with a mushroom fountain and a hottub, but it was pretty empty and thus relaxing while we were there. We had a good game of marco-polo in the pool without fear of running into anyone else. I used the computer center to print out some directions and the free wifi in the room was nice. Parking was free, which is saying something considering how much some of the other hotels in the area were charging to park your car.

First of all the location we found great for the Disney parks. The property is off the main road and therefore quiet and pleasant. But there was a route into Disney that seemed to get us there in an instant. We had a 4 bedroom townhouse type place with 2 levels. The place was huge and so well appointed. The cleanliness was incredible and the overall grounds and such just beautifully maintained and clean. Particularly nice bathrooms, closets and kitchen. The pool is very attractive and really nicely kept like all else. A main building offers a guest computer room with desktop units and really good Internet that kids found very appealing. Outdoor areas are very enjoyable with a small parklike area with benches and a couple small ponds with large trees and palms. The overall size of the site is fairly small but so pleasant and easy to get around. There is a gate system at the entry for extra security but was quick getting in and out. Extra security was appreciated. We had a couple of minor issues and a maintenance guy appeared like lightning. One morning my laptop was giving me trouble that I was not sure was my unit or signal related. I called the desk and a computer technician was at my door within 5 minutes. Problem solved.

A 24-hr WalMart supercenter down the road was a simple 1-shop stop for food, supplies, etc. Any downsides? Hard to think of any, but if pushed I'd say (1) Kissimmee is not Orlando, but it is minutes to most theme parks and the entire resort is gated for privacy and (2) those looking for a resort with a theme park atmosphere, restaurants, activities, etc may want to look elsewhere.
