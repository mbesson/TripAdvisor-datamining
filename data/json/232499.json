Good location. Those who must have certain options like coffee/tea in the rooms or a plentiful supply of specific foodstuffs at breakfast should check that out before travelling IMHO as nothing is a given in a small hotel / B&B like this.

Rooms were very comfortable and clean, although they are quite small you'll find this is the case with the majority of Amsterdam hotels at this price range. Breakfast is very good and provides a good choice. Hotel is ideally situated within a couple of minutes walking distance from Liedesplein Square on one side where you'll find a wide range of lively bars and decent restaurants and on the other side Vondelpark is also only a couple of minutes walk and is well worth a visit. The main central areas of Dam Square and Central Station are about 15 mins walking distance from hotel, but there's also a fantastic tram service from Leidesplein to Dam Square - we bought 48-hour tram tickets from the ticket office at Liedesplein for 11 Euros each, and found them to be great value allowing you to travel on any tram around Amsterdam. The tram service in general to all areas of the city is very good.Walking around was no problem, but it's also convenient to hop on and off the trams when you're pushed for time. Useful advice when walking around and crossing any street is to watch out for the bicycles - they're absolutely everywhere. When crossing roads, you'll always be looking out for cars and scooters as well as the trams, and tend to forget the bicycles so keep your eyes peeled for them. If you have time have a look around Rembrandt Square (just a few minutes from Dam Square) as that also has a good range of bars and restaurants, and try to make time to take in Museumplein (just a few minutes walking distance from Prinsen Hotel) and Waterlooplein. An absolute must is the Canal Boat Tour - get your tickets from the departure points at Central Station. Several options available, but we went for a 1.5 hour tour for 13 euros each -well worth doing and make sure you take a camera. We did this on our second day, but if you do this on your first day, it would give you a better idea of the layout of the city and landmarks. One last tip - on getting from Schiphol Airport to Prinsen Hotel (or any of the central hotels for that matter). If there's a few of you all with cases and bags, don't even bother with the train and tram option - just go for a pre-booked taxi. The Prinsen and other hotels recommend using www.schipholhoteltaxi.com and that firm offers a meet-and-greet option where they're waiting for you in the airport as soon as you arrive. We used this option, and booked it a few days before we travelled - at a cost of 47 Euros for 4 passengers, we thought that was reasonable and it meant we were at the hotel within half an hour of getting through luggage reclaim at the airport. On a weekend break when you're pushed time, means you can get checked in at the hotel and then get out exploring Amsterdam as soon as possible.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cParrots and comfy bedding.\u201d", "Author": "sedoyle", "ReviewID": "UR118383044", "Content": "When i arrived at the Prinsen I was greeted by a friendly night clerk.

The plus points are the superb location - very close to pretty much all of the things you want to do in Amsterdam (within walking distance or within short tram ride) but in a surprisingly quiet and smart street.

The carpet was quite dusty the whole time we were there. The en suite bathroom was OK, with a decent shower, but there was quite a bit of mildew from dampness, poor ventilation around the floor tiles and shower doors. The smell in the bathroom was never very fresh and I don't think the cleaning staff used bleach for cleaning the drains and bathroom units. A bit of bleach before check-in of new guests would do wonders! Also the breakfast - not very good, poor selection and very difficult to manoeuvre around the area as during the weekend the place was full and made the breakfast area difficult to move around for the self service continental breakfast (selection was three types of sliced bread, poor quality cold meats and cheeses which looked a bit tired around the edges. Boiled eggs and a very slow toaster. Orange juice, water, tea coffee, and two very basic types of cereal). After two or three days, you would get pretty tired of the selection. Having said all that, we were reasonably happy with our stay even though it was overpriced for what it was, but that could be because of the reasonable goodwill and good mood as we were on holiday.

There were two tiny single beds and the bathroom had just enough room to stand in. The decor was quite poor and there was a hole punched in through the plaster above one of the beds. We asked straight away for a move and the receptionist let us see room 10 next door which was the same size but a slightly better layout. We decided to take this room as there was no other choice and thought it won't be bad as we would be out most of the time. We were awoke the following morning very early by the sounds of the dining room right above us and tables and chairs scraping so loud they could be heard through ear plugs! The bathroom ceiling was also covered in mildew. Like a previous reviewer I felt like checking out despite already paying up front but we managed to get a room on an upstairs floor for our second night which, was much better, light and airy but still small. I will point out that the rooms were clean but I am not sure that the health and safety hazard of blocking fire escapes with laundry trolleys would go down well with the fire service. Breakfast was cramped, especially Sunday morning but the waitress did set us up a space at the bar which was not easy but better that waiting around.
