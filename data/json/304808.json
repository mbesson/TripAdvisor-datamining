Free Wifi throughout the hotel. The location is on a main road 100 meters from Taxim square which is busy all night long but because the bedroom was divided from the rest of the apartment, I did not have any excess noise. I had a kitchenette but not inclined to use it as a great variety of restaurants nearby although the fridge was handy. Staff were all very friendly. Hotel very clean. Breakfast was very good, served in the restaurant downstairs (which I think was called Faros?) This restaurant is also very good for lunch / evening meals, and you get 10% discount for staying at Taxim Suite Hotel. It's a short walk to Taxim square, Besiktas football stadium, and the boats across to Asia. Best advice I can give, when you arrive at either Ataturk or Sabiha Gokcen airports, there is a shuttle bus to Taxim square that is right outside Airport arrivals, cost me 12 Turkish Lira from Sabiha (around \u00c2\u00a34) and the taxim square stop is 50 meters from apartment. The return goes from the same place every half hour and takes between 1 hr and 1 hr and a half to get to Sabiha Gokcen. I also had a taxi do the same journey for 120 TL (around \u00c2\u00a340) and did not feel as safe.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromley, Kent", "Title": "\u201cAmazing aparthotel, warm staff and great breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Patricia_in_Bromley", "ReviewID": "UR118307910", "Content": "I spent 4 nights in Istanbul on holiday last week at this aparthotel and had a great time. As another reviewer said the only difficulty was leaving the apartment each day! I had a 5th floor Miyako suite and really liked the layout and practicality of the fittings. The spa bath was a strong pulse and very nice on aching soles after a day pounding the pavement. The bed is really comfortable, the wake up alarm on time and nicely spoken. The staff really try hard to make sure you are happy. The aircon was operating but not cooling the room when I moved in, and they sent a technician in within 30 mins (it was after 9pm) and it was working by 10pm. I really am impressed by this approach. The breakfast was in the Faros restaurant downstairs, and was a hot and cold buffet with serve yourself filter coffee included. Excellent fruit and cheese, meat and pastries offered. I didnt eat for hours afterwards. It is available from 7.30 to 11am. Incidentally they offer the Turkish breakfast at a cost of 17TL on their menu, so it is always refreshed and looking good.

This is an all aparthotel with about 25 apartments I guess. For the price of a 3 star hotel you have a five star apartment!! And a lot more space. I felt very much at home after a long working day. Just look at their excellent website, which shows you exactly how it is. They show a floor plan of each apartment type. The apartments are spacious (living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom) and nicely modern decorated, a bit Scandinavian style I would say. Free Wifi that worked fine and a good desk to work. I stayed in an Avenue apartment at the 6th floor. I even had a view on the Bosporus! I also saw a Park apartment as a friend of us stayed there and this was also very good. The hotel is located at a very busy road, but this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me (it is busy everywhere in Istanbul). The location is perfect: close to the Taxim Square and a 10 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk to the Convention centre. Lots and lots of restaurants in the neighborhood. Be sure that you have the address with you as our taxi driver didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it when we came from the airport, and although there is a sign on the roof of the hotel, the entrance is difficult to recognize. The hotel desk is manned 24 hours a day and the staff were always friendly.

We couldn't get into the safe using the code we had punched in the night before, and when the manager opened it for us a \u00c2\u00a350 note was missing. 2. The airport transfer we requested was not arranged so we had to take the bus instead 3. The suites are advertised as all having a jacuzzi. In fact our suite had a bath and a very weak drizzle of a shower 4. The rooms are quite nice though rather worn now, with stains on the rug in the sitting room etc 5. It is very noisy 6. The towels are not 'pristinely' clean, which is a little worrying. All in all, these suites are advertised as highest quality - at 160 euros per night self catering that could certainly be expected.

When I decided to spend a month, I asked a Turkish friend to recommend a suitable hotel. This is the only one he mentioned, and I was quickly reassured as I settled in. My sprawling suite overlooked a lovely park setting with a view of the Bosphorus in the distance. (Just past a couple of upscale chain hotels costing at least twice as much.) Yet, I was steps away from a public transportation hub and countless restaurants, shops, bakeries, etc. This area is teeming with Turks going about their daily lives, so you actually feel like you're THERE. No disrespect to the tourist areas such as around the Egyptian Spice Bazaar and the Sultanahmet District (a short taxi ride or vigorous, scenic walk away), but the Turks themselves are a main attraction. They are hospitable and kind. Look helpless for a moment, and someone will offer assistance. The bus from the airport (much less expensive than a taxi) stops just up the street on the other side. The daily breakfast cheerfully served in your room is an introduction to local food and a great way to start your day. The kitchen is equipped with mico, 'fridge, electric kettle, etc. Great food shopping is a block away. There's even a CD player. Mostly, I appreciated the sense of space. A corner suite on an upper floor, if available, provides an especially bright, cheerful living area. My bedroom had walk-in closets and a TV (in addition to the one in the living room.) Watch re-runs of old American TV shows! The decor is modern and functional. This is a relatively small hotel for such a large metropolitan city, and there may be times when communication with room service staff, for example, will be primarily by gestures and body language. The front desk personnel, however, speak English well and are extremely eager to please. The sales director, Zeynep Siseci, sometimes works at the front desk and can also be called for assistance. She speaks exquisite English and is a superb source of information to help guests. The free Internet connection is the fastest I've seen. I had a daily video cam session with my sweetie back home and it was like being in the same room. (WAY better image quality than I get at home!) Free self-service laundry. (Buy soap at nearby grocery.) Professional laundry/dry cleaning available. Perhaps five minutes away is the famed Istiklal Cadessi, a thrilling pedestrian promenade where -- at nearly any hour of the day or night -- thousands of locals and visitors stroll among a dizzying array of shops, restaurants, and entertainment. Even if you don't speak a word of Turkish you can dine inexpensively by simply pointing at what you want to eat in countless buffets! Impressive cuisine; reasonable prices. This is a metropolitan area, so don't expect quiet. (Take ear plugs if some city noise bothers you.) Learn a few words of Turkish to enhance your travel experience. Your effort will be appreciated. Express appreciation for things you enjoy.

So in love that I will be booking many weeks in this hotel in 2009, as I am here on business. So in love, that I won't tell too many other colleagues about it, until I have secured my reservation, for fear I won't get a room. The hotel has a great location, near cafes, a park, surrounded by restaurants and shopping, and a 5 minute walk to Istiklal, the great walking/dining/shopping street in Beyoglu. The noise level is definately urban, but tolerable. If you have stayed in New York City, you will have no problem with the traffic sounds, pedestrian chatter. The suites are cozy, clean, modern, and stylish. As a business traveler, I have plenty of room to work, relax, and keep a fridge stocked for those nights/days I can't get out to dine with colleagues. It is a relief at the end of a long day to walk in, drop my bag and keys, grab something from the fridge, kick off my shoes and relax in my \"living room\". And just like home, I have a DVD Player, a couple of TVs and plenty of storage space. The staff is attentive and helpful- and wake-up calls (the non-automated kind) are timely to the minute. Breakfast is delivered daily to your room; the wireless is fast and free; and the laundry is on-sight and also free. They will even do your grocery shopping for you, with a modest 10% charge. Downsides? Not many- I tell my colleagues the only thing I am giving up is room service, and a pool. So if either of those is important to you, you could chose a Hilton.
