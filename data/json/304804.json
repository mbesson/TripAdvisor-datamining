I wanted to relax in the steam room, lay around and watch tv, and use the internet to make all of the connections and reservations necessary for my trip. I have been traveling for three months and this is by far the worst place I have stayed. The wifi was immediately an issue. They have four different connections, but non of them work. So they give you the pass code for the hotel across the street, which also stopped working. I stood there waiting for them to do something and they shook their heads as if I was asking for a blood donation. \"you advertise wifi, I could have stayed at twenty different hotels...\" At which point the manager was kind enough to then call three other hotels near by and get their wifi codes until one finally worked. Great. But, then, since it was a one time use code, every time I wanted to use my computer, I had to go through the same circus act. Why not just fix the wifi, they charge so much money for everything on site, I'm sure they can afford to correct the porblem. Then I asked for the front desk man to write down directions to the airport. He wrote down the name of the airport. no joke. And I said how do I get there? He said \"taxi, half hour ride\" That will cost 80 lira. I asked about a train, and he said no. Then said \"oh metro\" and pointed down the street. \"can you please write down the directions to the metro?!\" He pulled out a map and pointed and gave me the paper with the airport written on it. What service. The room? The tv is about 8inches long and has a high pitched squealing back round noise that comes with the volume. IT's noisy, and the AC is as loud as the tv screaming. The room was dingy and not what is pictured, the only thing in their mini fridge was beer, coke and fanta, the room service menu had no prices so I'm sure they will charge you 20lira for a salad, since they charge 5lira for a cup of nescafe. The shower has no shampoo, soap, conditioner or even washcloths! The \"spa\" is also a rip off. They charge you 60 lira for a hamam treatment but, it lasts approximately 15 minutes. And, no, it wasn't busy, I was the only one there. To use just the steam room, it costs 20 Lira, but, they make it seem like it comes with the hotel cost on all of the websites of course.

We were given food which looked like it had been cooked weeks in advance and tasted roughly the same. None of us could finish our meal. But alas, the nightmare continued as when we got into our rooms the following night we found things like a soap dispenser where the soap had been there so long it had separated and a smoke detector which had been painted over. We thought all was not lost the following morning when we went down for breakfast. It was obvious that nothing was fresh as the meat had been there so long it had discoloured and started curling. Don't even get me started on the coffee, the watered down cherry juice or the cost of the orange juice for a breakfast which was meant to be all inclusive. However, being an optimistic family we decided to check out the free sauna. We went to explore the turkish bath facility and I can safely say that if you wish to have a turkish bath at the Blackbird then my simple advice is: don't. All in all the Blackbird Hotel is aweful.
