The room was a double room with two added beds, so the free space was minimal, almost extinct.

It is NOT a few steps from the Vatician. It is a metro and bus trip which can take 45 minutes to get back to the hotel. We were a family of four with two children. The bedroom was nothing like the picture we saw on the web. We had three single beds squashed together to make space each side of the room for our small suitcases. The fourth single bed was alongside the foot of theses three beds leaving just enough room to walk by. One side light did not work as the electrics were all hanging off the wall. One wall had black footlike markings which gave an overall unkept impression of the place. The bathroom was fine, the towels were clean as was the sheet. Every bed had a very very thin pillow. We used towels under them to raise them up a bit. The wardrobe had three hangers for the four of us. The staff were fine, when we arrived people were complaining because the electricity was not working in their room so I would say people complain a lot. What we decided to do for our stay was not to return to the hotel until bedtime. The metro ended at 9 oclock which suited us fine as we had children but for anyone else they would have to get a taxi back which can be costly. There was a curtousy bus to the metro in the morning but it only took seven. When we tried to book it for 8am the morning we were leaving we were told- too early. It cost us \u20ac20 to get to the metro just down the road because when you come down the steep hill from the hotel in order go left to the metro you had to first go right for a mile or two and then come back on the other side of the motorway. Rome itself was lovely, the weather was great and out children really enjoyed themselves. We didn't complain because we didn't think we would get anywhere so we just made the most of a bad location.

Initially i was concerned that despite specifically requesting a double room i was allocated a twin. This is a minor concern i agree. Other than this i had a nice stay at the hotel, though there are some things which i would like to point out to others wishing to stay there. Firstly i must comment on the distance from the city!! The hotel is situated just off Via Aurelia a main road leading out of Rome. The hotel website states \"10 minutes from the Vatican\", this is true if you take a taxi which varied in cost depending on where exactly picked up and the time of day/ night. The most i paid from the city for a taxi was about 18 Euros. There is a bus and metro link possible with the buses available quite regularly. This link goes via a place named Corelia where you swap for the Metro on Linea A. Just 4 stops later you arrive at Ottaviano - San Pietro which is close to St Peter's Square. Another 4 stops and you arrive in Spagna near the Spanish Steps. A good idea is to purchase a ticket for the length of time you are there which is valid for all buses and metros. I paid 11 Euros for a 3 day ticket. A word of warning though!! Pick pockets are rife on the Metro so be careful. Whilst i Personally did not have any problems here, i did witness a gentleman who had just been robbed!!! Also the Metro lines stop at 9pm so make sure you take this into account, the only ways back to the hotel from the city are to walk or in a taxi, which can sometimes be difficult to get hold of late at night. All in all i had a very pleasant stay in Rome, and the hotel was well presented and comfortable, with a supermarket nearby.

No interest was shown in rectifying the omissions when we remarked on the problem at reception- we were just told 'yes, it's very complicated'. If approaching from the GRA (motorway ringroad) you cannot simply turn left before Aurelia Railway Station, as the website says, as it's a dual carriageway with a solid barrier in the middle. Instead, you need to exit right, take the flyover and return the other way. Even then the turn is hard to spot as the hotel is not signposted and the road sign is very small (so is the road) - the road is next to a McDonalds, follow the signs for the Holiday Inn. The hotel is in a quiet area, and is quite clean, apart from a lot of scuff marks on the wall. The staff were pleasant. The bedroom was an ok size, as was the bathroom. However the room looks nothing like the picture on the website - tiled floor, cheap furniture, poor bedlinen etc. On the plus side, rooms are air conditioned and have shutters to block out light. The bed was unusually low but comfortable. On the minus side, the rooms seem to have very thin walls and every sound from every side (above, below and to the sides) was audible. We were awoken every day at 6am by what sounded like furniture being dragged around above us. The breakfast was truly awful - very limited in choice, and of some of the sustenance provided amounted to a Crime Against Food - certainly a Crime Against Coffee! It seemed to be mostly foreigners staying here so maybe they thought we would eat any old thing and not complain. I didn't bother eating breakfast after the first morning. My husband did, but as he memorably heard an American visitor remark, 'Man, this really -----!' The hotel is well out of Rome, although there are regular transport links to the city - walk to the bus stop (bus regular but always very hot and crowded), bus to metro, metro to centre. However, the metro (line A) stops running after 9pm, and you would have to get a bus home instead (usually standing room only), which takes a lot longer. It's not that it's difficult to get to or from the hotel, but it takes so long that you wouldn't bother going home to change and shower and go out again in the evening. We ended up staying in Rome all day and eating a big lunch, and not bothering with dinner - fine, but not what we had in mind when we booked the hotel. The hotel website says that it is a 'few steps' away from the Vatican - this is completely untrue, it is nowhere near it. You have to get the bus to the metro, then go 3-4 stops. I don't think you could walk it in under an hour, and it might well take more. I see that the website says a shuttle service to the Vatican is available, but I don't recall it being mentioned when we were there (although we were given a useful info sheet on bus/train links). Overall, the best thing about this hotel is the price - we got a very good deal on the internet. It was quite clean and quiet (apart from the early morning).
