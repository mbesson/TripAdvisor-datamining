The shower water pressure was fabulous (invigorating, hot showers are important to me) even on the 14th floor. The staff had mediocre frendliness, but was responsive with my questions. Parking at the next door multi-level garage was fifteen dollars/day. Live Jazz at L.A.'s Jazz Club on a night that I was there. Pretty good, too. Another amenity was a fitness center, but I used my own membership at the next door 24-Hour Fitness facility. Meals at the restaurant were o.k., but not spectacular.

Not sure why some models have one and others don't - these don't and I love that feature when I travel. Here's the big downside: This is essentially a v-shaped hotel.

Once inside room I must say I was pleased..Great room..Everything looked fresh, new and up to date..See Pics below..I was very impressed with the room..All tho there appeared to be some construction still going on, it did not affect my stay..I then decided to go back down and attempt to reverse the negative vibrations I was receiving from the 90% Hispanic employees of the hotel, with kindness.. I contacted a doorman (ref computer in lobby that allows airport check in) and a different clerk behind the front desk to use a pencil..After me killing them with kindness there attitudes appeared to relax a bit..Except for a employee wearing a nice suit who didnt say anything but appeared to be watching all the employees and there actions.. I then went into the restaurant and sat at the bar..The bartender Temo (older hispanic male) gave me the same negative reaction as the doormen and desk clerks) As I sat @ the bar he asked if I would be eating there. I stated yes..As I looked @ menu a older white couple sat at the bar and Temo smiled and greeted them with \"how may I help you\"..Thru out my dinner I too killed Mr Temo with kindness and left him a big tip as well..Even tho I had to ask him twice for more water..Ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfect..Great meal..Left bar and went to gift shop... Met a wonderful Philippino couple who worked in the gift shop..I only purchased bottle water and a news paper but had a 30 minute conversation with this couple..Very nice and pleasant couple..These two are an assist to the hotel..

I was greeted by the valet staff kindly, then the desk staff on a Sunday afternoon. Check in was quick and painless, completed in less than 5 minutes and it only took that long because I had heaps of questions. Then Manny helped me with my bags to my room and made sure everything was a-ok and he also guided me to where I needed to go to drop off my rental car. Turns out our home towns were near each other. A short and pleasant interaction. When I arrived to my room, everything was what one would expect of a 4 star hotel. I asked for a renovated room and discovered I had been already upgraded because of a membership that I have. A nice touch was a personal message on the phone (not a recorded one) checking to make sure that everything in the room was in order. I guess all I needed after that was cookies and milk and to be tucked in. I am a stickler for water pressure, so I was not disappointed when I had bathing time. The deep tub was a plus. Room service was fast and very efficient. I ordered breakfast in my room the next day and was satisfied with the service. Though I only stayed 1 night, the thing I liked most was that it was uneventful. I wanted to get sleep before a 14 hour flight and even though the airport is \"across the street\" and there is airport noise, I slept very well and this probably had a lot to do with the comfort of the bed. Definitely a plus, the bed. For less than 100 US dollars, this is the place. If you want to be near the airport and have a good nights rest, this is the place.

They know that, being near an airport, weary travelers desperate for some shuteye will come stop in no matter what. Even their comments to people who have posted reviews here seem to simply have been copied and pasted by some drone. I used Hotwire (on my brother-in-law's recommendation) for the first and last time here. Firstly, it turns out the discount I received was actually far less than advertised, they seem to have just jacked up the price on Hotwire; and secondly, I felt like I was being treated as a second class citizen because I tried to be thrifty. I understand that you can't always expect the same level of glamour when trying to save a few bucks, but to be poorly treated by a major hotel chain? That's appalling to me. I was traveling with 3 other people (myself, a friend, and a couple), and we were shocked by the size of the room. The beds were too small for the couple to sleep comfortably, let alone for two grown men to share. We asked for a rollaway bed, but they said they couldn't because it was a fire hazard which seemed odd to me. I'm not saying that they were lying about it, but I have never had a problem getting a rollaway bed in similar establishments in California. The front of desk's only recommendation to me was that I consider sleeping on the floor if I wasn't comfortable. I had to leave that conversation I was so upset at those childish remarks. I was polite and rational, and I was met with hostility and sarcasm. My friend, who is admittedly over emotional at times, almost cried at being treated like that. What really irks me is that the room was clearly set up for two people. Two towels, two cloths, two individual shampoos. The desk staff said that they simply give rooms to Hotwire who then fills the rooms, but they could at least maintain some communication with Hotwire to ensure that they're ready to welcome your guests in a professional manner. But nope, they just passed the buck and kept telling me things that they \"couldn't\" do instead of finding a way to resolve a situation.

I will say that I enjoyed both of my stays at the property but it really started to cement the thought that most of the Crowne Plaza properties that I have stayed at are getting very dated.

Pre-Booking --- Booking the room was quick and easy as it always is with ICHotels group. Not only were we able to book a room on the Executive Floor, they also charged the same rate for the same room on a standard floor. Excellent touch! Excellent reliability with PC points to book the room. (ii.) Airport Transfer & Check-In --- After a very long day of flights we finally touched down at LAX at 00:30 and took the long taxi towards the terminal. Finally getting outside of the airport at around 1:15 it was time to wait for the airport shuttle. Surprisingly, there was not much of a wait! About 10 minutes of waiting curb side for the shuttle it showed up with \"Crowne Plaza LAX / Raddison LAX\" on it's planned route. The bus ride was another 15-20 minutes as we navigated the cars around the terminals and drove the maze of roads onto West Century. Arriving at the hotel provided a quick and easy check-in experience. The reservation was already prepared and without any delay we were on our way to the elevator to swipe our card to get to the CP Executive Floor. On the previous stay being on a standard floor meant having to share with a travelling youth band. As you can imagine they weren't the quietest bunch. The only thing we heard on the floor was the ding of the elevator when we arrived. The Crowne is close to the airport. A quick complimentary shuttle ride away. (iii.) The Room The room was comfortable. We were located on the West side of the hotel with a view of the LAX tarmac (something which I had requested in the reservation). The room was your average Crowne Plaza style. Two double beds with the Crowne Plaza red pillow for decoration, a working desk and television. The room needs an update, there is no doubt about it. From what I have seen on the other reviews there is a refresh program that is starting to pop up throughout the hotel; a welcome change indeed! Bathroom was clean and once again a standard Crowne Plaza room. Good amenities, great water pressure. No complaints at all. As with the bedroom, it also needs a refresh. (iv.) Club Level --- If you are on the fence on whether to upgrade to the Club level, just do it! On the first stay we opted out and stayed on a standard floor with significantly more noise and traffic. The second time, we upgraded and were very happy we did so. The primary reasons were the quietness of the floor and complimentary continental breakfast. The area around this hotel is barren. The only place to get something to eat within walking distance was snack food at a VERY sketchy convenience store. The breakfast in the morning was fresh and offered a large amount of different pastries, juices, and coffee. Even for an extra $10 it's so much more worth it then going to the \"store\" or waiting to pay through the roof at the airport. Note: I am not a very frequent user of Executive level services. To me it was perfect, but to other seasoned business travellers it may not be the same experience. (v.) Conclusion --- As the title says, it was an average Crowne experience. I don't expect the Crowne brand to be grand in any sense but it should live up to it's name as an upscale business traveler hotel. I can't say that if I have the opportunity to stay at another Crowne I would \"jump\" at the chance, but I do know that they hold a quality product that is a little dated. As with this property specifically it is comfortable, close to LAX, provides an airport shuttle, and will give you a good night sleep. If you aren't tied to Priority Club and earning through them I'd say take a look around the area and see if another property really attracts you. If you're looking for an average CP property near LAX, this is for you.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location @ LAX & near Culver City & Santa Monica\u201d", "Author": "Newo", "ReviewID": "UR122113452", "Content": "This is a great location within walking distance of LAX.

It's an airport destination; I've seen few families staying here and that's probably because there are more family oriented hotels closer to the touristic sites in the L.A. area. On my last stay in August 2011, our daughter drove up from San Diego to see us off. She has a three year old an an infant and as we entered the lounge to have a drink and appetizer I noticed the waitress view us out of the corner of her eye as she stood at the server counter visiting with the bartender. We chose a table at the back where we would not bother any of the guests, though there were few. We didn't get waited on so I eventually had to get up and go ask the waitress to take our order. Service was tendered but with an attitude. Not a family experience! Rooms are adequate but I've always found the bathrooms - and I've stayed here a number of times - to be dated. The upside: beds are comfy and the pillows are so good I ordered some. The dining room is laid out around a central buffet but you can order from the menu. Meals border on average but I've never been disappointed with the service during breakfast or dinner. The wait staff in this restaurant go beyond the call of duty and I'm never reluctant to leave a generous tip. Curbside parking valets are friendly and efficient. Finding a valet to carry luggage to your room can be problematical, though, and on more than one experience. I checked in one night and found a college age valet standing in the lobby with nothing to do but not meeting the shuttle bus at curbside. I finally got his attention and got my bags to the room. I flipped him a $20 bill to help pay for his education and told him next time to pay attention to arriving guests. But this is really management's job. On another occasion, I made reservations on line (I'm a Priority Club member) for my wife and when she checked in they weren't going to give her the room after traveling over 20 hours from the Middle East because she wasn't me! If they had scrolled down on the reservation they would have found the notation that she would be arriving late and checking in in her name. My wife received an apology from the manager the next morning, but she was wondering where to go at that late hour due to an obstinate young desk clerk.

It was cold and windy and late and there is no reason for a 47 minute wait when the hotel *promises* a shuttle every 15 minutes. When I arrived, check in took 20 minutes, mostly cause the from desk staff were busy chatting with what appeared to be friends or colleagues rather than attending to their job. When I expressed unhappiness (in a nice way) about the shuttle delay, a somewhat hostile front desk agent said \"that is not our fault; the shuttle is run by a different company.\". That is a ridiculous response because if the hotel elects to outsource this important function, it is responsible for making sure it operates properly, as the hotel promises to its guests. When I got to the room, it was very basic \"motel 6\" quality, at best -- probably a little worse than that -- and it was not cleaned as well as a typical motel 6.

Perhaps the only redeeming aspect during our stay was the voucher for a free Starbucks drink at the restaurant downstairs [one free drink for four people...nice going]. Otherwise, this ranks as one of the top five shabbiest hotels at which I've stayed. It was disappointing from top to bottom: dingy carpets along the hallway and in our room. Upon checking in and walking to our room, there were at least four wine glasses (not fully empty) left along the hallway, which were not cleared at least until our checkout the next morning. The room was so musty that we were forced to open some windows to air out the room. Rusting faucets in the sink and in the bathtub added allure, along with cracked tiles and caulking. It seems that the TV had time-travelled from the 1950s to join us; the duvets and sheets came from that era as well, along with holes and stains. The parking was about $14, which was slightly ridiculous considering the long-ish walk with luggage to the entrance of the hotel [compared to other hotels associated with parking structures]. While the staff did consider our requests, they did so begrudgingly, which detracted very much from good customer service. I rarely come away from a hotel thinking, \"I would never stay there again.\" But this is one of them.

When we booked this hotel, I was told that breakfast was inclcuded for the two adults but the children would incur a fee. This was similar to the arrangement we had at the Sheraton Four Points in San Diego where we flew into the US before we arrived here. Actually, for a buffet breakfast where my kids did not eat much, we were charged $63! I queried the bill and the hotel stated that British Airways rates did not include breakfast! I was not happy. In the end, the Resturant Manager agreed to reduce the bill to $40. Still not happy about that really. By the way - the Pool? Don't bother. Its a postage stamp! The thing is on the second floor and so small that when the people sitting at the far end start smoking, the kids get irritable in the pool at the far end! And we had to wait ages for replacement towls to be delivered while we shivered by the pool, which itself is in shade most of the time because it is between two buildings - which also means that there is a fairly strong wind around most of the time. Parking the rental car on the hotel property costs $13.75 which is reasonable, despite the fact that at the Sheraton in San Diego it was free! To be honest I expected much more from this hotel as I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza in the UK both at Heathrow and in Chester where the service and prices were impeccable. But the hotel here at LAX was pretty bad considering. Even the lady who sold me the road map in the gift shop was rude when I stated that the map only showed LA north of the airport and I wanted to see the south part. Overall, not the sort of place I will be staying in again. It is fine for quick proximaty to LAX but as a hotel for any lengthy stay, I will be looking elsewhere in future.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bakersfield, CA.", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Atmosphere- Great Park And Fly\u201d", "Author": "terrynkathy", "ReviewID": "UR115946557", "Content": "Parking Structure is next door to the hotel and covered.

My booking had of course been cancelled by that time, but the gentleman at the check in desk found me a room and offered me late check out (2pm) which I was greatful for as I thought I'd sleep most of the morning. Got to my room and it was clean. The bed was comfortable. The room had a view out onto a main road, but it is an airport hotel that you don't go to for the view, and I had no problem with traffic noise. I ended up waking up around 9:30am the next morning and decided to have a shower and go to breakfast (which was supposed to be available until 11:00am). By the time I got down to the breakfast room it was about 10:20am and it was empty. I had to wait a minute before someone noticed that I was there and I asked if I could have some breakfast. I was told the breakfast buffet had already finished, but I didn't want the buffet anyway, i just wanted some eggs on toast and juice. They accommodated me while they were setting up for lunch. Breakfast was good - massive plate of eggs and steak (not sure if it's the same everywhere in the US, but the steak was so fatty that I could not eat it - but I am picky about meat anyway). Cost was reasonable considering I was staying at a Crowne Plaza (about USD$18 total inc drink, tax, tip). The hotel also has a cafe that sells snacks all day also at a reasonable cost. As I was awake I went to ask the concierge what there was to do around the area as my flight did not leave till about 10pm that evening. He suggested paying $5 (round trip) to take the \"trolley\" (it's just a bus with wooden seats) to Manhattan Beach. I did do that and it was a great suggestion. You can get off either in the main town area (near the beach), or go to either of the two malls a little further on. Overall this hotel is reasonably priced and I had no problems with the room or the staff. I assume they mostly get people staying for 1-2 nights on arrival or at the end of their holidays as the hotel is by the airport (free shuttle to and from airport) and there is not much to do around the area and it's not close to any of the usual tourist sites in LA, but I will definetely go back there at the end of my next trip to the US.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest breakfast buffett with the freshest, tastiest fruit near LAX!\u201d", "Author": "changrcc", "ReviewID": "UR115069051", "Content": "OK... if you can handle the occassional aircraft landings and take-offs at this hotel a few blocks away from LAX, then you don't want to miss their breakfast buffett, especially the incredible in-season fruit.

Even though I paid full price for my room I was not offered that option when I spoke to a manager about the condition of my room. I was offered free drink tickets and free breakfast but that doesnt make me any less freaked out about sleeping in filth. Out of desparation we ate in the restaurant of the hotel which was also poor. Our food was cold and tasteless. On top of that, they didnt even honor the drink coupon I had because it wasnt beer or wine that I ordered. (in fine print of course). It was too late in the evening to find another hotel and we were flying out early in the morning. I barely slept and stayed fully clothed until it was time to check out.

I can honestly say that this was the worst hotel room we have ever had and we have stayed in many hotels. Even the $50 a night budget hotels that we have stayed in were way better than this hotel. The only reason we choose this hotel was because we like to park in the quikpark parking garage right next door when we fly. So we didn't have to go far to check in after parking. The Marriot down the street is a way better choice than this hotel. Only downfall there is no covered parking. But the rooms are clean and comfortable there.

Despite its affordable price tag, I seriously reconsidered even pursuing our 3 day trip plan to LA after reading all the bad, depressing reviews and seeing the disgusting photos posted by other travelers. With a toddler and a clean-freak like myself in mind, it seemed like throwing away around $200 (because Priceline bid offers cannot be refunded) might be the only way to save our vacation from the worst hotel nightmare. Fortunately, I figured out from the Crowne Plaza Hotel website that there were renovated rooms at an extra cost. So we decided to upgrade our room as soon as we arrived (only additional $20/night). And boy, am I glad to have done that! With an exception of a bath tub (which has apparently not been replaced, but not too shabby either), everything was in brand new, sparklingly clean, and excellent condition. It definitely looked like a 4 star hotel room. Another thing that we liked is that they offer an option to gain internet access for 2 hours ($1.95), which was sufficient time to check emails and search for sightseeing/dining options for the next day. It would have been even greater if the internet was free, but I thought $1.95 was pretty reasonable. The only downside was the noise from the flights (relatively minor though) and from next room through a paper thin wall. Our neighbor was watching TV literally all night (from 1am to 6am), and that did bother our sleep on our first night of the stay. But since our neighbor left on the second day, that noise issue was no longer a problem. So all in all, we were happy with our stay. Important tips to the future travelers: 1) Try to play as much lowball bid as possible (I even saw someone got a room for $40/night) to get an overall decent deal. 2) For those of you who have higher expectation on hotel rooms, please do not hesitate to spend extra $20 per night to go with upgraded rooms. 3) Do not park in the garage which adds $14/night. There were always a few street parking spots in the back of the building (2 hour parking from 12am to 8am, which translates to a free parking from 10pm to 10am). 4) When you check in, ask for quieter rooms on the backside of the building.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleasantly Surprised!\u201d", "Author": "Californiadreaming64", "ReviewID": "UR101297670", "Content": "We flew in on a red eye from the east coast.

I could not have been happier. I checked it around midnight and the staff was friendly and helpful. My room on the 11th floor was HUGE, I got a standard king size room. Apparently it had been recently renovated and they did a good job, It had a nice LCD tv, a little lounge chair thing in the corner a big comfortable bed with like 8 pillows. It had a desk as well. There was a lot of room to just walk around. The air conditioner (controlled by in-wall thermostat) got super cold in a jiffy, but its okay because there were like 3 comforters. I do believe the carpet was kind of grimy but it was hard to tell because its a brown carpet so I may be mistaken. The bathroom was actually pretty nice sized. It included nice toiletries like shampoo, facial bar, soap, etc. The shower got hot in a second and had good flow. Also, if you forget bathroom essentials like a toothbrush, comb, razor, etc. they'll provide them complimentary which is nice. One downside is the internet is expensive, $10.95 for 24 hours, $4.95 for 4 hours or $1.95 for 2 hours although I don't know why the 4 hours costs MORE? Why not just do the 2 hours twice which equals $3.90? The dining choices are expensive, they have some in-room dining as well as some restaurant, coffee stand and a little sushi stand. I recommend walking the half mile straight shot to Carl's Jr. If you want some inexpensive fast food. Besides other local hotel restaurants, that's pretty much the only dining establishment within walking distance. If you walk a couple hotels down to the Marriott, they have a Starbucks with free WiFi, they also have a FedEx Office location in case that comes in handy. Back to the Crowne Plaza, they have a pool, fitness center and Sauna, all of which are free to access with your stay which is pretty cool. It is right near the airport so you can hear planes taking off and landing but it wasn't overbearing. If it is, the room has a bag that comes with earplugs. Overall a great experience for an overnight stay near LAX.

When I went to the front desk to ask about the bill, the front desk clerk was snarly and told me that I was checking out that day. I told her that I was not and she got even more snarly. I asked her about the note that said that they needed more \"authorization\" and she said my credit card didn't have enough to cover my bill. I was a little taken aback by that and then the \"manager\" stepped in to confirm that. I told them that that was impossible and only then the first clerk admitted that she was looking at the wrong account. She did not apologize...I then got a little angry at this situation and wanted to know if I really needed to check out and find another hotel in an hour, as the first clerk told me that I was checking out that day and the hotel was sold out. The \"manager\" pointed to my bill which had the CORRECT CHECK OUT DATE and said that I was not and that I shouldn't freak out about it. I told him that the ONLY reason I was \"freaking out\" was because his employee told me that I had to leave and the hotel was sold out. Never an apology from either of them. The maids knocked on our door early in the morning two out of the 5 days, even with the do not disturb sign displayed. We got one extra bottle of shampoo in the time we were there. There was a horrible stain on the bed skirt that was extremely disgusting. Use your imagination. The queen size beds are not...they are doubles. The water never got hot...we took luke warm showers. The hallway to our room was freezing cold...there was an open vent at the end and it whistled at night. The restaurant was just okay but the wait staff was terrible. Some couldn't understand us, and I'm pretty sure we speak decent English. I've never had a hard omelette before...I didn't like it! The coffee shop which sold coffee, donuts, sandwiches, etc. was much better. All-in-all, not a good trip and the hotel is also under renovation.

ACCOMODATIONS: The room I stayed in was BADLY in need of renovation. The wallpaper (beige) bore assorted scuff marks. The carpeting (again, beige) seem to have a thin seam of dust all along the edge of the room where the floor met the walls. An easy chair/ottoman combo was comfortable but seemed very dated. The bathroom (again, most beige) provided adequate counter space overall. The faucet in the sink was no longer firmly attached to the vanity, it moved a tad whenever I shut the water on/off. The caulk along the edge of the bathtub had \"potholes\", simply worn through from its age. The hotel is located on Century blvd near LAX. Airplane noise was not a problem, however, street noise was occasionally heard. Wi-fi in the room was about $10/24 hour period (that fee is waived for higher-level priority club members). My overall impression is that the hotel chain has woefully neglected the rooms in this hotel. If I had to guess, the room interiors seem to be 30 years old. Before checking in, thought the rate quoted ($125 for a AAA member) was an incredible deal. However, the poor quality of the room, brought me back to reality. I was very disappointed with the accomodations. Given its location to LAX, this property should be maintained as though it were the \"flagship\" of the chain in Los Angeles.

I needed a hotel in the LAX area for a weekend conference. There were 3 possibilities that matched the offer for 3 \u00bd stars for $59 a night and after researching online reviews I was really hoping I would not get the Crowne Plaza for my reservation, but I did. I dreaded my stay and pre-requested a quiet, clean room with a king bed. Upon my arrival, I was surprised to find the staff to be friendly and helpful and my requests noted in my reservation were granted. They gave me a room in the \u201cquiet zone\u201d with a king bed and a small pull out sofa. The carpet was stained, the outside of the windows were muddy and the tv & furniture was outdated as mentioned in other online reviews, however the room was QUIET and the bed was definitely comfortable. The room was clean other than the carpet and the daily cleaning service was efficient. I personally would not take a bath in the small tub, but the shower had a massaging head and the curtain was curved out a bit as to make it less confining. I parked in the self parking lot (a reasonable $12 a day or something like that) and was able to walk to my conference at the Hilton in 15 minutes each way. The breakfast buffet was a good deal with the 50% off coupon given to me at check-in and seemed to be a popular choice. The outdoor pool was the smallest pool I have ever seen and the chairs did not have cushions on them but the sun was shining down on the woman taking advantage of the facilities where-as the rest of the area was still overcast. I did not use the pool, hot tub, fitness room, sauna or steam room but it was nice to know they were there just in case. I did try to get a drink from the drink machine that only takes credit cards. After the machine on my floor did not work, I went to the next floor. It took my credit card but did not give me a drink (twice). There is a number to call and get a refund but I have not called. I did get a drink coupon from the lobby when I reported my issue. There is a convenient trolley that loops from the LAX hotel area to Manhattan Beach regularly for $5 round trip.

We stayed for 3 nights and this was relatively unpleasant. The hotel is unlike other Crowne Plaza's we have stayed in previously and appears to have been forgotten about. It is in serious need of modernisation and refurbishment in the communal areas and the rooms. Our really low points were as follows; Our room was dull with old looking furniture. The windows were dirty and one did not shut properly which caused noise difficulties from the nearby runway & flight path. The ancient aircon unit rattled and the pipes vibrated through the wall to the next room (even if ours was switched off!). This noise was 24/7. Whenever the room above us ran their sink water or shower we found water coming into our bathroom sink and bubbling up in the sink pipes. The walls to the rooms were thin and we could hear people in the rooms either side talking. The outer bedding did not look particularly clean and the beds were not so comfortable. The restaurant is relatively dark with just a few windows that look onto a smoking courtyard. Again, the furniture and decor is tired and does not appear inviting. Our second visit to the restaurant was a real turning point due to the delivery of some bread and butter to our table by a waiter, which was accompanied by a long thick black hair woven through the butter scoops. This was utterly disgusting and we were in disbelief that not only had it been placed there by whoever prepared it but that it had also gone un-noticed by the waiter. It was clearly obvious and we immediately questioned the overall restaurant hygiene. We pointed this out and cancelled our food order, although the staff did not seem that suprised. Needless to say we did not eat here again. Good points; Either side of the hotel are the Sheraton and the Marriot. They are both very nice with relaxed yet smart restaurants.

The beds were comfortable, of medium firmness, with a fitted bottom sheet and a top sheet which was not tucked in (eliminating the need to remake the bed when the bedding is pulled from beneath the mattress).

The \"ocean blue\" vans are easily spotted from any of the terminals.

Tips \u00b7 If you have a couple of hours to kill, a trolly/bus stops right in front of the hotel and goes on a loop to Manhattan Beach and a couple of shopping centers. The ride has an excellent recorded narrative describing points of interest along the route. Round trip tickets were just $3/person. \u00b7 If you have more time, you can take the courtesy bus back to the airport and catch a free shuttle to the closest Metro stop. A day pass on Metro is $5, giving you access to all of LA. If you have the time and inclination, the Walt Disney Concert Hall a short walk from a Metro stop, where you may take a free audio tour of the facility.

I\u2019ve criticized this hotel in previous review (below), based on an abundance of small, customer-unfriendly irritants and finding a room not ready (once). (See below for an earlier review and a message to third-party guests. Usually, I get rooms in this hotel via Priceline, and although it\u2019s rated as 3.5 star, bidding for a 3-star will often return Crowne Plaza. Bid $50 or less.) Some of the caveats remain, but some things have improved: NOTABLE: (I am now known by name, and am on a list of some kind at the hotel, so this may get me a level of treatment not given to all guests.) Checkin was swift and easy. I was placed on the 15th floor, reserved for CP \u201cpriority\u201d guests, and given a room with a nameplate that identified it as a suite. It was different from other rooms in attractive but cosmetic ways: faux marble entry and bathroom floor; a lovely quiet-flush toilet, an attractive ice bucket and new furniture fixtures, a soft ceiling light next to the bed, and a bottle of water. An airport shuttle runs about every 20 minutes. Nearby competitors (Courtyard, Radisson) offer free wireless, so the $11 charge is an irritant, but the option to buy 2 hours @ $2 works and download speeds are nothing short of remarkable--500 KB/sec, twice what I get at home. Free wireless that doesn\u2019t work, common in hotels, is a big marketing mistake. BE WARNED: The shuttle is not announced inside the hotel lobby--you need to be outside. The stops are brief and you can fail to get a seat the shuttle because it is too crowded. (It\u2019s run by a vendor, and also stops at Radisson.) Plan this possible delay into your trip. Another guest told me she missed two prior shuttles, and when she asked a bell desk employee, he was dismissive. In her words: Thirty seconds is not enough for me to get my luggage and myself outside. Announcing the shuttle\u2019s arrival INSIDE the lobby is a small step that would help some slower-moving or hard-of-hearing guests a lot. A coupon given at check in for 50% off food and beverage used to help small eaters, but now applies to buffet only. The price of the buffet is high to begin with, so this is a big bonus for big eaters. Room doors still slam--hard. This is addressed by asking guests for quiet on the door tag, which clearly does not work. A fix would probably involve installing hardware closures, a big job. The hotel web site notes free local-area-shopping transportation but an inquiry to the concierge produced a referral to a taxi. The bus transit center is on 96th, a 1/4 mile walk. Know in advance the route you\u2019re looking for, and have exact change for the fare. January 2010 Exceptional Bedding, Many Customer-Unfriendly Irritations [This note to Priceline & other third-party guests precedes all my reviews of hotels I purchased through a 3rd party vendor] 3rd-party customers read reviews and arrive with expectations; high attentiveness to guest needs distinguishes one 2-3-4 star from others. Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice: pay attention to reviews, articulate needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet, ask management for adjustment; if unresponsive, tell the 3rd-party vendor in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found them responsive. Talk to management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Whatever rate you paid, be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational. Commend with care what is commendable.] At almost any time of year, rooms can be had for LAX-friendly overnights at $40-50 on Priceline. If you are bidding on higher-star hotels, you may be rejected under $95. Don\u2019t fail to adjust your bid DOWN if you drop star levels from 4 to 3.5. CP is treated as 3.5, but it can nearly always be had for under $50 on Priceline, and if you are bidding on 3-stars you may get it (3.5) instead, described by Priceline as an \u201cupgrade.\u201d COMMENDABLE: Guest laundry, regular free airport shuttle, very nice bedding. Expensive but well-operating wireless internet, with 2-hour-at-$1.95, 4-hour at $4.95 (What??) and 24 hours at 10.95. Simple but good curtain closures.

Went to the room, was unaware he had put me into a smoking room, until the elevator door opened and I was almost blown over by the stench. Went into the room and almost gagged from the smoke. The plain beige carpets looked almost paisley with the amount of multi colored stains that embossed (meaning that they were not all sunk in, some were \"raised\" stains - meaning more like gum on carpet). The carpet that comes up on the wall that acts as a baseboard was peeling off in some spots. The chair that is in the room had some grotesque soil marks on them - not sure what went on there. There were marks on the wall that looked like they may give you a disease if you touch them. UGH. As I could barely breathe, I had to complain to the surly front desk clerk, who reminded me that they were sold out. As I couldnt accept this, he was going to have his manager call me back. He then called back himself to let me know that they were having another room cleaned for me on a non-smoking floor. (Strange how that just came up, hmmm?). Moved into that room which was cleaner than the first, yet the carpet still looked soiled beyond belief and marks were on the wall here too. The bed was clean, but it was the kind that is so worn that you fall into the middle and then feel like you are trying to roll uphill to get back to the side. I checked the room to see if the sheets and towels were clean - the sheets were spotless, but one of the hand towels had a chunk of something that I can only hope was chocolate or caramel stick to it. Shocking. Unbelieveable.

But other than that, there isn't really anything in walking distance in terms of food or attractions. It's mostly a residential area for locals (lots of condos). We were one of the few hotels. 2.

Then a few hours later, more people tried to get into my room with keys given to them by the front desk. At least this time I had used both locks so they didn't actually get in even though their key worked. I called the front desk again.

We only used the shuttle from the airport as we were going on a cruise departing San Pedro on Saturday. Check in was very fast, a nice thing considering we were tired and ready for bed. On arrival at the front desk they had a sign welcoming their guest of the day and it was me, much to my surprise. They gave me a basket with cheese and crackers, chocolate chip cookies, candy, and a couple of other things with a bow on it. It was a nice touch. I am assuming the recipient is selected at random, possibly from priority club members, I don't know. Additionally they upgraded us to a room in the executive floor which allowed us to use the lounge which unfortunately was closed as it was late. We weren't up early enough for the complimentary breakfast in the lounge. The room was clean as was the bathroom which to me is the most important thing, with the exception of the carpet which did have some stains and looked worn, definitely could use replacement. The room could use an update, especially the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable as were the pillows. People have mentioned the noise from passing aircraft,. While there was noise, it was not too bad just a dull low roar occasionally and not enough to keep me up or wake me up and neither my mom nor step-father complained about it so it's not a big issue. They did have a set of ear plugs but we didn't use them. The concierge was helpful with transportation to the port in the morning recommending a towncar vs. a cab, saying it cost the same.

Room service was prompt and delicious. There was plenty of lighting in the room and the internet worked great. Oh and the shower was hot and had plenty of pressure (unlike many in So Cal)!

Not wanting to make a 50-mile drive on unfamiliary freeways at 6 a.m., I decided to leave a very nice Hilton Garden Inn in Ontario and go to LAX and stay at a nearby hotel the night before my flight. I chose the Crowne Plaza Hotel because I was a member of the IC Hotels Priority Club (which includes Crowne Plaza and the Holiday Inn family). I was very happy that I did. First, when I checked in, they told me that as a Platinum member of the Priority Club, they had an upgraded room available for me. Wow...a feature of a frequent flyer or guest program that really works! Of course, it's based on availability, but it's nice to get a perq without having to ask for it or point it out. The front desk and bell staff were extremely helpful and patient with me, a person who is not accustomed to staying at a full-service hotel. My room was on a \"quiet\" floor on which they try to place flight crews to ensure rest. That floor has an earlier noise curfew than the rest of the hotel. Each guest on that floor will find a gift pack including a complimentary eye mask, ear plugs, and even a relaxation CD! Because of the hotel's proximity to the airport and concern for noise from aircraft taking off or landing, they may offer the same gift pack in rooms on other floors. Although I didn't need the package, it's a considerate touch. The bathroom appeared a little dated, and the hotel can't help it that city water is so laced with chlorine, you'd think that you were in a swimming pool. The bed and bedding were fantastic, and the room itself was very clean and comfortable. The airport is in a mixed neighborhood, so while the \"Hotel Row\" itself is fairly safe, there are some places like a 24-hour US Post Office and a Burger King a few blocks away that you may want to drive to rather than walk. The hotel provides a shuttle to the airport. If you don't feel like driving around to find a meal, there are several great restaurants or snack shops downstairs. If I hadn't had dinner on the way to the hotel, I would have liked to try their handmade pizzas. They also have Krispy Kreme doughnuts. In general, prices seemed very reasonable for food items. Need to work off the calories? They have a good exercise room with several TVs to help take your mind off your exertions. They also have a nice outdoor pool and spa on a balcony a few floors up from ground level. I'm glad I decided to go to Crowne Plaza Hotel for the night before my flight. It's convenient, and it's comfortable. You expect more from a full-service hotel, and they deliver.

Rooms were average, the biggest perk being the very soft King size bed and the powerful shower head. I had no real problem with the room - it's perfect if you are just looking for a place to crash for one night and to get to the airport early. Had to pay a small fee for one-hour of wireless internet access, which annoys me because the Crowne Plaza's sister property, Holiday Inn Express, offers it for free, but the price was nominal. The airport shuttle came quite often and runs all night - it takes literarly 4-6 minutes to get to the terminal. It does stop at the Raddison first, but it was quick. Tip - if you are returning a rental car, most of the rental car buses will stop in front of the Crowne Plaza and drop you off instead of bringing you all the way back to the terminal - we used Dollar and they complied. There are also 2 nice, safe gas stations (Shell and 86) close to the hotel on Century Blvd, which you can stop at before returning the car. We stopped at the hotel first to check in before returning our rental car - valet attendant let me leave the car in the front while we checked in, knowing that I would be back soon to go return the car. If you exit onto Century Blvd and want to go to the aforementioned gas stations, be prepared to get into the left lane quickly to make the U-turn. I didn't move fast enough and we ended up going into LAX to turn around - an annoying detour. I definitely recommend this place for a quick stay or for one-night to head to the airport quickly.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent,England", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "Riffmaster", "ReviewID": "UR5691896", "Content": "Couple of nights here before flying home.

What an interesting place. I was one of the guests lucky enough to get a west-facing room -- overlooking the LAX south runways, no less. There are people here who checked into this hotel for this experience, and the views from this wing are spectacular. LAX, though, is an important international airport and operates 24/7. There is noise, and some of the worst is between 11pm and midnight when many trans-Pacifics are landing. Some guests have cameras at the ready, and others have stuffed cotton wool in their ears. I checked in at 1am after a late flight from the east coast and had to stand in line. Like the airport, this hotel is gangbusters 24/7. Flight crews are boarded here, and so are many TSA personnel. They are allowed to check in first. It then took about half an hour to get my keys, check in my rental car (the hotel does not own the parking garage) and register for the 9.95 a day wireless Internet service. Then, up on the 15th floor, I could hear a party in one of the rooms going great gun as I carted my rollerbag down the hallway to my room. Those guests checked out the next day, and new ones checked in. One of this hotel's problems might be the turnover -- not too many guests seem to stay more than one night. My room was smallish, but it seemed clean. The bathroom had plenty of towels (see photos) and the maid kept me well supplied with amenities -- even a little bottle of lavender water to spray the linens with. The bed was very comfortable -- almost up to premium standards. The staff worked very hard, yet this property would be hard-put to pass a white-glove test. It's simply too busy. If you want to find a scrape, a skuff or a fray, you will. The only real problem with my room (1529) was that there was no way for the fix-it guys to keep my H/AC unit from dripping water on the floor. A whole section of carpet near the window was sopping wet and never dried properly.

It has a private lounge area for only that floor with free drinks and snacks. Some minor irritations I had that you should be aware of: (1) parking will cost you $12 a day to park in the garage, even though you are a hotel guest. I don't like paying for parking when I am a guest. (2) Pool is small and nothing special, but they do have a decent jacuzzi.

We have never noticed this before in a hotel, and we are seasoned travellers. OK, they do give you earplugs and eye masks but only for one person in a twin bedded room!!! We also had to pay $32 for a short telephone call to the UK (made from our room) to confirm our time of arrival next day - I believe a phone card would have cost about $10 and we would have had twice as much talking time.

We landed at LAX and waited approximately 15 to 20 minutes for the free shuttle to pick us up. We arrived at the hotel and found check-in to be very quick and easy. Our room with king-size bed looked out across the street to the airport. While we could make out some airport noise, it was fairly well muffled and didn't prevent us from getting to sleep. The room was clean and comfortable with plenty of towels and toiletries. The hotel itself was, in my opinion, very clean and well kept up. LAX is obviously an old airport and the surrounding hotels reflect that but the Crowne stood out from the others to me. We stopped by the concierge desk for advice on sight-seeing and found the gentleman who helped us polite and informative. At his suggestion, we took the 40 minute bus ride to Santa Monica but opted to take a $20 cab back as we felt it would be faster and more comfortable. Upon returning, we stopped by the restaurant for some desert and found the staff to be attentive and the food average. We woke up the next morning and were checked out and loaded on the shuttle quickly and with no hang-ups.

Travelers Aid was very helpful and called several hotels that advertised hot tubs. When Crowne Plaza was contacted, they informed Travelers Aid that their hot tub was working so I checked in with them. The room was okay so I took a nap, had dinner, and then changed to check out the hot tub. That's when I received my rude shock. The so-called working hot tub was cordoned off with yellow warning tape, like a scene from CSI, and when I crawled beneath the tape and dunked my toes into the water, it was freezing cold! I thought perhaps it wasn't turned on so I turned it on. The bubbles came up but the water remained cold while I sat beside the freezing \"hot\" tub for 15 minutes, shivering my butt off! I went upstairs, completely distressed, and complained to the front office, who, instead of apologizing for it, blamed Travelers Aid, who had done absolutely nothing wrong. Later, when I checked out, they wouldn't look me in the eye and were quite rude when I tried to get my valuables out of the safe deposit box.
