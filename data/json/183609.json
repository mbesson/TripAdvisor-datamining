When you first see the hotel from the outside it is a murky brown building - not much to look at. The moment you step out of the lift this all changes. The bar / lobby and lounge area are decorated to a high standard. Very hip, trendy and modern. All areas were spotlessly clean and plush. Reception check in was very smooth. Our room was spacious and clean. The bathroom had only been re decorated and had beautiful tiles and white fluffy towels. The shower was great and I used the bath also. The bed was large and comortable and we had a large flat screen tv. We had breakfast included with our stay and it was delicious - I could not fault the food, it was fresh and plentiful. We had drinks at the bar which is a huge area with plently of privacy if required. I liked the wine tasting idea and would have tried this if we had more time. The pool area was amazing. There are plenty of loungers and the pool is clean and well kept. You really feel like you are being spoiled here - its such a treat. The hotel is connected to the shopping centre and food courts and metro station. Brilliant location. We walked to Mont Royal Park from the hotel and back within 2 hrs. China town and the Notre Dame are all within easy walking distance. We did take a taxi to Park Olympic. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a wonderful stay in Montreal for location, friendly staff and a quality hotel.

Very dissapointing but , luckily there was still the sauna since the steam room was closed . Very nice sauna and yoga room .... so steam room had broken and was closed , and pool was only opened till 9 . No hot tub in case you are wondering . So we planned to go early tomorrow morning until the friendly lifeguard had told us it was only opened at 1 in the afternoon . Check out time was 12:00 that did not work out and we only made it to the pool once and for only 10 minutes . Meanwhile parking was okay . We got to the underground DesJardins parking and had to pay a pricey amount . Rooms were average but very well maintained and clean. Average size . Bathtub is very small but , location is marvelous right near Catherine Street and across from the art museum . Staff was friendly and the lobby is very nice and modern . The Hyatt may be a little complicated for first timers coming to the hotel since it is inside a huge mall . The Hyatt Regency Hotel is great for families if you are able to go swimming between 1:00 pm and 9 :00 pm I think sauna is open till 10:00 pm . Hopefully they will change their hours .

Its location is convenient. Short walks to Old town Montreal, train station & Chinatown. A bit longer of a walk to the shopping on rue St. Denis and the other spots to the North (Schartz deli, Fairmont bagel, McGill, etc). Subway is also close by, but we mostly decided to embrace the cold greyness that was outdoors in Montreal for the duration of the trip. The entrance to the hotel is odd - because the lobby is not on ground level, its multiple elevator rides no matter how you enter/exit from room to outdoors. We were in the city for Wed-Sun of Easter 2012, so maybe that's why the city seemed quiet. We got 2 rooms on priceline. My issue is more with priceline ranking this as a 4 star hotel. There is nothing really 4 star about the hotel. Its clean with a decent selection of tv channels, small bathroom with no natural light and poorly working ventilation fan. The bed left my body a bit achy unless i slept on my back. There was a mini fridge that did a decent enough job of keeping drinks, snacks and desserts cool. It had a small table, 2 chairs, footstool, and desk crammed in a pretty small area. Parking in public garage in mall under hotel was 19/nite during week and 10/nite on weekend. not ideal, but this is a major city, so not unreasonable either.

I think it's everything else that needs updating (lobby, elevators, corridors, common areas). The service is pleasant, but the staff always seems overworked. I phoned reception and had to hang up after 10 rings. Little detail: the soaps and shampoos are by far the worst and most awful-smelling things I've been in contact with in a hotel. Absolutely gross.

As for the hotel itself, the lobby and lounge are very chic, and the rooms have been renovated but just enough to make them look more modern. It's fine, but don't expect to be blown away by the beauty of your room. During our stay, we had a flooding problem because guests in the room above us left their water running all day. When we came back in the afternoon one day, we had a puddle in the bathroom, a drip in the closet, and a giant patch of carpet between the hallway and the first bed was soaked. Maintenance responded very quickly and was really nice about it. However, we were surprised that we weren't offered the chance to move to a different (dry) room. We talked about it and decided not to request it, since packing up and moving on our last night would be a pain, but I can't help but think that in a different hotel, the hotel would have extended the offer as a courtesy instead of leaving us in a room where we had to keep our shoes on in our room for the rest of our stay.

One minor complaint I have about this stay was about the overall cleanliness of the hotel. which for the most part was good, however, there were room service trays in the hallway all day along with one room that had several wine glasses on the floor outside for almost 2 days. It wouldn't hurt to send someone around to the floors periodically and pick these things up. One other minor complaint is about the buffet breakfast, while very plentiful. was cold most mornings. The usual scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, etc. but it was barely lukewarm. One bit of advice, if you partake in breakfast at the hotel, use the omelette station - at least those eggs will be hot. This hotel has recently renovated the main lobby area which is quite nice, very contemporary but does not give you the warm welcoming feeling - rather cold and stark.

The location is great, it's right at Complex Desjardins so you don't even have to go outside to get to Eaton Centre etc. My issue is that I found the hotel actually hard to find as the lobby is really on something like the 5th or the 10th floor. You have to take an elevator from the ground up to the lobby or Foyer level, but there's no signs or anything telling you this. I saw the elevators but there was no sign that said Hyatt or anything so I assumed they were for something else and spent about 15 minutes trying to find the lobby until I finally asked the valet where to go who told me to take that elevator one floor up. Once you're in the lobby it's very nice but you then have to take more elevators up to the room which is a bit odd as it's a lot of elevators to get to your room but not the end of the world.

I realize this is a mixed review - if you really care about location - this is a great property but I was disappointed with the elevators and how much time we wasted waiting for them (and no other access options - I really don't mind stairs) and the basic (premium for view) room.

The woman who checked me in, by contrast, was apologetic and friendly.

Throughout our stay, we saw this gender disparity on display repeatedly. As noted, we had access to the club lounge, but the continental breakfast was weak, with stale pastries and very few pieces of cheese and smoked salmon. The evening offerings were even worse, and we gave up on the lounge after the second day.

The check-in desk is in a terrible location though. There are numerous entrances to the hotel from the ground level, but the check-in desk is not at ground level, forcing you to take an elevator up. The issue is there isn't any signage of where check-in actually is! I walked around for 15 minutes trying to figure it walking through the mall, up to their conference center, and finally out to the front where valet parking is where I had to ask the valet (who was EXTREMELY rude about telling me where the check-in was). It took 30minutes to check-in as the lines were incredibly long. The entire area to check-in was a loud mess as there were only two people at the desk checking in probably 50 or so people. There were also only two elevators working, so a massive amount of people waiting beside the check-in area to actually get up to their rooms. It also took 30 minutes to check-out of the hotel, with the same issues as check-in.

I'm a Hyatt Rewards member and used a free night to 'pay' for my one night stay. When I looked online at prices, they were quite high which I thought was ridiculous but we were also there during the week before the Grand Prix race. Here's the rundown: **Location, location, location - The hotel is right near the Place des Arts Metro station and really close to the bus line. We took the airport express bus and it dropped us off a block away. It's also connected to a large shopping center, which is quite convenient for shops and restaurants (We had one meal at the Baton Rouge restaurant - good food and reasonable prices). It's about a 20 minute walk to Old Montreal and Notre Dame (you can take the metro instead for a quicker trip). There is a Starbucks literally caddy corner from the hotel and the Rue St Catherine (where you can find tons of shopping and restaurants) crosses the hotel as well. The Plaza accross from the hotel hosts many festivals and is super convenient if you are attending one. **Room - the room was nice, typical Hyatt, not anything overwhelmingly fabulous but nicely appointed, clean, flat screen tv, etc. The bathroom was a little small but it's not like we were planning to spend much time in the bathroom. Had a king size bed that was comfy and clean. Our view was of an empty parking lot accross the street and then some city skyline. We didn't really care since we weren't planning to hang out in the hotel much. **Hotel - There are massage services onsite for a reasonable price as well as a pool and sauna. I didn't have time to use them but seriously considered it. ;o). Room service is available but ridiculously pricey, as room service usually is, and it's available until 11:30 PM. The WiFi wasn't free, which was the one thing that really irritated me. It was $12.95 for 24 hours, which isn't exorbitant, but for the price per room they charge, you'd think they'd throw in WiFi for free. The front desk staff was great, very helpful with suggestions on things to see, how to get to places, etc. They are all multilingual, which was awesome since my husband speaks no French and mine is limited to \"Please give me 'X'; 'I would like to get off at bus stop 'X'\"; and a few other phrases ;o). I got offered a late checkout for free (although I think this was because I'm a Hyatt Rewards member). There was no concierge, which was a little odd, but the front desk staff subbed nicely. Some reviewers have commmented on the elevator situation but honestly, I didn't find it to be a big deal at all. Essentially, you take an elevator from the ground floor to the lobby (the bell staff pointed out which elevator to take but we could have figured it out). Then from the lobby elevators, you walk accross the lobby (it's not that big so it's not as if it's a long walk) to the elevators that go to the rooms. That's all. Not a big deal so I'm not sure what people are whining about. it was relatively busy when we were there and in terms of speed of elevators, they aren't rocket elevators but unless you are in a super hurry, it's fine. They don't slip the bill under the door for 'auto' checkout, which is a little unusual but I actually found that with several Montreal hotels so maybe it's a Montreal thing. Checkout was easy though, there wasn't much of a line when I went and I wasn't in a hurry. There was quite a bit of construction going on around the hotel when I was there which isn't ideal but that isn't the hotel's fault. All in all, we had a good experience here and I'd definitely stay here again if we could find a good deal on pricing.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWas expecting more\u201d", "Author": "adamfoxiscool", "ReviewID": "UR111865673", "Content": "Stayed here with a bachelor party of about 10 this past May.

I have never seen a hotel which you can enter directly from the mall. This puts you on the East side by the water, and at the top end of the main street, Rue St-Catherine. We chose to park in the mall parking lot which is much cheaper than hotel parking, and just as convenient, unless you are one of those people that absolutely have to have valet parking. It can be a bit confusing finding your way from the underground parking to the mall and then in to the hotel, but worth it. Montreal is a very walkable city and you are very close to museums, shops and the park. Check-in \u00e2\u20ac\u201cWe were there for a conference, so check-in was packed, but the line moved pretty efficiently. When we got to the front, the desk clerk retrieved our reservation and said that the non-smoking King rooms were gone, but she had a non-smoking two Queen room, or smoking King. We opted for the smoking King, but were told that it is a bit smoky, which we said was fine. She then elaborated that even smokers find it a bit smoky - at that point we changed to the non-smoking queen! She told us that even though the website says that WiFi access is a paid service, that for this weekend (perhaps due to the conference) it was free. Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The room was a little walk from the elevator, but nothing strenuous. We had a view out on to Rue Jeanne-Mance, which provided a nice enough view of the downtown area. The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was also roomy, and had a full bath as well as shower. They provided robes in the room which is always a nice touch. There was ample desk size, which meant we could spread out our things and comfortably set up our laptop. The free WiFi was quick to set up and access, and even though it said it would charge the service to the room, as the desk clerk had said we were not charged upon check out. We did notice that room service trays seem to sit outside rooms for quite long periods of time. Amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The upside of the location of the hotel is you can go to the food court, shops or even the grocery store without going outside, which may be desirable at the right time of year! There is a decent sized pool, and supposedly a hot tub, but it was not obvious where this was. The fitness center was adequately stocked, and had a few treadmills, a couple of elliptical as well as weight machines and a row of dumbbells. We did not eat at the restaurant, but there is one. We did have a drink at the bar, and this was fine, better than one might expect when your view is the mall. The service and selection was good and the bar snacks were plentiful. Check-out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Even though there were many people checking out due to the end of the conference, the wait was very acceptable, and the staff was very efficient.

We were pleasantly surprised upon learning which hotel we had booked, due to the location. Very close to St.Catherine and within walking distance to the Eaton Centre. We inquired on checking in if there was any possibility of an upgrade, and our very helpful and friendly receptionist Eric was able- the rooms we had booked were on a lower floor, with no fridges, getting 9th floor and fridge was top notch. The room itself(942) had a great city view, but the curtains were really wonky and hard to open due to this, only one of the 2 was able to open completely, the other was blocked by sheers. Beds were firm but also soft, hard to describe. Room was well equipped, well furnished and the coffee and tea provided were very much appreciated. The mall below the hotel has a decent sized food court and a good number of stores to shop in including a super-market which was really handy.

We found the hotel very clean and had an excellent location.

We had breakfast at Eggspectations that was also attached and it was perfect. Spent a few hours in the pool which from prior posts has revised their hours (it was 6am to 10pm with 2 short 30 minute breaks for the lifeguard to have some food). They were so occomodating that we arrived at the pool at 11am just as he was about to go on break, and instead of asking us to come back, a plate was brought out for the lifeguard and we didn't have to leave at all. Our room had a new LCD, and a safe. There was also the option of self-park or valet (I refuse valet after a very bad experience elsewhere). The only things I could possibly recommend (and I think at least some are coming) is I'm not particularly fond of paying for internet ($13/day) -- I fortunately knew this in advance and had a rocket stick and was able to tether my blackberry.

Give me a shoddy room and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll not likely say anything, but feed me a bad meal and you may have an enemy for life. In short, it would take a very bad experience for me to complain to the hotel administration. For your consideration in assessing this review. The hotel is a mess, inside and out. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything about the construction outside, and they are trying to fix the problems inside, hence the renovation. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether the complicated entry procedure is due to the renovation disruption or whether it is always this way, but you need to take two elevators to get to a room. The location is ideal, close to the metro and major bus lines. It is attached to a mall and business complex. Many of the major attractions, including le Vieux Port (the old port), are within walking distance. Upon check-in, we hit our first glitch when advised that there were no rooms with king beds available although this is what we had paid for (not merely reserved, but purchased). When I explained that we were celebrating a special occasion, the desk agent did what she had to and found us an acceptable room, which was very much appreciated. When I am on holiday, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not of a mind to inspect a hotel room with an eye to finding fault. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vacation, after all, not a forensic investigation. However, I was taken aback to find clumps of long, dark, hair throughout the bathroom. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a matter of a small oversight; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about hair in the tub, hair around the tub and hair on the walls. Since something this obvious was overlooked, I questioned whether the rest of the bathroom had been cleaned at all. The rooms are three-star quality. They are not large. Our room was similar in design and size to the Delta Chelsea in Toronto, but this is likely the pre-renovation style. Although we were on the third floor, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the outside construction. We did not have a safe, fridge or bathrobes in our room. The bed was comfortable. We had no difficulty with the climate controls. On the second night, we came home to find that a snack had been left in our room. This was a thoughtful gesture, but since I am allergic to two of the main ingredients, the smell was a problem for me. Nevertheless, it showed that hotel management was making an effort. We tried twice to check out via the television, but did not receive confirmation that it had worked. I would not likely stay at this property again unless the post-renovation price is comparably low and the service issues noted by other reviewers are remedied.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't turn up late\u201d", "Author": "Biggs426", "ReviewID": "UR80139180", "Content": "I was travelling across Canada in a party of seven, and we chose to stay here for two nights in Montreal.

Check in was smooth, and the font desk staff was helpful, courteous and professional. Then, we got to our room.... The bedroom itself was OK - clean, well made up and comfortable. It was, however, just as dated as the lobby. No fridge (available at extra cost), old tube-style televisions, and poor WiFi reception. But it was the bathroom that was absolutely disgusting. The paint on the ceiling was peeling, there was black mold where the shower wall met the ceiling, the wallpaper was peeling on the walls near the sink, and the sink itself was clogged. I suspect the paint/wallpaper, mold issues may be due to the fact that the bathroom ventilating fan was inoperative. On the way out that night, I informed the front desk that our drain was clogged and we'd be heading out for the evening. She was going to have someone fix it immediately. It didn't happen, as we noticed when we returned. Another request in the morning, and it was fixed later that afternoon. I spent tens of thousands of Hyatt points for this room. Perhaps they give non-paying customers the substandard rooms; I hope that's not the case. FYI, I am a convention planner, and I know what's important and what can be looked past.

Or, if we preferred, we could use the parking lot operated by the shopping centre (which is a connected to the hotel's lot and has an entrance to the hotel directly from the parking) for $10 nightly. As we would not be going in and out, we chose the later. On the negative side, yes, the furniture and decor were a bit dated.

The common areas are renovated, lovely and modern. The rooms have been somewhat renovated, almost everything except the bathtub which is too shallow to really take a nice bath in. Then again who would want to when the fixtures seem to be original and old. The staff is very nice and accommodating, never had to wait to check in or out. We stayed on the club floor, they had cereals, croissants, muffins etc for breakfast, cookies to snack on during the day and a couple appetizer in the evening. We check in around 7pm Friday, brought our bags upstairs and rushed down to get some snack since we were starved. The paper handed to us when we checked in said that there was food being served in the lounge until 9pm. After we rushed down there was nothing, we asked the gentleman working there and he said that the paper was wrong that there was nothing after 8pm, disappointing. We needed to go to the front desk for another reason and mentioned this, they apologized and gave us a bag with chips, water and a granola bar. It was a nice gesture but it would have been nicer if the snacks weren't expired by a month. Since it was late by then we decided to order room service even though the pieces were high we were \"treating\" ourselves that weekend and we got married at that hotel and knew the food was good. We ordered the onion soup, salad, chicken with sage and the veal which was the special of the day. When it arrived less than 30 minutes later it seemed good. We started with the soup and salad, the soup was the best I've ever had and would definitely order it again! The salad was good also. The we were ready to eat the main course, after a bite or two I realized they had given me chicken with mushroom sauce, the exact same sauce as on my husband's veal. I called them to let them know they made a mistake, instead of fixing it the gentleman on the phone told me that i ordered the chicken and mushroom and that that he confirmed it with me, i said there's no way i ordered that but he said he wouldn't fix it for me, i was peeved! I had to pay for something I didn't order and didn't like! The sauce was gross and the chicken had an artificial \"grilled\" taste. My husband's veal was no better, it looked processed not an actual piece of veal, I've had better microwave dinners. When you're paying 100$ for room service you expect more especially from a 4 star hotel. Thank god I didn't try the room service food before the wedding because I never would have had my wedding there! Avoid room service at all costs! The buffet breakfast was OK, less choices than a year ago. I asked the Waiter if there was any more cheese but they said no, they wouldn't be refilling it. When I asked for green peppers in my omelet there were none left and the chef couldn't get more, isn't this supposed to be a 4 star hotel? And when you're paying 20$ per person for breakfast they should refill things and make sure they have enough food to last till the end. The breakfast is only open till 11am so not a good option for the younger crowd, we saw a lot of people get turned away around 10:45am but lucky for them there's an Eggspectations right downstairs and I'm sure they won't run out of peppers. The pool area is beautiful! Newly renovated with new chairs and is gorgeous! The pool however could use a good scrub, people actually wrote their names in the filth around the inside of the pool! The pool is only open from 10-6pm and is closed for 1/2 hour so the staff can take a lunch break, give me a break! That is not mentioned anywhere so when we got down in our robes ready to swim and found out we had to wait 20 minutes that was really annoying! The pool is hardly open and they still don't have time to clean it? WOW. There is no hot tub but there is a steam room and sauna but to use it you have to go down to the locker rooms, not great if you like to use both. Parking was easy in the complex desjardin, it cost us 18$ for the whole weekend! Fantastic! If you don't plan to use the hotel facilities then it's a good choice for you especially with the mall attached and the many activities around and if you can get a room for under 100$ then you should take it.

It's also conveniently located on the Metro line and Montreal's underground city - a fascinating walk. I was only in town for a couple of days so I didn't really have an opportunity to check out all the hotel's amenities. There was a nice business centre though. It allowed for 10 minutes of free internet time per session before charging - a novel idea to keep those not really doing business off the computers. The bar area was quite impressive although I did not stop for a drink. They had this modern vibe going on from the music to the decor in the common areas - kinda cool and much like my stay at the Hyatt in Vancouver. But ... The hotel is certainly showing its age. While my room and bed were quite nice and the room was plenty spacious enough there were two glaring factors that made all this modern vibe go down the toilet, namely the tub fixtures and the tv. Why on earth these have not been replaced by now I'll never know. The bath fixtures have to be the same from the hotel's originating days ... my guess being the 60s sometime - embarrassing. And the tv was not much better - probably purchased in the 90s sometime. I mean, how much would it cost to purchase these two items on bulk? It would give the room such a lift. Really though those were two minor annoyances. I was quite happy with my stay. The front desk was ultra-charming. Although I was there on a priceline bid (which amounts to a second-class citizen with some hotel stays I've had), the young lady at the front desk set me up with a king-sized bed in the \"quietest part of the hotel\". I swear it was quiet too. I didn't hear a peep either from agacent rooms, the street, the hall, the elevator, the icemaker ... nothing. Very nice if you're a light sleeper (which I'm not) but it made me feel like a VIP nonetheless. Having my expectations set high with a previous Hyatt stay in Vancouver, this Montreal Hyatt does not compare ... although it was reminiscent. I don't think I'd be happy paying full price for this hotel but I've had worse priceline-bid hotels awarded to me. And the charming front desk makes me give this hotel a thumbs up. p.s.

In the years since its opening just before the Olympics, its Complexe Desjardins location, across from Place des Arts, hasn't changed, but Montreal has gotten more interesting going eastward, so the hotel is more central than ever. . . Kudos to the owners and designers who carried out this renovation. Given the age of the hotel--a lot of Montreal was erected in the mid 60s to mid 70s, for the Expo 67 and 1976 Olympics, and not all has aged gracefully--the refurbishment was a near gut rehab. And a thorough one at that. . .new and fresh lobby, guest rooms, lounge areas, and fitness center. Rooms are not huge, but they are ample and airy. The original design of the building, sort of a checkerboard pattern, provides just half a window to the outside. Supposedly, the view I received, out over Place des Arts and a slice of Mount Royal, is a premium one with a surcharge--the front desk agent gave it to me as 1) I requested it, and 2) she was not sold out. Very nice of her, but the view would not be worth the $20 per night extra cost. Great Hyatt beds, in-room coffee, and brand new carpet are highlights. Odd that they did not install flat screen TVs given the newness of the reno effort. Bathrooms are well laidout, and more pleasant than their size would indicate. Great bumpy Portico soap and curved shower rods are nice touches, though the vanity has just one sink, and a small area at that. Interestingly, Priceline categorizes this hotel as a 3 1/2 star, while its freshness and amenities would be closer to 4 star in my book (especially given some of what Priceline does call 4 star). That rating accounts, in part, for the $63 US room rate bid that Priceline accepted--a steal for this hotel. It is to the hotel's credit that I was treated with VIP service, and upgraded even with this--some hotels treat you like the great unwashed if you are a Priceline purchaser. The hotel lobby is seven stories above the street, and the double elevator rides get a bit tedious--the trip to your room requires an elevator to the lobby, then a second set of elevators to get you through the guest room tower. The Complexe Desjardins/Place des Arts location puts guests within underground access to two Metro stations (with similar names, Place des Arts, and Place d'Armes), the Convention Center, and much of the rest of downtown Montreal's vast tunnel system. Complexe Desjardins, itself, is a large mall and office complex (the center court is one of the most voluminous retail spaces in the world. .) with a considerable food court at the lower level. Place des Arts, right across St. Catherine St. is Montreal's answer to Lincoln Center, with a number of performance spaces, and the hall for the Montreal Symphony. Chinatown is nearby, and the main downtown shopping stretch along St. Catherine is just a few blocks to the west of the hotel. St. Catherine going east, from about St. Urbain to St. Denis, is the closest thing downtown Montreal has to a red light district, and while it is not aggressively awful, it is not pretty, particularly at night. The gay Village starts just beyond St. Denis, about a 15 minute walk east. And north along St. Denis is the Quartier Latin, with countless cafes and restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk. Visitors who take the train into Central Station have about a six block walk. Overall the Hyatt can be a great choice, particularly when Priceline bids in the $60-70 range are accepted. Even at full price, the location and stylish renovation make this a strong hotel to consider for a Montreal visit.

Hyatt was the epi-center of the festival, and we couldn't have been luckier! Although the rooms were standard, the hotel staff and it's gathering spaces made up for the standard rooms. Wonderful outdoor and indoor common areas, nice indoor pool which opens onto a sundeck. Indoor, outdoor bars, great bar menu. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was worth it. We were not rushed or hurried through our breakfast and it was great to sit, relax and enjoy the many, many offerings on their 'buffet'. Thank you Jose for your attentiveness to us! The hotel is adjacent to a mall, and the mall has every type of shop you'll need, a grocery store, liquor store(liquor stores are government run so all prices at all stores are the same), salon, clothing, shoes...everything! We bought some great snacks at the IGA and took advantage of the outdoor space which overlooked the jazz fest. Took a walk into Old Montreal on Saturday...highly recommended. The Basilique Notre-Dame de Montreal is a breath-taking must see. We stopped off at les 3 Brasseurs for a beer tasting and bar snacks. Many local shops line the streets and it makes for a great afternoon activity. Back at the hotel we ventured to the spa/steam/sauna....you could get lost trying to find them, but they are worth the venture. Spa services such as facials and massages must be booked through the concierge, there are no technicians on site and you will need an advanced appointment. We had all good intentions of going to a fabulous restaurant but heavy rains and thunder storms made us re-think our plans and we decided to stay put, order pizza and talk the night away. Our floor was full, but oddly, we never heard any outside noises, with the exception of doors closing, it was a quiet floor. There was no concierge on site--but we have to give a huge shout out to Thomas, bell-hop extraordinaire! He took the time to search out places to eat and had them ready for us when we returned later that day. Valerie, front-desk superstar worked her magic and found 2 rooms on the same floor for us, throughout our stay, she took the time to say hello, and remembered who we were, a nice personal touch. Maria was also extremely helpful if and when Valerie was busy. Pietro who helped us with our bags, made sure we knew how everything worked in the room. Heather, the bartender told us many spots to visit while we were in her town. Granted, our stay was perfect because of those that were around us.

I don't think all areas of Montreal enjoy this. Also, it's close (5-10 min walk) to both major lines of the metro. Rooms are relatively big, pretty standard for \"business\" hotels, and the included toiletries are okay. Things I didn't like = I guess this is a trend in Canada hotels, but there was no safe in the room, no minibar (at least there was an ice machine on the floor). The lobby and entrance has got to be one of the dumbest and most inconvenient designs I have ever seen. It was definitely \"noisier\" and not as professional as other hotels (yappy cleaning ladies, etc.) The bar was consistently empty, and the front desk was sparsely staffed... usually there was a line. No free internet anywhere but luckily I leeched off an open connection that only happened to work in my room and with my laptop turned a particular way... pretty funny (writing the review right now). But I guess most \"chain\" hotels never give away Internet, but at least some people have free wi-fi in the lobby. The Hyatt had an open terminal in the lobby for general use but it was constantly mobbed.

(Be sure you tell the valet at the hotel entrance that you are self-parking as he will not mention that option. They would prefer that you pay their $26 rate for valet instead.)

Chinatown is a 5 min. walk, the Old City is 10 min. It seems like the hotel has had a recent upgrade. Decor is sleek and contemporary. Our room was spotless with super-comfy beds, soft sheets and down blankets. Although the bathroom was small, it had lovely marble tile floors and tub surround and a black granite vanity top. There was also a little bar counter area in the room--very convenient for preparing coffee, drinks, snacks, etc. Having the mall downstairs was very convenient as there is a grocery and liquor store as well as several food outlets. The pool area is one of the best things about this hotel, especially if you have kids. The pool is huge, by hotel standards, with a nice sauna and steam room and spa-like shower and change rooms. My only complaint about this property is that it feels very sterile and impersonal. More like checking into an office building than a hotel. I think it has to do with a shortage of staff.

The hotel restaurant is not open for dinnner which made it difficult with two young kids as the mall downstairs shut around 6pm during the week. On the positive side, the pool is great!

The tub was also a disappoinment, narrow and shallow, like an apartment tub. The restaurant was not open for dinner during the time we were there.

One of us had heard good things about the Hyatt, and seeing as we were able to book at a reduced rate since the hotel was offering an early-bird winter special, decided to give it a try. Right from the get-go, the service at this hotel was mediocre at best. We initially ordered two rooms and negotiated what we were told was a free breakfast included each day for 2 people per room (usually a 35 dollar value, per day), since we were booking 2 rooms for 5 nights each. A few days later a few more people entered our party and we needed another room. We called back the same number to find out that while our initial rooms were still booked, we couldn't get the same rate for an additional room because the manager had to approve it. We were given her name and number and told to leave a message and she would get right back to us. For the next 3 weeks we left several phone messages with no return call from the manager. We were re-directed to several people who said they couldn't help us. Meanwhile, the rate for the room steadily inclined as we reached closer to the new year. Finally, 3 days before our trip we were told the manager we had been trying to reach for nearly a month was on vacation and all the hotel could do was charge us 50 dollars more per day for the additional room, even though they were the ones at fault for not getting back to us sooner. On top of that, they claimed that at no time was a free breakfast offered to us. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by bell boys who were fairly friendly and helpful with our luggage. If you want to park in the hotel, it costs something like 26 dollars a day. If you are not planning to use your car (and trust me, you can get practically anywhere in the downtown area by underground or Metro), park next door in the Complex Dejardins (the mall directly underneath the Hyatt). It costs $19 for every 24 hours, as long as you don't leave the complex (i.e. no in and out privileges). We did this for 5 days and the car was completely safe, underground in a well lit and secure parking lot for only $75 total. We got to the hotel at around 4:30pm, our room was ready and check-in went smoothly. The rooms are spacious and were clean and tidy. Yes, the TV was a little old but it worked and it had enough English channels to entertain us in the little amount of time we did spend in our rooms. The heating was easy to adjust and adapt to your own liking. The bathroom was clean, my only complaint being that there was very little counter space (ladies, your make-up bag, wash kit and hair products will not fit very well in the bathroom at all). However, several things went wrong over the course of 5 days, including one complete room change half way through due to a malfunctioning shower. I'm not the type to do much complaining or be too picky, but here's a list of the things that went wrong in our rooms in 5 days that the hotel did little to nothing to help remedy the situation in any way: - Shower head that was broken and dangling from it's perch, with water that switched every 30 seconds from absolutely freezing to scalding hot. Took 2 days for maitenence to come in and out before switching us to another room completely because they couldn't do anything (apparently - however another couple was booked in that room a few hours after we left, meaning they knowingly booked someone in a room with a broken shower) - 2 occasions where the rooms were not cleaned and no one responded when we called down to ask for someone to come up because the room was missed. - 2 TVs that had blown speakers that would ring if you turned them up past a certain volume - Electrical outlets that would not work at all - Fire alarm in the middle of the night from 4 am to 5 am with no compensation (i.e. in terms of offering food, blankets, drinks, etc. to those waiting out in the cold in their PJs half asleep) In my opinion, when it comes down to it - for the amount of money you pay to stay in the hotel, you get little to no service, and many of the amenities you'd expect to be free (local phone calls are 1.50 each!) or cheap (wireless internet cost 35 dollars a day for access) are not included. I have had better stays at howard johnson's or days inns than here. Mind you, the location is amazing and you are in walking distance of just about all the major attractions. For advice on eating - try Jiggs Fritere downstairs in the food court. Very cheap but tasty food, especially the poutins and breakfast (served till 11). For dining out, the Baton Rouge was terrible (service and food), try St. Huberts (the French version of Swiss Chalet) for great prices and great food. Didn't find any bagel places in close vacinty to the hotel, but a quick drive down St. Laurent will take you to Shwartzs Deli which has amazing Montreal smoked meat. For sights, we went to the Biodome/botanical gardens/insectariam (biodome is the best by far and not to be missed in my opinion!), shopping on Rue St. Catherine (the other street the Hotel borders) which is a street lined with shops, mostly clothing, although I didn't see many different from the ones found in Toronto. We also went to the Cathedral Notre Dame, which is within walking distance and GORGEOUS. Anyone with an appreciation of history/religion/architecture should not miss this. For nightlife, we only really went out one night, on new years, to a party at club soda down the street. But from what I can see, St. Laurent and St. Catherine, 2 streets within walking distance from the hotel, are littered with bars, pubs and clubs. I'm sure you could find a great party to go to every night within stumbling distance from the hotel. Don't be afraid to take the metro and the bus system! It's incredibly fast and efficient, and all have maps of popular destinations and which stops/buses to take to get there. Also, you can get to almost anywhere by taking the underground paths which are well lit and easy to navigate if you pay attention to the maps and arrows. Lastly, don't be nervous if you do not speak French very well/at all. Most people speak nearly perfect English, and if not, they know enough to tell you what you need to know. It was actually mind blowing to see how efficiently bi-lingual most Montrealers are. We got some attitude a few times for being obvious English tourists from Ontario, but it was slim to none and for the most part Montrealers are extremely nice and helpful people. Plus, we met many other Torontonians, Ottawers and Americans in the hotel which was a fun experience. Overall, I'd give the hotel a 3 out of 5. A great location and aesthetically pleasing, however much to expensive for the services offered. There are many other hotels in the area which I would recommend checking out before this one.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLocation Couldn't Be More Pefect!\u201d", "Author": "TravellerGal", "ReviewID": "UR23106772", "Content": "My husband and I booked the Hyatt Regency for a one night stay on Boxing Day en route to Mt.

The restaurants were rather expensive (18$ continental buffet), so I went downstair to the Complexe Desjardins food courts, where you can eat a decent breakfast (chose Frankie's Hot Dog, 2 eggs and sausage and toast for 5$).

The hotel is in the heart of the city with everything around you within pretty much walking distance. Below the hotel is a mall with a food court. You didn't even have to go outside to go shopping or get some food, it was all there. Of course if you chose to go outside there were many more options as well. Beds were very comfortable and the room itself was overall quite pleasant (except for the cons below). These are the big, big pluses of the hotel. Now the cons: For a 3.5 star (per Priceline) I was appalled at the furniture in the room. It was in short - old and plenty used/scratched. I have never seen such old used furniture in a hotel of this calibre. Secondly, the hallways were very dark. Thirdly, and another absolute shocker, the washroom was very dark and not only that had lots of grime in the grout in between the wall tiles and some of the areas around the tub. As well it seemed as if the wall tiles in the tub area had been permanently marked by the water or something because they looked like they were in major need of sand blasting or something. Very bad condition of the wall tiles as well as the ground tiles which had cracks here and there. Parts of the washroom reminded me of something you'd find in a 1 star motel.

The hotel was a little difficult to get out of, you had to take two elevators to get to a shopping center on the ground floor then find your way to the street. But it was good having the shopping plaza in the same building there was a large food court, an IGA supermarket a bank and lots of other stores there. Parking was expensive at $19 a day for self park , it's 26 a day if you use the valet. The staff was helpful but didn't know about some of the arts venues we were looking for. The experience was outstanding for the $65 a night price on Priceline.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cHyatt Not As Good As Other Montreal Hotels\u201d", "Author": "travelerhnl", "ReviewID": "UR16549818", "Content": "The room was very comfortable, with a nice, clean bed, and the small window (which didn't open) had a very pleasant view of Mont Royal and the Place des Arts.

When I called the front desk to inquire about a remedy, they first suggested that I pay $50 to upgrade to a Club Level room so that I could use the computers in the Club Lounge. And this after I had already paid for access! I found my own solution -- going to the lobby, where my (paid) access worked. But what really ticked me off was when I asked the concierge if there was a place for free WiFi, and he said that he didn't know of anything -- and, by chance, I found out that the coffee stand in the mall just below (a ten-second elevator ride away) offered free WiFi.

Then when we checked our credit card online we saw \"pending\" charges for both the uncorrected and corrected bill; eventually this self-corrected; perhaps, this was a credit card quirk. Our complicated alarm clock CD player had been left for us with the alarm set to go off at 7:45 am--which it did. (It took me several minutes to figure out how to turn the alarm off; I doubt they train their maids to check and turn-off alarms and there is nothing intuitively obvious about how to turn off the alarm.) At check in it was suggested that we might want to upgrade to the club floor and were told that even though the bar in the club lounge was an honor bar where we were supposed to sign for our drinks (to be charged to our room) no one checked to see if we really signed for our drinks. The hotel occupies the lower 12 floors of a much higher building. Our first night was a high school prom night with a loud band on floor 6. On our floor 12 you could hear the band softly until about 12:30am. A quirk is that it takes 2 elevators to get to the street. A plus is that there is a metro stop a block away and it can be reached w/o going outside if the weather is bad. (The hotel is part of a mall complex that extends underground.) This was our second stay at the hotel and we would consider staying there again, but only for a \"good deal.\" There is nothing special about this hotel that would make me want to pay a premium to stay there.

This trip was with the boys to see a hockey game, and I booked on Priceline (for $52.60 taxes in US a night) We got two rooms for 2 nights for what any normal 4 star hotel would have been for 1 night. After finding out it was the Hyatt, and reading the mixed reviews, I was a little nervous. (I have stayed at Loews, Omni, Intercontinental, and Sheraton in Montreal, all very nice with Loews being absolutely sensational) Now having said that, I would not classify this as a 4 star, it isn't quite as nice as any of the previous mentioned properties in Montreal, it is more of a 3 to 3.5 star (which it was rated on Priceline) Maybe that is what all the mixed reviews are about. Here is my breakdown of the property Pros: How can you go wrong at the rate offered on Priceline Great location, 7 min walk (underground) to Metro, IGA, food court, Baton Rouge Restaurant, and numerous stores right underneath in Complex Desjardins. Every member on the staff I encountered was very helpful, and spoke excellent English Nice Beds, and no charge fridge and safe in room which was really helpful Nice pool area/gym Cons: Tiny bathrooms, not sure how everyone is complaining about the lighting, the light by the mirror was bright, and the bathroom was too small not to be able to see everything You have to take a could of elevators to check in/get to your room/get down to the underground city (a minor issue, and one of the elevators sounded like it was on the fritz) Another minor issue, but toiletries were not replaced each day. I heard from other people I talked to that booked on Hotwire (as a 4 star for about $75 US a night) So if you are going on a weekend I would seriously try using Priceline (remember on Priceline it is a 3.5 star) check Hotwire first and then make your bid about 25% less.

Having read the recent reviews, it made me a little nervous that we were booked at the Hyatt. However, our stay turned out to be very enjoyable. We stayed in a room with a king bed. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the moutain of pillows they provided (nine of them!) The staff was consistently helpful, friendly and courteous the 3 days we were there. There was a coffeemaker with complimentary coffee and teas in the room. Mugs and glasses were provided. We ordered an in-room movie and there was a little technical difficulty that was quickly attended to and they didn't charge us for the movie. We had drinks and desserts at the lobby bar and the staff was professional and the prices were reasonable. They make a mean cosmo! We also had the buffet breakfast, which was included in the price of our room. It was a little smaller than other hotel breakfast buffets I've been to but it had all the basics, including an egg/omelette station. The cafe where the buffet was served was very nice, lots of windows overlooking a rooftop terrace, which I believe would be gorgeous in the summer. We used their pool and gym, which were very good. The pool is quite large - none of those lap pools you see in the newer hotels. There were many attendants around to give you towels and supervise the area. The deck area around the pool is elevated with many comfortable lounge chairs. The pool was essentially in a solarium so it was warm, bright and perfect for relaxing with a good book (which I did). The gym equipment is new and there's a 42-inch plasma TV in there so you're entertained (boyfriend was happy about this). The concierge was excellent and very professional. He got us the restaurant reservations we wanted, the movie showtimes for the closest theatre, pointed us to the best bagels in town. Location, location, location. We were smack in the middle of downtown Montreal. Everything was a 10 min walk or a 5 min drive (b/c of all the one-way streets, you need to make many detours). The hotel was directly connected to the subway and a pretty shopping mall by elevator. There are of restaurants, banks, grocery stores, shops, etc. in close vicinity of the hotel. The parking lot was one of the cleanest, most well-designed lots we've seen. We loved how accessible everything was from our hotel. The Cons: Just a few minor hiccups that can be improved on, and I'm really nitpicking here. The water temperature of the shower was sometimes unstable - we found this was especially so during the peak shower times (morning and night). It was fine in the afternoon. We asked for a humidifier, which was brought to our room after 2 repeated requests. As mentioned above, the breakfast buffet was on the small side and some of the food wasn't as warm as we'd like. The TV in the room was a decent size but an older model. We were told by the technician that they soon plan to replace the entire system with a new one though. As for the dark bathrooms, I really don't know what people are talking about. While the lights were not extremely bright, there was plenty of light in the bathroom. I was able to do my makeup there and see everything clearly. I guess when you close the shower curtain, there's less light because there's no lighting on top of the shower, but you can definitely still see. The shower curtain, however, caused some leaking problems if you don't pull it close all the way. We had a few puddles on the ground after our first shower. Overall: I have to say I'd stay there again, especially with the great rate we got. (2nd night was half price and free breakfast each morning) It's a great hotel if you want to actually enjoy the hotel facilities. We noticed that many families stayed there (probably for March Break) but the nice thing was, you can request for a quiet room like we did and there was not a peep from screaming children, or anything at all really. We rented a car but it's really not necessary if you're staying at the Hyatt. It's so central and the hotel is in good condition (recent renovations).

I had the hotel breakfast once (tasty by expensive) and then opted for the myriad of choices in the mall for the rest of my trip. The hotel is only a few blocks away from the convention center, which was key for me. If you weren't particular about this point, the idealness of the venue drops a lot. The negatives...as mentioned in other reviews, the bathrooms have HORRIBLE lighting. It is dark and completely insufficient. I'm not sure if it's meant to be romantic or what, but for a business traveller who needs to look her best, it's quite unacceptable. And while we are on the subject of business travellers, not only was the internet access expensive, it didn't actually work. I followed the instructions given to me by the front desk and the instructions listed in the room and each time I tried to log in and pay, I was given an error message and asked to call some central 800 tech support number. There were a lot of other convention-goers I spoke to who had the same complaint. Really, for a hotel who is playing host to major business events, this is really shoddy. I actually was so frustrated by my experience that I left feedback on the \"comment card\" they leave in your room. I did receive a nice email a few months later addressing my concerns to some extent. Apparently, they will be renovating the bathrooms. Negativity aside, Montreal is an amazing city.

The desk clerk mentioned a few times that my booking was through Priceline, as though I wasn't aware of this. After a bit of discussion, I was told that a room would not be available until later in the day and that I would have to wait to check in. I reluctantly agreed and requested that a crib be sent to the room for my infant daughter. When we finally got in to the room later that day the crib was still nowhere to be seen. I called and was told that they were \"out of cribs\" and that I would simply have to go without. After telling them this was unacceptable the duty manager got involved and promised that a crib would be sourced somewhere else. Fortunately they managed to find one and everything turned out OK. Other than these minor mixups, everything else was OK. The rooms aren't really up to the standard I've come to expect from Hyatt.

Light in the entry hall is so dim that it's hard to discern your clothes in the closet.

Broadband computer access did not work, despite considerable time with the broadband provider's help desk. Delights: The staff is knowledgeable, welcoming, and responsive. The gym is spacious and well equipped, and the indoor pool and outdoor sundeck looked nice, though they were closed for remodeling while I was there. The surrounding neighborhood is a bit funky and honky-tonk for a couple of blocks, but I never felt unsafe, due to lively sidewalk traffic. Hint #1: Take a cab from the airport, not the hotel bus. The bus ride is very long, stopping at several other hotels and requiring a transfer at the bus terminal, and then making several more stops before the Hyatt. Taxi fare is under $30 (Canadian) and worth it. Hint #2: There is wonderful super market in the hotel/shopping complex.

The good: 1) Location. You are above a mall/underground walkways that can take you to the conference center, and many other locations. You can easily walk to old Montreal. There's a grocery store and food court in the mall that's right downstairs (well, two elevators away!) 2) Water pressure. You can't see yourself in the dark washroom, but the hot water has lots of pressure. 3) Soaps (when you get them) are not bad quality - not the best, but certainly usable. The bad: 1) Housekeeping. They don't refill empty shampoo, conditioner, etc etc. I am staying here a week, and went a couple days without roomservice, and only took down the \"do not disturb\" sign when I needed refills, as I'm in and out of the room for a conference. So I'm completely out of shampoo and the bottles are left empty in an obvious place - and they don't refill anything. I had to call for refills. They also don't replace toilet rolls, or the tea/coffee in your room. As I'm paying $200 per night, bit annoyed not having tea/coffee in the morning... I phoned and an hour later someone arrived with some items. Also, the fitted sheet issue others mention here -- so true. I cannot believe that they use a flat sheet on the beds. Woken up every morning on a bare mattress - ew. Other things were tidied up at least. 2) Room Service. Costly room service menu, limited hours. I guess I'm used to the Hilton that's open really late (the only reason I order room service is when I need to eat odd hours due to conventions!). But the price - huge price tag on the food, and then they tack on $3 service fee and taxes on top. Also, service was LATE both times -- they said they would bring my food at a certain time and were late by at least 10 minutes each time. (Not bad, but when you're on a schedule for meetings, it can throw things off.) ALSO - they advertise \"freshly squeezed orange juice\" on the menu (at $5), which is worse than Tropicana. It's seriously generic-brand concentrate grade. Stay away, or set your expectations low. Other than that, the people who brought the food were friendly. 3) Elevators. They were out of service at times, which meant long waits. Oddly laid out too - a separate elevator takes you up from street level to the lobby. A different elevator takes you up to the rooms. A third elevator takes you down to the mall. More inconvienent is that the stairs seem to be for emergencies only. I am on the first floor above the lobby - so I've had to take the elevator just to go down a single floor (before getting on a second eleavator to go anywhere else). Very annoying. 4) Bathrooms - The lighting. Not bad if you're there for a night - but a whole week it gets on your nerves. One small light over the mirror. Oddly placed so it's awkward to put your make-up on (awkward in that you get shadows all over your face and cannot see.) That's a minor inconvienience. It's the fact that it's completely dark everywhere else in the bathroom. I guess this helps hide any grime anywhere else... 5) No full-length mirror, no safe, (and naturally, no fridge). No mirror is annoying on a business trip for sure. Attending a professional workshop and conference, you want to make sure you look presentable - but it's pretty difficult as there are no full legnth mirrors anywhere to be found (in the room or halls, etc). A safe is a big one for me though - for business I have all kinds of gadgets with me I want to lock up when not in the room all day. Every other hotel I've been in over the past few years has had in-room safes - not here. First time I've felt the need to search out a review site to vent.

Hyatt has refurbished the rooms since taking over the property from Wyndham. That being said, I found the one area that could use some improvement was the bathroom. It was quite small ... there's no room for improvement there, but the fixtures were quite dated and the tile and grout around the bath could have used some attention. The toilet lid had a missing hinge cover that revealed a grungy looking bolt. The hairdryer was of the wall mounted type with a vacuum cleaner hose and was anemic at best. The vanity was moulded composite acrylic ... most better hotels now use composite stone. The location of the hotel is near boul. St. Laurent, which has been the historical and geographical dividing line between east (francophone) and west (anglophone) areas of Montreal.

For the price we paid, the hotel was perfect! The last time I stayed at this location was back in 2001 when it was still a Wyndham and the public areas haven't changed much since. Back then, Wyndham had just redone everything as the previous occupants, the Le Meridien chain, had left it in a sad shape. So lobby/bar area are the same as they've been in the last 5 years, except that the carpets and some furniture were changed. I liked the style they had before in the lobby so I'm glad they didn't really change it but the new furniture is very sleek and modern. You won't find yourself in a flower-power style Marriott here. LOCATION: Depending on what you're up to, I think it's one of the best location of all downtown Montreal hotels. It's at the start of the shopping strip on St-Catherine, right in front of la Place-des-Arts (performing arts center) and the Contemporary arts museum. That's If you walk toward the west. Heading east on St-Catherine, you'll find yourself in the middle of a ton of strip clubs, the University district and the gay village, a 10-minute walk away. 5 minutes heading east, you'll also end up on St-Laurent and St-Denis which has tons of great restaurants with nices patios. It's also where the French clubbing scene happens (the more \"English clubbing\" scene, where most of the underage american students go, is on Crescent, much farther away but heading west). Old-Montreal, altough we didn't go, I've walked from this hotel to Old-Mtl before and it's a 10-minute walk If you're a quick walker, 20-minute walk If you're legs aren't what they used to be. This being my 30th time or so in Montreal, I can tell you that you will waste time taking the subway (changing from the green to the orange line will be necessary so you'll go east and then back west again). But the M\u00c3\u00a9tro (subway) is a safe and quick way to practically anywhere else (But If you're like me and you like walking, walk, you'll discover Montr\u00c3\u00a9al more) Don't be bothered by the homeless and punks begging on the streets, this is a very safe city and they are harmless (well, most of them, exceptions exist everywhere). Toronto might look \"cleaner\" in that respect but I believe this is mostly due to the fact that beggars are not tolerated (by-law) in T.O, while this isn't the case in Montreal. Finally, the hotel is in the huge \"Complexe Desjardins\", which is 3 office towers connected with a shopping mall, the Hyatt and the immense underground garage. Something I noticed in a previous review, the subway IS accessible without going outside, practical in the winter time. Take the parking elevators to Level 2, \"Place\" (lobby is on the 6th floor). SERVICE: I thought the service was excellent. I don't think it compares to anything I've received in the last 3 years in Montreal. Hotel was sold-out but 5 clerks were working the reception desk and I got my room in 5 minutes. Had requested 2 doubles non-smoking and that's what I got. The Francofolies stage being in front of the hotel, she asked If I would prefer a room on the 7th floor with a view and the music or a quieter one on the 10th floor at the back on the Regency Club Level. I opted for the later (but the rooms are apparently all the same anyways). Still great that they asked. Contrary to the previous reviewer, the concierge gave us wonderful restaurants reccomendations and was extremely polite. Security staff, pool staff, everyone was nice and greeted us without being overwhelming. Not pretentious at all either. Even though we are French speakers, I didn't see English-speaking guests being treated differently. ROOMS: Great renovations. Now that's really something they've changed since they took over in 2003. Everyting was new and modern, GREAT bed (Pillotop mattresses and tons of feather pillows). They did have fitted sheets. CD player in room, mini-fridge, quiet but cold A/C and finally, they did the bathrooms which are now up to par! The room is exactly like what you see on the Hyatt website. Hallways a little dark but it's the modern, cool style of the hotel I guess. It's relaxing to say the least. POOL/FITNESS: This as also changed since Wyndham/Meridien... I definately think that anyone who's seen the pool's shape before and after will agree that it was larger and nicer before. BUT, the fitness facilities, the terrace/gardens and the pool area overall are much brighter and feel like a little oasis in the middle of town. Very nice. PARKING: Warning! Do not use the Valet parking. It's outrageously overpiced and may spoil your stay. At 23$ per day+tips, it's definately a rip-off, even in Montreal. This becomes even more obvious when you know that they park you car in the Complexe's garage (just like it has been done since it opened in 1976) and you can do just the same yourself and from Friday 4 p.m to Monday 9 a.m, the daily maximum is 8$. 2 nights=8+8=16$ with taxes. Hyatt's rate: 23+23=46... I saved 30$! On weekdays, I saw a daily max of 16$... you're still saving 7$... So don't be puzzled, pass the front entrance of the hotel on Jeanne-Mance and a few meters after, you'll see the sign for \"Parking, Complexe Desjardins\". It is all the same and elevators will get you right to the lobby. Overall, I will say: book with confidence and ignore the negative reviews. It's comfy, quietly luxurious and well-located, in my top 3 Montreal hotels.

Our criteria are listed below, and all were more-than-amply satisfied: 1) Easy to reserve: I booked online via the hyatt website. 2) Reasonable cost: I booked a 'super break' deal, for 3 nights, which included breakfast and twin beds. TIP: register in the loyalty programme: Hyatt Gold Passport. You can request high floors and an upgrade at check-in. We were upgraded to a Regency Club Room (spacious) with 2 double beds, a great view (floor to ceiling windows) and a complimentary fruit basket. Cost was CAD 666.04/ EUR 455.07 (excluding 50% off the third night, given at check-out), for 3 nights, per room, including breakfast. 3) Location. Was central, close to the Underground Shopping Mall, around 20 minutes (gentle) stroll to the Old Port area and best of all, located directly above the Les Jardins shopping complex. 4) Good service. Staff were very friendly and attentive to our requests, e.g. concierge - for directions; reception: for room service, other queries. 5) Cleanliness. The room we were assigned, was very clean. It is possible to request anti-allergy pillows and linens. 6) Decent breakfast. This was the highlight of our stay. An extensive array of breads, fruits, cooked food and drinks. Including porridge, french toast with maple syrup and eggs cooked-to-order. Really fresh, well-cooked and with kind waiting staff. 7) Fitness facilities. The hotel has adequate fitness facilities (weights, machines, cross-trainer, treadmill and bikes). It also has an indoor, heated swimming pool (around 10m in length). Open from 6.30am onwards. Possible to have massages aswell. We took advantage of a 1-hr lymphatic drainage massage (cost CAD 65 each).", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto ontario", "Title": "\u201cmy best hotel experience in montreal ever\u201d", "Author": "poca", "ReviewID": "UR3756804", "Content": "every summer i would travel to quebec for a short vacation with my kids. we have stayed at different hotels but my stay at hyatt regency proved to be our best experience so far. the staff were very nice, friendly and helpful. the loacation was conveient for downtown shopping and dinning. and my kids love the swimming pool very muchl. our room was clean and spacious. will definitely stay at this hotel again. keep up the good work.", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cStrike & Managers\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3659348", "Content": "Like most of Montreal hotels, Hyatt Montreal was on strike on friday, July 8th.

At the front desk (waited 45 min to c/in), room was'nt perfectly cleanned (bad job in the bathroom), messed up my order 3 times at the bar. The next day, employees were back on the job, sure glad they were back! These employees are competent, deliver good customer service and are better at dealling with busy periods of the day. I had one manager throw a fit at me because i was complaining on how the service that day was so crapy, he did not apologise for the situation that was going on. I would have left this hotel but my understanding was other hotels had the same situation going on. They deserve everything they ask for in their contract negociations.

Getting to the lobby was initially confusing because you need to use one elevator to get to the lobby, which is on the 6th floor of Complex Desjardins. Check-in was easy and then we had to use a different set of elevators to get to our room. The whole two-elevator thing is a bit disorienting at first, but easy to get used to. We got a two double-bed room with great, modern decor. Bathrooms were great, though the tub is shallow, definetly not something you can soak in. The best feature of the room (though all of it was great) were the beds! We loved the sealy pillow-top mattresses, the pillows and the duvet -- we all agreed that it was actually more comfortable than our beds at home. There is a pool and gym in the building. The indoor pool is nicely situated, with lots of deck-space, chairs and sunlight coming through the windows. The gym was downstairs from the pool, the equipment a bit older and few, but there is a new gym facility that has been constructed in a room by the pool. We peeked and there was lots of nice new equipment, but we were told it's not open yet. Location is pretty good and the convenience of being in Complex Desjardins meant that it was a very short trip if we ever needed anything, like food, snacks, &c. We had the buffet breakfast in the hotel and it was pretty good. I think there's good enough variety for whatever you'd want like cereals, yogurt, fruits, juices, an omelet station, along with your bacon, sausages, french toast, breads, danishes, &c. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and formal.

Guest rooms are not chic or boutique, but the rooms are clean, modern, and comfortable. As mentioned in past reviews, this location is the best in the city -- on Ste. Catherine St, near the major blvds. of St. Laurent and St. Denis, directly above Metro station access. Close to everything from Place des Arts to the funky trendy Plateau neighborhood to Chinatown to the Old City to the red light district. Ample dining options are available just downstairs. The rate for parking at the Complexes Desjardins underground parking center is typical of Montreal -- coming in this time at around $18CD per 24 hours. ($15USD per day).

We made our reservations on Hotwire and then read the reviews here on Tripadvisor. Several reviewers reported problems when using sites such as Hotwire and Priceline so I decided to contact the hotel to help ensure that we'd receive a King/Non-smoking room upon checkin. I also confirmed that I was guaranteed for late arrival. Upon check-in we were greeted enthusiastically and were checked in efficiently. The room was very nice. The renovations scheduled for completion in May must be mostly finished. Our room looked just like the one on the website. We've stayed in Montreal's Hotel Nellgan and the 'new' rooms at the Hyatt are fairly similar to the rooms at the Nelligan. Obviously there is a difference between a boutique hotel like the Nelligan and the Hyatt but there is also quite a price difference. Especially at Hotwire prices!! We had no problems at all with room service which we used once. The room was cleaned very well each day and we had turn-down service each night. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Hyatt to anyone. The renovations look great, the rooms are very stylish. Our view looking over Place des Arts was wonderful, especially at night. Last but not least, the hotel is in a fantastic location... truly in the heart of downtown Montreal. The Old Port is right behind the hotel and Ste. Catherine's street is right out the door and to the left. No problems here, I suspect some of the 'bad' reviews came during the renovation or maybe even when the hotel was a Wyndham last year.

Room had clearly been renovated recently. Staff were very pleasant. You simply can't beat the location: 1) atop a mall with a decent food court AND a supermarket. 2) Walking distance from Old Town; and 3) near lots of night life. Only complaint is that the halls were noisy at night. Perhaps St. Patrick's Day had something to do with it? Tips: I self-parked and heard other guests complaining about difficulty with ransoming cars from valets. Go with self-park unless you expect alot of in-outs. Free highspeed wifi in lobby.
