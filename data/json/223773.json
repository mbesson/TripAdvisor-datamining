These were some of the muggiest days in Memphis this year. The a/c in the room functioned wonderfully. The biggest plus of this place it its location. It is a few blocks walk from Beale Street and the Peabody. After a late start, we left the hotel at 10:55 AM and still made it to the Peabody in time to watch the ducks march in. If you don't mind 15 people asking you to spare them some change on the walk back to the hotel at night from Beale Street (which is true in almost any American downtown area), this seems like the only \"decent\" chain hotel that is in the downtown area. It is half the price of all other options. Numerous great restaurants, bars and clubs are within walking distance. The staff at this hotel is just plain rude. There was no welcome when I checked in. There was no greeting as an Elite Diamond member. I usually am allowed to check out late, but they would only allow a 1 hour extension from 11 AM to noon. The front desk allowed me to extend my check out time until noon. However, the room attendant kept knocking on the door every hour starting at around 9 am asking if I was \"going to check-out yet.\" Even when I went down the hallway just to get some ice, she still asked me the same question and \"when exactly it would be.\" I kept telling her \"soon.\" I got fed up and finally just checked out at 11 AM. I thought the breakfast was decent for an econo lodge. This is not a \"your morning breakfast\" like comfort inn makes with several hot items. If you want that you can stay at the award winning comfort inn a few blocks away for double the price. There were bagels and toaster ovens; danishes; real orange juice; coffee and sliced bread. I pretty much expect a bunch of carbohydrates in the morning if I stay at the \"lesser\" choice hotels like econo lodge and rodeway inn. Unlike some of the other econo lodge franchises, it was better than just having the selection of a stale muffin, coffee, and a cheaply made sunny delight rip off orange mix as a beverage. I agree with what another reviewer said about the elevators. ANyone off the street could just walk into them. They are outside, across from the front desk, but they don't always seem to be paying much attention. All around the world, I seem to have strange fascinations like elevator inspection code documents within the elevator. These elevators did not have any. One of them went from floor to floor but the numbers did not light up on the buttons themselves and on the numbers showing you where you were above the elevator door. Parking is $10 per night per vehicle. There are in and out privileges. It did seem like a safer place to park overnight than many of the other \"open\" lots nearby.On the other hand, this place is not the Ritz. They really should offer free parking to paying hotel customers. It would likely boost their ratings some. The pool is strictly locked up at 10 PM. You literally can not even go outside to walk anywhere in the courtyard after a staff member locks the door. There are visible staff members during the day, but not so many at night. Also, I did not notice any security guards any place on the property. The bathroom was the worst part about this hotel. The finish inside the tub was peeling off. We made a comment about this to the management, but it looked exactly the same on the second night. They really should make a better effort to try and make the bathrooms look more decent. There is a coffee maker in the room and their were coffee packets but no creamer or sugar packets (at least in our room there wasn't). I drank black coffee that morning and that evening, the room attendant did not even leave more coffee packets for the next day. We didn't complain about this, but the hotel staff is not exactly responsive to complaints (like that dreadful tub) so we did not bother. If you have to stay downtown for cheap and want to walk everywhere, this may be the best option. However, if $60-$80 is your budget and you don't mind paying for cabs, public transportation or parking to go to Beale Street, you are better off somewhere else.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cConsider other options...\u201d", "Author": "sirpres", "ReviewID": "UR116279917", "Content": "It's built on up of a parking garage, if that tells you anything.

The only thing it has going for it is the location... it's within walking distance to Beale Street, the FedEx Forum and AutoZone Park.

No one was around, when suddenly we heard footsteps running up behind us. When we got to the next corner, police were directing cars out of the Peabody Hotel parking garage. We stayed on the corner while two young men appeared from behind us, walked across the street and disappeared down a dark alley behind the EconoLodge (remember what I said about the elevator?

We pre-booked this hotel online before we left for the US, as it was significantly cheaper than all others downtown. We did not go in the pool so cannot comment on this. There are a fair amount of 'cons' to this property: 1) The entrance/ car park/ lifts/ general area was pretty sketchy and run down. However in saying that it was the presentation of the property rather than anything or anyone behaving sketchy on the property itself. 2) The room, although it was pretty clean in the main, the blankets had smoking holes burned in 3) It is next to a derelict looking office block, and depending where your room is you can see straight in, and I suspect there are people living in that block, that's not really anything Econolodge can do about this! 4) The walls are a bit thin, but we were never woken up. You could hear people talking in their rooms tho as you walked down the corridor. 5) The breakfast room was not great - a bit depressing- and the selection was starch carbs only- pastry/cakes/ bagels. Coffee and OJ. I think this is the cheapest they can get away with. 6) Seems like flimsy complaint but there was a lack of TV channels, only a handful. Pros: Location Location Location!

I don't think the sheets are ever cleaned? They actually felt dirty and gritty. My wife said the room had a smell. The floor by the sink was damp and the hot/cold faucets were backwards. We never felt unsafe while walking to Beale street but we were asked for a handout by someone who approached as if he were concerned about our having a good time in the city. There was security person visible at the corner about a block before our hotel. If you want to hear good jazz music, the lounge across from the office had an excellent 4 piece band and the beers were about $3. You may need to show your room key to get in. The people in the longe were very friendly and the service was good. All in all, you get what you pay for, but, any other room we priced in this area was double the price.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price and friendly staff!

I was in Memphis for 5 nights at a conference at another hotel and shared a room with someone. When they had to depart a night early I searched from something reasonable in the area. I found this Econolodge and read the reviews. There seemed to have been an issue with noise but I had none during my stay. The room was basic but the King bed was REALLY comfortable. The hotel rooms are on the 7th through 10th floors over a parking garage. Checking in went fine with Deangela at the front desk. As I approached my room the housekeeping staff was very pleasant. I head some noise from the next room but it turned out to be the housekeeping person cleaning the bathroom. The walls are a bit thin but I had no problem. One think I liked was that the air/heat unit in the wall under the window was actually quiet when it ran. And it did not blow air directly at the bed as many hotel rooms do. I had a great night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The hotel offers a free continental breakfast, which is served in the blues bar/night club next door. It consists of juice, coffee (but no REAL milk or cream.. just powdered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153creamer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), HUGE bagels w/ cream cheese and REALLY large muffins. This was fine with me. Checkout with Lakita was also smooth. I was allowed to leave my bags there until my airport limo arrived in early afternoon. The hotel is in an area where there are few businesses and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend that single women walk in the area AFTER dark, but I felt safe on the street. The one caveat which might give some concern is security. The room floors are accessed by an outside elevator that stops on the six parking lot floors. The desk clerk can see people entering the elevator but they may be busy with guests. And they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if the person was going to a room or the parking lot floors. I guess I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paranoid but I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d point this out. It is easy walk to Beale Street, Main Street etc and the rate was at least 40% less than other hotels in the area. If I go back I would probably stay there again if I needed a fairly priced room in Memphis, a city with LOTS of empty hotels and yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for some reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c high hotel rates.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStop don't do it!!!\u201d", "Author": "Bmiss", "ReviewID": "UR97363453", "Content": "Just left the place now, stayed 5 minutes and left in fear of both my safety and health.

There was a 2\" pipe running across the top of the room on one wall but it was painted to match the wall and caused me no harm.
