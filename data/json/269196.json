In addition to the small kitchen, there's a lounge with sofa and a dining table, a bedroom with a very comfortable double bed, and a bathroom with shower.

What made this hotel special were the owners - they were friendly, spoke excellent English and were happy to book tickets for us to the Uffizi Gallery (which we would strongly recommend, to avoid the mile-long queue!)The location can't be faulted; we were within short walking distance of all the major sites, and the Duomo was practically at the end of the street! Would definitely stay here again, and would advise anyone travelling to Florence on a budget to do the same.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR436268835", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Holly_H"}, {"Content": "Nice stay in Firenze We booked over Internet and found a nice small hotel with a friendly atmosphere right in the centre of the old town, almost neighbour of the Dome.

I have only just now read the reviews here and so many of them echo how we felt about the hotel - the people that work there just made the visit so special. The room was spacious and comfortable and we didn't need air conditioning because it was winter - and the room was lovely and warm. We had a courtyard room which was nice and quiet. We only stayed in the main hotel for one night, then had 2 nights in the apartment and that was just the perfect end to our holiday. The only downside of the apartment is the 4 flights of stairs when you have your suitcase, but once there it was our own private haven. Immaculately clean, well furnished and so comfortable we didn't want to leave. Marco was very helpful with suggestions and driving directions. I agree with the person who said it's hard to find when driving, but only because of the one-way streets - we got there eventually and then Marco would mark on a map the best way to go. Perfect location too - just the highlight of our trip.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR881183424", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KatherineNZ"}, {"Content": "The friendliest hotel in Florence! I first stayed at Hotel Dali five years ago and have returned there every year.The hotel is in a prime, central location, but is also quiet and you feel wonderfully relaxed as soon as you walk through the door. The rooms are all beautifully cared for and there are a number with views over an Italian courtyard. From every single room you wake up to hear the Florentine church bells ringing over the city rooftops.For the quality of accomodation and central location, I am always surprised at the great value when staying at Hotel Dali...it is a very good price and you are always left with a few more Euro to spend on shoes!!Although the hotel is lovely and clean, the prices are excellent value and the location is central, none of these are the best feature of Hotel Dali. The very best thing about staying are the people who work there. Often when you are travelling to a foreign city, you look for 'a base' from where you can see the sites but the owners of Hotel Dali ensure that you get much more than that. Their friendliness and hospitality are second to none and you leave Florence touched with something very unique and special. You feel as if you are a friend of Hotel Dali rather than a guest and that is true if you stay just one night or for two weeks! Everyone who works at the hotel are keen to make sure you are as comfortable as possible and will help with any information you need.I would recommend Hotel Dali as a fantastic place to stay in Florence for a touch of warmth, a ray of sunshine and a gift of something truly Italian.", "Date": "Mar 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR750089443", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Hotel Dali Apartment Highly Recommended I travelled to Florence last January, and stayed in the Hotel Dali apartment for one week. It is a wonderful, centrally located one bedroom apartment, at a very good price. Just a few blocks from the main rooms of the hotel, near the Duomo, on a top floor looking out on views of the red tiled roofs of the city, decorated in Tuscan farmhouse style, this apartment makes a comfortable, surprisingly quiet, home away from home. Perfect for couples, families or solitary travellers who enjoy living more like natives than tourists while visiting Firenza. One caution: it is a walkup, with no elevator, so guests must be able to navigate several flights of narrow stairs. I would also like to note that Marco, the owner of Hotel Dali, is a very warm and gracious person.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR866303144", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "aelita208"}, {"Content": "Super affordable when you have a car   showReview(2866941, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 7, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR791546862", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "very basic, but OK for the money   showReview(2700441, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 13, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR992891403", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location   showReview(2698990, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 12, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR793890334", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "RTWtraveler"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel!!!   showReview(2450228, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 15, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR488852131", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A nice hotel and staff   showReview(2355252, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 2, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR713766470", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Choach73"}, {"Content": "Tranquil Hotel Dali   showReview(2314580, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR648399213", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TrueBlueTraveler"}, {"Content": "Dali an excellent value   showReview(2148846, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 3, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR551374138", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "great place to stay in Florence   showReview(2113192, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR510983596", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "beadhappy"}, {"Content": "Perfect Florence   showReview(2111871, 'full');", "Date": "May 23, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR276045034", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Location   showReview(1789719, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR649524555", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Cabo"}, {"Content": "Merci Marco pour votre chaleureux accueil\"   showReview(10660010, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR485052283", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "francoisejulia"}, {"Content": "parking hotel et salle de bain   showReview(8365988, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR129151940", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "italie2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d269196-r23202047-Hotel_Dali-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "269196", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
