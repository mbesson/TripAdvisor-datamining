As written in other reviews on this site, the hotel is not up to date inside, the renovation I assume means that it has been decorated at some point. We were in room 102. This room was in the north-east corner on the first floor and had a view from the balcony of a few houses and streets. The room had a large bed which was quite comfortable. The room and bathroom were both clean and well presented. The negatives start here. The room had two big windows that opened easily with shutters outside. While these are nice, the curtains inside the room do not shut. The hotel also has no in-room internet access which should be a given in any three star hotel. Between the wall where the head of the bed is and the store cupboard outside run water pipes. These are incredibly loud when anybody in rooms above us uses these pipes. Also, either above our bathroom or outside the building there is what sounds like a water tank which is constantly making noise. The walls are paper thin so you can hear practically everything going on in rooms around you. There are also no tea/coffee facilities in the room so the only option on drinks is buying from a nearby supermarket or using the mini bar. The breakfast is terribly dull with no hot food facility. I had breakfast three times over eight days. The hotel only serves food at breakfast as well so no restuarant for the rest of the day. The hotel, whilst close to the main street and vaparetto station was very over priced. We were greeted with, \" Since you are staying here for a long time, we will give you one of our best rooms.\" This sadly didn't happen. We asked to change rooms on the first night but were told that there were no other rooms available to switch to. I would definitely not recommend this hotel unless you can get it during the low season and don't have a room number that ends in anything from two to five as the problems we experienced probably apply to all rooms in the north-east corner of the hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem, Israel", "Title": "\u201cExcellent access to Venice but overcooked croissants\u201d", "Author": "evakama", "ReviewID": "UR127465339", "Content": "Excellent access to Venice via the Vaporetto which is within easy walking distance.

This small addition can make such a huge difference in the quality of the stay. c) Finally, the breakfast is extremely boring. There is not even a bread toaster for some hot food. The choice of the spread is plain boring. I guess it will cost less than 500 Euros to set the above things right and the make the stay excellent. Another thing to bear in mind is that the hotel is in Lido and not main Venice Island. It costs 13Euros for a return trip to Venice. Something to bear in mind for someone on a budget.

He was absolutely right. The hotel was a five minute walk to the water transport and then just a 15 minute water bus journey to S. Mark's Square. We did all the tourist things we were supposed to do but could return to the tranquility of The Lido. I really did not like being in the centre of Venice with all those crowds of people and so was so glad to go back to The Lido. The hotel was much better than we had hoped. It was a very high standard 3 star hotel. We had a good sized very pleasant room on the 2nd floor. The decoration of the room was a bit strange with every colour you can think of in it. Such a shame because natural colours would have been so much better. It had a really good bathroom and the whole hotel was spotlessly clean. The breakfast area was basic but we had a very good continental breakfast. The weather wasn't warm enough but next time we go we will hopefully be able to sit in the garden to have breakfast.

We weren't disappointed. The hotel is on Lido De Venice an island a short ferry trip from St Marks Square and could be summed up as \"Far from the madding crowd\" - it allows you to escape the vast numbers of tourists in the heart of Venice, to find good quality food and drink at reasonable prices and to receive excellent customer service. We were fortunate to get the last available room (number 404) which came with a beautiful terrace overlooking the local canal and with a skyline view across to Venice. It was an unexpected bonus which helped to make our holiday. If you choose to use this hotel ask about the 4th floor rooms as they all appear to have a terrace. From the moment we arrived to the time we left we felt welcome and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Breakfast was 'continental' with cereals, breads, croissants, boiled eggs, cream cheese, etc supported by fruit juices and excellent coffee. No complaints there. Our room was spotlessly clean with a nice sized on-suite, TV, and easy to use safe. It had an interesting round, domed ceiling painted to look like clouds in a blue sky ! The hotel is easily found down a quite street about 2-300 metres from the ferry terminal and has lots of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. There's also the beach about 10 minutes walk away, it's really well worth a visit. The only 'downside' to the hotel could be the fact that you have to travel by ferry to reach the heart of Venice, but it only takes a few minutes and there are very regular ferries. The cost for each journey is 6.50 euros which in truth is a rip-off when set against the cost to locals (1.50 euros). If you're likely to make multiple journeys (we did) to Venice and other islands such as Murano, Burano (both a must) look at the various multi-ticket offers. If you get your timing right you can make these very attractive because you'd have to pay from Venice anyway. Work out your timings to get max value from a 12, 24 or 36 hour ticket. We bought a 12 hour ticket for 16 euros and did all we wanted to do across a single day starting about 10.00am.

Easy access to Venice by boat Cons 1. Wifi access does not extend to the rooms; you have to be in the lobby or near the elevator We stayed for just one night in Lido when visiting Venice. We flew into Marco Polo airport and took the Alilaguna water taxi from the airport which dropped us off at the ferry terminal - about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel website has good directions from the ferry terminal and Lido island is not complicated to navigate which means finding the hotel is straightforward. The staff is communicative via email and phone as well. We stayed in a double bed and the room and the bathroom were very clean. There was A/C in the room (a big plus, Venice was warm and humid even in mid September) and very interesting decor/paint color in the rooms. The internet as stated before is fast, but wifi does not extend to all the rooms, at least not to the 2nd floor where we were staying; you have to be in lobby for wifi access to work properly. There are restaurants, bars and gelatarios (open at least till midnight) within easy walking distance so you can grab a bite to eat if your flight lands late at night like ours did. Breakfast is good (cereal, boiled eggs, meats, fruit juice) and is served starting early morning in the hotel. Lido beach is very close (worth visiting) and car parking is also available (we did not use it). The major drawback of course is that this is Lido, not Venice itself so it takes some time (45 minutes or so) to get to the city by water taxi. Water taxis are also spendy per trip, so that would be something to keep in mind if you are planning to commute back and forth from the city. We checked in the night before, checked out in the morning, dropped our luggage off in Venice train station (direct water taxi from the Lido ferry terminal), did Venice in the morning and afternoon and left Venice in the evening by train.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wassenaar", "Title": "\u201caverage but clean\u201d", "Author": "traveller20000", "ReviewID": "UR115726705", "Content": "We reserves 4 rooms for our family trip to Venice at Atlanta Augustus Hotel.

Even with higher prices of hotels there, it still more fun and less hastel to stay where attractions are. Water transportation is also very costly, and this adds up to expenses of staying out of the main island. Anyway, the hotel was really clean and breakfast was ok for a three stars hotel. Staff were generally helpful except for one who was rode and aggressive for no apparent reason! Car parking is very small, and I would suggest that visitors leave their cars in the parking outside the island before they take the fairy. This way, not only save the cost of transporting the car, but also find more reasonable parking for un-needed car.

The exterior suggests a very pleasant hotel, however, the interior does not live up to expectations. On the plus side the location is not far from the water taxis nor the the main strip of shops/bars(then again not difficult as the Island is only small) All areas of the hotel appear were quite clean. The bedroom was basic with no aircon (Italy in May is warm, it must be unbearable in July) There was a TV in the room but it was tiny and no English channels nor film option (Yes, when on holiday the idea is not to stay in your room, but you cannot stay out all day/night) The breakfast area was very basic as was the breakfast on offer. The bar area can barely be called as such, it is an after thought. Finally, the hotel staff. Other than a Good Morning/Evening there was no interaction, no asking how I was finding the Lido, what I thought of Venice etc, they seemed quite distant/uninterested. I think the lack of lounge/bar area meant no relationship was created. Wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend unless like me the rate was very good. The average I've given the hotel is down to the rate I paid, if I'd paid more, it would have been a poor. As a suggestion go to the Ausonia Hungaria hotelfor a drink (just 3 euro for a beer, which compared to most was very cheap) & something to eat (Better still check rates and stay there!) It is a larger hotel on the main strip which is set back and looks quite grande with seating outside which is very nice. Welcomed with a smile and a chat from the bar lady (Jelena) who was very nice. All in all the Lido is a pleasant place to go and unwind. It isn't a place to be wowed. Beach was ok and was fairly quiet. As for Venice, it was something of a disappointment. Yes, it is pretty and the water taxi has a novelty value but it is a lot of very nice! You wind around street after street which is ok at first, but grows tiresome as other than a tiny square with cafe/bar there is little to see. Quaint squares and a sitting down somewhere is all well and good late in the day after a busy day of sightseeing, but not when that is the sight to be seen and it is only 10:00 in the morning. If staying for more than a few days get the 7 day water pass for 50 euro (water taxi runs throught the night every 20/30 mins) and use the Alilaguna water bus from Marco Polo airport to the lido.

The hotel is only a short walk from the Lido stop (St. Eliz Maria). The nearby Garadini restaurant is worth a visit. Nothing flashy but good value for money and lots of locals. The man at the front desk is a bit strange. He asked for our passport and then gave us the key to our room. He said he would give our passports back in five minutes. He didn't come to give them back so we popped in on our way out that evening to get them. He then took our key back and said we had to leave our passports there each time we left. I actually thought that as a tourist you are meant to have photo ID on you when travelling about. In any case we didn't feel comfortable leaving our passports with this man and just left via the back door! A bit strange and possibly dodgy. Breakfasts are OK and the waitress is quite friendly.

The hotel had a building permit sign out front, so I assume they may have just reopened, or perhaps it was just a seasonal special. We had no problems with any construction. In regards to a few earlier comments, this is one of the many hotels in Europe that have 20-30 rooms. It is a 3-star hotel. The lobby is small, but I found it very clean, neat and well appointed. There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that was likely added just to get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the hotel, and they will gladly make you a drink, but there is nobody actually drinking at the bar. I did get a glass of wine to take up to the room. The staff spoke plenty of English for me, but I must say I hate reviewers who check in to a moderately priced (for Venice) hotel expecting all of the staff to speak perfect English. Perhaps these people should vacation in Detroit. The rooms were decent, not fancy. The beds were comfortable. We were supposed to have a quad room and for some reason were given a triple. When I brought this to the attention of the desk manager we were just given an additional double down the hall. Had the hotel been fully booked this might have been a disaster. As it was it was nice to have the extra bathroom in the morning. The extra bed in the triple was a smaller bed, and four lumberjacks booking a quad might be in for a rude surprise. As for the bathrooms, both of our bathrooms were very modern with modern fixtures and absolutely spotless. The shower was in a bathtub sized stall with a little ledge so a woman might be able to kind of sit to shave her legs. There might be those who could find fault with the rooms or some other aspect of the hotel, but I don't see how anyone could complain about the bathrooms. The hotel is located about a 10-minute walk to the Vaporetto station, and the ride to St. Mark's takes about 20 minutes. The cost has risen very dramatically from what is listed in the guidebooks, I presume because of the rising price of oil. The cost of a 48-hour pass cost our family of four about 100 Euros. A single ride costs 6.5 Euros, so you must buy the pass if you stay on Lido. This is an expense you should factor in when calculating hotel expenses. On the other hand, my wife enjoyed being away from the gaggle of people on the main islands. We were able to walk on normal streets at night and spend slightly less for dinner than we might have had we been in Venice proper, although it was still plenty high. One reviewer makes mention of the Lido \u00e2\u20ac\u0153casino.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I think the Lido \u00e2\u20ac\u0153casino\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd may be closed and moved to the main islands. There is a slot parlor a block away from the hotel, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all it is. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t claim to be a casino. Finally, one reviewer complained about the \"filled\" croissants. I must concur. There is nothing more disgusting then a \"filled\" croissant, and that was what was offered for breakfast, although the other offereings were good. I found that if I tore the ends off and ate them, I could then rip the top off and leave the nasty filling sitting on the uneaten bottom of the croissant. They were sprinkled lightly with sugar and were quite good if eaten this way. I think perhaps the hotel was filling the croissants to make the guests eat fewer of them, and from looking around at breakfast, it was working. I talked to other people who felt the same way I do about these things, so if management is reading, please ditch the filled croissants, or at least offer some plain ones.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely exterior awful croissants\u201d", "Author": "goodtogethome", "ReviewID": "UR10069857", "Content": "When I saw the beautiful exterior of this hotel I was full of hope.

The complimentary toiletries included a small bar of soap a sachet of shampoo and shower cap - probably the sparsest ever for a hotel of this standard. Normally this wouldnt bother me but since the introduction of only taking cetain liquids on planes I now take little with me, so depend on hotel products. The big disappointment however was the breakfast. There was only choice of tea or coffee no herbal teas. Each table had two jam filled croissants and two rolls and two dried pieces of bread. When I asked the reception staff if it might not be possible to have plain croissants they said 99percent of our guests like them and looked at me as if I had insulted them. The only other thing on offer was two sweet cakes and cold eggs - at least I wasnt tempted to overeat as has been the case at hotels with sumptuous breakfasts. The only fruit on offer was inferior grapes and apples. The hotel had no feedback leaflets, so assume the management do not care what their guests think about the hotel .

My husband and I chose to stay in Lido as a quieter and more economical alternative to the Grand Canal area in Venice - Huge Mistake. The hotel was very old and was not all that they advertised to be. I upgraded us to a \"Junior Delux Penthouse Suite\" - a complete joke! The jacuzzi tub was broken, the room itself was very outdated and offered no delux ammenities. The lobby was very shabby and immediately we knew that we made an error in our selections. The hotel staff spoke very little english and the complimentary breakfast was horrible, just some dried rolls and coffee. Considering the additional costs of daily transportation to and from main Venice (you must take water taxi's) there was zero benefit in staying in Lido.
