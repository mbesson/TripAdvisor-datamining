However, it is old (d\u00e9cor, furnishings, kitchenette) and a little run down. I was surprised that it still met the usually high standards set by the Accor Group. It is also 13kms from the city centre and around 3 blocks from the Metro Train & Bus station. We didn't get to see how efficient the Rome Metro was to get around because there was a strike the day we needed to use it. Long way to walk to find the trains and buses not working! But apparantly public transport strikes in Rome are common and occur regularly! We were able to catch a taxi and the fact there was 4 of us meant it wasn't too expensive.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cBest bargain in the business quarters of Rome: EUR\u201d", "Author": "LucySatti", "ReviewID": "UR118039740", "Content": "Booked a duplex for three person for four nights in Adagio Rome Garden and I found it fantastic: very tidy and spacious, with 2 separate bedrooms (a large one with twin beds + a smaller one with an individual bed), a big bathroom, a livingroom, a kitchinette and a terrace facing the famous Centro de la Civilt\u00e0 del Lavoro. What else could three ladies wish for? :-) Location is very good: perfectly connected with Fiumicino, Ciampino and the city center via bus lines and Metro lines A and B. The closest subway stations are EUR Fermi and EUR Laurentina. In the surroundings there are a few restaurants and bars, a McDonalds, two supermarkets and Gay Village (for those interested in this aspect). In the immediate vicinity of Adagio Rome Garden there are a few museums/centers/churches as well: - The Roman Civilization Museum - The Planetarium - The Prehistoric Musuems - The Traditional Popular Arts Museum - Le Colis\u00e9 Carr\u00e9 (Centro de la Civilt\u00e0 del Lavoro) - St. Peter and St. Paul Basilic The service was impeccable! No flaw. The receptionists are multilingual, hospital and very helpful. Upon request they provide maps, brochures and precious information on everything relating to Rome: seesighting, archaeology, restaurants and events. I rate this aparthotel excellent. TIP: For archaeology related info, ask the night audit Mahdi Fellak. He has the studies and expertise in the field, and avid researcher, and his info is far superior than a normal tour guide would ever provide you with.

Don't expect any luxury apartments here (it's more like an apartment-hotel), but for 3-4 nights it does the job perfectly and it's reasonably clean, cheap and comfortable. We did our booking for Rome late and didn't have much choice, also the same Adagio hotel Dehon was fully booked. Had the apartment for two, with the balcony. The view is not spectacular since it's in the EUR, i.e. the newer part of Rome, but still it was great to have a balcony to sit on. Transport - metro station is not too far from the hotel and very convenient when you go to the city centre, for 1 Euro. It's a long ride. However on the way back we always missed the last train so count on the taxi ride back to the hotel (20 Euros, but make sure you catch the official cab.) Rooms are not spectacular, but functional. Same applies for the bathroom. Internet was not free but it worked well for a small fee. What I loved the most was that the parking in front of the hotel was completely free, so we just parked the car there and enjoyed Rome by transport and on foot. They also have quadruple rooms so it's also something to consider when traveling in groups or for families.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cApartment is clean,but far from main centre\u201d", "Author": "Sangs_143", "ReviewID": "UR117765216", "Content": "My hubby & I stayed in this place from 31st Aug to 3rd Sep..

It takes 20-30 minutes to get into the center by bus or Metro, but we did not mind. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel and we found the buses very convenient, also providing interesting views of the city. We got 7-day transit passes which allow unlimited rides, so we could jump on and off buses to get to various locations. By studying the bus map, we found we could get almost anywhere we wanted with one change. We liked having the kitchen because we could have breakfast in the room and sometimes a snack in the evening if we had had a big meal at midday, which was frequently the case, Not much in the immediate area, but just down the street are a supermarket and a good pastry and gelato shop.

The hotel is a residence apartments with nearly all rooms being duplex comprising of kitchenette, hall, living room, bathroom and bedrooms, all with balconies or if on ground floor a patio garden. There are studio rooms which are one roomed affairs, I understand, and should be avoided for long term stays. Prices are very reasonable for an apartment per night, bearing in mind the large size of the apartment you get! Reception is extremely helpful and knowledgeable, with a large amount of information for the tourist to hand and to view. Taxis can be ordered and are very quick to turn up. There is free car parking in the hotel (are rarity here) and a superb Chinese / Japanese attached to the hotel building; the food is amazing, the best quality food and cooking I have had in years from a Chinese restaurant \u2026and very reasonably priced. Try the Sweet and Sour chicken! The hotel, I assume, was built around the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s. The apartment rooms are an oddity of a 60\u2019s/70\u2019s style and with a \u201cSoviet flavour\u201d. The furniture is old, again probably 70\u2019s and the apartment rooms from level 2 and above are in need of refurbishment; certainly a lick of paint would not go amiss and an update. These rooms smell musty and this tends to get in ones clothes. For ground level to level 1 the rooms have has a lick of paint, tidied up plus nice kitchenettes! These are OK. There is self service laundry washing, drying (Washing 4 Euro, Drying 4 Euro\u2026expensive!!) and ironing but buy your own washing liquid, etc. The soap tablets you can by from reception are next to useless! All rooms have a TV with Italian channels nearly all in the Italian language; odd seeing most of the guests are English speakers. Please note if you are in a rush to leave and want pay your bill, it would appear this could be time consuming if it is a large value amount! The location was OK for me as it is in a quiet area of an admin/ business district, with a number of good shops in Via Europe which is a 10 minute walk and other restaurants are near by. Also visit Euroma2 which is a 10 minute taxi ride (5 Euros), excellent shopping! Breakfast is provided next door in a bar/caf\u00e9 at 3.5 Euros for a coffee and croissant, etc\u2026expensive!!
