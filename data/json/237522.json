{"Reviews": [{"Content": "An additional warning Another Trip Advisor member warned the Hotel Stella Mary was fraudulent. Well, perhaps not fraudulent but the questionable ethics we experienced cause me to add another horror story about this hotel.I booked two rooms for a two nights in May 2007 (I had to list March because Trip Advisor wouldn't let me list a stay scheduled in the future!), using a credit card to reserve them. I followed up sometime later and received an email that there were new owners and new management didn't have a record of my reservation. However, I was told, with a new credit card reservation deposit, the rooms would be available. While I was taken aback by this response, I complied and re-reserved the rooms. Sometime later, I received an email from the hotel telling me that they were cancelling our reservation because during the two days in question they had a group much larger than they had expected and that the hotel has only seven rooms.How about that for a reason to cancel your reservation - we can make more money by cancelling your room reservation and booking a larger group! Having read the fraudulent posting of another member, I had to submit this additional warning against counting on the folks at Hotel Stella Mary, Florence to have a room when you expected it!", "Date": "Mar 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR108308874", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "traveldean"}, {"Content": "It was okay, not bad, just okay We chose this hotel for it's proximity to the airport. The reviews on the - site were all good.After arriving and realizing that the hotel was smack in the middle of a horrible, smelly, and dirty part of town, we were disappointed. The room was very nice size with a decent size bathroom and bath tub. The AC unit was in the room, but there was only one controller for the entire hotel. We had to go to the front desk to have it adjusted every time. The window was padlocked shut, however the view would have only been another dirty building.I would not advise women travelling in small groups to stay here.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR262585334", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SardiniaMichelle"}, {"Content": "Fraudulent Hotel Three freinds and I made reservations online and travelled six hours by train to Florence.

The 2 flights of stairs were a little steep at first, but after walking around Florence for 4 days we soon took it in our stride.Our twin-bedded room had a clean bathroom, and a little balcony which afforded us a good view of the courtyard. We weren't bothered by noisy traffic as we were not in a front bedroom - in fact, we were only ever awoken by the Duomo ringing its bells for early morning mass! How wonderful. The location of the hotel, so close to the main sights of Florence, was excellent, and the staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very typical European fare, and the coffee was great. All in all an excellent experience and I would recommend this hotel to my friends (as indeed it was recommended by a friend to me).", "Date": "Oct 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR120013463", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Sleeping Impossible AC is turned off at midnight.

The a/c seemed to be on a timer, (the owner said it blacks out when used too much), but was always able to be restarted with the remote control which was kept only at the desk. So at 3 o'clock in the morning when it had shut off and was still hot, one of us would have to go to the desk to ask the person to come to our room to turn it back on. The only positive I can say is at least it was fairly clean, and the room big enough. Would I stay there again?
