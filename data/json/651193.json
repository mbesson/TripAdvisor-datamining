I just stayed there for 3 nights. The reason I chose this hotel is just because it's a new hotel opened for just 3 months time. However, it's quite disappointed that the room is not so new as expected. Can you imagine that water will slip out from shower room for a new 4 star hotel? The staff are absolutely cool and not helpful. They will never greet any guest. The location of this hotel is just fine. It's about 30 minutes taxi ride from the city centre, but the problem is most taxi driver still don't know its location. Another bad experience I had is the housekeeping staff left my room door unlocked after the room cleaning. I will not recommend this hotel unless you've got a very good rate and don't mind encounter any bad experience. I'll rate this hotel below 4 star standard.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR465590677", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CChanHK"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u6fc4\u4eb1\u9288\u5847APPY\u9286?#x201d;   showReview(19169053, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR379478262", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u6d93\u5d84\u7a76   showReview(19168125, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR505239382", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d651193-r14010689-Marco_Polo_Parkside-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "651193", "Price": "$169"}}
