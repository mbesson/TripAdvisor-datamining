But once we checked in and saw the room, we were fine. The front desk staff is extremely nice and eager to help. The rooms are much larger than the average hotel and include a microwave and mini-refrigerator, which really came in handy. A five minute drive will take you to the center of Napa. Our only concern was we didn't want to drive at all after drinking and there was nowhere within walking distance (aside from taco trucks and one diner) to eat. So my husband had to limit himself to one glass of wine with dinner. If you drink a lot, this will be an issue unless you have a designated driver or take cabs.

Bathroom was acceptable, but not great. Service guy was friendly and referred us to a fantastic vegetarian restaurant (Ubuntu) which we much appreciated. The hotel room entrances are on the outside of the building. Ours faced the parking lot. I would have preferred a hotel with doors inside the building, but didn't realize this in time before we booked. Not exactly my idea of how one should enjoy themselves in wine country, but we managed to spend the money we saved on our room -- and spent it on wine and great food.

I dont know if they turn the spa off during the day or if it was broken. I like this location since it close to shopping and restaurants. Since I live in a rural area (the sticks) shopping and finding a decent restaurant is a treat. The beds seemed fine to me I didnt think they were too hard. I stay here because it is cheap relative to many other hotels in the area, less than $100 for a regular room. Having a refrigerator & microwave is convenient.

Decent hot and cold breakfast buffet in a clean, inviting public dining area. Helpful staff offered to print directions, was efficient, and was responsive to minor issues such as key cards and a blow dryer that each stopped working. Location was relatively convenient to major routes to the wineries; closest to the Carneros region and the southern Napa wineries. Target and grocery shopping was a quick hop away. Those with Hyatt points can stay here very inexpensively, especially relative to other accommodations during the high season. Adequate close parking. The Bad: As others have noted, the location is loaded with eyesores, from the adjacent abandoned liquor store to the brightly lit car lots across the street and adjacent. I also agree that the beds could be more comfortable. Our room near the front of the building bore the full brunt of noises all night from the busy road; I couldn't have slept without earplugs, but perhaps rooms further from the street are quieter. The front desk gave very poor customer service regarding a significant reservation mistake they made; other encounters were polite, but not friendly. Those who have stayed in a Hawthorn suite will miss the large kitchen area in the Inn. Overall, a decent value if you're a sound sleeper not looking for a particularly romantic Napa getaway.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in the wine country\u201d", "Author": "momonthegoe", "ReviewID": "UR8192893", "Content": "We just returned from a 2-night stay in Napa at the Hawthorn.

Come to find out, there was a group of about 30 high school aged kids drinking alcohol in the parking lot & playing loud music from their cars. HAWTHORN SUITES STAFF APPARENTLY DID NOTHING!!! After ~ 3am, & some earplugs, I finally fell asleep. We were running late the following morning, to get to the wedding, and consequently never said anything to the front desk. The following morning we went to the wedding and when we returned, that afternoon, our room key didn't work. I initially thought our key had been damaged, so I went to the front desk and got a new key made. Upon returning to our room, WE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE IN OUR ROOM!! AFTER ONLY ONE DAY, OF OUR TWO DAY STAY, THIS DUMP RENTED OUT OUR ROOM TO SOMEONE ELSE????? Our things were later found, in the maids' area & we were informed that there were no more rooms, of the type we'd paid for, and we could leave if we wanted to.

It is next to a Ford dealership and an abandoned liquor store so the view is not the best. However, since you have to drive to the wineries anyways, it is pretty easy to get to the main roads to get where you need. The directions from their website is not helpful. Make sure to get directions beforehand either by calling or using mapquest. It is near IHOP, Denny's, Jamba Juice, Target, Burger King, and a supermarket.

The staff at first was very friendly and offered us information about wineries in the area. However, the attitude changed when we arrived back at the hotel late at night/morning after the wedding. We were being very respectful, not being loud or anything that would disturb the other guests, we just wanted to go to bed. We arrived at our room and our key cards did not work in the lock on the door. After going back twice to retrieve new cards we had the staff member on duty come and look at the door. Nothing worked to open the door; he brought numerous keys and a machine. After about 45 minutes the staff member on duty called the manager but explained to us that he did not answer the phone and we asked him to call again but he gave us the number. One of the members of our group had to call the manager herself, and explain to him the problem. Finally after an hour of waiting with little apology our door was open. The next morning when we went to pay we asked for a discount on our room and the staff member that was now on duty was extremely rude. Was condescending to us calling us \"girls\" and telling us that we only had to wait an hour and it was very late at night we came in. After loosing sleep and being spoken to very rudely we were only given a $30 discount. We should not have to worry about getting in to our hotel room no matter what time it is or who we are. They had no regard that they had left 3 women stranded outside their hotel room.

The receptionists was also very helpful and courteous during the several calls we made asking about breakfast, the tub, quiet room, etc... And the room was quiet and very clean. There is hot breakfast, a basic one: eggs, sausage, potatoes, bread/bagel, good coffee, juice, cereal, hot chocolate, tea. Free internet access in your room. Fridge (excellent for storing your bottles of water or leftovers or refreezing your icepacks) , microwave, coffee maker, and hair dryer too. They also take Hyatt points here. With all that said, this is a basic hotel/motel, not a luxurious one and not a romantic one. There is no view. The location is in downtown Napa, so it's a short drive north to the wineries. During low season, I'll look for bargains at the B&Bs or romantic high end places, but during the summer, when most of the day is spent outside, and I just need a nice cool, quiet, and clean room with all the conveniences, the Hawthorne fits the bill.

It was $129/nt (a little more then what I like to pay but. . .). Anyway, I reserved my room. Check in at the Embassy was great. Super nice staff. The room was nice but the internet access was horrible and they wanted to charge $10/nt for it. I was not happy with all the $$$'s for extras like the net and the phone calls. I finally got on the net and found the Hawthorne Suites for $89/nt, free breakfast and free internet. Sign me up. . . . The next day, I checked in early (12 PM) with no problem and the clerk was great. Room was nice an cozy, had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Very clean, well lit and a nice TV.
