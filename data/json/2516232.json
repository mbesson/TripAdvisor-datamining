The free breakfast was very nice and enjoyable with a good variety and they have a mini-coffee bar (self-serve) set-up 24/7 which is great for a coffee drinker like myself. They include free WiFi - which is not only great but saves some money. Nice plasma TVs in the room. Their work-out room was nice and very modern and had good basic offerings. Their outdoor (heated) pool was great (took a nice swim) as was the whirlpool. Another nice feature is that 1/4 mile behind the hotel is a huge outlet of restaurants, stores and pretty much anything you could want or need.

New hotel very nice, clean and great breakfast. The decorating is top notch. One of the nicest Hampton Inn's that I have been to. Location is good too, shopping very close (walmart, etc) and good restaurants nearby. Got this hotel on Hotwire for $59.00 per night and that is with a suite with 2 queen beds. Reg price is $149.00. Wished I would have booked more than 2 nights because I did not get this hotel when I tried thru Hotwire.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vevey, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNew hotel, OK\u201d", "Author": "mojave", "ReviewID": "UR24043073", "Content": "The hotel is new. Staff is pleasant, breakfast is fine but not outstanding. I had booked nine nights, but left after two, because the windows are sealed and I like to sleep with an open window. A few things were irritating, such as a bad fax number on the web site. No fridge or microwave in the room.
