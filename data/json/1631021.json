Its is not clean at all. The minute we stepped into the room we found dust on the table and the bed. Very noisy and you can here everything that happens in the room next to you from flushing the toilet to what they are watching on TV or just if people are talking. Breakfast was not tasty at alllll. The address of the Hotel is very hard to explain to taxi drivers. The neighborhood of the hotel is bad and full of shops that sell car parts. Not a friendly area for women. The hotel lobby is very small as well.

The swimming pool really is excellent. There was rarely more than 2 people swimming and there was enought space to sit, sun bath and chill out. More than welcome after a hot day touring the grand bazaar etc. Rooms are spacious with comfortable beds, good air con, internet access, great bathroom and quiet. Couldn't ask for more and I wouldn't wanted to have stayed any closer to the old district. However, service was very poor. Hotel staff's english was either mediocre or non at all. I'm not being an arrogant English man here expecting that they know my language. Our party spoke spanish, german and French as well as English. For an international hotel you would expect better language skills. Asking for anything became farcical. Food orders required long discusions amongst staff even when we pointed to the dish on the menu...it still arrived wrong. Drinks never arrive and were over priced with 18% service charge! An iron took 4 hours to appear...despite several requests. They tried to charge for minibar items we didnt take...not once but in each of our three rooms. Tried asking them....Was my room already paid for? Are you just taking a deposit? ....they just ignored me. We only stayed 4 nights you'd think we were there longer! Shame as hotel itself was great.

First he said that it was a mistake and that he would refund the money in 48 hours this is the third month and i am still waiting the refund. the Hotel is closed down on booking.com and other websites too.

The hotel insisted they had no reservations for us, despite us having the confirmation. After a lot of shouting & gesticulating, they put us in a car and we landed up in the sleaziest part of town in a hotel I wouldn't have dreamt of staying in. To add insult to injury, it was my birthday, and we were due to have a really special meal, but we landed up having McDonalds! And even worse, the hotel manager harrassed my female business colleague both face-to-face and by telephone to her room - until at 1am she unplugged the phone and jammed her suitcase and a chair behind the door. The City Hotel then changed their story when the booking company contacted them, and said my card details were not valid which was utter rubbish as it is a company debit card and was used throughout our whole trip with no problem.
