The front desk staff searched under my last name, but no luck. They finally located it, under the other guests name in the room (same last name). -The room itself was spacious and the flooring was new and pretty nice. The room had a flat screen TV and a view of the Bell Centre. The bathroom had a large crack in the ceiling and the shower curtain wouldn't stay closed. One of the chairs in the room had visable stains on it, as did one of the pillows. After a shower the second day, I was drying off and felt something cold on my leg. I looked down to find a bottle cap stuck to the towel (we did not have beer in our room so it was not ours). A nice feature was the computer in the room, but the internet connection was hit and miss. There was a coffee maker but no mini fridge. The beds were comfortable, as were the pillows. Shower pressure was fine. -Noise was not an issue. We were located near the elevator but didn't hear much noise from the hall. There were a large group of young adults that arrived by bus, but as noted we did not have any issues with them partying or making noise. -The maid service was disapointing. Although they were polite, they did not come to make up the room until after 5 pm both of the first two days. Considering we were out of the room most of the day, coming back to find the room not done was less than perfect. We ended up only getting the room done twice because of this. -We did not get a chance to try the restaurant, as when we went down to eat at 1:45 pm one day we were informed they closed at 2 pm. The store in the lobby was also closed at wierd times. -The lobby area seemed to be constantly filled with people lounging around. I assume they were guests, but each time we went down the area was packed. -Location was very good for us, close to the Bell Centre and shopping. There are a few restaurants very close, and several more a short walk away. -Check out was fine, no issues. The front desk staff helped out by calling us a taxi which was great. In closing, I really wanted to give this hotel a better rating, but based on the areas noted above, a 2 out of 5 is about right.

You can throw away your GPS App with this destination right in the downtown. Bell Centre; home to the Canadiens hockey is just a block away which makes Hotel Espresso the \"Hab\",I mean hub of Montreal for future visits with my husband a special Hab fan. This was my first trip to Montreal in many years and I was loaded down with needed \"stuff\" for my son who lives there. My ill husband could not accompany me for this pre-Christmas junket and on my own with little knowledge of the city to navigate its many one-ways and detours a central hotel adjacent to public transport or walking distance was paramount. WestJet gave coupons for Budget and a minivan for the 133 kilos of X-Cargo and maxed out luggage w/bike in a stealth black Dodge fuel-saver \"new\" Grand Caravan for the duration and may I mention that Vic is a very special Budget Agent. Arrival by WestJet's polite and genuinely helpful crew on Red-Eye was seamless and pleasant with a three hour differential from Vancouver. Highway signage is wonderful by other cities' standards, despite Quebec's monumental undertaking for region-wide restoration of the aging road infrastructure. Just follow the great signage from the airport to Montreal \"Centreville\" and 18 minutes later in \"cautionary\" slow speed due to environmental and cost effective \"ARRET\"'s everywhere and no right turns on the less usual x-lights, you emerge off a turnpike and amazingly there was Rue Guy with the well-lit and inviting sign for Hotel Espresso right off the corner. The professionally engaged; friendly, and genuinely, amenable management that began with the previous week's phoned arrangements, until departure with secured underground parking right downtown for my last afternoon had staff I saw, ensuring each guest's needs and desires with all queries fulfilled to their satisfaction. Additionally, to its central and accessible location; their great Sunday brunch at a reasonably cost; full-menu restaurant, clean and inviting rooms, and other facilities (i.e. full spa; gym, and outdoor pool) make this a great hotel to return to after every memorable evening at any one of the entertainment; nightclub or romantic restaurants that make Montreal famous. Did I mention that you are greeted with complimentary \"real\" espresso coffee with every tour past the lobby? We all enjoyed the sparkling Spanish wine on ice. We did make one wonderful side trip to \"The Willow Inn\" in Hudson for a lovely Sunday brunch overlooking the lake and watching the annual Santa Claus parade down the main street which will not be soon forgotten.

The first two nights were fine. The room was spacious and reasonably clean. There was a large TV and a desktop computer with constant connection to the internet. There was also a mini fridge. The restaurant did leave much to be desired; it was over-priced ($12 per person for buffet breakfast), it took the staff an inexplicable amount of time to replenish the food and some items, such as the sausages, were overcooked (to the point of being near-rock hard). While I did appreciate the location, in downtown and a short walk from the Bell Centre, the police station, several good restaurants and stores, I felt they over charged for the parking (more than $10 per day, despite being a guest). The first two nights were quiet enough, but the third night (the Saturday before Hallow'een) was a night in hell. I stayed in and went to bed early as I had to leave early in the morning for Ottawa and then on to the Maritimes. Around 10:30 pm, I was hauled from my sleep by revelers parading up and down the hall yelling, whooping and making pirate noises. They were also dressed like pirates. They had just returned from the Montreal-Boston game (Montreal had won) and they were drinking and partying in the hall. I figured they would celebrate a few minutes and then head back to their rooms, but they didn't. About 45 minutes later I called the front desk to complain and I asked them to deal with the noise. Nothing happened. The noise finally stopped around midnight, when he revelers headed out to the streets. I was again pulled from my sleep an hour or so later when the revelers returned. This time I yelled at them through the door and they did head into their rooms and it quieted down for about an hour, when I was -- for the third time -- pulled from my sleep by excessive noise in the room next door. That noise sounded suspiciously like a plumber replacing pipes. There was an inexplicable amount of banging and clanging (especially for 2:30 am) and finally, very tired and very angry, I called the front desk again. I was assured someone would be sent to check on the noise. Nothing happened. When checking out, I complained about the noise and said I had considered calling the police. The clerk told me calling the police would have solved nothing, and that I should put myself in his shoes, that he could not control the other guests. Well, that annoyed me even further. I told him he needed to put himself in my shoes, a paying guest who was trying to get a night of sleep, and who, given that he had paid for the room, was entitled to a restful sleep. I also told the clerk that was the first time in all my years that I had stayed in a hotel where the staff allowed guests to make such noise (even though the hotel stated in its ad on Expedia that id did not allow partying and proms and the such). I told him he could have asked the guests to quiet down and if they refused, he could have asked them to leave and if they refused, he could have called the police and ask them to remove the guests. I also suggested he could have moved us to another room to make it up to us. A couple of days after I checked out, I sent a note -- and complaint -- about my stay to the hotel's manager. More than a month later, I still have not received a reply. The clerk did allow us two nights of free parking, but that was of little consolation for virtually a night of lost sleep. I will never stay at Hotel Espresso again.

The location is ideal in downtown Montreal, near two Metro stations and a stone's throw from the Bell Centre. The hotel (formerly a Days Inn, I believe) was clean and comfortable with an in-room desktop computer available with free internet - which we found was a big plus. The bathroom could have used some updating though. The lobby was a bit dingy and the same clientele always seemed to be hanging out there watching TV - not sure why since every room should have a TV. We ate at the hotel restaurant one morning and had the breakfast buffet. For about $12, it seemed overpriced for what we got and when many food items were depleted, such as bacon for example, they weren't replenished. As I said the first two nights were fine but the third night was a disaster. From early evening until the wee hours of the morning, we heard loud voices and laughter, both in the room next door and in the hallway. It was as if a party had taken over much of the fourth floor. We even heard banging and clanging from the room next door - almost like a plumber was fixing the pipes at 2am! We called the front desk twice but the noise never subsided. When we checked out the next morning, we complained to the desk clerk who told us there was nothing he could have done and calling the police would have been a waste of time. Expedia mentioned, and I quote directly: \"The hotel does not allow partying in rooms\" - which is totally misleading. A party was going on but we didn't want to attend - we wanted to sleep!

I booked this as a last minute trip to Montreal, literally I booked it the night before through Expedia and got what I thought was a decent rate. For the price I paid, I expected certain things and for the most part got them. Unfortunately there were some issues with my stay. First the good: It's a good location on Rue Guy practically on the corner with Rene Levesque so you're right downtown. The Bell Centre is practically at the door and the Metro station is close by & you're within walking distance of Ste Catherine. Beds were clean, room was tidied every day, free WiFi or a rather antiquated PC is in the room so you can use that if you prefer. Didn't try the restaurant on site or the room service so I can't comment on those. Free coffee in the room. Now for the bad: Room was not ready on arrival and was told I needed to come back at 3pm. That's not really the hotel's fault but after a 6 hour drive it's nice to be able to relax in your room. The air conditioner was some huge montrosity that didn't work properly and leaked all over the carpet. One night I woke up at 3am and the air conditioning had stopped working and was pumping out hot air. It took 30 minutes to get it back on.The windows didn't open so it wasn't possible to get any fresh air in the room. Tiles in the shower were cracked, and there was no grate over the drain. If you dropped the soap, it would be gone. And when turned off, the shower head leaked for a while directly over the drain. If you took a shower before going to sleep, you were in for a noisy time until it abated. Also on the weekend, the bar downstairs turns into a very loud discotheque. If you're on the lower floors, be prepared to either sleep with earplugs or wait until it closes for the night before sleeping. And while the coffee was free, the pot was not cleaned when I first went to use it and neither was it cleaned all subsequent times. Thankfully the cups for said coffee were all paper and disposable. In conclusion, it's not a great hotel and the service is a little lacking.

Once in the room we took a look around, once the a/c finally come on it ratted and made a loud enough noise for us to want to turn it off, the bathroom had no towels and was filthy. I called the front desk for towels and she said it would be a little while as the linen \"had not arrived yet\". We thought for sure she was joking so we asked a housekeeper on our floor, her response was \"no towels until 6pm\" when we asked how we were supposed to shower with no towels her response was \"i duno i came here by bus\" .... Finally I went down to the front desk to try and get a room upgrade or a room change, anything really. I had to speak to a different lady who rolled her eyes at me and handed me off to the next young woman. Finally I was moved to a down graded room that at least had a flat screen and furniture that was more than likely bought 8 years ago instead of 20. The next day we came back to the room at 5 and our room had still not be cleaned. We had to leave the room and go swimming so she would clean our room.

It was spotlessly clean, nicely decorated (flat screen TV, computer that I never quite figured out how to use - but on the 2nd flr. there are computers and printers) and it's in a great spot (if you like the downtown area). After seeing Old Montreal, I was partial to that neck of the woods, but if staying in Downtown Montreal in the future...I would book the Days Hotel. They also have a mini-store, spas, a small gym, and a nice size outdoor pool on site. It's $15 a day to park in their underground parkade. $15 doesn't seem like much, if you've ever parked in NYC for the evening. (I have yet to check my credit card bill, but I hope that it will reflect the price on the receipt that I received.) If not, then I'll have a problem probably more so with the bank and their foreign exchange fees, than the hotel. Cash is king as they say. This hotel is a block away from St. Catherine St. and a very short walk to the subway. Once you learn the subway system, you can go anywhere. We visited, Old Montreal, Mont Royal (go to the Tam Tam Festival on Sunday afternoons - it's a free festival where drummers come from everywhere and just stage an impromtu concert), Jean Talon Market (where the locals shop), and Olympic Park. So, yes, I'm giving this hotel a thumbs up.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "funtush", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "funtush", "ReviewID": "UR35283238", "Content": "I booked this hotel over the hotwire.

We went to the desk and they said it would be fixed shortly, so we left to go explore Rue St. Catherine. We arrived back at the hotel about 2 hours later to find out that the toilet was not fixed and we had to switch rooms and move all of our unpacked items. In the next room we had been given, it smelled clean but there were burn holes through the covers on one of the beds, the radio/clock was broken, the coffee maker was broken, and the lights did not work properly. The carpet throughout the hotel was dirty and unclean.
