For that reason I chose it for a recent business trip and it was indeed perfectly located for my needs. The hotel has a wonderful New York charm about it which initially endeared me to the place, but after a few days the charm wore off. The room was small but by no means was that a concern for me, it had everything I needed so it worked out great. I had a great room with a view, positioned right on the corner of w22nd Street and 8th Avenue on the fourth floor. The only problem is that in the 'city that never sleeps' with that room it meant that you will never sleep too. Fire engines, police cars, crowds of people, street sweepers, all going throughout the night right passed your head. The bathroom was great, again, wonderful new york charm and had everything I needed. The only 'complaint' I have was that the room was always cold. It was like the walls and windows were there just for display rather than function. I'd imagine that would be great but I was there during some particularly chilly nights. The heater was adequate however, its just a shame the room was so cold. The hotel is perfectly positioned in Chelsea, and with no breakfast on offer you have the most amazing bagel bakery right across the block to indulge in. Overall nothing really wrong with the place and I would probably tell people about it, along with my views of the 'charm'.

I was incredibly surprised that my mom got the room for only $159/night, which is unbelievably reasonable for the location. The hotel is located on 22nd and 8th Streets, more or less in the middle of Chelsea. It's within walking distance to the train station, and two different subway lines are within 1-2 blocks. However, it's a little bit of a walk (5-10 mins) to any good restaurants or shops in Chelsea (which I personally find a lot less exciting than Tribeca/Soho/Greenwich). But if you don't mind the exercise or hopping on a subway, it won't phase you. The room was small, but we didn't care because we weren't in NY to sit around in the hotel. It was clean, modern, and tastefully decorated in a black/white theme. Our window looked out onto another building's windows, but again, we weren't there for the hotel view. A huge bonus is that it was quiet -- extremely quiet at night, and the bed was comfortable. The front desk service was also excellent. The only minus (and the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5) is that I found two stranger's hairs in the bathroom upon first getting to the room. Otherwise the bathroom was spotlessly clean, but I'm a stickler about hair (yuck).

The rooms are small but the furnishings are very simple, clean and smart that you don't even mind the size.

It is in an area where you don't have to go looking for anything since everything is right around the corner. My room was always very spotless and the view on top of the roof is soooo beautiful at night...I have never been to a hotel in NY that actually made me feel comfortable or had such warm customer service. The exceed all expectations and everyone that ask me about hotels in NY I only refer the GEM. I should also add that on one of my trips for work that as I was leaving the hotel and in a rush to get to work but was also checked out, I remembered as I was walking into the building at work that I forgot my ring on the night stand. I frantically called the hotel hoping someone would find my ring and actually give it back, the front desk clerk JEFFERY told me he would personally go up to my room and check and call me back in 15 mins. That was the longest 15 mins but he said he found it and would hold it there for me. I knew I would not be able to get it since my fight back home would be right after I got off of work and I could not miss the flight. I enlisted one of my friends to pick it up for me but he could not pick up that day. The very next day I was already back in CA and I got another call from JEFFERY from the hotel. He was concerned since he got back to work and my rings were still there. I told him that my friend would in later that evening to pick them up for me.

I walked to the West Village a lot, which was a very pleasant stroll. And right around the corner from the hotel was a subway stop to take me wherever I wanted to go. There is construction happening on the ground floor retail space, and it was noisy. When I first arrived I had a room on the second floor, and it was incredibly loud, the drilling and banging. But they allowed me to move to the fourth floor. I could still hear noise travelling up to my room occasionally, but it was not very bothersome. The room was not large but it was definitely not the smallest room I've had in Manhattan. I liked the modern design of the room. The shower was great. Pillows were comfortable. The HD flat-screen TV was nice. Two minor complaints: one was the fact that I had an \"interior\" room that faced a wall. A lot of the rooms at this hotel are like that. But, at least I had no complaints about street noise. My other complaint is the noise of the doors. The room/stairwell doors are metal and they make this clicking noise so any time someone comes or goes, or uses the stairwell, or housekeeping opens/closes rooms to clean, you hear them. It seemed like there was a lot of door noise at all times of the day, which drove me crazy a little bit when trying to sleep in or nap. The rooftop deck was very, very cool. Great view toward the Empire State Building. No one was ever up there so I felt I had it to myself. I liked it and found it relaxing. Staff was mostly nice. The hotel's location was perfect. The price was reasonable. I would stay again, especially if I could guarantee a room that didn't look at a wall, and if I were to find a good rate.

Cons: over priced, small, horrible bed, linen and pillows, no tub/shower only. Poor cost to value/quality. The only good thing about this place is it's location. It is surrounded by restaurants and subways are close by. The rooms at the Gem are not just small, they are tiny. The bed all but filled the room. In the corner was a free standing \"closet\" reminiscent of something one might use in a garage, and was not large enough to store my suitcase inside. There was not even enough space to accomodate my suitcase next to the bed, so I was forced to place my suitcase on the bed to open it. The \"closet\" did include the 2 things I rarely use, a safe and an iron. The bed itself was far from comfortable. The mattress sagged and the linens were horrible. Ever seen a sweater ball up? The sheets at the Gem Hotel were rough, with balls of fabric that scratched at exposed skin. It was much like what sleeping on velcro might feel like! The pillows were equally awful, fiber filled flat lumps. The bathroom would have been adequate if there were a few hooks to hang towels or a shelf to place a glass, contact solution, or toothpaste. There wasn't even a toilet tank to place so much as a cotton ball upon! No tub, a shower only, which is fine, this is not marketed as a luxury hotel, but the shower curtain was too short and water dripped outside onto the floor. One thing I did like was the shampoo and body wash dispensers on the shower wall, which avoids waste and plastic bottles being tossed in a landfill. The air conditioning worked, but the 2 foot square vent blasted air and sounded like a jet engine. Good luck sleeping with that turning off and on. So if you are looking for creature comforts go elsewhere. Men may do better in these rooms than women. If you are fine in small spaces and don't mind an over priced room in exchange for a location near subways and eateries then you are golden. For my money, the price was exorbitant if you look at cost to quality. This is listed as a 3 star hotel, don't believe it. It felt like a luxury hostel instead of a hotel. I can understand a slightly higher room rate due to three events during my stay: US Open, 9/11 Memorial, and Fashion Week.

The bathrooms were updated with quality materials, but very small with limited vanity space. The shower curtain didn't reach quite far enough down, but it wasn't a big issue. There was no bathroom fan. The beds were comfortable enough. Good pilows. The TV was flat screen. There was an iPod dock in the room and a small desk with stool. There was no closet, but there was a cabinet (think dorm room) with a table top ironing board and iron, extra toilet paper, etc). There was also a hair dryer hanging in a bag in the bathroom. A floor length mirror was a plus. The coffee maker was not easily visible, but it's there (bottom of night stand). Also, a much appreciated bottle of water was left in our rooms each day. The hallways were small, but noise could potentially be a problem is there were noisy neighbors. We had no issues (except hearing our own family members). The doors are very noisy when shut. However, there was no street noise, only an occasional distant rumbling of the subway that runs underneath. The thing to remember about space and noise in NYC is that you will most likely be exhausted and it won't matter as long as you can shower and sleep. The front desk staff were always friendly. We prepaid, so were surprised that $80 room charges were taken from our debit cards in case we damaged anything. However, these charges were removed before we returned home. Upon our early morning arrival, they stored our luggage in a locked room until check-in. The location for us was great! It's located on the corner of a tree-lined street of brownstones. Also a beautiful church is across the street. Hailing a cab on 8th was never a problem and the subway was one block away. One night we walked from Times Square. The only place we ate nearby was a little store around the corner (b/w 22nd & 23rd) where we just happened to hear a local order, \"A BLT and quick!\" or we wouldn't have known hot food was available - A great breakfast and late night snack.

Since we were travelling with friends we let them do the booking and so all we learned about the hotel came from its website that seemed pretty impressive. Oh, how wrong we were. First, the good thing - location is excellent. Right in the heart of Chelsea, with convenient Subway access. The hotel presents itself as a boutique hotel. In my book this means premium price for premium comfort, service and design. Not so much so in this case. Although the hotel is very nicely designed, someone forgot convenience and comfort in the process. The design does not compensate for the fact that the rooms are extremely tiny even by NYC standards. Tiny as in a 6X6 ft room, with a queen bed smack in the middle. Imagine trying to get around the room at the same time with your husband or getting dressed after a shower. Not doable. Since space is so limited, the closet that is in the room is also tiny and could not accommodate more than our jackets. Needless to say, our clothes remained in our suitcase for the duration of the stay - less than ideal, and the suitcase took much of what was left of the room... Bathroom space was also limited, as there was no real shelf for putting our stuff (toothbrushes included) anywhere but on top of the sink. Other problematic issues - cleanness. Bathroom was not clean, and we've had to ask for it to be cleaned again. Even so, we've long noticed hairs in the shower stall (since both me and my husband have short cropped hair, this couldn't be ours...). Yuck. For the most part of our stay the elevator was malfunctioning, with one day in which it didn't work at all. Though we had to schlep through the stairs to the fifth floor, no compensation or even apology was offered. While we are very undemanding (want a clean room and comfy bed. All the rest are negotiable) and will willingly accept that kind of performance from a cheap or lower-rated hotel (as we did, in the past), the huge difference between the way the GEM hotel presents itself and performs is a reason not to return there.

Con's: Room is too small, the window almost does not exist (you can't tell if there its sunshine or rain outside) and the sheets and towels are very, very old. In addition to the small size of the rooms, the design is also very un-practical. You can tell that they haven't paid attention to small details in the rooms, i.e. there are no hooks to hang anything in the batroom, or the closet is small and half of the closet is taken up by a safe, so you can't hang jackets or coats. These things become very important in small spaces, and a hotel in NYC should definitely think about these.

There was no welcome pack etc in the room so we had to ask what time we needed to check out and didn't know about some of the hotel facilities. There was only one robe provided even though there were 2 of us. This was mentioned when we checked in but no reason was given as to why, it didn't really matter as we didn't even use it but it was a bit odd.

They sent my husband and me to another hotel for the night. They checked my sister into a larger room than what she had reserved but told her they were only charging her for the room she reserved and this rate was valid for 4 nights. We finally got back to the hotel the next day and they gave us a key. We went up to the fourth floor and our room was an inside room. The window looked at a brick wall. It was claustrophobic and, frankly, unsafe if there had been a fire. We called the front desk. They sent someone upstairs with another key for a similar room across the hall that looked out on 8th avenue. After about 14 hours in New York, we finally got into the room we had requested originally. The rooms are tiny. The closets are only about two feet wide and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even accommodate the length of a short dress or a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shirt.

My 1 small window looked out at a wall with little natural light, but as I was hardly in the room this did not bother me. My suitcase barely fit in the room. I had it wedged between the bed and a wall, so could only get out of the bed on the other side. The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was compact, but spotlessly clean. There is a good size LCD TV on the wall - with a good selection of channels - above a tiny desk. The coffee/tea maker was good, but as there is no fridge/mini bar in the room I could only used powdered milk. Location is good, as it is central as I like walking around New York. Loved the FREE WiFi. Overall I was happy with the hotel and might stay there again if I can get as good a rate (I checked all the re-seller websites and found the cheapest price on lastminute.com).", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location for public tranportation users\u201d", "Author": "MissTizzi", "ReviewID": "UR59076391", "Content": "As I move mostly by public transportation in N-Y, this hotel is super conveniently located as it is one block down (3 min. walk) from the 23rd blue line subway station (which is the one that goes either to JFK or to Penn Station >Newark).

A highlight of problems we experienced with the hotel include, but are not limited to the following - - When my friend and I arrived the desk clerk tried to tack on extra charges to our nightly rate. - We protested and were told that we couldn't stay elsewhere due to the 48 hr cancellation policy (entrapment). - We were told the only way to avoid this fee was if we stayed in a smaller room with a full bed (I later found out this was a lie by calling the main Choice/Clarion hotels customer service and was told that we were already paying the queen bed/double occupancy rate). - The supposedly \"full size bed\" is one of the tiniest beds I have ever seen and is completely unsuitable for more than one person or anyone over 6 ft tall. - The hotel manager was not there so we were left without someone to resolve our problems/ we just had to have the main customer service dept file a written complaint (they have not contacted us yet and it has been over 48 hrs). - Another clerk ended up giving us a queen bed on a floor that nobody else was staying on due to water damage and large fans outside of the door, telling us that we would be charged 1/2 the normal nightly rate for that room.

Since I doubt anyone 'wants' a loud room, the hotel should improve sound insulation on the street side.

When we got to Newark, we were told the charge was $80 plus tip. Probably not the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, but they should deal with more reputable services. RECOMMENDATION: a good hotel for an independent solo traveler who is willing to ask for and then double-check everything.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine", "Title": "\u201cMixed Review: Terrible Climate Control, Great Bed\u201d", "Author": "eruadh", "ReviewID": "UR26548947", "Content": "The climate control was just awful. My room was absolutely freezing; it seemed as if the windows weren't properly sealed. However, using the electric baseboard heater made the room overheated and dry. There was no way to make the temperature comfortable. On the other hand, the bed was amazingly comfortable; pillows were great and the bathrobes were plush. The shower and toiletries were delightful. The room was small, but how much time do you spend there? Location is very convenient (away from the Midtown tourist areas) but best for people familiar with the subway system or willing to use the map.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Weekend In New York\u201d", "Author": "megcrnll", "ReviewID": "UR26075669", "Content": "I just recently spent a long weekend with some friends in NYC. I was playing around on line one night and found great deals at this website www.newyorkguest.com I was able to get the hotel for about half of what I was seeing on other sites, and great tickets to Wicked!! The hotel was really cute - has a really boutique-y/NYC feel to it. The front desk staff was really great - and the room even had an ihome in it! While we were there we got dinner at this amazing steakhouse on the east side, called Benjamin's.
