It simply isn't within my budget to afford staying here. So some of my views are based on this. However I was here for a work conference and since they were footing the room bill I got to enjoy the resort. Check in and Check out was smooth and painless. Service at the hotel was very good. I was impressed with my room. It was quiet, spacious, clean, had a great walkout area off the patio doors (I was on the ground floor), and the bathroom was huge. The bed was comfy, and I slept well. Also the temperature control worked very well, which was a big deal in +35 C heat. I stayed here for 3 nights and I don't think I got to explore all of the property, but what I did see was beautiful, and the pools/lazy river were a treat. What I didn't like was the cost of drinks by the lazy river. Outrageous that you'd have to pay more for a drink by the pool than you would in the bar within the resort that was short 2 minute walk away. Yes I know it is a money making thing, but I don't agree with that. When you pay a premium to stay at a place like this you don't need to gouge for more. The resort is walking distance to some decent shopping, which I enjoyed, and although I didn't get a chance to use the fitness center I did take a look at it and thought it looked great. Would I stay here again? No, unless I got some fantastic discounted rate.

With several friends staying at the resort we were invited to to enjoy the pool at the resort, knowing the hotel's policy is 5 wrist bands per room. Our friends gave us wrist bands and myself and my 3 sons (ages 11,.8,7) were having the time of our lives on the Saturday before Easter Sunday with 5 other families, 2 of which were hotel guests. I ordered a hot dog for my son and we both took bites out of it - it was beyond hot - scolding- we both burnt our tongues, my son was crying and the hotdog was gross so I complained and told the attendant at the snack shack to be careful with other guests eating the dog is was too hot. He called his manager and he refunded my money. We went back to our seats and all of sudden the manager, who refunded my money, and a security guard came over to where we were sitting, approaching me so agressively, it was shocking. He said, you were asked to leave once and you are treaspassing you need to leave the property immediately. I respnded by saying I was not asked to leave, which I was not the security guard said this is not up for discussion, so I said I need to find my 3 sons and got up. Ofcourse I couldn't find them they were swimming and having a ball, I walked around the property looking for them, my heart ponding. While I did that my friends tried to talk to the security guard to find out my they were kicking me out and he said he didn't know what happened but was just doing his job, they said you have the wrong person, she has done nothing but laying here getting sun and swimming, other guests sitting beside us tried to get involved and they said the PD would be called if I didn't leave the property. I finally found my kids and packed up and me and my 3 girlfriends and our 7 boys were escorted off the property all the way to the valet. How embarrassing, can you imagine. I am a single mom, a professional woman, a clasy and sophisticated person, I was enjoying my Easter weekend in Scottsdale, from California. I was sober and respectable and did not derserve to be treated this way. There was absolutely no reason to have escorted me out of this resort and in the insulting manner I was treated. This was honestly the most devasting experience of my life and ruined my children's vacation. They were embarrassed and confused. I am also a frequent Marriott client and can not believe they treat people like this. There was no discusson or empathy, they didn't pull me aside and explain anything or try to work with me. They treated me like a common criminal that had committed the worst of crimes. Beware if you are at this property you may get kicked out and be humiliated for no reason what so ever. I ahve travelled all over the world stayed in the most exclusive resorts and never in my life have I been asked to leave or treated in this way. I will never ever stay at a Marriott again.

Even the Priceline-level room I got was pretty phenomenal, with a big balcony, comfortable loveseat, and fantastic work chair -- I wanted to go home and buy that same chair. Fantastic bed, too. The highlight of this resort was pretty clearly the pool, which seemed to stretch on forever. The lazy river actually had enough square footage to be lazy. Inner tubes were free and plentiful, and there was a bar and taco stand within feet of the pool entrance. All the poolside areas were immaculate and functional, even down to the restaurants situated just outside of the pool/lake area. Service here was inconsistent. Check-in was a breeze, a late checkout wasn't a problem, and it was never an issue getting somebody on the phone from the front desk, even at busy times. With such a sprawling resort, though, I'd run into situations where one hand wasn't really talking to the other. The girl at the front desk, as an example, told me that the steakhouse on site was open till 10 PM. I decided to go there for dinner after dropping off my bags. When I asked for directions to get there at 9:30 (the hotel is big enough to require such directions), I was given functional directions only to arrive and find that the steakhouse had closed at nine. It seems like somebody could have filled me in there. I ended up heading back to the water's edge to grab dinner at the bar area, and while the service was great when someone actually showed up, it took a full 25 minutes from when I sat down to the moment where someone even came by for a drink order. The area was a little crowded, but not 25-minutes-bad. Oh, and the resort fee. $25 per day is a little nuts, even if it gets you access to the gym and free (very functional) internet. This should really be $15/night and it should cut out some of the useless accoutrements (e.g. free appetizer at the steakhouse with an entree purchase) that are padding the fee. It didn't bother me since I had a greatly reduced rate, but for $400-$500 a night, that extra $25 is no fun. That resort fee also includes a discount on valet parking, lowering it from $25/night to $15. If you don't choose to use the valet, parking here isn't all that great; it's a pretty lengthy walk from any of the free self-parking lots to the entrance, especially with bags.

Overall the hotel is beautiful: the buildings are beautifully done and the public spaces look excellent; the landscaping is superb; everything is as one would hope for an upscale resort hotel. But, as I mention below, the hotel lets itself down in ways that are quite unnecessary and could be easily cured if management wants to do so. The bedroom was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and reasonably well laid out. It is not ideal that the toilet is right by the shower (2' distance). I was staying by myself so it wasn't a problem for me, but if two people were sharing the bathroom it would not be optimal. What is a problem in my opinion is that the housekeeping (or maybe maintenance) is obviously more superficial than it should be.

In a hotel with 900+ rooms there should be a proper maintenance schedule to take care of vent cleaning on a regular basis - apparently the Marriott Desert Ridge lacks such a maintenance problem. And that raises another question: if their approach to maintenance is poor, what else in the room/bathroom/hotel is not kept properly clean? Whether the location of the resort works for someone depends totally on what they are there to do and whether they want to be going into metro Phoenix. The resort is a major freeway drive away from most of central Phoenix - plan on 20-30 minutes to get places, more if you hit traffic jams. If you just plan to stay at the resort the whole time that won't matter to you. Nickel & diming: the resort imposes a daily resort fee of $25+tax ($28.32/day), which I did not know about before I arrived. What do you get in return for the resort fee? Nothing. Not WiFi, not valet parking, not even a newspaper - nothing, nada, zip. So what is the resort fee really? It is a hidden, second-stage room cost that is not shown as the room cost - so the hotel rate seems to be one price when actually it is the displayed price + another $25. At least some resorts include free WiFi, phone calls, newspapers, and valet parking in return for the daily fee. Other gripes: (1) the towels in the room are poor quality, tired, worn out. If my room/bathroom was a guide, then the resort needs to get new towels that are resort quality. If this was a 4 star property I would not make this point (though I have stayed in 4 star places with better towels) - but this is a 5 star JW Marriott resort and should be judged by that standard. (2) Lunchtime dining options could be improved: I was told of just two options - The Meritage and Blue Sage. I expect there is poolside dining but I was not by the pool so I don't know. I opted for Meritage, which is the hotel's steakhouse and should have been their best restaurant. The service was VERY slow and the food was indifferent. A pleasant but unexceptional crabcake, calamari that must have been cooked from a frozen packet (and would have been unacceptable at Applebee's), entrees that were unexciting. Overpriced wine by the glass. (3) Intrusive sales pitch by Marriott Vacation Club. Phone message, papers under the door, urging the guest to stop by the desk and let them make their sales pitch. I have a couple of Marriott Vacation Club memberships so I am friendly to the general concept, but I don't want it pushed at me in a hotel when I am not indicating that I want to know about the product. Every one of the negatives I have mentioned could be solved easily and quickly by a hotel management that cares. Remove the negatives and I would rate the resort as very good. Final note: when I objected to the resort charge because I had not been told about it in advance the lady at the front desk removed the charges, and when I showed her the photo of the air-conditioning vent she seemed genuinely upset and concerned and said she would report it. So, the front desk attitude on check out was appropriate. But it should not have been necessary in the first place.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita", "Title": "\u201cLovely Resort\u201d", "Author": "shelb333", "ReviewID": "UR126885198", "Content": "The JW Marriott Desert Ridge was a lovely resort, but not nearly as nice as the JW Orlando or JW San Antonio.

The bars and restaurants have great happy hours and we enjoyed some early drinks most nights in the warm fall evenings. We had dinner at Blue Sage twice and it was delicious both times. The prices are reasonable and quiality high. The sushi at Roy's was a big disappointment - but drinks were delicious. My husband also ate at the Vista Lounge for a burger and it was great.

We are loyal in that regard and unless we are traveling to a destination location that has a special resort (such as in Australia , we usually chose a Marriott hotel/resort because they are reliable and we know what to expect, and generally speaking the communication is fantastic. Our first stay at the Marriott Desert Ridge was a few years ago. We booked a suite and on our arrival were so surprised when we arrived to our room and found we were placed in what was named the \u201cBoard Room\u201d. It was actually an approximately 800-1000 square foot large open studio suite which contained a living area with small patio and then a \u201cdining area/board room\u201d area which had a beautiful dining room table which would comfortably seat oh, I\u2019d say 10 people. There was also a hutch which had a selection of hard -back books in it. Mostly for show, but during our 4 night stay we did read a couple of them. The suite, used probably more for business gatherings could also be used for small impromptu cocktail receptions because it also had a small butlers pantry in another area which was accessed by a second entry door. This area included a small kitchenette with microwave, fridge, 2nd honor bar and wet bar. In our case it worked out perfectly for our long weekend. Oh- the bedroom was a pull down Murphy bed. Located in the living area. Worked for us. Good bed, nice selection of pillows and the robes were really nice as well. On this experience alone I would rate the resort 5 stars. We enjoyed the 24 hour room service, the fitness center and the on demand movies. The problems we have with the Marriott Desert Ridge is that we really like this room and on the following visits we have attempted to book and make use of this room to no avail. The first attempt we tried to book online and the room wasn\u2019t listed. So we called the hotel directly. After being shuffled from person to manger, we were informed that the room was not available anymore as a \u201csingle booking\u201d and if we wanted to book it we would have to book it tandem with an added room (with an adjoining door leading to a basic hotel room, which would end up costing us approximately 1/3 more per night)- or we could book a one bedroom suite and take our chances upon arrival that it would be available. We did the latter and it wasn\u2019t available on check in. We tried once more, and again no luck. The Marriott Desert Ridge is a nice hotel.

We typically \"resort\" to accomodations in Scottsdale as close to Camelback as you can get. We've never been up north and decided to give it a try. Our first impression was that we were in a very busy convention center hotel with a focus on meetings and swimming and not so much on relaxing. When we got to our room in a wing right off the reception area, we realized they must have thought we were priceliner's. It was the standard room, nothing \"signature\" about it, unless you like to look at swimming pools, lazy rivers and listen to gates closing and conventioners lumbering through. (great if you have kids though) We were fortunate to speak to Nathan at the front desk and he promptly moved us to the signature spot we hoped they hade. With his help what appeared to be a Fairfield Inn like stay, turned out to be the resort experience we've come to enjoy when in the Phoenix area. Fountains, mountain sunrises, golf course views and no sense of the busyness of business life that this place has to cater to remain open. The grounds were nice as you would expect, the herb garden was a really unique spot to walk through. Can't comment on swimming / lazy river, since it was 58 degrees during our stay, however we found a really nice quiet spot on the patio of Italian resturaunt that we had all to ourselves and basked in the early / mid morning sun. Golfing was great fun, with new friends from Toronto, even though we played the last hole in total darkness! We did not use the spa. Accomodations were good, rooms at least in our section were quiet. We literally felt like we were the only ones in the section. We ate at two outlets, Blue Sage for breakfast (blue corn pancakes, yumm) and dinner at Meritage. A little expensive as you would expect, but service was good and the food was fine. We would stay again, as long as we have Nathan behind the desk. You need a car, it's a long way from Sky Harbor and the shopping area across the road has some good options for eating out. but too far to walk though. The Musical Instrument Museum is close by and a good rainy (or crazy hot day) option. And downtown Tempe / Scottsdale are too far away. Also there are a lot of churches on or around Cactus and Tatum, we recommend Harvest Bible Chapel. Yes there is a resort fee, 25.00 includes parking, discount on shopping, Internet and telephone.

There is another bar across the way, also with outside seating and live music. Both areas also offer outside propane fire pits which add nicely to the ambiance. The fine dining option is of the Italian variety. The food is very tasty and inventive. The outdoor seating by the lagoon is quite nice and borderline romantic.

The rooms were very, very clean and well stocked with towels and supplies. Room service was very fast and one morning, they even gave us a complimentary pastry with our coffee. Every day when I ordered my coffee, it came with a bud vase with flowers - wonderful touch. Had a mani/pedi at the spa, which was very nice. The spa is a great place to get a healthy beverage as well. I had a carrot/ginger/juice which was great one day and the next had some kind of herbal, minty iced tea, which was great. The spa restaurant is a gem - if you like healthy food, don'e miss it. The Blue Sage had a good breakfast and lunch. Had the grilled salmon on a salad one day, which was perfectly prepared. Everywhere I went, the staff was friendly and greeted me with a smile. One day I was walking in with some team supplies, and two different staff members offered to help me.

If you are a runner, there is a nice 4.2 mile course on the sidewalk around the hotel. If you can get up early, go before dawn so you can see the incredible stars in the sky and then see the early sunrise - you won't regret it! The pool has a lazy river that everyone can float on - and, tons of different areas for the pool chairs, so you don't realize you are at such a large resort. Great job on the space planning!

Conferences seem to be what the specialize in as well as weddings....large groups and volume! We paid extra for a \"Signature Room\" view. Our view was the top of a palm tree and the other wing of the hotel. Save your money and skip the special view room as the balconies are ridiculous anyway. You can see your neighbors all the way down the row, no privacy, and the only thing between you and them is a piece of lattice and a empty flower pot. The room very small with a worn out mini-sofa and a chair. The bathroom consisted of one room with a 2/3 size tub, one sink, shower door that opened out into the toilet and 2 towels. Maids will not provide you with more than 2 towels and you will need them as the shower door leaks all over the floor. It was one of the worse hotel bathrooms I've seen in years. Property is clean and main lounge area is nice with outdoor seating, heaters etc. We ate breakfast in their buffet (Blue Sage?) each morning. The funny part is we had a \"golf package\" which included a daily buffet. The first morning the waitress was fantastic and made it very clear in writing on the check that the gratuity was included in our package. On the second day, Connie stamped our ticket that gratuity was NOT included, even though we told her we were on the golf package. I went to the room to check to make sure the documents stated it was and let my husband know.

We really wanted a nice relaxing stay at a resort without paying $400/night or something crazy. This Marriott property fit the bill. The resort is huge and the walk from the self-parking lot to our room was lengthy,,,,although we don't mind walking so no big deal. The weather was chilly for Arizona,,,low 70's for the highs...so very few people were in the pool area. We took advantage of the Lazy river (really nice) and one of the large pools plus the outdoor hot tub. The grounds and landscaping are beautiful. On check-in the front desk guy told us he moved our room to a more scenic view overlooking the desert botanical gardens (instead of facing a wall). We appreciated that....although truthfully there seemed like a ton of vacant rooms in our wing so it probably wasn't very difficult to do...but this was a nice touch. Made us feel like we were important! The Blue sage was excellent for lunch. We did not splurge for a the $25 breakfast buffet but rather bought some breakfast food from the Target nearby and stored cream cheese and orange juice in the mini bar fridge. We did eat at Tuscany one night and it was just so so. My wife's ravioli dinner came out cool so we asked to have it heated up. It came back barely luke warm. I'd stick with the pizza from this place. I saw it on someone else's plate and it looked better than anything we ordered. There was a big sales conference going on here....beware that this is a huge convention/conference hotel and lot's of conventioneers are loading up on the company expense credit card. EVeryone looked classy and well behaved though....except the people next to our room liked to come back late night, probably after several drinks and they made some noise. The walls between the rooms seemed very thin.

By that point, I was finished with the conf and wanted to relax, so my room wasn't cleaned that day. My biggest issue was the cost of the hotel - well over $300 a night. Didn't feel it justified that price. Initially, I was on the Marriott wait list. I had booked another hotel just in case through Priceline. A 4star+ resort 11 miles away - The Boulders. The room rate was $50 cheaper than the Marriott. Ultimately, I chose to cancel that and go w/Marriott to be onsite for the conf., but wished I had stayed with The Boulders.

When I travel, I like to know that the property would at least meet certain expectations, important when traveling for business and considering the value for what you are paying. This property exceeds any expectation that I had and has become my new Phoenix/SCottsdale go-to for ANY stays, business or pleasure. This particular trip was a quick get away for my wife and me. We needed to spend just a little down time in a relaxing atmosphere. While this is a resort - Golf, Spa, HUGE pool complex - there was still plenty of opportunities to relax and not be bothered by other people living their lives. It also is one of the few properties where they have a concierge lounge which they call the Cloud Club. It is an up charge, but well worth it - virtually 24 hours access, plenty of snacks that go WAY beyond crackers and cheese, a \"dinner\" snack that could easily pass for a meal and breakfast including omelets cooked to order. The Club staff is beyond accommodating and the particular chef that we had there, Lem, was entertaining and would create anything that we wanted and that he had available - on or off menu. They really tried to make you feel welcome and comfortable. What was truly nice was that there were no children allowed under 21 in the Club. I know, that sounds terrible, but the last property we stayed at with such a property (NOT a Marriott) allowed children and it was a nightmare - the parents had no control and were rude about it. The staff did absolutely nothing to prevent or even deal with the situation. But let me move forward. . . . The restaurants are all fabulous, and include a Roy's. I know, it is a chain, but Roy Yamaguci still has a hand in things and the food here is as if you went to one of the anchor locations. The lounge area can accommodate many, many people, and there is entertainment I believe every night. I mentioned the pool complex - it is huge. It has a restaurant/bar with a complete menu and just not a bunch of fried food. The pools themselves are sprawling all over the property and include a \"lazy river\" for those wanted to just drift. The spa/exercise facility is large and friendly (and comes with the Cloud Club package). The equipment is well maintained and they have free weights as well. The only draw back is it is a short walk outside and at an end of the sprawling property but hey - you're going to work out so a little walk is good for you , no? I would suspect that this property sees a fair amount of convention and business travel due to the size of the ballrooms and number of restaurants, lounge areas and places to \"hide\", so I would caution people to check to see if a convention is booked and what % of the bookings are used for that purpose. On the other hand, if I was looking to book a convention or gathering, this would absolutely be a top choice if not the top choice in the Scottsdale / Phoenix area. I would also \"caution\" that while I was never approached, this is somewhat attached to a Marriott Vacation Club.

The water pressure wasn't spectacular and the hot/cold shower knobs were very touchy.

We enjoyed using the two comfy cozy bathrobes available to use during our stay. If you plan on using the fridge within the rooms, don't bother! There's absolutely no room! We brought our own ice chest with food for breakfast and lunch then had dinner at the resort. We enjoyed the $50 daily resort credit and used it towards dinners at Blue Sage and Tuscany Restaurants. The kids ate for free both nights, which was included in the package deal. So, for our dinner, we pretty much just paid for the tip. As far as dinner, Blue Sage wasn't very good. Service was extremely slow and not very attentive. Once our food came, we had to send a hamburger back that was cooked only to med. rare and not med well that we had ordered, then it took another 15 minutes to wait for it. With kids, you can only wait for food for so long and coloring gets old. Menu wasn't that great. The next night, dinner at Tuscany's was much better. We didn't have reservations, but didn't have to wait too long. Food was much better and service was more dependable. The pool area was really nice. I am big on cleanliness, and it was exactly what we got. No \"dirty ring\" around the waterslide, like we saw at the Phoenix Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort. All the pools were clean as well. Pool staff were working non-stop, keeping the pool area tidy. They also were friendly and courteous. It was such a hot weekend and there were many water stations placed throughout the pool area that had suffiicient ice water pitchers and cups available to use. We never had any trouble finding shady spots to plop our towels and belongings (we only needed 1 chair, as we were always in the water). The kids loved the Lazy river and basketball pool. Near the basketball pool there was a live band...believe it was reggae (?)...sounded very tropical island, which was nice because it really made you feel like you were on vacation. For lunch our last day, we had those tacos at the taco bar that other contributors were talking about. Mmm Mmmm!!! Only $3 per taco and you can chose from chicken or beef, plus they had fresh taco fix'ins. The taco bar also sold hotdogs as well. The grounds are just beautiful. There are some close walking trails, which we didn't take advantage of this time, as it was too hot. But, I am sure there were some nice sights to see on the trails.

When I asked about the water they did admit it was softemed even in the kitchens and the engineer said it was 100mg/l. This is at least 10 x the level in UK drinking water. This meant that I could not drink any water or anything made from water (tea/ coffee) in the main hotel. I had to buy suitable water from the local supermarket and load the coffee maker in my bedroom! This sodium level probably is tolerated by most normal people but it is a risk to the very young and also to adults with sodium intolerance like me as my ankles, hands and face swell. It also is a significant risk to people with hypertension and cardiac failure and also those with renal impairment and so beware!", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Desert, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat For Conventions\u201d", "Author": "LoriJM", "ReviewID": "UR115922511", "Content": "the rooms are spacious and the air worked wonderfully in the rooms.

The grounds are big and lovely, complete with a desert plant garden and reflecting ponds. But the best part is the many pools. The family favorite is the lazy river pool with a small waterside. There is also a long, curvy, narrow dipping pool/lounge deck, and a sports pool, as week as a massive fun pool with a giant waterfall deck and sitting ledges. Ice and water pitchers are available poolside for free, but you do have to get them yourself. There is a poolside grill as well as roaming waitstaff for drinks and lunch, but service can be slow. The biggest downsides to the pool area are the hike to get to the bathrooms and the lack of lifeguards. When we visited in 2009, lifeguards were stationed at the lazy river and the big pool, but no more. One attendant was stationed at the top of the waterside, but the meek young girlsndid not have any sense of authority for safety, and we found some raucous teens endangering us more than once. A return to safety attendants would be a good move for this resort. However, I pulled out my \"don't mess with this Mama face\" and that worked. There is a lovely desert botanical garden on site, which provided habitat to lizards, birds, and bunnies. A great little hike to start our morning. There is also a lovely grass lawn near the pools and restaurant terraces, so you can relax at happy hour while the kiddos play and run and look at the ducks on the pond, all within perfect sight. The rooms are clean and nice, the beds comfortable. Our room had a separate shower and tub, and a balcony with a view looking at a pond and the mountains, quite lovely.

The hotel was LOVELY, we booked a suite with a resort view and we were more than pleased with the room. The only issue I had is that I kept finding teeny spiders in the room (maybe because of the region?), even in our bed! That gave me the heeby-jeebies really good because I do NOT enjoy insects of any kind. Plus, I had my kid with me and I didn't know if they bit. I certainly didn't want to take them home in my luggage. A really nice lady at the front desk told me over the phone that the exterminator would be in our room probably within the hour, and I said this was fine, that we'd be at the pool. When we returned to our room a couple of hours later, I figured the exterminator had been there. My husband and daughter were napping when I got a phone call saying the exterminator was on his way up. That just would not do because where was I supposed to stash my sleeping 3 year old for the next couple of hours? Everyone knows you do NOT wake a sleeping child. : ) So the exterminator did not end up coming after all. Other than that, the hotel was fantastic wtih a great staff, very generous food portions (we ordered room service for breakfast each day, and once for lunch), and lots of activities. We were delighted to return to the hotel after graduation and find a live band playing in the lobby! Looked like alot of fun, though we were too tired to join in. Word of caution, WEAR SWIM SHOES AT THE POOL. The ground is blistering hot out there, and it would have been WAY too hot for my daughter to walk on, so I am glad I took a few steps first and found this out for myself. I would suggest that the hotel posts something about that or mentions it when guests check in that they will want to protect their feet. I am from Houston, Texas and it's plenty hot, but I've NEVER experienced that before. So just beware. This review would have a much different tone if my kid had blistered her feet on the asphalt. Across from the resort is an awesome shopping district that includes a theatre for beating the heat and of course the all important Target store! Also, the Museum of Musical Instruments is down the street and VERY interesting. I reccomend this hotel, except for the spiders.

YES! WE LEFT AT 3AM BECAUSE IT WAS SO BAD! I really don't have a long complicated drawn out story to tell. The bottom line is; this place is a place overrun by filthy riff raff drunks. For a lack of a better word...the clientele here is very low class. I pulled up to the hotel at NOON and there was already a bunch shirtless people standing around the front lobby with 6 packs of coors light. Nice..awesome. The pools had maybe 4000 chairs and 10 umbrellas. The entire resort is supposed to be smoke free but people are smoking at the pools, in the rooms...I was walking into a cloud of smoke almost every turn..and this is a GIANT place. If you want free second hand smoke...this is your place. Complained to hotel...and was actually told that people are allowed to smoke on their balconies. WOW! I called back to double check and the manager assured me that she was mistaken and the resort is \"supposed\" to be smoke free. RIGHT........ We got a suite for us and our baby because we wanted a nicer room and experience. Well it's such a joke. Because...all of a sudden at 9pm...a HUGE group of people BURST into their STANDARD SIZED rooms (i say that in caps b/c standard rooms here are dirt cheap and so 8 people are splitting the room so it's only $25 a person...yup you get the picture of who stays here) throwing beer bottles around, rowdy as can be, playing beer pong...doing body shots...you name it...they were doing it. I think at one point, one of them threw each other on to the wall during a \"friendly\" fight because I thought something for sure was going to explode through my walls. I almost threw up when one of them went out for a smoke break on the balcony and said \"oh dang i can't wait to eat more sausages tomorrow.\" WTF??!!? Called front desk...hotel sent security to calm them down... Fast track... 2AM...awoken by the sound of beer bottles breaking on the OTHER side of our room. Another group of drunks swearing, obscenity, F bombs every other word, girls challenging to fight the guys...guys threatening to throw each other over the balcony! My baby was startled to death and and cryng hysterically because they were screaming next door throwing chairs around going in and out of the room and balcony nonstop. IT WAS LIKE A SCENE AT A BRAWL AT A $39/NIGHT MOTEL IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHEREVILL. It was so disturbing and we had to pack up at 2 in the morning...baby crib, all our luggage, wet bathing suits (have you tried to pack up at 2am after you're awoken by drinks? it's not fun) etc so we can escape from this HELLISH place filled with NASTY PEOPLE! We went to check out at the front desk (by this time it was 3am)...I was furious already thinking we were the only who would be awake at this god awful hour. Nope. There were people walking around the hotel lobby shirtless, INSANELY INTOXICATED, PRACTICALLY WALKING INTO THE WALLS AND YET stillllllllll chugging their coor lights. I was shocked...and yet the front desk staff didn't even bat an eyelash..because THIS IS THE NORM OF THE CROWDS HERE. The pools are open 24/7...which you might think is great..but it's probably the biggest red flag because 24/7 pools means loud obnoxious drunks at all hours. STAY AWAY. DISGUSTING!!!

Hotel guests can use this for a fee, although it apparently is discounted or free if you are there with a group/conference.

Why can Courtyard by Marriott provide free internet, but the much-more-expensive JW Marriott charge for it? Annoying. Anyway, when I received my bill I was prepared for the internet charges, but there were other surprise charges. Self-parking is $10/day. Plus 3 taxes. They didn\u2019t tell me at check-in about this, and there are no signs in the parking lot indicating that there is a charge. Surprise! And then I also paid $53+ to receive two packages. I had called a month before and been told by the front desk that there was no charge to receive packages. Yet, for the packages which had arrived slightly before my arrival, I paid $53 for them to hold them and then deliver them to me. Despite being told the wrong information by the hotel, they refused to credit back this charge.

While the hotel seems grand and the grounds expansive, the attention to details that make a big resort seem to care for the individual are mostly missing- especially after sundown. There are areas you can see from the hotel- but they're not lit, or there's no access, or the firepits aren't lit at night. It's a big place, and I get the feeling that crowd management is a priority. For instance, poolside dining/cocktails end at around 5. The pools AND jacuzzi shut down at 8pm. and most of the beautiful grounds are literally locked off after that time. The end result is that folks are herded into the dining rooms, main veranda and lobby. While these latter two sites are spacious you definitely are going to be sharing the evening with scores of your closest friends! The Revive Spa had beautiful facilities- not the nicest but very good. Sadly, it was literally run like an assembly line.

It was spring break and we were a bit nervous about crowds. We were ecstatic that our stay was an absolutely FANTASTIC experience. The resort is first class in every way! The grounds are immaculate and beautiful. The restaurants are fabulous and we never had a problem getting seated. Breakfast at the Blue Sage was a treat - don't miss it! The pools were crowded but we never felt that other people were on top of us. The tennis center is absolutely fantastic and the folks that work there are truly service oriented! The staff was bright and cheery and very welcoming. The golf courses are beautiful and very playable for golfers at all levels - even our kids went out for a few holes! The rooms were well maintained and up to date - flat screen TV's and more. The Spa was first class - go for the hot rock message!! Keeping it real, the front desk did struggle to juggle the crowds. We requested a connecting room as we have teenagers and a 10 year old. We were arriving on a late flight from New York and we wanted to make sure everything was set upon check-in. A few days before I called to see if the request had been granted. I was told it was and that our rooms had been assigned. We arrived around midnight and they had given our connectors away. I was not happy as we had to separate the family on night one. Early the next morning I received a call from the front desk that they had found connecting rooms for us. What a relief! Unfortunately they moved us from a room with a view of the pools (which we paid an upgrade for) to rooms overlooking the parking lot. Again I was not happy. When I asked how this happened they told me \"take it our leave it. that's all we have\". Exactly in those words. I was so unhappy I called the other big resorts and was all set to check out the first day after I checked in! I decided to talk to the manager to see if anything else could be done. Thankfully, after some more juggling, we were put in a WONDERFUL room overlooking one of the isla's and golf course. The concierge was very, very knowledgable and helpful. We went off property for a few dinners and the recommendations were superb! The value for money without compromising quality was truly superb!

From the moment we checked in until the moment we left, our experience was just perfect at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is a little hike from the airport compared to some of the other hotels that seemed comparable on the internet, but then again we never heard the roaring engines of planes flying overhead, nor traffic noise, so that was awesome. The resort has several really great on-site restaurant options to choose from, and a Starbuck's in the lobby. Also, a very nice outdoor mall is within walking distance, and the paved paseos through the resort lead you right to it. There are some wonderful restaurants and a Cold Stone Ice Cream shop there if you want a change from the hotel food, which is delicious, by the way. For the kids, there were planned Nickelodeon-themed activities daily and each evening, some with and some without a fee. There was also a \"family escape\" where you could leave your kids in the capable hands of teenaged supervisors-there, the kids could play video games, play with the computer & I-pads, watch movies, play frisbee, all in a safe, enclosed area...There were grassy areas available for families to play catch or tag, as well. But by far the best time was provided by the numerous pools, the water slide, and the lazy river. So much fun to swim and dunk and float-we did this all day long for 2 of the days we were there. The water was super-clean and the perfect temp to refresh you when the heat got to be too much. It was crowded when we were there, but we always found lounge chairs or a spot on the grassy knoll by the pool. Beach towels are provided by the staff, so you needn't pack those for your trip. The gym on-site was certainly adequate, clean and had plenty of equipment, but if you get up early enough, a nice morning run through and around the resort is a good option, as well. If you like tennis or golf, they have courts and courses for you. The rooms are great-the beds comfy and the bathrooms were actually quite luxurious. Never heard our neighbors or any ambient noise from outside our room. We had plans of driving to the Grand Canyon but decided not to go (it's a 4 hour drive) since we were having such a good time at the resort. Next time we will split our trip and stay somewhere closer to the GC, and finish our trip back at the Desert Ridge. One day activity I would recommend is a place called Crackerjax, a family fun park that has bumper boats, go-carts, batting cages, bungy dome, mini golf, an arcade....Fun for the whole family. It's about a 15 minute drive from the hotel. If you need to rent a car at some point during your trip, there is a Hertz facility on-site. This was convenient because we did not rent at the airport (very expensive at the Phoenix Sky Harbor for some reason) and we only wanted the car for a couple days. This worked perfectly for us, and we turned in our car at the airport for no extra fee, saving us money on transportation to the airport. Parking was free, though, so if you do have a car for your trip, it won't cost you to park at the hotel. (I think the website said there was a per day charge).

I was Working in Desert Ridge so location was great. I will try to keep this brief and point out some areas for consideration if you are visiting Phoenix for the first time. Firstly, you must hire a car as I only saw 1 bus in the whole week I was there and nothing is walkable. The hotel was about a 35 minute drive to the north of downtown and the airport. The hotel is huge but never feels overcrowded. As I had travelled from the UK I suffered from waking up at around 5am after my first night - no worries. I was straight down the gym (accessed by key card) onto the treadmill and then beat of all into the lazy river for a swim around watching the rabbits and sunrise. Then into the hot ub at around 6.30am, fabulous! Then, breakfast al fresco at the hotel - full buffet with everything you can imagine. I was especially fond of the counter full of fresh berries (2 plates full per day). As I arrived on a Saturday - on Sunday we jumped in the car and headed north to Anyhem Outlet mall (30 minute drive). To cut to the chase, well worth a visit (Nike / Ralph Lauren and so on), but you are just as likely to get a bargain at Macy's at Paradise Mall (I picked up a RL Hoodie and RL Lambswool v neck for $55 in total. Needless to say, food is fantastic, recommend the Cheesecake Factory.

The Marriott issued wrist bands each day when entering the pool to keep this for guests only. It was crowded but we never had a problem finding a spot, there is ample shade areas as well. The grounds are kept immaculate! There are several ponds and sitting areas, at night they have bond fires going all over. We ate at the pool side restaurant a few times during the day, very good, delicious smoothies. We enjoyed Tuscany, the Italian restaurant along with Roy's Hawaiian fusion for dinner, both very good.

It was so very loud and continued non stop until 1:45 AM. As I was traveling on business it really affected my last day due to the lack of sleep.

We wanted a place where we could have maximum time to catch up, a fabulous spa, and some hiking. We also wanted to be somewhere where we would not have to leave the property. We found almost everything we were looking for at the JW Desert Ridge. We got a spa package that allowed us to stay at a very reasonable price and included spa treatments, breakfast, and discounts in some of the shops. We had a bit of trouble with check-in, and had to spend some time correcting our bill -- the reason for the four stars for service. Otherwise, all of the staff was wonderful and accommodating. The spa was perfect. The poolside Spa Bistro served delicious and health-conscious meals, the spa staff was attentive, and the spa spaces were well-stocked and very clean. We were all very pleased with our treatments, from facials to massages, to mani/pedis. We enjoyed our meals at Roy's so much, we dined there a second night, as well! Dining outdoors the second night (accompanied by live music) made for a different experience. Breakfast at the Blue Sage was also great -- the breakfast buffet had a great variety and very good quality. The only disappointment was not necessarily the fault of the resort. We saw on the website that there were several walking trails available, and expected some scenic hiking available. The trails are all sidewalks through developing retail areas along relatively busy streets, except for a short half-mile through the resort that was unmarked -- we ended up on a maintenance road and the golf cart trail.

I spent a Saturday night mini-staycation here and found it to be tremendously quiet and peaceful. Almost too quiet, given that it was a weekend during the high winter season in Arizona. But that is a reflection on the economy more than on the hotel. As a result, we hardly saw another person during our stay, which added to our sense of getting away from it all. We even had a secluded hot tub to ourselves on Saturday night, which was pretty nice, though we had to walk a long way outdoors in the chilly desert air to get to it. My only knock on the place was the uneven service and the parking. On the plus side, after making my reservation (with Marriott Rewards points), \"Elite Ambassadors\" from the hotel contacted me via email to ask if I had any special requests. I didn't have any, but answered a question about any special reason for staying by saying it was a romantic getaway. They responded by saying they would be awaiting my arrival. When I checked in, however, I was politely thanked for being an elite Marriott Rewards member and handed a small gift bag that contained...two bottles of water. That was it. Now, I wasn't expecting anything special when I made my reservation, but the Ambassadors made it seem as though I would be singled out when I arrived. Nope. I got a card with the bag telling me that Marriott would wave the spa/resort fee, which is a rip-off in the first place, and I'd still have to pay $10 per car (we came in two cars) for parking. Since it's a secluded resort, it's not like I was coming to a city center where all parking costs money, and there was nowhere else to park, so this is essentially another way to extract money from guests. Another revenue maker was, as is the case with so many Marriott hotels, charging me as an Elite member for spotty internet service. Again on the plus side, when I asked for a late check out, the staff member on the phone extended check out by two hours quickly and politely. When I did check out by phone, another staff member thanked me for being an Elite member and was very courteous. The two young people running the large gift shop on the evening I arrived also went the extra mile to help me find some candles to make the stay more romantic.

We weren't interested in the golf facilities at this resort. A pet peeve of mine is when a hotel nicks their customers for services that others don't charge for. The biggest irritant is the $12.95 charge for wireless services. Sure I could go down the street to a Starbucks and get it for free, but I shouldn't have to at this price point. The charge for parking is $10.00 per day. We had to ask for the coffee and paper cups to be replaced everyday. The towels were low quality, dingy and scarce. Again, at this price point I expect better. The hotel was basically empty until the day we left when a convention group began to arrive.

We arrived on a Friday and left on a Wednesday. Due to some airport delays, we didn't make it to the hotel until about 7PM. After working that morning, traveling all day, and not eating much along the way, we were pretty drained when we arrived. We had originally planned to go outside the resort to eat dinner, but by the time we got there, we just wanted to collapse. We decided to just eat on-site at the hotel and ended up at Tuscany. This proved to be a great choice. The wife had a great pasta dish as I scarfed down a pizza. Admittedly, we were probably underdressed for this place, but the staff made us feel very welcome and were quite understanding of our travel experience. We didn't plan on eating here, but having done so, I would definitely recommend it if you are staying at the hotel. If it is warm enough, consider dining outside on the patio that overlooks the Isle of Capri. We ventured back to our room and crashed. I woke up the next morning to a beautiful sunrise over the mountains with a view of the Isle of Capri in front of me. We had booked a standard room using Marriott points, and were upgraded to a Signature View room. It definitely did have a very nice view. I ended up spending a lot of time out on the balcony, just reflecting and thinking about how fortunate I was. Other than a suite, I can't think of any other room I would have preferred in this hotel. It had just about the best view I could have hoped for. Many thanks to the Marriott staff for placing us here!! Although I did play golf every day that I was out there, we did spend a good amount of time just relaxing at the resort. Many afternoons were spent poolside. All of the pools there are heated and at quite a comfortable temperature. There are multiple options when it comes to the pools. There is a large pool with a fountain structure built in the middle of it. There is also more of a quiet pool for swimming laps nearby, as well as a small area for younger kids to sit in the water and play. A decent size hot tub is in the same area too. Unfortunately, the lazy river was closed while we were there. They did a good job of hiding it from the public though. If we didn't know it existed, we would never had known it was there. This is a good thing if you have younger kids, as I would imagine they would see it and be quite disappointed. Our favorite place to relax was the spa pool though. It is far removed from the main pool complex and there were no little kids running around here. Don't get me wrong, I love kids and know to expect lots of yelling and splashing at a place like this. Sometimes, it is nice to have the option to escape to peace and serenity though, and that is what we got at the spa pool. Since we are Marriott Rewards Gold members, we did not have to pay to use the facilities. It is included if you get a treatment at the spa, otherwise, I think you have to pay a minimal fee. As for dining, we did try out most of the dining outlets at the property, as well as venture off-site a good bit. For breakfast, we did try out Blue Sage one time. The food was good, but it wasn't anything spectacular. There is a Starbucks on site that provides a quicker option. Across the street from the hotel is the Desert Ridge Marketplace, and most notably an Einstein Bagel. Most of our breakfasts were here. It's great if you don't need a big breakfast buffet. We did have lunch once at the poolside restaurant, Just a Splash. It was your average resort poolside fare. Not bad, but not spectacular either. It is good if you are hanging at the pool and don't feel like getting up out of your seat though. A much better lunch option can be found at the Spa. There are some really tasty, and really healthy options on the menu. And the fruit smoothies there are awesome (not to mention cheaper, significantly better and much larger than the ones at the other pool). If you find yourself craving fast-food, there is an In-n-Out Burger across the street from the hotel (in the Desrt Ridge Marketplace). Aside from our dinner at Tuscany that first night, we ate outside of the resort for our dinners. There are a number of great restaurants in the area. Down the street from the hotel is the CityNorth shopping area. There are a few options there, including Ocean Prime, which offered great steak and seafood. About 15 minutes away is Kierland Commons. This is a very well built up area with multiple great dining options and lots of shopping for the wife! We often stayed at the hotel for Happy Hour and then ate later dinners. There is the Vista Lounge, which has live entertainment and great specials. Roy's also has an Aloha Hour from 4-6PM. $5 for huge frozen margaritas became a daily event, as did the $5 drinks and appetizers at Roy's. I am generally quite active on my vacations, but there is something to be said for just relaxing to the music with a frozen drink in hand! As we were there a bit before Christmas time, the resort was nicely decorated for the holidays. One of the coolest things was the massive gingerbread complex (not house) that they built over the prior month that magically popped up in the lobby overnight. The picture doesn't do it justice. It was too cool....just an example of how the hotel goes above and beyond here. If there is a fault to this hotel, it would be the resort fee that everyone complains about. It was $16 for us as Marriott Regard Gold members and $25 if you are not. They give you a list of things that it gets you, but none of it really applies. You get 10% off in the shops at the hotel, but not the main gift shop, which is where we bought gifts! It does include self-parking fees or a $10 discount off the valet parking, but that is about it. Yes, it does suck. But there isn't anything you can do about it, so get over it before you arrive and don't let it spoil your trip. All in all, we loved this place! I have been to many fine resorts all over the world. While this isn't the Four Seasons, it is a very nice 4 Star Resort. It is one of the best Marriott properties I have been to, maybe the best (and yes, I have been to the ones in Hawaii). If you are thinking about coming here, don't think about it any longer.

The hotel is located very close to a shopping mall and it was easy to call for a town car with a flat rate of $5 (very good deal). I could go shopping while my husband was working.

The hot stone massage was done by a very gentle masseuse who was very in tune with what I needed. The facial left my face feeling extremely soft, revived, refreshed and renewed. My skin was glowing! The spa also has a private pool so that if you don't feel like mingling at the other pools, you can just be by yourself (maybe with a few other people).

A great choice since we had a fantastic time. We have stayed at 3 - 4 other JW's and Ritz properties and the Dessert Ridge is one of the best. As most of you know Marriot is known for their small guest rooms. They typically place a huge emphasis on the lobby and common areas. The standard guest rooms here are much, much larger than even the Ritz rooms we've stayed in the past. The bath rooms also are very large and plenty of room for two people. Bravo Marriot for breaking with past culture and expanding the size of these rooms. A few pointers: The Cloud Club is well worth the money. It's $100 a day per room or $75 a day if you are a Marriott Gold Elite member. This inlcudes the $25 per day Resort Fee and the $16 per day Self Park charge so essentially its $59 a day regular guest or $34 a day for Gold Elite members. It provides access to the spa area and the spa pool. This pool is pure paradise!! Very quiet and totally relaxation for adults only. Cloud Club has a great cooked to order breakfast with fresh fruit, pastries, bagels, etc.. Happy hour with nice selection of wine & beer, mixed drinks, soft drinks, bottled water, etc.. The food at night is very nice and all you need before dinner. Self Park- no big deal...just a 2 minute walk even in 100 degree heat. No sweat...sorry couldn't resist. Runners & Walkers- great location for both. Right out of resort onto Deer Valley Dr. cross Tatum Rd. go about 1/4 mile and will intersect with a shaded trail through a subdivision. Nice place to run or walk. Golf: The Faldo course is excellant. Irish links course in the dessert. Room location...not a big deal but the Blue Sage Restaurant has live music on the veranda each night. Our room was on the 5th floor directly over the music and it's audible even from the 5th floor. If your on east coast time and want to turn in at 9pm it might be a bit noisy. These rooms are directly over the lobby on the back of the hotel. Great views of the pool and mountains.

After reading through many and relating to a few, I would like to add my 2 cents and strong positive support of the resort. True, the room was no great shakes, but the property was beautiful. True, it is large enough to warrant getting a map, but it wasn't so big that you couldn't get around without one. True, service at restaurants was spotty, but it was great to have so many choices on-site. And if the service was bad, or the food unmemorable, you could always go to the shopping center across the street that has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. I highly recommend Mimi's Cafe for good food and good prices. A local's favorite, you may have to wait a while to be seated, but it's worth it -- great breakfast. I felt the resort staff was extremely nice and helpful, but restaurant/lounge staff attentiveness was spotty. We went to attend Spring training games (go Mariners!) but were outnumbered by families on Spring Break vacations. Personally, I have no problem with sharing \"my resort\" with families. On the one hand, it's our bad luck that we're paying premium airfare because it is a very popular travel time for vacationing families, but on the other hand, what a fabulous respite from rainy, dreary March in Seattle. Worth the price of the plane ticket. Our favorite things: for my husband, the fitness center and spa which he visited every morning. First class and never over-crowded. For me, taking long walks in the morning while he was doing his workout. I walked city streets into neighborhoods but the sidewalks were wide and are flat, safe and easily accessible. Did I mention what a fabulous respite this warm March weather was from our cold, wet Seattle March weather? You can't beat it. Other favorite things: drinks on the sofas/club chairs facing the grassy knoll (good sushi btw); Meritage Steak House - not necessarily the best steak I've ever had, but a nice atmosphere; people watching (we also were there during Fight Night and personally saw or heard of many celebrity sightings); warm weather - oh, I already mentioned that. Usually at this point I'd say \"you'll really like it\" but reading the past reviews, it's clear that people are looking for different things in their vacation stays, so this may not suit the bill for you.

We enjoyed Arizona last year and decided to stay there again. We chose this resort for the most part because of the pools and good reviews. This review is purely based on our experience and maybe some of you can relate: THE RESORT GROUNDS: Very beautiful and some what clean. The main entrance to the resort is somewhat plain, which was disappointing. I expected a visual grand entrance to heighten my arrival, but it never happened. Most of the visual appeasement comes from the pool and the surrounding areas of the restaurants. ROOMS: Nice, but nothing exciting. Our view was of the main entrance. See above post. However, our view at night was very beautiful with all the surrounding lights. RESTAURANTS: Where do I begin!!! Roy\u2019s: Yes, Roy\u2019s....Very slow. There were only two tables being occupied when my wife, kids, and I went. It took for ever for the food and the bill to come. Not to mention my waiter was inattentive and annoying as hell.....\"No worries.\" This is what he kept saying to us and other guests the whole night. Needless to say, my food was not hot and my wife and kids went back to the room because it took so long for the bill to come. As a matter of fact, I didn't even wait for the bill and left 15 minutes later. Nonetheless, I called the manager from my room and told him about our experience. $100.00 for a unmemorable meal. Go else where. Tuscany's: God awful!!! Take my Gnocchi\u2019s back because the have no taste. My 7 and 10 year olds hated their meal. My wife boxed her's to go and later confessed that she didn't like it. The waiter was a lot better than the guy at Roy's. Blue Sage: Very good hotel food. Sadly, I recommend this restaurant over the others. FYI they were only open on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for dinner. Breakfast buffet....AWESOME. Note, those who get the free breakfast buffet with there hotel price they still give you a bill at the end of your meal even though it's free. I don't know about you, but I'm not paying a waiter 20% of a $60.00 bill for pouring me coffee. Funny, last day there I guess they figured it out and nobody waited on us. I don't mind tipping, but I also don't like getting ripped off. LOCATION: Great!! Plenty of shopping and restaurants across the street. POOLS: Awesome!!!! Kids loved them, wife and I joined in. Be Warned!!! A few degenerate people. You would think that at a nice hotel like would attract classy people. For the six young males and females drinking Coors Lite out of the cans while sitting in a inner tube traveling around the lazy river, I pray for you. Your mouths were fowl. One day you'll understand when you have kids. Not to mention they left their beer cans littered under the bridge. GET A PLASTIC CUP, KIDS ARE AROUND!!

The Desert Ridge is a beautiful property with excellent restaurants on property including Roy's, Blue Sage and Tuscany, and within a short drive (about 2 minutes) you have California Pizza Kitchen, Macaroni Grill, and many others. The property is a nice expansive property, but done right. They are going through a update to the rooms. We were in one of the newer updated rooms and the amenities were fine. We had two rooms (one king with pullout sofa and a double). We had no issues. Plenty of channels on the t.v. and plenty of room in the bath. The amenities of the hotel include golf and the more popular river pool. Needless to say, it is true it can get crowded around the pool. The water is cool in the morning, but warms up quickly during the day. They provide tubes for coasting down the river, along with the Nickelodeon adventure of poolside shows for the kids at the pool. The servers around the pool do their best to take care of customers, but it can be a bit of a wait for drinks or food. For the most part, we found everyone to be courteous and accomodative. Usually two people \"cruise\" the area, so if you get missed, someone is likely to come by. We spent time all over the pool. There is something for adults and families. The fitness room is fine, with treadmills, ellipticals, bike, and stairmasters with television. THere are free weights and other equipment. Nice facility close by the pool. Didn't use the spa, but I'm sure that's nice. I noticed one review as it related to the courtesy of the staff, I cannot disagree with that comment more.

They have a simply divine lounge with outside seating that isn't too noisy even if there is an event which is not that often. The lounge area extends outside and is a very large area with lovely comfortable seating where you can have your pre dinner drink around their attractive firepits. Should you be going we recommend Roys restaurant - it is Hawaiian cuisine and has simply delicious fish. There is also a restaurant called Tuscany which didn't suit us but I think it would be great for young children as they have pizza's and a variety of other smaller dishes suitable for children. Having said that there are always plenty of kids at Roy's as well. There is a beautiful fine dining restaurant called Meritage at the club house and although agreed it is expensive the food is very good indeed and worth paying for. This is really a lovely resort in a beautiful setting and we are not golfers, we have been two years now and intend to go again.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201c2nd stay.

Not only was this resort beautiful, but you cannot beat the value. Let me preface by saying that I have stayed all at types of all inclusives (including Mexico and the Carribeans), and the package that we got for the Desert Ridge was as close as you can get to an all inclusive here in the States. I found an incredible deal that included daily breakfast buffets ($22 value per person), daily found of golf for the guys ($130 value per person), plus daily 50 min spa treatment for the ladies (valued at over $130 per person). We got the whole package for about $250 per room daily. You can't beat that! Pros: Hotel: Beautiful layout. The grounds were immaculate. For those that say it is too big, go and check out the Mexican resorts...now that is big. Nothing looked run down, people always cleaning Pool: A hit with the kids. Lazy river and water slide was nice. Attentive wait staff around the pool as well. Room: We got the 2 bedroom connecting. It was perfect for 2 families (4 adults, 4 kids). The kitchenette was perfect. We loved the Murphy bed and extra full bath in the living room. Allowed the men to leave early for golf without disturbing the rest. Our room was 3406 and was easy walking distance to everything (including Golf course). Food: This was the biggest surprise. Food was terrific. Food was well priced for a big resort. Plus with the resort fee, kids eat free! We literally save $100s on that alone. There was always happy hour with decent priced drinks. We ate at the Blue Sage (terrific breakfast buffet), Tuscany (great ambience if you sit outside), and the Meritage Steakhouse. We had lots of picky eaters and all thought the food was great Service: This too was outstanding. Everyone was friendly. There was a housekeeper/engineer named Thomas who even went out of his way to get us free drink coupons. Everyone tried to cater to our big group. They even compensated us (gave us a credit) for a fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night. The \"At Your Service\" number was always able to help us with reservations and anything else we needed. Golf/Spa- Having this included in the package was awesome. I called well ahead and made tee times and spa reservations well in advanced. Golf clubs were taken from our car and was always ready for us at the cart each morning. The courses were in great condition. The practice range and greens were perfect. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. My recommendation would be to make an early tee time (<8am). The spa, per the women, was wonderful. The waiting room was nice and all treatments were enjoyed. Tip is automatically added to your bill. Cons: - Rooms weren't ready til exactly 4pm. A tad annoying - The carpets in most of the rooms were loose and worn down - Pool got really really crowded during the weekends. Hard to find chairs and lounges - Beds were really soft and worn down - Towels at the pool also appeared worn down and frayed - Buffet gratuity for party >8 was automatically 18%. Did not understand this - Would have liked to be able to rent a cabana at the main pool All in all, you could not ask for a better deal for a family vacation. I don't know how the resort made any money on us :) I don't know of any other resort that combines spa/golf/pool like this one did.

I immediately called the front desk and was told they did not put me in my \"guaranteed\" reserved room because they had overbooked--- after much disappointment we eventually were able to move rooms midstay- but that is a whole different story (we ended up roomless from 9 AM to 5 PM because the room we were moving to was never quite ready). The rooms are not that great. The first part of our stay we ended up in a king with a twin size sofa pull out for our family of 4 (kids 6 and 8). Our second room had 2 doubles. The king and pullout was better. The doubles are very small and my tall husband and I were fighting for space in the middle of night. I called for more pillows and was told they were out- doubles have 2 pillows on them-- 2 very lumpy small pillows. Kings have at least 6 pillows. I did not think the rooms were very clean-- not for 4 stars. The Kierland has much better rooms, beds and pillows. We went primarily for the pool. We went out at 8:00 in the morning and noticed about 85% of the chairs were already taken- oddly there were only about 15 people around. It is obvious that people get up very early and go down and save seats at the pools. They have a sign that says they will remove articles from seats that have been unattended for 30 minutes---- this never happens. We watched as people left their seats saved for up to three hours. They do not have any cabana rentals in the family pool areas. It was stressful to think about waking up early just so we have spots at the pool. This place is also very stingy with their towels. 1 towel per person and they check off your room number- if you ask for more you are charged. This is ridiculous considering the towels are half the size of the chairs and the chairas are in pretty bad shape and not very comfortable. Again, Kierland beats their pool. The lazy river at the Desert Ridge is average. They have many pools but they are all small and not very enticing to kids. Kierlands beach access, plentiful towels, comfy chairs, tables beside the chairs, service, etc.... had me regretting the pool I was sitting by at the Desert Ridge. Valet is $25 a day- Self park is $10 although the website says it is free- Seriously? $10 to park your car 2 miles away? Bathroom configuration is weird- In both rooms shower door would not open all the way because toilet is so close. Shower is a tight fit. Pina Colodas with toasted coconut along the rim were fantastic. Yes, they are $12 but I feel that price is about average for a good pina coloda. It is in a great location with a Target very closeby. They have plenty of nearby off site palces to eat and shop. This place is better than the Phoenician. We were cosidering moving hotels so we went to tour the Phoenician. It is very tired--- needs rejuvinating. Must be why it was the only 4 or 5 star place with rooms still available.

Positively the most unattractive headboards I have ever seen. Bedding not especially memorable. Pillows were terrible. Artwork mediocre. No theme.

There is no refridgerator or microwave like you would expect to find in any quasi-upscale hotel/motel and which are always useful when traveling or staying for extended periods of time. There is a coffee maker in the room but no coffee pot or coffee==that will cost you extra. There is no ice maker anywhere, you have to order ice from room service which we presumed was about $5 for a handful of ice. There isn't even WI-Fi in the rooms. Instead there are some areas around the front lobby that you can get connected but expect to pay about $13 to get connected each day. I declined this \"service\" so I'm not sure if they also charge you for actual time spent on the net. While our room was paid for by employer, the resort still wanted our credit card for \"incidentals\" that they expect you to have to pay while there. The grounds and area are really well kept and beautiful and a walk around the outside of the facility is a must do. We didn't go into the swimming pool area because you have to swipe your room key into the gate to get in and we expected that would also be an \"incidental\" we didn't want to pay for since we were not going to actually swim. There are several of the typical shops and restaurants found in most well appointed malls and shopping centers just across the street from the hotel grounds but it is a fairly good (albeit pretty) walk from the hotel to this area. We ate at the Keg Steakhouse our first night and we both had the toughest prime rib we have ever encountered. We both had tired jaws from trying to conquer these overpriced pieces of meat. We would never return to the Keg because we've had much better prime rib at less than half the cost of this place. We thought initially the Keg was going to be really good just because their prices were extaordinarily high but then you don't always get what you pay for, certainly you don't at the Keg. However, Steamers Seafood Restaurant located closer into downtown Scottsdale was a real treat. The shrimp, scallops, and fish were very good and the prices are reasonable. Also, Mimi's is in the area across from the hotel near the Keg and Mimi's is generally a very good choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner. All in all, aside from the beautiful grounds which you can take in without actually having to stay in the resort, we would prefer to stay in any one of the better motels that provide lots of amenities such as coffee & tea in the room, a fridge, microwave, WiFi. At the Desert Ridge Resort, we felt like P.T. Barnum was following us around (extracting as much money as possible for those things usually included in the price of the room in better hotel/motel selections) while whispering \"there's a sucker born every day\" as the dollars fled our pockets.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cSpotty Service\u201d", "Author": "dnvr", "ReviewID": "UR49362059", "Content": "I found the grounds beautiful and the rooms also.

Grounds are nice, but location is pretty far from the core Scottsdale properties. For many off-site dinners and meetings, journey is a pain. We did a conference dinner at the Phoenician and it took a good 40+ minutes to get there at 5PM. Had some room service errors and slowness, but food was pretty good. Has one nice restaurant on property. Had a somewhat difficult concierge experience when they could not find a package that was delivered. In a nutshell, it's a good, above average facility for a conference, but they do not live up to the JW name on service and attention to detail. It's no Phoenician, No Four Seasons, No Royal Palm, No Marriott Camelback. But, if you are here for a work event, it has what you need, however, it's not a four or five star hotel on service.

However I would not return because of a couple of major issues. When I booked I called the hotel and was told there was a package which was $ 269 and gave free breakfast buffet and $ 100 a night towards the hotel restaurants. When I checked in I asked to confirmed the package but they said \" no free breakfast\". After a long discussion they eventually agreed to honour what I had been told and not charge for the breakfast. However when I checked out they had charged for the breakfast !.. That was another long conversation but they did eventually cancel that charge. They had also not applied the$ 100 credit to my dinner at Roys restaurant at the hotel . I took issue with this when I checked out and got the bill and they said \" that resturant is on our property but not owned by us so you cannot use the credit. \" I said that was the first time I had been told that and if I had known I would have eaten at one of their other restaurants . They said that when they gave me my room key there was some small print on the documents attached stating that Roys was excluded, , so I had to pay for that dinner. ( When I got home I found the papers they gave me when I checked in and there was NO mention of the fact that I could not use the credit at Roys) . When I checked out I asked if I could use some of the unused credit for lunch . They said that was fine. However that was then charged to my credit card, but when I raised the issue they cancelled it. . This was all such a hassle I would not return. I got the clear impression that they will charge for everything they can and hope you do not notice. The second issue I had was that despite a very good range of pools, not one was \" adults only\" and all had noisy kids so I had no peace to read.

Marriott Spa & Resort for three nights for a business event. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The facility is gorgeous! I could have spent most of my trip in the lobby or the huge arrival verandah. This impressive property blends very well with the natural surroundings and I was thrilled to see jack-rabbits eating grass on the lawn on my way to breakfast. Dining outside was a treat as well since all sorts of birds, including hummingbirds happily mingled with diners and staff and more aggressive species waited to snatch left overs from the buffets and clearing trays. The impressive labeled native plant collection on the walking paths and an adequate number of big comfy wooden benches and chairs made it easy to tolerate the high temperatures (102 - 106 during my stay). The distant mountain range was an impressive view from my balcony. A colleague said she'd seen a coyote on the path during an early morning jog. This facility is definitely for nature lovers and is a perfect backdrop for nature photography. My king room was adequate, though the color scheme and decor made it a little too casual - might do well with an update. The room and the entire hotel were clean and tidy though. In my room was a large desk with ethernet (wi-fi is free in the lobby), big screen TV, large chest with in-room safe, large closet, loads of large mirrors, a seating area with loveseat and coffee table and a large bath with deep soaking tub and separate glass shower. When I reported the toilet handle was barely attached to the tank when I got to my room maintenance arrived promptly to make the repair and the front desk followed up via phone to ensure all was well. Meeting areas were great but our group was quite large so we utilized several salons. Because of the size of the room it was difficult to view either of the huge screens while presenting from the center of the stage. One thing everyone noted was the hotel catering staff for the meeting was reluctant to leave the buffets out for very long even though the meeting frequently ran past break time. Stragglers arrived to the foyer to find the serving trays had already been removed though there had still been plenty of food. Food during the meeting and via room service was good, nothing extraordinary but certainly not inedible. The resort boasts several restaurants though I did not get a chance to try any of them. There is also a spa, golf course, swimming pool with 'rafting,' a Starbuck's and Kinko's as well as several upscale shops. Kiosks to print boarding passes are across from the front desk and are a welcome convenience. The conscierge desk staff was even there late evening to help facilitate day trips or outings and there was a multitude of brochures to peruse. Each morning, a variety of newspapers were available at reception. Despite the magnitude and elegance of the entry and reception, the main focus at Marriott Spa & Resort seems to be comfort and a down to earth friendly, cheerful approach. I suppose that would explain the sunny yellows and bright colors in the rooms rather than more somber and stuffy elegance. One point to keep in mind if heading here for a stay is the resort is very large. I was on one end of the building on the lobby level and my meeting was at the other end. It was easily a ten minute walk, albeit through the beautiful lobby and past a bank of windows through which I could watch the bunnies enjoying the lawn. Marriott was advertising a deal, $99 a night for up to four nights for a future visit but it was necessary to prepay and I wasn't sure when I'd be in Phoenix again so I didn't get details but I would definitely recommend this property for leisure or business especially at those savings!", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cLocation\u201d", "Author": "Chopalua", "ReviewID": "UR43172119", "Content": "The hotel is located on a huge parcel.

I was charged a daily resort fee of $25 so the deal was not completely free, but close. Due to lines at the rental car counter and a crazed GPS unit that sent me at first South from Sky Harbor instead of North I was very late arriving. There was no one at the bellman station or valet and the huge lobby area was desolate. I never saw the area look this way again during my stay--typically it was like a beehive. I asked for a quiet room and upon first examination of the room's location and view I was disappointed. Later I learned to be grateful as I was far from the very noisy areas of the hotel. This hotel was full of families with young children. I rarely took an elevator downstairs from my fifth floor room without sharing it with children and strollers. I had read about the lazy river online and the many pools but when I went outside the lazy river was almost solid acorss with inner tubes occupied by kids. This was the situation at every pool. I checked out all of them and there werte children in all of them. The one that was the farthest from the back of the hotel was the least crowded. There is a Nickolodean kids' camp and lots of activiitesd geared for children. Most children were well supervised though I did ride the elevator with solo children more than once and even in my room with its view of some construction acorss the way I heard the occasional howl of children running on the floors below me. I liked it that my room had a balcony, but it was so close to the balconies to my right and left that whenever I went outside I felt I was sharing the space. A teenage girl in the room next to me stared at me whenever I went outside to sit to the point that I grew uncomfortable. I noticed that some of the balconies on the poolside of the hotel had dividers between the balconies, but the ones on the wing where my room was located did not. Now with all this said,, the room was very well appointed and larger than the typical room. The bathroom had a separate shower with clear glass walls and glass door and a deep soaking bath tub. The toiletries provided were larger than those typically supplied and very nice. There was a robe in the closet, a flat screen TV, and a nice sofa. I was surprised that there was no wi-fi--had to connect by cable and pay for the use of the internet--a pet peeve of mine since most lower end Marriott properties provide this as a free service. The botanical gardens on the property were nice and I enjoyed seeing the rabbits there as well as the interesting flora. There is a fedex center and a Starbucks coffee shop on the premises. I did not eat in the hotel redstaurants as I had reservations at several PHX restaurants during my stay. I did have a drink out on the patio one night where they had live music. A water element separates the patio from a grassy lawn and I sat at the table and watched kids playing Red Light Green Light on this lawn. There were a number of young teens, young kids and older people in this area just talking, enjoying the music, etc. It was pleasant but I kept thinking I would have had more fun with my grandkids...it was just that sort of place....a family resort. I ordered room service breakfast one day and the food was okay but not that great. I had the omelette and it was dry with rubbery egg. The hashbrowns were a bit overdone and while there was a small vase containing a flower on the tray the presentation on the plate was rather drab. I expected a piece of fruit or some detail attention all things considered. The valets were very fast with the car--always having it out front by the time I walked there from my room. They were all friendly, eager to open the door, seemingly grateful for tips. They have two computers across from reception that you can use to print boarding passed for free. I did not know this except that I went to the fedex center and asked about time on computer and the girl there told me I could go to reception and do it for free and she would charge me by the minute. It would be nice to put this in the booklet in the room or advertise it better since my room was on the opposite side of the hotel froim the fedex center. I did not use the spa so I can not comment on it. All in all, the property is very pretty and well-maintained. The staff is kind and efficient.

They had some really good summer specials for us locals (we live only five miles away, if that), so I decided to take advantage of a couple and see what this resort was like. We had never stayed there before. The first night, we got a local rate of $111 for the night. The arrival, valet and check-in process was smooth and everyone greeted us and made us feel welcomed. The room was spacious with a king bed, big couch, desk, flat-screen TV, balcony and a huge bathroom with separate soaking tub and shower. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were top of the line. We spent most of the day relaxing in the room or walking around the resort holding hands. It was great! For dinner, we ate at Roy's, one of the restaurants at the hotel. It serves Roy Yamaguchi's renowned Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine in a festive, island-style atmosphere. The food was great and the service even better. The second night, we did the \"Buy two massages and get your hotel night free\" deal ... the two massages were only $175 total and they were great! The Revive Spa truly lives up to the hype and advertising ... it is luxurious, well-appointed, soothing, clean and the service is outstanding. My wife and I got a couple of great massages and spent most of the day at the spa, swimming in the pool, eating at the spa cafe and taking advantage of the amenities. For dinner, we just decided to sit outside at the Vista Lounge, had a couple of drinks and ordered some sushi rolls. They were really good! Later, back in the room, we got the munchies and I decided to order a Chicken Pot Pie from the Blue Sage Restaurant. This was the only down side to the whole experience ... it was the worst Chicken Pot Pie I have ever had! Oh well. The next morning, the check-out process was painless as all we had to do was drop the key off at the front desk. The valet had our car waiting, loaded our bags and off we went for the five mile drive home. Overall, I give the JW Marriott Desert Ridge the highest rating I have ever given a resort. The facility is new, fresh, modern, clean and inviting. The staff are, without question, friendly and very, very service-oriented. And just about all of the food was fantastic. I know the prices for the accomodations become quite steep in the winter during high season, but if you can get a deal, I would highly recommend this resort in every way. Heck, even without a deal, it would still be worth the experience if you could. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know that I can be highly critical of a hotel when necessary.

The front desk/phone service staff were extremely helpful. On the last evening of out stay we attempted to relax and enjoy the bar and restaurant. Of course, as with most resorts, distance and cost of transportation off-site make for very high prices for on-site food and the Desert Ridge was no exception. A convention at the hotel did push the limit of capacity at the Blue Sage restaurant but nothing beyond that experienced by most major city restaurants on a Saturday night. We found ourselves waiting for 45 minutes to be seated for a buffet. The hostess was useless and couldn\u2019t seem to \u201cfinds\u201d any of the parties whose name she whispered (there was no hearing her meek calls over the talk of the people waiting). My husband and I eventually walked in to \u201csee\u201d buffet and noticed several empty tables for two. Still we continued to wait. After finally being seated, we noticed quickly that the large numbers of wait staff did a lot of running around but accomplished very little on each \u201ctrip\u201d. The service should have been relatively easy given that most customers chose the buffet. Our first thought was that our table was not assigned though we were in the front room and passed by every server going to the kitchen, bar, and hostess station. The hostess by then had been joined by a young man who seemed to be the only individual trying to solve problems. He seated us, got us our water, cleared tables and sat the crowd the hostess couldn\u2019t seem to handle. We waited 15 more minutes for someone to take our drink order so we could tell them we wanted the $19.95 buffet. Finally a rather abrupt waiter came by and gave us permission to go the buffet. The \u201cadult\u201d buffet food was good but small plates and bowls for deserts and soup were not available. The waiter appeared for what was only his second visit to bring our check. When we finished eating, we continued to wait for another 30 minutes for our money to be taken and another 10 for our change. By this time there were about 4 tables left in the restaurant with patrons seated. Our wait gave us time to watch the hostess take 30 minutes to buss a table across from us with ADD like distractions pulling her away to seemingly meaningless tasks every few seconds. The entire staff was now in closing mode and we were completely unable to make eye contact with anyone. Luckily we were not in a hurry and decided to make the best of watching and chuckling at this hapless display of disorganization. After more than two hours we went to just outside the restaurant to the large patio area to enjoy a drink. No server asked us our order though they did serve other guests around us. We then ventured to the lobby bar are where we experienced the same non-service. I strongly suggest the Dessert Ridge go to the local Denny\u2019s or Waffle House to bring their wait staff up to the standards of the rest of this hotel\u2019s service.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel..should have better restaurant service..\u201d", "Author": "coastal4", "ReviewID": "UR36614800", "Content": "Loved the hotel rooms, lobby, pools and landscaping..A+++..but the restaurant service, particularly at the Blue Sage is the WORSE we have ever experienced at a resort..for the money paid, expect the best..I am not a complainer, but took 45 minutes to get our drinks..kids gave up and ate from the slop buffet( worse than what you would get at a Mac Donalds)and they tried to charge $17.95 each, even though one of our kids was free with the resort fee we paid..our food arrived cold 30 minutes later..meanwhile the kids left, had been gone for a long time, and waitress asked if they wanted refills on their drinks, not noticing they were gone..our salad came after the meal..and the kids dirty plates sat at the table the whole time..horrible experience, for such a beautiful place..get your act togwether Desert Ridge!", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus", "Title": "\u201cFinest Resort!\u201d", "Author": "Toyia", "ReviewID": "UR35612985", "Content": "This is a favorite of mine!

It was 115 degrees during our visit. When we arrived with our rental car we parked under the entry canopy. The valet insisted on taking our keys while we went inside to check in. Check in was very slow since there were only three associates behind the counter. When it was our turn about 15 minutes later we were taken care of promptly. The associate did not mention the resort fees (they cover high speed internet, fitness facilty etc) of $25 per day. When I checked my account on the hotel channel I saw the fee and asked that it be removed. When I checked out I realized they only took the fee off for my first day. The mistake was corrected. We went back out to retrieve our keys and inquire about parking. We expected that we would have to pay $10 per day but we were not charged. Self parking was quite a distance away but as we were unloading the car a golf cart pulled up and whisked us up to the hotel ballroom so we could check in for our conference. He literally pulled us right up to the door. I did not book our rooms under our event's group rate. I was able to find a cheaper rate through AAA. Their rate also guaranteed us a view of the pool. We received an email from the hotel concierge asking for any other special requests...and all of them were met. Great view, high floor, extra pillows etc. The room was very large with a huge balcony overlooking the pool area. The bathroom was also very large with a tub and a seperate shower. The entire bathroom was travertine and granite. Perfectly clean and well appointed with a blow dryer, toiletries etc. The fabrics in the room were a bit dated but the bed was all white high quality linens. The matttress was extra cushy. My king room had a small sofa that also pulled out into a bed. The armoire at the foot of the bed had a 42\" high def flat screen. It was also outfitted with plug ins for computer, Ipod with power cords in the roomy closet to make all the needed connections. There was also a mini bar and very small frdige in the armoire as well as a small safe. The closet was large and had many hangers, 2 plush spa robes, a full size ironing board and iron, coffee service and the entertainment plugs mentioned above. Large sliding doors went out onto a semi private balcony. It had plenty of room to relax and it was awesome to sit out there in the morning before my meetings and enjoy the cooler air. At least it was enjoyable until my neighbor turned out there two kids onto their adjoining balcony. I glanced over and discovered that they were just sitting there staring at me...my guess is the parents stuck them out there so they could have some \"alone time\" in the room? HA, The hallways were divided by large stairways and atriums so there wasn;t that Vegas huge long hallway vibe. I think this contributed to it being very quiet at night. There is a bar in the hotel lobby that plays live music at night outside on a patio. Unfortunately the patio was close to my room so it sounded like a live concert up in my room til after 10PM. The ballrooms were a decent walk from the rooms but certainly not excessive. The meeting rooms were well appointed and even those usually boring banquet meals were all very tasty and enjoyable. We tried two of the hotel restaurants, The Blue Sage, which was more like a big coffee shop and Roy's. Roy's was outstanding but quite pricey. Good for an expense account or special occaision but definitely not everyday vittles. There is a huge outdoor shopping complex called Dessert Ridge across the street from the hotel with tons of restaurants and another complex just down the street with many upscale eateries. We tried 25degrees there and it was outstanding. Gourmet burgers and excellent appetizers. The pool area was just outstanding. There was a long lazy river and then about 4-5 other pools scattered about. There were tons of chairs and many water stations. Everyone grabbed the complimentary tubes and cruised along with their margaritas and pina coladas. It was just wonderful. The landscaping was inpeccable and the terrain went on and on with golf course and the hotel grounds. It was so much greener than I thought the desert could be. The sound of running water was everywhere with water features of all varieties scattered around. Every single hotel associate I came into contact with was smiling and friendly. I don't know if this had to do with the economy and them being so grateful to have any job or if perhaps they had the opportunity to hire a higher calibre of employee because of it. Regardless they all went out of their way to be extra nice and helpful.

It is a beautiful large resort with all the amenities. We were given a very quiet room, although it overlooked an acre of roof. The room, bath, cleanliness was all very good. We spent one afternoon at the outdoor pool area. It was what we expected - lots of noise and young families. I had one little boy cannonball me while his mother watched and said nothing. They had the entire pool but chose to douse the few adults talking. The resort planned this area well because all the water falls really drown out a lot of the worst noise. That evening we dined at Ristorante Tuscany and it was by far the finest meal of the week including our excellent service. It was a very expensive dinner but I would highly recommend this restaurant. The next day we planned to spend the entire day at the spa pool and then have a massage in the afternoon. This is a beautiful spa and we were very impressed when we first arrived. That soon changed. In spite of many signs placed in the spa and outside at the pool stating no cell phone use, no smoking, etc. people were just coming to the spa to make their cell phone calls at the outdoor tables. Women were chatting on their cell phones in the locker room, and people were loudly conducting business all around the pool. One young women was on her phone the entire afternoon. The spa is also nonsmoking yet one young man found a lounge chair outside the locker room and smoked away. You could smell it in the pool area. The final straw was a young mother and grandmother rolling in her baby with stroller, etc. to camp out at one end of the pool. The spa states that it is for adults and children over 16. Another young mother not using the spa brought her 6 year old son to the outdoor spa cafe so she could talk on her cell and let him run around. Why have rules if they mean nothing? This is not an adult spa and it was not relaxing. The waiters will not say anything for fear of losing tips. We changed our plans for massages knowing that tranquility is not a priority here. The next morning were were charged an extra resort fee for each day even though we were on a package and did not use the internet or parking. They said they had taken it off only to find they had not when we returned home. Nothing earth shattering, but nevertheless an annoyance that takes time to correct. If you have small children and like a loud noisy resort this is for you. If you like a first rate spa experience I would look elsewhere for these prices.

Where oh where to start? 1. The worst service of any hotel I have ever been to. Staff at the pool area are rude, unresponsive, and act as if you are bothering them if you ask them for anything. 2. I was overcharged on my bill several times. 3. There was a bizarrely mean woman tending the slide in the Lazy River. She actually seemed to get off on screaming at the kids and singling out certain kids for her disdain. Everyone at the resort was calling her the \"Pool Nazi.\" Several people complained, to no avail. 4. The pool area has some smooth concrete which is lethally slippery when it gets wet, which resulted in, 5. my broken second toe and a complete lack of empathy or any response at all from the hotel management. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. The food ranges from bad (Blue Sage, which apparently cannot discern the difference between an omelette and scrambled eggs despite numerous edification efforts by me) to Bad Plus Expensive (my $80 wagu rib eye cooked within an inch of its life when I requested \"rare\" and no comping for it) to OK (Roy's is fine but everything is horribly salted) to \"Not Bad\" (Tuscany is what we would consider a mid-level restaurant here in Portland but much more expensive). I am now in bed with a very messed up toe and management refused to put me in tough with their loss claims department so I could send them my medical bills. My son really enjoyed our three hours in the emergency room, and when I asked the hotel to fill my prescription so I could simply lay down for a while after returning from the hospital, they took the prescription and said they would \"see what they could do.\" 6 HOURS LATER they called me and said \"we don't do that.\" Meanwhile, my now green, black and blue toe had swollen to twice its normal size and was throbbing to the sounds of the music in the room next door, which I could easily hear because the walls are so thin. But I have no pain medication. Ah, perfect. I was looking forward to golf, tennis and hiking in Scottsdale.

I disliked the $25/night \"resort fee\" which is a ripoff to me, but more and more hotels seem to be adopting this add-on. I'm not even sure what it covered, and it wasn't even mentioned at check-in though I was aware of it at the time I made my reservation. The only meals we ate the hotel were poolside for lunch, so I can't comment on any of the other restaurants. The poolside service was spotty, despite the area being relatively empty (don't if all the guests were in meetings or whether the 65 degree temperature kept others away from the pool). The pool temperature was great - nicely heated which I find not to be the case at many other resorts. There's also a nice lazy river and water slide for the kids. Plus, the piped in music was unobtrusive in most parts of the pool area except the lazy river. The rooms are nothing special, but they do have flat screen tv's with HD on many channels. The staff was friendly and seemed to be well-trained. Its location is fine - right across the street from the Desert Ridge outdoor mall and right off the 101 Loop which can take you either to other parts of Scottsdale or downtown.

We checked into our room, which was beautiful and had a great bathroom and comfortable beds. The TV would not decrease past 19 on the volume level, and I called the front desk to ask for help. The question I was asked was \"did you try the remote?\". Wow. About 30 minutes later, a maintenance man appeared and was mystified because he couldn't decrease the volume either, so he called in assistance. It could not be repaired, so we were moved to another room--this was about 1 1/2 hours after we had checked in (for only one night). The next room was exactly the same, and the TV worked. I went into the restroom to use splash water on my face and almost overflowed the sink because the stopper was broken and plugged the sink. I had to reach in to dig the stopper out, and didn't bother asking for it to be fixed because our time had already been wasted some. There are no vending machines on the property, which was an issue for us because my husband is diabetic and sometimes needs a quick soda if his sugar levels drop suddenly. **The last problem we did not discover until we were already home--when checking in we were asked for a card for any incidental expenses, which we are accustomed to, and my husband gave his debit card--now, normally we would use a credit card, but staying only 1 night we knew we would have no additional expenses. Checking our bank statement, a $210 charge was debited at the exact same time we checked into this establishment. Our room rate was only $161 plus taxes (government rate)! I called the hotel Saturday, and they said they could offer no help, it would have to wait until Monday and a separate billing department would be able to assist me. I did call them Monday, and was told by a representative that it was a \"hold\" placed on the funds (which renders them completely frozen until Marriott calls the bank to have them released). That's all fine and good, but we were not told that any amount would be frozen by the check-in girl, and we travel frequently and are used to giving a card for incidentals, which we normally never accrue. Our 1st 2 nights in Scotsdale we stayed at a lower star Marriott and this one could use some tips to earn its higher star rating. As stated by others, the housekeeping staff did not acknowledge us at all when we walked by, and we always make a point to speak to housekeeping in the hotels we use.

Also, housekeeping showed up one morning while we were still in the room and *immediately* offered to come back later. The fire pit area behind the restaurant is very nice to hang out at (especially in December, when even Phoenix can get a little chilly at night).

Carpets are worn, scuff marks are noticeable on the walls of the hotel's corridors, etc. The \"Lazy River\" closed at 7 PM in the summer! I find this difficult to believe since there was a good three to four hours more of decent cooler weather. In Phoenix, people like to be outside in the earlier mornings and late evenings. The schedule for this pool should be better than this. I was at conference all day, wanted to take a dip and was told to get out after 15 minutes. Ridiculous!

We have a lot of mixed feelings and I have to say that if it wasn't for the great rate we got (nearly 70% off rack) because of our convention, we probably would rate this stay a lot lower. First the good... 1. Location: It is convenient to the Desert Ridge marketplace, a full service mall including a 20 screen movie theater and dozens of restaurants. The Resort runs a shuttle every 15 minutes or so to the mall. If you have a rental car - it's location is very convenient to Phoenix's highway system and downtown is only 20 minutes away. 2. Grounds/Atmosphere: well kept - and you can't beat the bunny brigade as we called it. In the late afternoons, dozens of rabbits plop on the green grass and stretch out - it's an almost surreal experience which is fun for young and old alike. There is a lot of grounds to explore... Although I have to say Orlando's JW Marriott's lazy river is much more fun, there are at least more pools to choose from. The slide would be more fun if it wasn't turned off so early 3. Rooms: Pretty typical for Marriott - which still has the best beds of most any hotel in it's tier. Bathrooms are nice and the flat screens come with full computer interface to hook up your laptops too. Patios in every room are a nice touch and big enough to host 4 friends relaxing. 4. Front Desk Staff, Concierge, housekeeping and Parking Staff were great folks and easy to talk to and represented the Marriott brand well Now the not so good... 1. Service: Outside of the folks mentioned in #4 above, We were extremely disappointed in the service by the other staff. We had better experiences with service at Motel 6 and other budget brands then some of the people we ran into here at this JW. The lounge and bar staff were completely rude, hard to get a hold of and just not very pleasant people to deal with. Our waiter at Roys and one of our waiters at the Blue Sage were the rare exception to the restaurant staff as well. If I ever stay here again - I would much rather take a shuttle to Desert Ridge Marketplace and eat over there than waste any more money at the Resort restaurants and their rude service.. 2. Speaking of staff - the lack of friendliness at the pools by staff was also very noticeable - and quite honestly for what we're paying (if it was normal rack) - we would expect a few more options poolside for drinks and snacks similar to how Orlando's JW resort runs. 3. If you like the all in one contained resort experience, I suppose you will like the entertainment options (2 golf courses, spa, etc) available - but we made more trips into Phoenix than the average guest because quite frankly, these resorts can get boring and drain your pocketbook dry. So maybe in all fairness this complaint isn't fair to direct at this JW specifically - but imo, if you plan to stay a few days here consider renting a car (AT THE AIRPORT - NOT THE RESORT - YOU\"LL SAVE LOTS OF MONEY) and exploring the area more. I am not overly picky about service but the consistent attitude and not so hot service we received from the lounge, restaurant and other staff here reduced our rating a whole \"star\" alone.

The pool area is excellent, we were on east coast time, so we were up at 7am at the pool daily and had it to ourselves or shared with one or two others till almost 9:30. There are three pools and the fun lazy river. The pool area was never overcrowded in my mind, and had plenty of people to serve drinks and food. We ate at Meritage, Blue Sage, and Just a Splash. We loved all of it. We thought the mixed drinks at the pool for $10.00 were a little pricey for our taste, but hey we didn't have to leave the pool or resort to get to it. We found that going across the street to the Desert Ridge Marketplace and other local restaurants was more fun and cost effective. Our faves: Jalapeno Inferno (Scottsdale Road-5min), Sweet Tomatoes(Desert Ridge Marketplace 1mile), and Islands (Desert Ridge Marketplace 1 mile). If you go to the movies and keep your stub Sweet Tomatoes will give you 15% off your bill. There are a ton of stores in the Marketplace to keep you busy. We also went to the Fashion Square in Scottsdale about 13 miles away. We headed to Williams, AZ about three hours away for the train ride to the Grand Canyon, we don't have children so this long long day trip didn't cause an issue for us. My husband played golf there and loved it as well. This time of year it's 67.00, and he played at TPC Scottsdale (5miles away) for $47.00. Very cheap for excellent courses.

The combination of almost guaranteed sunshine, sandy beaches, crystal clear seas and increasingly luxurious resort just had us coming back for more. But this year the combination of an early Easter and school holidays meant that redemption opportunities were nonexistent and discounted fares were very difficult to find. It was a friendwho said, \"Have you ever thought of going to Phoenix, Arizona?\" \"No. Never,\" was my reply. Seriously I thought Phoenix was wilderness USA, nothing but cattle ranches and cactuses. Nevertheless the seed had been sown and as I searched the internet I uncovered a raft of luxury resorts in the area, all brimming with swimming pools, golf courses, spas and other facilities. In fact it became clear that we could find everything we had become used to in the Caribbean apart from the sea. And since we adopted the little one - we have spent an increasing amount of time around the pool anyway. Award availability was wide open in all classes on the BA flights from LHR so we booked 3 Club seats and finally settled on the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort and Spa. Others we considered where the Phoenician (maybe a little more up market and very expensive), Fairmont Scottsdale Princess (it got lots of poor reviews for service), and the Royal Palm Resort (lovely but very few facilities for a 10 day stay). The Marriott won because it had 5 swimming pools, 6 restaurants, Two 18 hole golf courses, a spa, a desert botanical garden, expansive grounds, and a lazy river bigger than I have seen in most water parks I have visited. We arrived after a flawless flight and only 10 minutes to clear US customs and immigration, sweeping up this huge magestic driveway to be greeted by an army of bellhops and people eager to be at our beck and call. The reception of the hotel is set around a giant open plan \"Atrium\" area about 4 storeys high - a feature that apparantly is being introduced into Marriott resorts world wide. This provides a central meeting place for families, businessmen, and drinkers. It looks out onto an expansive lawn and lake called The Sage Lawn where we saw people playing ball games and later in the week special meals being served to conference delegates. Lining the lawn is the outside Vista Bar where they light the Firepits as soon as the sun goes down and these fires become the focal point for the evening live entertainment. Our standard room was very big - the king sized bed suitably covered in various layers of pillows, throws, wraps and other decorations. The bathroom had a walk in shower and spa bath and all the usual smelly stuff which they replaced twice everyday. There was a gigantic flat screen TV with all the usual pay for extra services. Great balcony patio with views over the desert and mountains. The swimming pool area was very impressive. 4 huge swimming pools (with a 5th available in the spa in a more private and tree lined location), and the lazy river. The latter was so relaxing - simple grab a huge rubber ring, sit back and be carried round a landscaped lap every 15 minutes or so. This was a good place for topping up the sun tan as well. We arrived on Easter Sunday and the resort was mobbed with families. On the first day the swimming pool area was very busy and I did have a fear that we had made a mistake (most Caribbean resorts have a very quiet relaxed air about them). But on the second day the families disappeared and the business conference delegates arrived so the swimming pool areas became very empty. The only thing I didn't like about the swimming pool area was the piped music - simply because it was intrusive. However they did have an extensive collection of 80s music and I heard songs like \"Safety Dance\" by Men Without Hats for the first time since the.....well since the 80s. The resort features some very impressive restaurants. Blue Sage - where you have a typical US breakfast and for the rest of the day typical US fare of burgers, steaks and ribs. Not the best place and the focal point for families but good value for breakfast. Roys - a Hawaiian Fusion restaurant with a great wine list which soon became our favourite. Sitting outside in their garden with torches burning and with the nearby firepits warming the air was a lovely setting. The Five Spice Fillet Steak melted like butter when cut and the rib starter was mouth watering. After dinner you can retire to lounge chairs around the firepit and finish of your bottle of red wine. Meritus Steak House - this was at the Golf Club and had an impressive range of steaks from NY Strip to their signature dish which is a smoked rib-eye steak - this was delicious - never had smoked beef before and it was a pleasant change from the normal way a steak gets cooked. Good squid and chicken here as well. Their terrace over looks the desert botantical garden and again is a lovely venue for an evening of food and wine. Tuscany - this is their signature restaurant and features gormet Italian fare. Another terrace garden, this time over looking a lake and \"The Isle of Capri\" which that night was being used for a conference dinner. The Spa - the restaurant here does fitness breakfasts and health conscious lunches. The spa itself is well equiped with a fitness studio for Yoga and Thai Chi, treatment rooms and a large swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and cabannas that you can hire out for a more relaxing day. Try the hot stone massage - quite deep and penetrating (oo - er!), and try walking on rubbery legs afterwards. Splash - is a poolside restaurant serving burgers and sandwiches. The turkey BLT was fabulous with waffle fries. Finally - not really a restaurant - but there was also a Starbucks and this had the longest queues. The yanks love their morning Starbucks don't they? We did breakfast - basically a grande and a muffin here several mornings. The grounds of the hotel were spotlessly clean, and liberally landscaped with waterfalls, lakes, flowers and cactuses. There were rabbits on the lawns and even mallard ducks swimming in the pools. And the coyotes came to the Golf course greens every evening. One night I even saw a barn owl swooping down over the roof of the golf club. Service everywhere was impeccable. Each bar and restaurant has plenty of waiting staff, people to pour more wine, people to clean up the plates and sometimes simply to have a chat - so it seemed. We took a day trip to the Grand Canyon which I am not even going to try and describe. It is one thing that only the eyes can appreciate. Photos and videos do not do the place justice. And we spent a morning riding horses in the desert. My first time on a horse and I enjoyed every minute of it - but boy was I sore the following day!! Any critisisms? Only one. The Hotel was very inconsistent with its turn down service. I find this at most hotels that offer it - including Ritz Carlton. If they are going to service the room for a second time during the day then they should be consistent. Some nights they only cleaned the bathroom, some they turned the bed down, put slippers by the bed, put a chocolate on the pillow and put on a soothing CD, other nights nothing at all. Anyway it resulted in a $100 credit when I made the comments. So I would whole heartedly recommend this place. We would go back definitely and as a winter holiday it gave us everything we have ever had in the Caribbean apart from the sea - but with one major major advantage. It is a dry arid climate so there are no biting insects. So for the first time in 10 years I didn't have to smother nuclear strength Deet Aftershave all over my body to stop a concerted mosquito attack.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "paper11", "ReviewID": "UR15738745", "Content": "We just got back from this resort and we are talking about going again already.

Nearly every person we talked to, whether it was at different restaurants, outside, at the front desk etc. seemed genuinely happy and more than willing to answer any questions we had. Many members of the staff seemed to go out of there way to help. From the moment we got there, the staff outside were Very friendly. The first thing we did was eat lunch at an outside cafe and the waiter we had was Very nice. Later we had dinner and sat outside on the patio and listened to live music and our waitress was extremely nice and helpful. Another day, we went to the kid's play room that they have and the young woman there was one of the friendliest people I have ever met. Another day, we didn't get our roomed cleaned and someone came by to make sure we didn't need anything. We didn't, but it was nice that someone came by to ask. Another night, we had dinner at Roy's restaurant and the service was Excellent. We have a little one who has a few food restrictions due to allergies and they went out of their way to find her a dessert that she could eat (that came free with her meal) even after we told them it wasn't a big deal. Our little one loved the dessert! When we booked our vacation it came with a credit and room upgrade. The front desk was great at helping to make sure that we actually got these. The room was Great! We had a huge tub and stand up shower and a private balcony that we could sit on and listen to the live music each night. GREAT!!! We loved that. The entire resort was clean and the interior decorating throughout was beautiful. I appreciated all the of the details and decor everywhere. In your room you are also given a, \"What's going on today\" sheet that tells you everything you can participate in which is really nice. If I had to point out a few things that were not positive, there aren't many. There are many birds that fly around so there is a good number of bird droppings by the pool area and at least on the balcony that we had. But, you can walk around these. It doesn't take away at how beautiful the resort is and at how great the landscaping is. It's really beautiful. Although there is a lazy river, which is great fun and relaxing, if you have someone with you that cannot swim or isn't a strong swimmer, I wouldn't let them out of your sight. My husband, literally helped save a woman from drowning. She went up and down in and out of the water a couple times splashing around and when we realized she needed help, she had just went under water again and didn't resurface for many seconds with one hand sticking out of the water until my husband jumped in from the other side and got to her and pulled her out of the water. There was a lifeguard nearby, but I think she must not have seen her. Also, I think there are spots that the lifeguards cannot see and although the water isn't deep, it's moving and for someone who cannot swim well, it's easy to panic and slip which is what I think happened to this woman. Thankfully, she is ok. Also, I did have a couple drinks by the pool that were a little spendy that were not very good that I didn't finish, but then my husband and I both ordered a couple smoothies that we were delicious.

The room was definitely one of the nicer rooms we have been in. Everything was very clean and updated. Our room had a small patio area that overlooked a water with a fountain. My husband is in sales and stays in hotel rooms across the country every week. He was impressed with the both the room and bathroom. The grounds of the hotel are spectacular. We found something new to explore every day we were there. We didn't find the pools to be too crowded. There are a variety of locations to sit at and enjoy the pools and waterfalls. We found the lazy river a nice place to sit near since it kept people moving by and not constantly splashing or yelling right in your face. There were also other locations through out the pool area that were quiet and relaxing just to sit and listen to the water falls.

The staff, at all times, were friendly and helpful - even the young men working the valet service (although it is my understanding that they are contracted by the hotel). Upon check-in, my request for a king bed was immediately satisfied, despite the two large conferences going on there that week. My room overlooked the \"Isle of Capri.\" The grounds were immaculate. On occasion I did see some trash but with all of the kids about, that is to be expected. On the subject of the grounds, I have uploaded some photos I took while there. If you are into birding, you'll see several species that have taken up residence at the resort, including Verdin, Gambel's quail, Cactus wren, Kildeer and Curve-billed thrashers, along with the usual Mourning doves, House sparrows, Mallards and Great-tailed grackles. I didn't expect to see rabbits on the grounds (I'm from the east coast) but they were everywhere and allowed me to get close enough for some nice pictures. The children at the resort loved seeing the \"bunny rabbits.\" The room was very clean and I was pleased to discover a 37\" flat-screen TV upon arrival. There was also a user-programmable safe and a mini-fridge. The mini-fridge was split in two down the middle, with the left side locked (where the booze, etc. was located) and the right side unlocked. A key to the fridge was offered at check-in. The bed was VERY comfortable and the A/C unit cooled the room down quickly when asked of it. The bathroom had a marble counter and included a tub and a glass-enclosed shower, at opposite ends of the room. Hot water was almost immediate, at any time. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant since food was provided at the conference. Whoever catered the event did a fantastic job, with the helpful, friendly staff and delicious food. (I only add this to my review in case the hotel was somehow connected with the catering.) Smoking is not permitted in any of the rooms but ashtrays are provided upon request for balcony use. For those interested in shopping at the nearby Desert Ridge Mall, the hotel provides a free shuttle service, with departures every 30 minutes from the hotel entrance. There is an Albertson's grocery store at the mall (with an attached liquor section) as well as a CVS and Target, for any of your needs.

This is my second stay at this hotel, last was 2 years ago for 3 nights. First, let me say I am a Gold Member of the Rewards program and am a loyal patron. That being said, I was dissapointed not to be treated like one. One week before check-in I requested a room overlooking the Desert Botanical Garden. I did this knowing that the rooms facing the pool are quite loud at times. I was told I had an \"upgraded view room\". Upon check-in I was given a room with \"two over-sized Queens\" according to the front desk. Queens?? These are full beds and I am with my wife of nearly 15 years on vacation. Possibly we could have a King bed? Oh yes, and the room is on the 2nd floor overlooking...the pool. I called front desk immediately to let them know this was not satisfactory. They took my cell number and told me they would call when they had another room available. The time marched on until about 3:30. At this point, I was concerned they would have filled their rooms. I went to the front desk and found they only had 2 rooms left in the hotel. Unreal. They were a King on ground floor (I always request high floors, but apparently having that information in your Elite reservation status is just for one's own personal information) and another double/double room overlooking the Botanical Garden. I took the double/double begrudgingly as it least it had a decent view. By the way, no offer to help move my luggage...nice touch. Room we finally setlled in was standard for the resort. Nice view of mountains, botanical garden and....720 people from Bacardi on two mornings having breakfast. Now I dont begrudge the hotel for making money on corporate events, but they need a better system to make those on vacation not feel inconvenienced by these events. My inconvenience came at 3:30 AM on my 2nd night there when the staff started setting up the buffets, etc. Having come to AZ for the weather, I had my sliding glass door open. Ahhhh, the relaxing sounds of golf carts backing up (beep, beep, beeep) and rattling dishes, clanking glasses. Now, every day you get a sheet in your room with activities for the resort. Basically, this doesn't change form day to day. My suggestion? Put the events and location of events on their as a \"heads-up\" to the vacationing resort guests so they know if they should keep their door shut so as not to be awoken at 3:30 AM. Another thought, work it out with the corporation to give those in rooms overlooking their event a small gift. It would go a long way. Lastly, let's talk about litter. The grounds are mainly immaculate. This ends in the common areas outside, especially at the pools (SPA pool is worth the money). I know there are a huge number of people that traffic these areas, but the resort doesn't seem to know this. They need many more staff to clean up througout the day. Cups, straws, etc were everywhere. Part of the blame lay on the guests. Some of whom didn't make any effort to clean up after themselves. On the other hand, I shouldn't be swimming in a pool with empty cups at the bottom (at least 1 every day I was there). Also, as I was walking back to my room after a day at the pool and I noticed something striking. There was a sugar packet on the lawn as well as a piece of plastic. I saw 2 Marriott employees, one was dressed as a manager. I thought this will be interesting to see if they stop to pick up this trash. The answer? They walked right by. Marriott, train your employees to have pride in the resort surroundings. This is unacceptable. One last piece of advice: get some new chaise lounges out at the main pool. A number of them look like you got them from a garage sale. People are paying over $500 a night at this time of year for chairs like this?

Great location but will not travel in March it is Spring Break and no matter where you travel whether beach or ski there will be plenty of kids about. I was suprised no one mentioned the vacation club time shares. Do not show interest when traveling past the time share desks because I did and not only had 3 separate voicemail messages on my room phone but also had a flyer put on my door so unless you are truly interested in their 90 min presentation steer clear. This hotel is located across from Desert Ridge Marketplace one of the cleanest outside shopping malls I have visited, it is not high end stores but has most everything moderate and they do provide a shuttle pick up from Desert Ridge. The rooms are some of the cleanest and the housekeeping staff very friendly. The pools were crowded due to the month of travel but there are several and they do clear out at 5:00 pm and since it is still very nice outside that is a great time for adults to attend. The restaurants are priced average for a hotel in this category. The room service prices are steep for breakfast so we went across to Mimi's or Paradise Bakery. Be prepared to walk alot, if you like to be near the pool or golf please ask to be near those areas. The nightly turndown service provides a schedule of activities for the next day, this is the first time I have seen a Segway tour offered. Overall a very pretty setting, quiet and very clean rooms. free parking, paid laundry room. As long as you like yellow and gold tones you will not be disappointed.

Since we had an early morning flight, we had requested early check-in in advance. We knew it might or might not be available but we were happy to learn on arrival that our room was ready and it was only a little past 9:00 a.m. We had also requested a high floor in advance and we were given a room on the 5th floor (top floor) that overlooked the lagoon, golf course and mountains in the distance - very quiet and relaxing on the balcony. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. I have read other reviews complaining about the size of the room. We had a \"regular\" king room and there was a desk and chair, loveseat, coffee table, armoire and still plenty of room. I peeked in a room with 2 queens (or doubles) and it looked a little more cramped. So if a king bed suits your needs, you will find it more spacious. The bathroom was huge - separate tub and shower and large vanity. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating. The concierge made three dinner reservations for us, gave advice on activities we might enjoy, and printed out our boarding passes on the day of our check-out . Breakfast at the Blue Sage was great - good food and fast service - we ate outdoors each morning. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel so can't comment on that. Even though the hotel was full, the only place that seemed crowded was at the pool. It was somewhat of a chore to find a chair each day. Lots of chair-saving going on, even though the hotel says this is against their policy. However, the beverage service at the pool was fine. I forgot my pool wrist bracelet twice but this was not a problem - I had my room key and was not asked to go back to get the bracelet. I appreciate the staff's diligence in keeping outsiders out of the pool in order to keep it available for guests - this is common practice at other nice resorts. The spa was a real treat! It was expensive but in line with what other spas charge. I think when you travel at spring break, it takes a good attitude to have a great time and enjoy your vacation.

We felt the service was so so, no one is too friendly out there.

Maybe the belief is \"you're here to be lazy, if you want to sweat, go to Bally's\" The equipment was in bad condition and it just wasn't a good facility. The health club requires you to walk outside to get there (bad move). The pools were beautiful with a lazy river and walking path along side. The hotel is pretty isolated, but it is located in a relatively nice area with a huge shopping complex and strip mall within walking distance. We always ate dinner offsite at one of the restaurants, so I didn't have a chance to eat at the Resort. My wife said the Spa was first class and thought the prices were reasonable. There is also a golf course on the grounds (it's Phoenix). I would stay here again, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice in the Phoenix area. I've stayed in much better rooms for less money and better looking places.

Marriott, I truly looked forward to my visit at the Desert Ridge property. Unfortunately, the overall experience could best be described as \u201cunimpressive\u201d. Arriving at the J.W. Marriott Desert Ridge, I found the expansive entrance to be very fitting of a quality property. Check-in was fairly quick and efficient even though I showed up about two hours before their scheduled check-in time. It was possible that I might have been a little lucky since the person ahead of me was telling his friend that he was not able to check-in yet because his room was not ready. My room was on the 5th of 6 floors which did fulfill my request for a \u201chigh floor\u201d from my online reservation. The room was nicely appointed although the room itself seemed a little small based on my expectations. The king-size bed had an ample supply of pillows and included two side tables with lamps. The room also had a small loveseat with coffee table as well as a small work desk. The armoire had an approximately 29 inch conventional television as well as a mini-bar which required a key to access the contents. The bathroom had a nice amount of marble and was visually appealing. Basically, there were no major problems with my stay, however, there were numerous minor ones that left me unimpressed. To start with, my shower was apparently missing some silicone caulking near its base which produced about a 4 foot puddle by the time I was done with my shower. The next day while getting ready for a meeting, there was no hot water available. I called down to the front desk and was informed that a pipe burst earlier and that there would not be any hot water for an hour. I certainly understand that pipes can burst, but that did not help me get ready for my meeting! The health club is quite mediocre by most current standards. There are around ten elliptical/treadmill machines. The equipment itself looked a little worn out. While working out in the morning, there were no special items placed in the room such as apples or bottles of water. The fitness center itself is about 100 yards from the closest point to the hotel building and requires you to walk outside to get there. I found that a little irritating since it was only around 40 degrees F each morning when I went to workout. The pools appeared quite nice and included a lazy river system. Unfortunately, the weather was just a little too cold to enjoy it! Another minor irritation is that I found the noise insulation in my room to be mediocre at best. Every evening from 6-10 PM a duo would be playing music on the ground floor of the atrium. Well, that basically negated any ability to get a good night\u2019s sleep before 10 PM as my door and walls would vibrate to the music even though I was on the 5th floor! I probably should have requested a room change, but I guess I just did not care enough (it was reminiscent of the noise in my room at college). The upkeep of my room was a little variable as well. One day the maid failed to replace the plastic bag in the ice bucket. Another day, she forgot to dispose of the garbage in one of the garbage cans. The maid service itself was performed as late as 4 PM on one of the days which I think is a little too late. The hotel is located in a relatively nice area with a huge shopping complex within walking distance. One of the subtle downsides of the hotel is that it seems much more geared for conventioneers than vacationers. Everywhere you turn there seems to be a person with their nametag attached to a lanyard around their neck. I did not eat at any of the restaurants but did enjoy several of the catered meals, presumably prepared by the J.W, at my conference. Other minor issues included the toiletries which were marked as \u201cMade in China\u201d. I found that a little surprising considering most \u201cnicer\u201d hotels/resorts certainly try to make exclusive toiletries for their guests. Also, there was no DVD player in the room which would have been nice. I wrestled on whether giving this J.W. Marriott three, or four stars. I ended up with four as a compromise that is was not great but not average either. I doubt I would bring my family here for a vacation, but would not mind it for a convention.

It is a beautiful, well maintained resort. We weren't able to use the pools or tour the grounds because we were there during a two day heavy rain event (1.5 inches) - unusual for the desert setting. The resort is huge. The map that guests are given is one dimensional for a multi-dimensional facility. We've used maps to travel extensively but this map wasn't helpful. Even the desk clerk was confused by it and indicated the wrong wing for our room location. Since it was pouring outside we decided to use the fitness center but we never found it. The map didn't indicate how to access it and three staff members (two in suits and one in a uniform) that we asked didn't know either. One suited staff person finally told us how to get there but it was down a walkway outsde the hotel - in the pouring rain. It seemed really odd that there was no way to access the fitness center from inside the building. Adjacent to the resort is a Marriott time share facility which looks very nice. At the J.W. there are people trying to sell you a time share tour but they aren't pushy about it. The time shares have access to the J.W. restaurants and pools, although they have their own, so it could be a pleasant place to spend a week. We ate at the Tuscany Restaurant. The service and the food were excellent. The ambiance was very pleasant. It's an upscale restaurant geared toward adults. I wouldn't bring children to it. As usual at Marriott resorts, it was pricey but not outrageous and worth it for a special treat. Even with a few glitches the J.W. was a beautiful resort.

Upon arrival, we checked in and were given a room on the 6th floor overlooking the botanical gardens, golf course and distant mountains. There was a small table and two chairs on the balcony. The room was clean and we had plenty of towels for our use. The shower stall tiles were a bit slippery and uneven. The beds were comfy and we had our choice of four pillows, two each of foam and feather. The ice machine was down the hall in an enclosed area and the free laundy (including detergent) was on the 4th floor. The only suggestion I would have is a screen for the sliding glass door. Coming from New England, I would have loved to keep the screen door closed and let the desert breeze in during the night. Staff in both the shops and restaurants were accommodating and gracious. The buffet breakfast is very expensive but there is a good variety. Lunch was busy but not a long wait - about 20 minutes. I put my name in coming back from the pool and went up to the room to change. When I came back, my table was waiting. Note there is a mall around the corner from this property and the hotel offers a free shuttle bus. There are restaurants, grocery store and a CVS there. Stock up on snacks and soda at these stores. We bought a case of water at CVS for the cost of a bottle at the Marriott. The grounds are beautiful and the lazy river was relaxing. I didn't have time to try the other pools but there were only a few people in one of the four other pools. The lobby area throughout the day and night was very busy and the the downstairs lobby bar area was very noisy in the evening. As mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel caters to a lot of meetings and conventions. However, every staff member greeted us with a smile. The concierge gave us great maps - better than Hertz. There is an onsite Hertz rental car service at the hotel which we used. Book ahead of time and be prepared to wait to get your car - it was about 30-40 minutes for us to get the keys for the vehicle.

I am going to try to give some traveler some tips that will be helpful. We were flying in from out of state and needed an early check in. The hotel had agreed to this prior. We arrived at the hotel at 10 am (yes..i know...early). So, the room was not ready and we were fine with this. We checked our bag in and went to the pool. The pool was not anything great. The service was below average and we finally went to the bar to get our own drinks and food. AFter that, we never saw a waitperson again (or one that would actually do something). AFter flying and laying at the pool, i checked back in with the front desk at 1 (no room), 2 (no room), etc...finally my BF was mad and talked to the manager. Apparentely my boyfriend had booked a suite and the last peope had checked out late. We downgraded to a normal room just to check in. That kind of sucked for us looking for a much needed vacation. I found there to be tons of Marriott employees who walk around and smile and act helpful...but they are NOT helpful. It is like a bunch of robots walking around with fake shells. We ordered room service that night b/c we were exhausated and needed rest. The food came in a reasonable amount of time and the staff was fine. 20% gratutity was already added to our bill so we did not feel the need to tip her twice (i know we all have different opinions on this). The staff person left our room and CALLED us, asking why we had not tipped her?? Can you imagine?? We also did not receive housecleaning during our stay which i think is a nice hotel faux pas. Here is my big tip. Go to the adjacent spa. It is the best that i have ever been to. The staff are wonderful and the deep tissue massages are to die for (ask for susana). AFter the massage, you have access to the relaxing sauna, jacuzzi, etc and it is so relaxing. The spa has it's own pool away from the hotel that is A+. Very small, cushioned chairs, excellent food/beverage service,etc. Go the spa, get a treatment and stay there! Forever. Go to Spa pool and do not look back at the crummy Marriott pool. This hotel is designed for familes and for business travelers. There are conferences going on everywhere and there is no room for just the vacationer. It is a stressful feeling and everyone is walking around with conference badges. I was not impressed by anything but the spa. However, Roy's restaurant in the hotel is good and i would eat there again.

The hotel is magnificent! The on-premises \"lazy river\" was on par with anything you'd find at a commercial water park (except much better - just a short walk from your hotel room). The service was really good. The only reason I hesitated in a 5-star rating is that we had a few housekeeping issues (conditioner vs. hand lotion). Unfortunately, the cleaning crew put a bottle of hand lotion in the shower and my wife used a glob of it on her hair! We had a few calls with management but they followed up and we resolved the issue amicably. Then, the next day, we had a few more, minor issues with towels, etc.. Again, we spoke with management and resolved the issue. - I'm not usually a nitpicker or complainer, but these little things, when added up, can be quite annoying. Anyway, that's the only reason I held off on the 5-stars. Otherwise, the staff was extremely friendly, pleasant and helpful. I used the \"Vacation Planner\" services, ahead of my stay, for booking a Grand Canyon tour with DeTours.Com. Which, by the way, was an awesome experience! Highly recommended! A bit more pricey (for a family of 4) than renting a car and going about it yourself, but, believe me, it's a bit of a haul, and you won't come anywhere close to the entertainment and learning value of going with an experienced guide. In our case, that was \"Bernie\". He was great. We were also convinced to take the Maverick helicopter tour over/inside the canyon. That was an additional $232 per head and not an expense I had planned - but, again, highly recommended! - Anyway, the free vacation planning service offered by the resort was great! Use it! I also used the \"matching\" services of the Tennis Center, to find either other guests or local/community residents for a game. They found me a great partner from the community. Unfortunately, for me, I had to stop playing after the first set. The Pheonix sun was simply too much to be reckoned with (and this was at 8am)! Though I was keeping hydrated, I felt I was simply overheating. Didn't want to risk having to leave the resort in an ambulance ;-) I think evening play would have been a better choice (or at least doubles, where you don't have to work as hard). As you may have read in other posts, the food was kind of pricey. But, the phrase \"you get what you pay for\" does apply. The $12 Cobb salad could easily serve 3-4 people. The $10 Kokopelli Colada was extremely tasty and plentiful. I had breakfast at the Blue Sage restaurant on my first day and took advantage of the $21 buffet. Everything was absolutely delicious! Other days, we simply bought bagels or breakfast pasteries at either Starbucks (on premises) or the little counter outside Blue Sage. That wasn't so bad (pricey). I did not have dinner at any of the hotel restaurants, but, my friend (who was attending a trade show there) did have dinner at Roy's with a client. He absolutely LOVED his dinner there and highly recommends the restaurant. Finally, having read other readers' posts, I went ahead and booked a limo for our trip to/from the airport. As opposed to using SuperShuttle at $20/head ($80 in my case for a family of 4), I conducted an Internet search and chose \"First Class Executive Limo\" due to their (Barry's) quick and personal response. The experience was excellent! My kids were impressed with the driver holding up our name as we arrived at the airport (which, by the way, was about 90 minutes later than planned). The driver, Mary, was very friendly and patient. The car was a 2007 Town Car - spotlessly clean and absolutely beautiful! Barry kept all my charges on the credit card, including gratuity, and I didn't have to deal with having correct change, etc. It certainly was a \"first class\" experience at an almost 20% savings in cost! What can I say. This was, absolutely, the best facility in which I've stayed/vacationed. I don't normally like to vacation in the same spots (variety is the spice of life) but, believe you me, if I come back to the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Sedona area, I would absolutely return to the JW Desert Ridge!

Rooms were very pleasant - all had balconies - and nicely decorated, if just a little lacking in table/ storage space -no drawers of any consequence, and one large table.

Pay the $25 to valet park your car...the free parking lot is quite a hike in the heat. The hotel appears to be less than 5 years old, up to date, and well-appointed. The lobby is beautiful with water fountians that add much-needed moisture to the dry desert air. I loved the complimentary ice water and iced tea in the lobby - it was great after arriving from the heat outside. Check in was easy and the front desk staff were pleasant. All requests made via phone to the \"Marriott at Your Service\" desk were met promptly and accurately. (I requested additional face cloths and hangers). The \"Marriott at Your Service\" staff made follow-up calls to my room to ensure my requests had been adequately satisfied - a nice touch! My room had 2 beds because a King room was not available at the time I made my reservation. I moved to a King room for the last night of my stay. The King room is the same size as the double, but with more room to move around in due to there being one less bed. Both of my rooms faced out towards the \"Lazy River\" and pool, but the windows/walls were thick enough that I couldn't hear noise from those enjoying themselves outside. The bathroom was stocked with nice \"upgraded\" Artifact toilietries, not the usual Marriott items. The bathroom was pretty, but strange in that it had a small, glass-enclosed stand-up shower with separate bathtub. This was a meaningful detail to me because it is next to impossible to shave your legs in the shower...no place to put your foot up. The bathroom also had a strange absence of towel bars. My least favorite thing about the room was the fact that the carpet left my bare feet dirty, even though it looked clean. Yuck! The convention rooms were nice and it was fabulous to have a Starbucks on the property. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the Lazy River, but I heard lots of good things about it. My biggest complaint about this property was that it was very understaffed at a time when there were more than 3 conventions going on at the same time, especially in the evenings. For example, there was only one cocktail server working in the lobby lounge (at times there were more than 50 guests in the lounge) in the evenings and she nastily told everyone who arrived to \"get in line at the bar\". The line at the bar was so long that it took a minimum of 25 minutes to get a drink. The hotel has a complimentary shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to the shopping center across the street. In the 110+ degree heat, we were glad we didn't have to walk over. I ate lunch at the Blue Sage (very good chicken quesadilla prepared the \"traditional\" way our server suggested, not the strange inside-out way described on the menu). We also had brunch at the Blue Sage on Sunday. The brunch buffet was a zoo, so we ordered off the menu. When our items took more than a 20 minutes to arrive, our server suggested that we get some fruit from the buffet to enjoy until our entrees arrived.

After reviewing this property online, and knowing Marriott's trademark of exceptional service we were looking forward to our 5 day stay at this fairly new property. Both couples stayed in Standard King rooms at $549 per night. Upon Thursday afternoon check in, our room was on the 3rd floor, directly above the main driveway/valet enterence. With this rate, the noise and traffic which included 3 buses were a surprise. The bellboy was assuring us these were the last bus arrivals for the day. As he spoke, 2 more could be seen approaching. Our request for another room was not immediately remedied, but an hour later we were told we could move, but we would be very far from each other. We still agreed after realizing the distance was most extreme! There are 950 rooms here so we were off to Egypt on our own, no offer of assistance. We laughed this off as glad to have the opportunity to be removed from the driveway noise and fumes. Later we met our friends in the huge and most beautiful lobby and waited forever on the patio to be acknowledged and served drinks. We decided to move inside and found a spot near the bar so our husbands could serve us rather than die on the vine. The people watching was fabulous tho- Obviously lots going on. A reception was queing up before entering their poolside designation. We noticed an entire outdoor common area had been roped off- and this was the beginning of how things were going to go - removing pool areas, lawn areas, patio areas for convention meals, receptions, MLB club members and special events. The \"vacationer's\" space got smaller and smaller as the weekend proceeded. All the pool's furniture filled up in the early morning either with bodies or \"saved\" with books and towels. Poolside service was very stressed, and there were long waits to order- and to receive orders. We watched as other guests lost patience and learned that the management had no time for regular duties as they followed up with personal apologies. I have no idea why they were so short-staffed, as the complex is designed to serve the masses. Perhaps that is the downfall, as the staff did not seem to enjoy or handle their positions under stress and there is no excuse for runnng it understaffed. We dined at Tuscany, it was fabulous and here the staff knew how to treat and please their guests and allowed us to feel like we were in Europe where it is impolite to hurry the guest along or present an unrequested check. This was our favorite meal of the entire trip! Roy's was a great environment, on patio outside. The food was also good but you will have to pay to get any amount of it, salads and accompaniments are separate. Their location is more visual to the \"hotel masses\" and here we knew that our table was \"scheduled\" for another reservation behind us. Reservations are a must, suggest later dining to avoid being rushed. The onsite Starbuck's had huge lines all mornings and usually ran out of breakfast items and popular ingredients before we got up. The hotel was full the entire time we were there, not just the weekend. We went to the spa on 2 different days: peds and manis on one visit, maggages the other. Never have we paid more for salon services, but were happy to have the use of the spa included which isn't always the norm for pedi/mani services. The massages were excellent but construction was underway next to the pool, tractors and alot of dirt and dust aloft along with the noise. There are many spas in the Phoenix area and this one dosen't come close to the atmosphere or relaxation available at JW Marriott's Camelback Inn - there is where you will find spa bliss! Our husbands golfed on site - very expensive for the quality - they are used to the Trune courses in Arizona and there is no comparrison except in fees. We were certainly paying enough and know what the resort experience should be. After a few days of not being treated as JW Marriott guest's reputation holds, we managed to get rooms in JW's nearby \"real resort\" Camelback Inn. This property is much older and smaller - but if you are expecting service and an relaxing atmosphere you will be treated as the most important guest that you deserve to be and would expect when staying at a resort. The Desert Ridge is a Convention Complex. All the amenities are a huge bonus and a great addition to the convention experience, resulting in positive reviews from the business traveler, and a huge dissappointment to the vacationeer! I shouldn't close without mentioning the middle of the night fire drill. The continued blaring sirens emptied bathrobed guests into hallways. I felt horrible for the parents of wailing children but the worst of it was that there was no communication. Remember, our rooms were at the farthest point, Egypt, and it was a hike with and without use of elevators towards the lobby. Since this turned out to be a false alarm it was unfortunate that staff did not send runners or use the PA system to explain the situation. They did record and deliver a phone message hours later that blamed the incident on a guest, suggesting that he was drunk in the bar and pulled down on an alarm. I don't like to quote over used phrases, but when we left the Desert Ridge I said to my friend, \"Been here, Done that, Won't be back.\"", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "StarBellySneetch", "ReviewID": "UR7762044", "Content": "When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that the parking lot was located kind of far away, but decided to just deal with it and make the long treck to our room.

Scrub and wrap combo was a good bang for the buck but massage seemed to be given by a newbie....Same with Roy's- I have eaten at 2 diff. Roy's locations and this staff was not up to par at all...food was excellent as always though. It seemed much of staff might have been college students on break for the summer or ?? Huge convention while we were there but not bothersome at all. Pools were awesome and lazy river was nice even for adults.... While we were expecting it to be HOT in May, it was 102....pitchers of ice water by the pool and lobby were nice ...cement and stone by the pool scorching your bare feet- not nice. Pluses of the property is that the food at ALL of the restaurants on site was wonderful-we tried them all. Room service, too. Mini bar prices were actually fairly reasonable for a property like this. Live music and patio area were perfect and drink prices were average. It was a nice relaxing weekend for a decent price (for room)and almost everything went well, but if youre paying for the details to be taken care of at a fancy schmancy place like this, you want all the i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed....service just needs more \"polishing\".", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cUnreal Experience\u201d", "Author": "NaptownTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7634204", "Content": "You know that commercial where the weary business traveler goes to check in and the first thing the front desk does is say, \"I'm sorry, it appears we have overbooked your room. We have another room it is on a different floor,\" and the exhausted and exasperated guy says, \"Fine,\" and the next scene is him walking into the type of suite in \"Ocean's Twelve\"? You know the kind of suite you picture Julia Roberts getting? Weeeeellllll.... That's not exactly what happened to us. Okay, that's exactly what happened. We got the most pimped out suite I had ever seen! We really did not expect much because we had gotten a time share presentation invitation from Northwest WorldPerks. My wife and I were considering a timeshare, and maybe a temporary relocation to the PHX area for a year (while a friend rented our house from us, our jobs are in demand anywhere in the US, and thus our friend indirectly pays for PHX apartment), so we were intrigued, but we did not expect much for $75/night. Well it turned out after our \"Great AZ Road Trip,\" which I chronicled under my review of the Comfort Inn Camp Verde, I was actually prepared to pay big $$$ for an upgrade. After all it was our third anniversary and I wanted to live how the other half does, at least for a few days. Well did not have to shell out for the upgrade thanks to the large Honeywell conference that took about 99.4 percent of the hotel and bumped me into a suite. Now this was no ordinary suite... Noooooo. We walk into gleaming marble foyer, with the most detailed closet with ample drawer space and plush robes. On the left is the bathroom with: Double vanity; Everything you could think to need in little baskets underneath on the shelves; A completely marble tub and seperate marble shower big enough for two and surrounded by glass; Seperate powder room with a phone in it!!!!; And marble that goes 3/4 up all the walls. Go past the bathroom and into the room (that was at least two regular Marriott suites in one) and there was: A huge TV with a nice interactive menu hidden in the TV armoire; Two bookshelves with actual books I would want to read (of course JW Marriott's book was there as well); Two leather \"Lazy boy\" chairs; Leather couch: Solid wood desk with a computer and internet; Large dining/board room table with eight chairs; Large wet bar (about double the size of most hotel wet bars); Mini-fridge (always how you get in my book of favorites): Safe; And king-size Murphy Bed with memory foam mattress with soft white linens. The wife and I laughed ourselves silly for about two hours and called everyone we knew. Mind you we're on vacation and people are wondering why were calling them so late (PHX was three hours behind at that time because it was Indpls's first year on EDT.) Then we got scared that they might make us move, but that never happened. They probably wouldn't but we left our do not disturb sign out 24/7 just in case. I experienced nothing but first class service while there, but then again, I wasn't really trying to get much other than a tan and tall drink. Ate in the steak restaurant once and service was above average. Expensive pool side drinks, but convenient and very tasty... er, effective! Time share presentation was very pleasant until they told me that unless I write a check for $X,0000 right then, I'd have to finance through them to buy... and the interest is 14.9%! Are you kidding me?!?! I could've bought it at 0.9% on my MC right then, but they don't take plastic. Dumb. Killed it right there and we were going to buy one. He did give us a $100 Marriott certificate though - applied it to a free steak dinner in one of their five restaurants! I had a very good filet, but it's not Sullivans. Scenery is 2nd to none. Our room overlooked a courtyard full of wonderful vegetation. My wife enjoyed here morning strolls before it got above 90 degrees. If I was an advid golfer there is no way I would miss a few rounds out here. Especially since you can sometimes get the Jack Rabbits to go after your partners ball. The only way this place would be better is if it was in Sedona, but you wouldn't want this place there because it would make Sedona too commercialized. The hotel was full of people bt did not feel crowded. The main guests with the deep pockets were Honeywell, but unlike some of the other reviews, I did not feel ignored. Housekeeping to valet, to regular attendants were courteous and acknowledged me before I had even made eye contact sometimes. The gentlman working at FedEx Kinkos was gracious enough to waive the internet fee because I was just on for literally two minutes. I think it would cost him more in his time to ring up 78 cents. Parking is a nice walk across some HOT blacktop, but I will take 115 degree heat over Indiana winter anyday. Water is something that is sold everywhere here so you're thirst is not far from relief but make sure that you are drinking water BEFORE you are thirsty. A smart tip is to go the grocery store in the shopping area across from the resort and just get a twenty four case of water. You will even appreciate warm water when it's 115 Farenheit. Pools are exceptional, but get towels early or bring your own. When I was there they were asking for hotel keys for towels, which is smart because there seemed to be some locals there who probably are not paying for these amenities. The place is so large there is not much that staff could do to keep them out. Did not utilize the spa, but definitely considered it seriously. Did a lot of exploring of PHX. Old Town Scottsdale is great. They are still building around Scottsdale and the free bus service is great, especially if you want to find a free place to park and then ride around town to several points including Scottsdale's amazing mall! The only other place I though to compare is the mall near Waikiki, but Scottsdale's mall was indoors and Hawaii's mall outdoors. Lot's of great mom and pop restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Wanted to try them all! Overall, I had the most enchanting experience in PHX and the JW Marriott was the crowning jewel. I hope to go back several times over my lifetime. Maybe one day I will retire there at the ripe old age of 51. Hmmm... Early retirement plan...Maybe I could be Ocean's Thirteenth - Doh!

If you have small kids-DO NOT STAY AT THIS PROPERTY! Page down to the Bad & Ugly for more details. The Good: beautiful landcape scenery, outdoor speakers w/ soothing music playing everywhere, tranquil water features, attractively designed rooms/suites, complimentary laundry facility. Tuscany Restaurant and great live music( 2 guys in their 40's)Complimentary mountain bikes. Allison at Tennis Center is a gem! Fitzroy, and red hair German waitress at Blue Sage are super nice as well. Lots of pools. The Bad: Black mold & mildew in every corner and grout line of the adjoining room's shower. Filthy bathroom floor covered in hairs upon checkin. Housekeeping overall was lax for such a $$$resort. Stopped into the \"Revive Spa\" the 1st day to make an appt. for a $125.00 skin scrub for next morning. Made the mistake of taking one of my kids w/ me to make the appt. All of a sudden a man was standing over my child and I, motioning for us to leave. We had been in the spa reception area for all of 5 minutes!!! We were in the process of walking toward the door anyway. I wound up cancelling b/c I knew after being treated so rudely, I would not be able to \"revive\" there. Finally, the UGLY-and I mean UGLY: Beside shelling out a $$$$ money for the suite and joining room, we also decided to shell out even more for a passcard to the \"CLOUD ROOM\". They offered snacks, lite meals, drinks, web access, open bar. However, they just instituted a no kids allowed rule. That meant either parent having to go solo to the \"CLOUD \" while 8 yr old sat outside to help w/the carry out food; the other parent stayed in room w/other 2 kids. Never got to enjoy the view, or ambiance as advertised. Despite this, we understood and used our divide and conquer plan as mentioned above and were fine with it. Then there was the issue of me trying to take my totally asleep 2 yr old into the \"CLOUD\" room b/c my spouse w/other 2 kids were at the pool. I figured it would be ok since I was doing a quick snack run. I didn't think it was safe to leave her alone outside in the hall. Asleep toddler and I were 6 feet into the \"Cloud\" Room when \"on duty \" Cloud concierge person stopped me and tried to shoo me out b/c according to her, kids aren't allowed (though it is a family resort) and it's not fair to the other guests who can't bring their kids in. She spoke rather loudly, repeating herself and embarrassing me in front of the other 6-8 guests who were in there. Naturally I reacted and told her that it was ridiculous that I paid extra $$$ for the CLOUD Room, and that I couldn't stop in for 2 minutes to grab a few things to bring back to our rooms. Not once did she offer to stand outside the Cloud room and watch my baby for the 2 minutes it would have taken. As I was leaving she got infront of me pushing the Cloud Room door wide open, for all the guests to see-more humiliation for me, and said \"I'm a momma too\". I turned to her w/ baby in stroller and said \" That's not the point \" but I didnt get to finish what I was saying to her, b/c one of the male guests came charging to the door and told me I was making a scene. Of course all he could see was upsetment on my face responding to her, and not the continued snipping she was doing to me. I am 5'7\", and the Cloud Concierge person was easily 5' 9\" , and the guy who charged at me was atleast 6'5\" tall. It was intimidating and scary to have these taller people standing over me in such an aggressive manner. And they did this to me w/ my toddler by my side. I wound up in tears at the front desk as my 8 yr & 6 yr old children walked up w/ their dad. It was awful. I didn't want to leave our suite and room after that, it ruined the last day & half of my trip. It also upset my kids to see me crying.

I never did find two other restaurants... this place is huge! You can also take a free shuttle to the nearby strip malls (very nice) to do some shopping and eating.

The staff at this place were really great. Very kind and attentive and willing to do whatever it took to make our stay enjoyable. There was a woman who was checking in when we were checking in and it turned out she was at the wrong JW in Phoenix, so the front desk attendant arranged to have one of the resort's town cars take her to the correct hotel so she didn't have to pay for yet another taxi. That's what I call great service! We picked this hotel for three reasons: 1 - lazy river/pool complex; 2 - spa (for me); 3 - golf (for hubby). If we were attending a conference, I might have given this resort a higher rating, but as a leisure hotel, it is only okay (especially given the high price). 1. The lazy river/pool was great, but a little on the cool side and always dirty with bugs and debris swirling right around the loop with you. Pool bar/cafe food was what I've come to expect from pool bar food - expensive and mediocre. 2. The spa environment was wonderful. The facilities were beautiful, peaceful and serene and the staff was okay. The massage I received was probably the worst I've ever had, and at $150 for 50 minutes, I was hugely disappointed. 3. I'm not a golfer, but my husband was pretty disappointed with the course he played (there are two and one was closed - unfortnately I can't remember which one he played). I guess it's the wrong time of year for golf in PHX, but still, for the price he expected a lot better. Our room was nice; bedding was heavenly. Shower pressure was terrible and so I called the front desk. Within an hour, maintenance had come, removed the old shower head, located and installed a new one and the pressure was much better. There was a cockroach in our room the first morning, but it was clearly on its last leg and was the only bug of any kind we encountered in our ground floor room.

The key item, as mentioned in other posts, is a faulty air conditioning system. The hallways smelled damp and musky. While the room A/C was better, it never cooled sufficiently or removed the humidity levels. Further, the pool area was awful.

Overall we had a great time, but there were some issues. We had a nice room... the beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was nice and had a separate shower, and there was a balcony with a small table and two chairs. However, although it was a step above the average room, it wasn't a very large or luxurious. The room service was reasonably priced and delivered quickly, which we liked, and had a kids menu for $6.50. The spa was incredible... my husband and I each had a massage there, and stayed for a few hours to lounge by the blissfully quiet, uncrowded spa pool and use the other services such as the steambath, jacuzzi, etc. The first issue was that the hallways were really hot and muggy. It seemed like they didn't air condition the hallways. It was a bit of a walk to get to our room, and by the time you got there you were sweaty and uncomfortable. The second issue is that they charged $20 a night for valet overnight parking. I can see that in a city, but we are talking the middle of the desert here. When we drove up to the main entrance, they asked us if we wanted to valet, and we said yes, and if we would be parking overnight, and we said yes (since we wouldn't be leaving the resort), but they didn't mention the $20 charge (until we saw it on the bill, LOL!) The third issue has to do with the pools. They advertise the pools as their big attraction during the summer. And while they were nice, they were REALLY crowded. All the chairs were taken (or at least they seemed to be taken, since there were towels on them), but no one seemed to actually be using them. If you asked a server how to get a chair, they said to get there early and put a towel on it, doh! We ended up just leaving our beach bag and clothes next to a bush every day we were there. Then, in order to get into the pool, you don't just need a key card, you need a one of those plastic bracelets that you clip on and it won't come off unless you cut it. I understand that it is to keep out non-guests, but they are uncomfortable if you have to wear them for 3 days (especially our 3 year old, who kept pulling on it). We cut ours off overnight, and when we asked for new ones at the front desk the next morning, they gave us a hard time about it. When we put them on the next time, we put them on ourselves so they were loose and we could pull them off. Don't let the front desk people put them on for you... they put them on REALLY tight. Then, if you want a pool towel, you have to give your room number (shouldn't the little bracelet be enough?). Its not like you can steal the towels, since there is a guard at the pool gate who makes you take them off from around your waist as you leave and put them in a hamper (not that we were trying to steal them, but our 3 year old was shivering and we wanted to just carry him to the room wrapped in the towel... and just leave the towel there for the housekeeping staff.) I was really worried the rest of the trip that they would charge me for the pool towels, since I checked them out one place with my room number, and returned them to the hamper on the way out. Then there is the lazy river, which is a ton of fun, IF you can get a tube. There is a limited number of tubes floating in the river, and you have to wait for one to become vacant to get one (the only thing you don't have to prove you are a guest to do, LOL!). However, people were hogging them, taking them back to their towel-draped chairs, using two to float instead of just one. It took about a half hour to find a tube for our 7 year old daughter to use to float. The kids also enjoyed the water slide, where they thankfully had a guard at the water slide line, so that there wasn't cutting/pushing/shoving. Also, the service at the pool left a lot to be desired. If you want service, you need to be at a chair and put up your flag, but there aren't enough chairs for the all the guests. My husband kept trying to wave down servers, then finally gave up and went to the restaurant and got us some drinks (not that it was a huge hardship, but it would be nice to be able to get cold drinks when it is over 100 degrees outside). Lastly, at one point they ran out of towels for about 30 minutes. You have to go to this centrally located ramada to get pool towels. On our last day I went with my daughter, soaking wet, to get some towels. They had run out. The attendant kept saying towels were coming, but they never came. At one point an official looking person came by to make sure the attendant REALLY meant there were no towels, and checked all the empty towel shelves to make sure they were REALLY empty, and then disappeared. After a long wait, we just gave up and walked back to our room wet. I think we would have enjoyed our stay more if it wasn't a holiday (Labor Day) and it wasn't so crowded, but the management should be able to anticipate when the hotel is full and plan accordingly (enough towels, enough servers, etc.) Also, they need to put some kind of system in place to ensure that people don't hog chairs and tubes.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cHad a great stay at the JW\u201d", "Author": "jmuemos", "ReviewID": "UR5760324", "Content": "I stayed at the JW Desert Ridge from August 27-31 with 6 other members of my company while attending an event they were hosting.

A gorgeous resort!!\u201d", "Author": "QCTrailrider", "ReviewID": "UR5759897", "Content": "My friend and I booked a Girlfriend's Getaway Spa Package for $289, which includes one night in a standard room, two 50 minute spa treatments (any ones you want), 2 Cosmopolitan drinks, 2 Starbuck's coffees, turndown service w/ 2 magazines, and a disposable camera. We changed it at the last minute to a regular Spa Getaway, which was almost the same package, but instead of the Cosmos, magazines, camera, and Starbuck's, we got 2 free breakfasts at Blue Sage, and paid $269. The resort is huge and very beautiful, with lush landscaping, gardens, water everywhere, lots of walking paths, several pools with a lazy river, and splash pad for the little kids. The spa is incredible, and mere descriptive terms do not do it justice. It must be experienced to be believed. It has a wonderful health food cafe that looks out onto a beautiful private lap pool lined with palm trees and private cabanas. There was never anyone using the pool, it seemed, and that was where we chose to spend the entirety of our second day. More on that later. Check-in was a breeze, and we got a ground floor room with double beds that overlooked a large portion of water and the Isle Of Capris. Very nice view. We were initially concerned about mosquitoes because of the proximity to water, but during our stay we didn't see one bug. The room was very nice, and the bathroom was large and well done. The only things I would change would be for the beds to be upgraded to Queen size, and I hated the sheets. They were very scratchy, and I expected that the hotel would have had softer linens. I have a very hard time sleeping in uncomfortable sheets, but the bed itself was very comfortable and had lots of pillows. The other issue I had was the way the A/C was set up. The vent was a large vertical space on the corner of one wall and only hit one bed, so one of us was hot all night and the other froze. I was glad for the big down comforter on the bed. We stayed Sunday to Monday, and on Sunday the pool was absolutely packed, but we had no trouble finding two chaises together. As soon as we even set down our bags a pool valet came up to us and gave us towels. As we sat down another pool valet appeared and gave us a pitcher of absolutely lovely filtered or bottled ice water, I'm not sure which. This was very good, because if any of you have tried drinking Phoenix tap water, it's really bad. But then we didn't see another server the entire time we were there, and we would have ordered something from the pool bar. The other review is correct in saying that some of the crowd definitely was being overserved alcohol and got pretty loud and obnoxious. We also saw one guy who was pretty raucous spill his entire drink into the lazy river. I was not impressed that you have to pay extra to get a raft to float around the lazy river, though there seemed to always be a few floating around that you could appropriate when someone left the pool. We didn't spend time at the other pools except to walk around and see what they were like, and they were nice, if set a bit close together. I loved the splash pad for the little kids which consisted of a big area with 6 deck jets aimed at the middle, and about 1/4 inch of water on the pad. No chance of drowning there! The restaurants are very expensive, though there were several to choose from with quite a bit of variety, we chose to eat at the nearby shopping center which had many more reasonably priced options. We did have our free Blue Sage breakfast, which was nothing to write home about, and arrived almost cold. We did have the option of the breakfast buffet, but we ordered off the menu. The servers will push the blue corn pancakes and say they are to die for. We thought they were pretty gross. The spa treatments were well done, and the staff was very professional. There is a required 20% tip added on to each treatment that is payable before the service, which is nice because you don't have to bother trying to carry cash around in your robe. The amenities in the spa were wonderful, and they offer everything. The layout is a teensy bit confusing and even though I spent 2 days there I still kept getting lost. On a side note, anywhere you go and anywhere you sit you will have something beautiful to look at. The hotel takes their theme of earth-water-wind-fire very seriously and incorporates into every aspect of the grounds and decor. It is just beautiful there, and I will stay longer next time and take more advantage of what the resort has to offer. Moving on, parking is $18 or 20 a day through valet. I recommend self parking, which is a little bit of a hike, but the walk to the front door is spectacular all along the way, and with everything to see it makes the walk go quickly. The valet staff is hugely helpful and friendly, and very quick to do anything you ask. The bell staff was equally nice and eager to please, as were the front desk staff, which was evident on the day we checked out. Being Elite Members of Marriott is supposed to entitle you to perks, which really don't mean that much, but the one we looked forward to was the free access to the spa for each day of our stay. We had access included anyway the first day because of the spa treatments, but we wanted to spend the day after we checked out enjoying the spa as well. We called a couple of times before we arrived to makes sure this was the case, and they said that it was. They also invited us to arrive early before check-in and use the pool and whatever else we wanted even before we were to be able to get into our room. Wow! Anyway, we checked out and went to the spa only to be told that we could use the gym, but to get a locker and robe, and to use the pool woud be a $25 charge. No way! We went back to the front desk, explained the situation, and after a minute the girl came back and told us to go enjoy our day at the spa, it was all taken care of. We found out later that the spa had charged our $50 fee to the front desk, and the hotel comped it to us. The spa told us that that was a source of contention between the hotel and the spa, and guests were usually misinformed of spa policy. What? Either way, we camped out at the pool for most of the day, we were the only two people there, and we were waited on by the servers exclusively. It was incredibly relaxing and quiet. The pool wasn't heated though, and I was too chicken to get in all the way; it was cold! Everything was great, and I will go back with my family and enjoy the hotel fully. The only other thing I have to say that is even a little bit negative is that it seemed that a lot of the staff was non-English speaking, as in mostly Russian, and we had a very hard time getting our questions answered. It was very difficult communicating with many staffers there, and if you wanted anything done or had pertinent questions you had to go to someone fairly high up on the hotel food chain, where they all spoke English. All in all I give this hotel an A-; we loved it! To break it down pricewise, we basically paid for our spa treatments, and got the room, the breakfasts, and the extra day at the spa for free. $269 total, with the spa treatments and tips being worth that, the room would have been another $115 or so, the breakfast came out to $45 including tip, the extra day at the spa, $50.

I dont know if this is standard practice for them or not, alot of other guests I spoke to did not recieve this but it was a nice touch.The bathroom was gorgeous, It was so large! It had a nice deep tub for baths and a seperate all-glass shower. The tile in the bathrooms is gorgeous but VERY slippery when wet. I think its a law-suit waiting to happen. The pools are beautiful, that is where I spent the majority of my time, while my husband was on business. There are many private corners,shady spots and umbrellas to stake out if you want to be alone. The service by the pool was unexpected. They will bring you drinks and a limited menu poolside. The food was great, noone I was with, was ever dissapointed in there choices. The salads could feed a small family, and at $12-14 each they should. Heres a tip: They offer a smaller managable half-size salad for $6-8 each that is still enough to fill up even a large appetite. But they wont tell you they offer this smaller size, we just found out by accident. Food and drink service poolside was a little on the slow side but the young people that were working the pool in 100+degree heat deserved a medal for that alone. Housekeeping was a bit slow, some days I would be out of my room 8 or 9 hours and come back and housekeeping was just finishing or had not gotten to my room yet. My only complaint about this goregeous place was the selection of places to eat. There is NOWHERE to just grab a low-cost meal. Even the cafe that is poolside charged $12 for a cheesburger, $12-14 for salads, and $10-12 for average drinks.(Everyone was raving about there Pina Coladas w/toasted coconut in all fareness) The restaurants I'm sure were fabulous, I only ate in the 2 that were the most affordable. You can also have drinks and a small food menu out on the large patio in the back of the hotel. ( I recommend the \"Chicken Wonton-Tostada's\" they were unreal....Yumm!!!)

You know the feeling, like everyone thinks that you dont belong there. But we ignored that and had a good meal. We swam that night in one of the pool and that was nice and relaxing. While we did that we could hear the live music playing in the patio area which made the moolight even more special. We did use roomservice for night snacks and that was prompt and good. That is 24 hours too. The bathroom was beautiful with a seperate shower and tub. Everything in marble and well stocked. The bath goodies that they give you are wonderful and we had to get some from the spa store to take home so we could have them there too. The beds are very very comfortable and I slept well. However, fitting two people on the bed if they arent children is quite hard. For two adults a King Bed would be best. In the morning we had breakfast at the Blue Sage Restr. on the grounds and that was wonderful and well priced. I will go back there over and over again to eat when we visit. The pool area is nice, however if you are going to swim at night be sure to take your own towel as there are none around the pool area that are clean. In the morning however you can find clean towels and a good place to sit around the lazy river or the pools. The service at the pools is great and prompt. We are going back at the end of the month because we loved it so much. They way that they have laid this property out is wonderful and they have decorated it beautifuly.

Then the bell staff took my luggage and then up to the room, along the way he was telling us about the area and what to and not do to in Phoenix. I planned a side trip to the Grand Canyon and he even told us the best way to get there. We had a standard room which was very nice for 2 people. Beautiful bathrooms are the norm. Bed is very confortable and easy to fall asleep on. We had a nice view of the grounds on our balcony and was nice just to sit out there and enjoy the weather and ambient sounds of the resort. The hotel restaurants are all great and the food is top notch. I highly recommend the butterfish at Roy's and the Salmon dish at the italian place there (forgot the name). When you get out to the main pool area (which there are a lot of different pools) you get to experience how nice the place really is. There are waterfalls, tons of desert flowers, cacti, etc to look at. There were plenty of chairs available and the area was not overly crowded at all. We were there on the weekend and you still can find a place to sit, even in the afternoon. You can sit anywhere and the staff will come by and take your food and drink order and you can eat right by the pool. The lazy river is great to get out of the hot sun and you can relax in there for hours on end just floating aournd. They even have a waterslide for the kids. I saw all different types of people, families, etc, so everyone is welcome here and kids are not a problem. They have 2 fitness centers, one where you have to pay $10 for that includes other spa services, and a free one, which I used and is better than your average hotel gym. They had 8 new treadmills, ellipitcals, free weight area, bikes, etc. Better weight machines are in the pay gym though. Golf courses are well maintained and very challenging. I do not play golf that much, but it was one of the nicest courses I have played. There are 2 and I played the Faldo one. They have a car rental place in the hotel so you can rent a car, like we did and drive to the Grand Canyon or other places. We were with a group of people who paid for our stay at the hotel, if not I am sure I could not afford the $300 plus a night. It is a bit pricy, but worth the trip.

There was no place to put anything in the double room and we were tripping over each other. Even the coffee maker was hidden away in the closet. The desk had an experimental computer on it you could use for $10 a day, so that took up even more room. Even the tub was tiny, but the separate shower was OK. This is a huge hotel with 950 rooms on only 5 floors, the largest in AZ they said, so it fans out like spokes on a wheel from the lobby in the hub. Getting a pool view means you are pretty much at the end of the spokes and a long walk from the lobby where the restaurants were. We got lost a couple of times finding the room, getting to the end of the wrong \u2018spoke\u2019 and had to go back and start all over again. Everything is first class and quite impressive. Staff friendly and happy to serve. We joined the Cloud Club \u2013 like a concierge room any guest can have for an extra $150 a night per room (max. 2 people) that includes complimentary drinks in the room from 4-10 pm each day including weekends, appetizers from 5-6 pm, dessert & cordials at 8 pm, and a chef prepared hot breakfast from 7-11 am. In addition they make dinner reservations for you, as well as for tennis, spa and golf. There is only one computer to log on with and no WIFI yet (although WIFI is available in the upper lobby). Cloud Club staff are very anxious to please and is a new project started Jan. 9, 2006. It is a large very comfortable room. So that took our daily rate to $600 before taxes.

We're taking a bona fide, pleasantly staffed real Starbucks. Then it gets better. You take your coffee and go to the lobby and sit in one of those comfy chairs and just people watch.

More important, the people were lovely. Upon checking in at around 6 pm we were at first thrilled to find out about the Starbucks, and then disappointed to hear that it had just closed for the day.

The gardens are immaculate and go beyond just being pretty. There is just something about a stylish building (that's only 6 stories tall) surrounded by ponds, fountains, pools, lawns, flowers, golf courses, and LOTS of palm trees. You could easily mistake this for a Hawaiian island setting. Our room was above average, overall. It was pretty big, with a large bathroom and bright walls, it was very clean, and there is a hint of some kind of flower perfume that is pleasant when you walk in. I was surprised that for $500 a night, though, that guests still have to pay $10 daily if they want internet access. You can stay at Courtyard by Marriott for under $100 w/ free internet. The pools were very warm at 86 degrees, and the Lazy River was nice and relaxing. There seems to be lots and lots of space for guests at the pools - hundreds of lounge chairs. The fitness center is great - all new equipment, including cardio w/ individual televisions, free weights, and machines. All of the hotel staff was very professional and pleasant.

We had eaten at the one in Pebble Beach, which was very good, but this one was about a 7 out of 10. We ordered the appetizer sampler platter, and everything was delicious, though pricey at $25. The entrees we ate were two of Roy's signature dishes - \"macadamia nut encrusted mahi-mahi w/ lobster Cognac sauce\" and soy-glazed butterfish. Both fish were cooked well and tasted good, but lacked depth of flavor. They was no explosion of flavors in the mouth. So, the meal was good, but not outstanding in my opinion. Service was very slow every step of the way, from taking our order, to getting a drink, to getting dessert (it took over 30 minutes even though we ordered the souffle with our dinner order, as recommended on the menu). They came around early on and gave us each 1 breadroll (yum!), but despite my requests for another roll, we never saw the bread guy again the entire night. There are plenty of places to eat near the hotel, if you don't want to go fancy all the time. We spent a whole day in Old Town Scottsdale.

There is also a relaxation room that you can enjoy before and after your treatment. I had a Swedish massage one time and a Hot Stone Massage another time.

Still conflicted on my feelings regarding our stay. My husband was out there for a conference and it just happened that our anniversary was the day after the conference ended. So I flew out a few days after he did and we just extended our stay. Overall I enjoyed it. The grounds are breathtaking! The food is great and everyone is very friendly. I really liked the location because it was located between Phoenix and Scottsdale and close to the freeway. It made getting around very easy. The staff was very helpful and always had smiles on their faces. Like I've already said the grounds are amazing. I really can't say enough about that and it really made up for the bad things (I'll get to those). There is a patio just outside the lobby that has several tables and lounge chairs with firepits and it was always the place to be in the evening and early morning. I really enjoyed taking a book and just hanging out. The pools are very nice and never seemed crowded. Okay so here are the few negatives. The pools weren't heated and it wasn't very comfortable to swim. However, this was in November. Second, I called two weeks in advance and spoke with someone at the hotel. I explained that my husband was going to be there for the conference but that I would be flying in halfway through the week for our anniversary. I told her it would be great if we could get a room with a good view and a king sized bed. When my husband got there he was put in a room with doubles. He told the front desk I would be there in 3 days for our anniversary and could they move him as soon as a king came available. So when I arrived 3 days later he was still in the doubles. We slept in seperate beds because I am 5 months pregnant and there was NO way we could both squeeze into one of those little beds. Not ideal on a romantic getaway. The next day we called and again requested a king room. We were called back around noon and were told our new room was ready and a bellman was on his way up to move us. We loaded everything up and made the trek across the hotel to our new room. When we opened up the door it was another double but the view was amazing (pools). The bellman called the front desk and explained we were wanting a king and again said it was for our anniversary. He was told which room to take us to but it was on the 3rd floor and overlooked the front drive! Not exactly romantic but we opted for the king vs. the view. This was the biggest problem we had. I know the hotel was sold out because of conferences. However, it just seems to me that someone would've thought to put more of the single business travelers into the doubles and leave the king rooms for couples. Also, over the course of a week can you really tell me there wasn't a king room with a decent view that came available. Also, my husband is a preferred Marriott reward holder. So much for rewarding loyalty that week. We did make the best of it and really enjoyed ourselves. Overall it was nice. Just a few little annoying things that keep me from giving it an \"Excellent\". Not sure if we'd stay again. If we knew the room situation would be better we would.

Pools close around 11:00 p.m. Something that was not mentioned in this site is that during the summer months it's monsoon season in AZ.

There were a couple little maintenance things that could have been overlooked in our room but it really didn't make a difference in our stay. One of the lightbulbs was out in our bathroom and part of the shower handle was coming off the wall a little. Our room was on the fifth floor and when the bellman took us through the hallways, it was very warm. But maybe, that is to be expected in Phoenix in August. The air conditioning wasn't on in our room when we checked in so it took an hour or so to cool off. One of the things that I really thought wasn't very appealing was the carpeting in the hallways of our wing, in quite a few areas it seemed to be dirty. Inside one entrance out to the parking lot, there were dried flowers or leaves on the floor that were there the entire four days we stayed. I kinda thought that would have been cleaned up as soon as it was noticed by the staff. The lobby was beautiful and very clean though! All the beautiful marble and large windows overlooking the back of the hotel. There was always iced tea and water available to the guests.

The Revive Spa was a beautiful building. The private spa pool was a very relaxing place to enjoy the rest of the afternoon after our massages. If I were to suggest to anyone coming to the Marriott Desert Ridge, ask for a room other than in Wing A if you have a car. While walking out to the parking lot from this wing, you walk past the garbage area and there is a strong sewer and garbage odor there.

Often first impressions of a hotel are formed quickly while checking in. Once again, Marriott came through with a check-in time of about 90 seconds. The associate who checked me in was friendly and efficient. I liked the fact that he asked if I wanted help to my room, which I never do when traveling alone. I lucked out getting one of the better view rooms in the resort. Room 6303 is on the 6th (top) floor and looks directly out onto the garden, stream, and pool with the desert and the mountains in the background. I made good use of the small balcony by having my room service dinner there. The room itself was about average size, but decorated and furnished very nicely. Everything was of good quality, especially the bed, pillows, and bed linens. The king bed was one of Marriott\u2019s new \u201cI want one of these at home\u201d beds. They are extremely comfortable. The duvet covering the bed seemed freshly laundered. On one of the night stands was a CD player/clock radio, a nice touch. My only disappointment with the room was that there was no swiveling-tilting office-type chair. I guess it would have not fit with the d\u00e9cor, but I always have work to do and a good office chair is appreciated. The desk also fit with the d\u00e9cor, but was not as conducive to working as a true desk would be. I suspect very few visiting this resort spend much time at a desk in the room! The bathroom was great. It was large and had both tub on one side of the room and a glassed in shower on the opposite side. The lighting was excellent. There were the usual upscale assortment of amenity items, a hair dryer and a magnifying mirror. There were plenty of thick towels. It was 109 degrees when I checked in and I took advantage of the pool quickly. Actually the pool complex has three pools, each different and on a different level. There were stacks of pool towels available and I saw most guests had pitchers of ice water at their lounges. I decided to try the Lazy River pool where you can effortlessly float in an inner tube around the pool in about 10 minutes. That was great! It being summer vacation there were a lot of kids, but that was to be expected. I had room service for dinner and was impressed when the associate who took my order suggested instead of the soup of the day they prepare me shrimp chowder. She said the regular soup did not look very good. The shrimp chowder and my American Kobe Beef burger were great. It took about 25 minutes from the time I called until my dinner arrived. I also liked the fact that they said up front that a 20% gratuity was being added as well as a delivery charge. Some hotels have a service charge and I am never sure how much of that the server gets. All of the hotel associates that I came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. My room key stopped working (I took it into the pool) and instead of just giving me another key, the front desk associate came with me to my room to make sure I did not have any other problems. I had a drink at the lobby bar and the service there was prompt and very friendly. There is a lot to do at this resort. Besides the pools, there is a wonderfully equipped health club. It is next to the spa and is complimentary. You don\u2019t have to pay to use the spa to use the workout room. There was every conceivable piece of exercise equipment you could want. Most had LCD monitors and wireless earphones. Another thing I liked about the hotel was the Starbucks. Their patio overlooked the botanical gardens.

There was a children program, but you had to pay a fee. Again I remind parents that this hotel is not a children only daycare center.. it is a large resort and most of the time has large adult conventions.. Around Memorial weekend we had the Pediatric Nurses Convention. Food: Roy's was excellent.. Drew our waiter was fabulous as was the Manager that night.. she knew we were celbrating a 50th Birthday and gave us a quiet area in the patio overlooking the grounds. We felt as though we were in Hawaii... even had a lovely breeze. The breakfast/lunch restaurant was great also. We did utilize the Cloud Room facilities and the staff catered to all our wishes.. by the way, the chocolate chip cookies were fabulous. Also, if you wish coffee and don't see it .. ask the ladies for some... whatever you want.. ask them for it.. they were amazing. Pool: there were always chairs.

This is a fabulous resort in every manner. I'll break it down: Property ... could not ask for any more. The location is not great ... in the middle of nowhere. However, the resort itself is practically made of marble. Everything is new, spotless, impressive etc. The pool complex is absolutely unreal. We loved all the pools, especially the lazy river. The property outside impeccably managed ... full of flowers, waterfalls, palm trees etc. Always the sound of relaxing soft music everywhere, as they have speakers throughtout all the garden areas. Rooms ... Very average. Marble baths are nice. Not the highlight of the hotel. View from main building was unbelievable. All rooms have balcony's, refridgerators etc. Service ... Perfect (not too much or too little) and always with a smile. I've been to scores of resorts and hotels as I travel a lot and never felt so welcomed. Everything was right on time and to our specification. Tips seemed appreciated in return for good work, not expected. Maids, front desk, bell, wait staff, and valet all took the time to say good morning and play with our 1 year old. Recreation ... Pools are the highlight as discussed earlier. The Wildfire Golf Club has two courses, Faldo and Palmer. I thought the Faldo was OK. I'm not a fan of the overbunkered type of course. I've played better desert layouts. Everything was well maintained and in great condition though and service was outstanding. A little pricy at $150, but that does include range, cart and 6 Calloway balls. Food ... There are 4 real restaurants ... the others are really casual, patio type snack bars. Roy's was outstanding (I mean top level outstanding). Blue Sage was average / good. We didn't eat in Tuscany or Meritage but I heard both were very good. The pool bar serves great lunches ... we ate lunch there every day. The have outstanding salads (Cobb is awesome) and great wraps. We went offsite a few nights. Spa ... My wife said it was incredible. I was wondering if she would ever come back. The resort does a great job with young children. Although it does cater to business meetings, we hardly even saw them even though there was a huge one in the hotel. It is very large and plenty of space for all. Pool and restaurants not really crowded, even though hotel had high capacity. All in all ... If you want a desert vacation ... you can't go wrong here.

Overall, I was very impressed. In particular, the staff was exceptional. Just walking by, staff would greet me. And, there was always plenty of staff in every venue for both group events and for single travelers. I don't GOLF or play TENNIS, so can't comment on the courses or courts. The POOLS were very nice. There are several pools, including the \"lazy river,\" in which you float around on tube rafts. Great for kids and adults who are young at heart. Also a water slide, primarily used by kids. Many pool chairs -- even on a very crowded day, it was easy to find a chair. Towels are plentiful as is ice water with lemon. They provide pitchers and replenish as needed. Pool service (bar/food) is decent and generally fairly priced -- although margaritas at $8 apiece are a bit pricey. I sampled three RESTAURANTS -- Roy's, Tuscany, and Blue Sage. Food was best at Roy's -- excellent for the price. However, they have a practice of requiring single diners to eat at the bar or chef's counter rather than at tables (even when the restaurant isn't crowded), which was disappointing. The service at Tuscany was first rate but the food was only average. Blue Sage for breakfast and appetizers was OK. Food provided during the convention was good. Service was outstanding. They set up enough food stations and bars so that, even with an extremely large group, we never had to wait in line for food or drinks. Dirty plates were cleared quickly. The Revive SPA is excellent. High class service throughout. One of the best massages I've ever had. Facial was ok. I would note that the prices are steep, even based on the East Coast norm. You get what you pay for but you will pay for it. ROOMS are nice and reasonably large. I would guess that every room has a decent view. All have balconies or patios. Big TV. Robes. Minibar. Good sized bathroom, with separate shower & tub. Toiletries (e.g., shampoos) are replenished frequently. Only problem is that soundproofing could be improved. STAFF is excellent. They were very supportive of a large group yet very attentive of individuals. I felt that everyone I met went out of his/her way to make my stay pleasant and enjoyable. People seemed genuinely happy to be working there. The property is deceptively large. Although there are nearly 900 rooms, you don't feel either claustrophobic with your fellow conventioneers or isolated if you're not with a convention.

My husband and I stayed for four nights and paid to upgrade ourselves to a Cloud Room. Well in advance (ie 3 weeks), reservations were made for all four restuarants with specific requests for outdoor seating. On arrival we were greeted well by many people and thought we were onto a winner here although it did take us some time to attract the attention of the gentleman at the Cloud Room to gain admission. Our first nights meal at Roys was exceptional with excellent attentive service; our room was beautiful and our walk in the gardens delightful. Day Two went well until Dinner, when we were seated in a corridor at Blue Sage (the dining room was empty) advised no outside seating was available (though tables were visible) and served our entree four minutes after our appetizer - the server could not understand we were not ready for it so left it anyway. Next day our problems started with the Cloud Room - this has the potential to be a great facility and the staff really do try their best. However, for Appetizers read - lovely food but used as Childrens Teas and dinner by those too mean to pay for it elsehwere. On one day there were 12 children racing around the room and others shouting and crying - one parent even pushed in ahead of us to get the last of an appetizer as it all was l her little darling would eat - we had to go without. The staff advised they have no control over the number of children in the roomas any guest in a cloud room can bring in unlimited children to the room free - so it is not a quiet oasis of calm for a pre dinner drink - quite the opposite. Breakfast was even worse as one dear child was in training for the Muffin Throwing at the Olympics event much to the amusement (and encouragement) of their parents. Obviously the hotel is not responsible for the behaviour of the parents, but be warned on the marketing, this is not the quiet facility you might think you are paying for. Contrast that with our lovely well cooked, romantic meal outdoors at the Tuscany where incidentally delightful well mannered child sat at the next table to us. Wildfire was also a good spot, though again that evening our pre dinner drinks were a shambles as the kids had empty all the adult mixers and Perrier from the fridge and the staff had to get more brought up - and when the first lot arrived doting grandparents took all the water bottles for the children. The poor assistant was so frustrated as he tried to get our preferred drinks to us. Other lapses that needed addressing were, a 50 minute wait for the (wrong) food order at the pool, with no supervisor available to register a complaint - an offer of free drinks was made but as we were about to drive and did not want alcohol or desserts that was worthless. Also had to point out every single day we were in a Cloud Room so should not be charged for parking, yet the charge still appeared on the final account; newspapers were not delivered on two of the days and each day we had to call housekeeping about things missing from our room (like the trashbin). Yes, some of these are minor grumbles, and many of the staff did work hard to provide a very good personal service, but the hotel let itself down too many times during our stay for us to rate it any higher. On check out, the lady adjusted the parking costs but was not interested in our issues re the Cloud Room (which its staff had suggested we raise with them as it concerned them too) - as we were on a tight timescale to get our flight it was pointless pursuing them, but my advice think very very carefully about spending $100 a night for a Cloud Room if you are a couple wanting a more relaxed atmosphere to sit have pre dinner drinks or breakfast in.

Strange how people can go to the same place and come away with a different opinion, but there's no question my wife and I were disappointed after a recent visit here. Ok, yeah it was a weekend and crowded with families and kids, as many Arizona resorts are in the summer -- thanks to off season rates and priceline. But even if you're only paying $39.95 a nite you should treat the place better than a Red Roof Inn. We saw guests lugging huge personal coolers to their rooms and even out by the pools. Little kids ran around unsupervised through the lobby and hallways. Underage (and unsupervised) kids were also jumping into the spas. Of course families taking over resorts is now commonplace and when you have a huge property like Desert Ridge it's understandable to keep the rooms full. What's funny, though, is that there are any number of other resorts in the Phoenix area with better family-oriented activities, pools, slides, games and so on. In fact, there are better places period. The Desert Ridge is far out of town cut into freshly-bladed desert and not especially convenient to anything. The place is huge and unattractive from the outside-- we thought it was a prison or a government building at first. There are other resorts that have better views and are more intimate and charming. Our standard room was smallish and appointed with only fairly humdrum furnishings. No doubt there are nicer rooms, but I like to judge a place by its standard room. The restaurants were fine and not too expensive for this kind of place -- we ate at the Blue Sage and Roys (Roys was more interesting) -- but nothing gourmet. In short, the phrase that comes to mind after a visit to the Desert Ridge is \"fair to middling.\" Probably fine for a business meeting, maybe fine for a family, but there are much better places at the 5 star level in Phoenix.", "Date": "September 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ephrata, PA", "Title": "\u201cBest choice we could have made!\u201d", "Author": "Kendie", "ReviewID": "UR2491440", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel August 14 thru 18, 2004.

We made the choice based on favorable tripadvisor ratings and an unbelievable package deal we received on a last minute booking. Service and staff were first rate and very attentive. They were well below capacity during the first couple of days, although it became crowded toward the end. The resort is huge and has ample space to handle large groups of people but it was a more relaxed experience, especially around the pools when less busy. Roy's was a very good restarant, especially for seafood lovers. The Blue Sage was typical hotel fare. Decent food but a limited menu. Ditto the pool food service. Didn't eat at Tuscany. We were offered an unadvertised 3 spa treatments for the price of 2. They wound up giving us the most expensive one for free ($180 vs. $120 for the other 2) which was surprising. The facilities are very nice and having the run of the more quiet spa pool and building for the day a nice extra. My wife and I agreed the treatments were wonderful. Played the Faldo (the other is a slightly more difficult Palmer design) and found it of average difficulty depending on the tees you use. It was in pretty rough shape, but it must be difficult to keep a desert course in shape this time of year. The grounds and lobby are beautiful and designed to keep you cool even in the heat of summer. In the evening they actually air condition the patio lounge by opening the huge double doors to the lobby. It really made a difference . Always ice water on hand. It was a great choice for a romantic getaway even though it may not cater to that crowd as much as the Scottsdale resorts. The only complaint has little to do with the property itself. It cost us $100 including gratuity to travel from the airport and back using super shuttle on the way out and their much more convenient car service back to the airport. It is over 20 miles away so I wouldn't expect a complimentary shuttle, but that seemed a ridiculous amount.

We got a great rate on Priceline and perhaps that's why we were given the absolutely farthest room (1180) from the lobby, pools, and main gathering area. We dropped off our bags and went to orient ourselves with the facilities and when we found out how far away we were from everything, we asked for a room change. I had non-chalantly asked one of the hotel employees about occupancy and learned that it was only about 60% so we thought we had a pretty good chance. Our room was changed promptly to building block 4 which is much closer to everything but they wouldn't give us a view overlooking the main courtyard. Instead, we were given a view of the Desert Botanical Garden. Not bad, but I would have preferred the courtyard view. We noticed that in our second room there were no bathrobes as was in the first room. Housekeeping brought them up to us. Also, we learned that they don't stock stationary as a standard item, you have to ask and they will bring it to you. We found a convenient laundry room in our block of rooms. The washers and dryers are free with detergent and softener supplied as well. For dinner on both nights we ate at Roy's. We dropped by the restaurant in the afternoon before they start serving to check out the menu and Bob the managing partner was extremely friendly and allowed us to poke around. The Hawaiian fusion food is fantastic. The best deal is the prix fixe menu. For $30 you get an appetizer your choice of entree and dessert. The next night we ate off the sushi menu. Mako, the chef partner, definitely knows what he's doing. We sat outdoors the first night and inside the second. Sitting outside is definitely better. The tiki torches add to the ambiance. There's a Starbucks inside the main area. Get a coupon for a free tall coffee of the day by going to the timeshare desk. The timeshare people aren't there at 6:00 am so make sure to get the coupon during the day. Just tell them you're only interested in the free coffee and they'll lay off the hard sell. If you prefer to drink something else, they give you a dollar off any dring with the coupon. Also, at Starbucks, bring your water bottle and fill it up with free water that includes lemon and strawberry accents. Later on in the day you can really taste the fruit as it settles into the water. Valet parking is $17 per day so you may want to think about self parking except it's a long hike back. A shuttle from the parking lot would be nice to see.

Overall, loved the resort but skip the pricey sub-standard spa!", "Date": "May 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cAverage review on the Dessert Ridge Resort & Spa\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1848681", "Content": "While the overall experience at the Dessert Ridge was both entertaining and relaxing, I would have to say that I left there feeling a bit fleeced in the wallet for overpriced services. There is no complimentary coffee available due to the numerous contract vendors on the property. It's the first time I ever spent over $40 for a breakfast buffet for two. The most disappointing aspect though, was the substandard service at the Blue Sage, Roy's, and Tuscany. We had one meal comped at the Blue Sage when our waitor dissappeared. We had a very similar experience at Tuscany's Tuesday night. Not sure what the problem was, but should we ever go back to the Dessert Ridge, we won't eat at their restaurants. As an aside though, table service was poor nearly everwhere we ate. Guess they feel their clients are somewhat limited on their choice of where to eat the finer foods. On another note. My wife could not even get an appointment at the spa. What a bummer.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort\u201d", "Author": "rlmwdc", "ReviewID": "UR1839357", "Content": "My husband, daughter (10) and I finished up a weeklong Easter 2004 vacation at this property. We stayed three nights and thought it was great. The property is BIG - but the staff is friendly and accomodating. We ate at Roy's the first night and we weren't disappointed. Dining outside the next night at Blue Sage was fantastic. Mostly, we enjoyed the Lazy River. So many pools to choose from - that we never felt crowded. I like the lawn area for the kids to play on and also the beautiful desert garden in the back. A nice Towne Center style shopping area is directly across the street with a big movie theater and nice choices for additional dining.
