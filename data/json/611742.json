We were greeted somewhat coldy (perhaps because the lady did not speak English?) and when we asked questions she didn't really answer...but the room we got was AWESOME. NIce size, comfortable. We also didn't have to pay the key deposit...and checking in and out was easy. It was a cool place to stay for the price, and the free breakfast was small but adequate. If your looking for a decent stay in that area of Berlin, this is a cheap reasonable choice.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cThe rooms are not like the pictures!!\u201d", "Author": "UKAUS", "ReviewID": "UR37502517", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for one night as it was convenient for an early morning bus the next day. The pictures of the rooms for this hotel compared to the room that we stayed in do not match - we had two single beds, end to end, and a hand basin. The toilet and shower facilities were across the hall even though we had booked an ensuite room. The room was incredibly uncomfortable and thankfully we were only there for one night as neither of us felt safe. Add to this the phone ringing at 2am with a wake up call, hearing the people in the rooms next door during the night and having someone knock on our door in the middle of the night, we were pleased to make it through the night and leave as early as we could the next day.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Funkturm-Messe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d611742-Reviews-Funkturm_Messe-Berlin.html", "Price": "$46 - $105*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Wundstrasse 72</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">14057</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "611742", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8d/e6/8de6c82ea44df28d5c6550a1257cae168large.jpg"}}
