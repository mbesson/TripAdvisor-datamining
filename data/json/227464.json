I actually made a booking at Pulitzer Hotel, which is the sister hotel of Regina, and literally next door. But he Pulitzer was full, so they booked me a room at the Regina instead. The best things I would say is the fantastic location of the hotel, which is a short walk to Ramblas or Paseo de Gracia, with great shopping. The other good things are the reasonable rate of the hotel and the impressive lobby, which feels like a grand old hotel. However, once you pass the lobby and go towards the rooms, you come to a tiny lift (only one lift!) so be prepared to wait and if there are 2 of you with luggage, its a tight squeeze. Then the rooms ... you start to feel the age and tiredness of the rooms when you step in. Room size is also on the small side. Opt for rooms in the front, at least you'll have a window. My room was at the back and there was a tiny window in the corner, facing a brick wall. Can be depressing if you don't walk out of the hotel to look at the sky. If you need a drink, its better to walk next door to the Bar at the Pulitzer, which seems more civilized and lively. Personally, I wouldn't come back to stay here as there are so many other great choices in Barcelona. For a similar location and type of hotel, I would probably opt for Pulitzer or Jazz Hotel next time.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Friendly Staff, Good for couples.\u201d", "Author": "Nimit P", "ReviewID": "UR126278483", "Content": "I would say this hotel would fit the bill for couples of smaller groups of travelers looking for something a little more upscale, clean, and serviceable without any of the high priced hotel frills.

We spent most of our 3 days prior to our cruise just walking around from the hotel. It's also a short walk from the airport bus stop which is right in front of the square and an easy and very cheap way to get to the airport and back. Since breakfast was not included in our rate, we didn't eat at the hotel as it seemed expensive for what you paid and therefore can't say what the food is like. There were tons of fast food and local eateries in the area plus a small grocery store right across the street for snacks and drinks. The lobby was fairly spacious and there was a bank of computers to use off to the side for free Internet access. I found the the free WI-Fi in the rooms worked fine as well. As far as the rooms went, they were adequate but not luxurious by any means. Fairly modern with wood laminate floors. The bed was comfy however, as others have commented on this site, you can hear every noise in the hallway - and our bed was less than 2 metres from the door. The doors seem more like cheap hollow bedroom doors that you would find in an older apartment than you would expect in a hotel - maybe a simple fix for part of the noise issue the next time they renovate. The rooms had air - but I figured out why the cleaning staff always left the bathroom door closed - since there was no air duct in the bathroom, if it was left open the cooling system could not keep the sleeping area cool. Worked ok once we figured that out. We were on the 4th floor and never noticed a problem with the subway noise that others mentioned. We did have a window - but it looked at wall - so there was no natural light coming in - but then we were rarely there other than to sleep and shower. Considering we only paid 84 Euros per night for a room in the centre of town we weren't surprised at the view we got. Had I paid full price then I might have had an issue.

The only negative aspect that I encountered was the 'thinness' of the walls, on the first day I was there I noticed I could here every source of music and loud conversation on the floor (1st floor). Luckily, any noise that did seep into the room was completely cancelled out by the unbelievably comfortable bed and bedding... I was pretty shocked by it at first, as I did not think a hotel bed would ever qualify that highly for such a price (I've stayed in a LOT of king beds at hotels all over the place and they so far have never been exceptionally mentionable). I was also suspicious that the comfort was proportional only to my exhaustion, but this proved to be unrelated during the three nights I spent there.

The front desk staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The hotel is nice and the rooms are nice, standard sized European rooms, with hardwood floors. The breakfast that comes with the hotel package is a standard European breakfast - both scrambled and boiled eggs, cold cereals and oatmeal, several types of ham, sausages, and bacon; pastries, several types of breads/rolls, butter, jam, fruits, orange juice, milk, and mineral water, all buffet style. There is free Wi-Fi access. The hotel is situated around the corner from Las Ramblas, which is great if you like the activity of Las Ramblas without having to hear it in your hotel room. The hotel is directly across the street from the entrance of the Metro station, but with the room I stayed in, I had no problems, couldn't hear the train at all, just peace and quiet. Had a walk-out balcony, which was nice to view the surrounding area. In my opinion, it's best to take a Taxi to the hotel. There are buses and the metro nearby, but depending on the time of night and how much luggage you have, it's probably better to take a taxi if you're not familiar with the area. Of course there's tons of stores and eateries in the Las Ramblas area. I suggest getting the hop-on/hop-off tour bus pass from the hotel, it's a few Euros cheaper and well worth it. Start out early though, as it takes you to other nice areas to shop and eat and lots of beautiful sights to see. I've been to Barcelona previously, so I definitely felt comfortable in the area.

No kettle to make a cup of tea No iron/board in room - although staff did provide us with this on request. Safety of iron questionable (see photo) Didn't always replace toiletries in room Reception staff variable in terms of helpfulness. Our room phone didn't work and wasn't fixed during our stay. Small shower-room, with water from shower escaping onto floor. Overall, if you are looking for a no-frills, central hotel close to all transport links, then Hotel Regina is probably worth considering. If you like a bit of luxury on your holiday, probably best avoided.

In one word- Perfect! it is also walking distance to most of the sites of Barcelona, but I would suggest taking a cab to Parc Guell and La Sagrada Famiglia. You can easily walk to the beach from here- something we figured out much later than we had hoped to! The Room Itself: PERFECT! We had a balcony facing the street and could see the action going on at Place Catalunya without hearing it.

The room was a good size for a couple and had all expected ammenities. There wasnt really any negatives as long as you dont want to watch TV in English and we never actually seen the resturant as it was hidden, i would recommend however a higher floor room as there is a little rumble noice from the underground tube. Overall, the location of this hotel was perfect for everywhere. Top tips, get the aero blue bus from the airport straight into Cataluna which is its last stop, takes about 25 minutes and is a bargain 5,30 euros! the hotel is just across the street (look for a habitat store its on that corner) The tour bus is also a must, you see everything Barcelona has to offer and get discounts for attractions too! Another tip is to buy the value pack from the hotel as it works out cheaper then buying from the bus. The tour bus goes from the same stops as the aero bus so its again easily accessible. I would take the blue route tour from there then change to the red route tour at the exange point, this way you can see everything almost in a day! Overall loved Barcelona and it does suit all budgets, just dont buy drinks from the small street cafe's on Las Ramlas as they charge a fortune! Everywhere else we vistited were great value!

Tourist tours, Julia, excursion tours, Plaza de Catalunya, McDonald, Burger King, KFC, Corte Ingles department store and good metro connections and a bit further but in walking distance the Aerobuses to the El Prat airport. The service in the hotel this year is the best and fastest i have ever seen. You won't wait 5 minutes to be attended. Staff is very helpfull and will show you where to go. Security is stepped up around Ramblas and Plaza de Catalunya by all kind of police forces. No sign of pickpockets. The FNAC store on the corner is huge and interesting. Should change name , sounds like a bank. I recommend you take a few drinks in evening in the bar. As we have 2 children we were forced to eat at their mandatory fastfood outlets. In the past I dined in the Regina or in the El Corte Ingles Restaurant. The Hotel is perfect for allergic people since they have no carpet. Nice surprise for our youngest. If you take that red tourist bus, do step on and off and visit Gaudi's wonders and the Aquarium. If you leave early for your flight, check out very early or night before. This is a busy hotel that many people like. They can speak enough english these days in barcelona. My kids could do any business themselves. We speak spanish.

I don't require top-notch luxury if I'm not paying a lot of money. But I have to say this was the worst room I've had in a highly rated TripAdvisor hotel and a terrible experience given the amount of money we spent for the room. After seeing other reviewers' photos, I see that perhaps my experience was unusual, but be warned that it could be you next time. Granted, we chose the least expensive room when booking, but even the least expensive room at this rate should have been better. My girlfriend and I checked in late and after waiting 15 minutes for the front desk employee to get off the phone, we were given a terribly small, dark, depressing, windowless room. I say windowless, but it actually did have a tiny high window that opened a little into a crawlspace/alley that was perpetually dark. The room itself was stark with the bed taking up almost the entire space. The bathroom was equally unimpressive. We asked immediately for a room change, but the front desk employee said that no others were available that night. He said he would switch the room in the following day or two. Every day we checked back, but to no avail. The only positive I can say about the hotel was that the entry way and common areas were nicely designed in a modern style. And it had a good location for touring. But we wanted nothing to do with the hotel and strived to be out as much as possible.

When we got back his colleague (who was really nice) showed us the room - we still weren't happy with it really, it had a window but no view as it was behind a billboard. I said that this was a birthday treat and could he not organise a nicer room for us. He was again very rude and ignored what I'd said but claimed that this was the last room in the hotel!

What we were not expecting was the fabulous location, right near Pla\u00e7a de Cataluyna - the place where La Rambla meets the Modernisme trail of the Eixemple and conveniently located for art, history, architecture and food. Even for the kids (who are used to being dragged about on foot, but at 8 and 5 have their limits) it was a reasonable walk to all the sights mum was insisting on and close to several helado opportunities for icecream o'clock. Meanwhile, you are not obliged to wade through the human traffic on La Rambla every time you needed to go into the Barri Gotic or beyond. The beautiful modern lobby behind the smoked glass doors was an absolute joy to come home to. So was the enormous room (104) with two large single beds pushed together and a sofa bed and an extra bed, with a huge marble and granite bathroom with full bath and large shower, fluffy bathrobes and slippers. The free unlimited WiFi was brilliant. Double-glazed windows giving onto the main street meant that while we heard a little noise from fellow guests going up the stairs, not a sound could be heard from the street side at all. Most unexpected of all in this modern, chocolate-toned haven was the lovely staff, from check-in to check-out, nothing but pleasant smiles, a rub on the head for the kids and no question is too stupid in their mother's abysmal Spanish. Even when the airconditioning did not work the first night, it was up and running smoothly the second after a quick word at reception before we left in the morning. Breakfast, while expensive at \u20ac16 for adults and \u20ac8 for kids was a gorgeous buffet with everything you could want from scrambled eggs and bacon to cheese and deli meats to cereal and yoghurt and best of all, beautiful fresh fruit (from the nearby Mercat de la Boqueria?). The breakfast ladies were lovely. The mini bar was well-stocked and comparatively low-priced and the bathroom courtesy packs well thought out (body milk, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel plus a ladies' or gentlemen's pack with tissues and a razor, lip balm and a very cute touch, peppermint foot massage cream). Could do with a shower cap. The only downside for our stay, and one that makes the Regina overpriced is the beautiful refit needs to extend to the bathroom, where some of the floor tiles are loose and grout has come away in the shower allowing mould to set in.

To my delight, this was the case. No smoking allowed in the lobby, the restaurant, the Internet area, which is exactly what I wanted. And the room had no lingering odor, and was quite clean and comfortable. The beds could have been more comfortable, however. Very standard mattresses. Also, I would have liked a clock in the room - bring your own. The location is excellent, and close to a major Metro stop.

Another positive is the assistance I received from a young man named Derek, who helped me out with a tricky dilemma, by making calls in Spanish for me, and being very accommodating.

There were heavy odours of industrial sealants etc plus dust and noise in the ground floor common areas. Beds were good, location great and staff generally friendly and helpful BUT Room 514: Like a rather tired prison cell, small, dark with a frankly unacceptable bathroom. No natural light save for an alcove with a window with views of a five storey concrete screen. What light does enter the room from this window falls on the wardrobe in the alcove and not the room. The bathroom was once a wet room (perhaps from the early 80\u2019s) and the addition of a half length, half width bath does nothing to change that, other than make it less useable. Dirty tired tiles and mouldy grouting. The shower over the half bath with ineffective screen makes showering a chore. Shower your left side and then exit to turn around to re-enter and shower your right side. Exit after showering to a flooded room. You couldn\u2019t make it up!! The lighting in here was also very poor. Nowhere for you ladies to apply your make up. Now to the low point. Soundproofing. Well there is none. I am now intimate with the bodily functions of the fella in the next room. Let me clarify. When I say next room, the rooms are not adjoining, oh no. The rooms are adjacent and across a hallway. Aircon: Didn\u2019t work. Reported it, a member of staff came and adjusted the settings and said give it ten minutes. Still didn\u2019t work. Room was stuffy and far too hot to be comfortable. Like being in a prison laundry. Requested a new room, apparently none available until the next day. Room 409: Much better, bigger, brighter, fresher and more modern, with a view and natural light. But, same issues with the shower and the soundproofing. Oh guess what? The aircon didn\u2019t work. This room had a shared balcony with two other rooms. Whilst the balcony was divided and on the fourth floor, it would be possible to pass from one part to another. Here in lies the worry. The outward French doors didn\u2019t lock, once latched any application of pressure and the doors would open. This being the case the occupants of the two adjoining rooms could, if so minded gain access to your room. It gets worse. The door to the room doesn\u2019t lock from the inside. Usual card access and exit applies. So the absence of an internal lock wasn\u2019t a surprise.

We stayed at the Hotel Regina for one day pre-cruise and 2 days post cruise. Location : Excellent. Convenient for shopping, food and gothic area. Rooms : Huge by European standard. Nice minimalist style which is rare in Europe but common in Asia. We had originally had 3 kids with us, 2 pre-teens and 1 toddler. When I made the reservations, the hotel had kindly indicated that our 3 year-old toddler could stay free. So we booked a quad for my husband and I and our 3 kids and a standard double for my parents. Subsequently, we had some change of plans and one of my older boys couldn't join us on this holiday. I decided not to change our reservation. When we arrived pre-cruise, we found the quad room really big and comfortable. We had 2 twin beds in the main bedroom area and 2 single beds in the separate corner for the kids. My little girl saw the huge bed in the main bedroom and decided that she wanted to sleep with me and my husband, not her brother. We decided to change our rreservations for the 2 nights post cruise to a triple instead. We saved EUR25 per night by doing that. The triple room we got subsequently was just as good. The difference is the smaller annex area which had only one single bed. My little girl was very happy and comfortable sleeping with my husband and I. The double room that my parents had was also comfortable and of very decent size. On our post cruise stay, the hotel gave them a triple room instead next to ours as they were not fully booked. My parents did however complain that the aircon in their triple room did not seem to work and they had to open the windows otherwise their room gets really stuffy. Amenities : My grip is that the hotel does not provide facial tissue paper. They only provided 2 sheets of serviettes per amenity kit. I think their were 4 amenity kits in our large room. It is a small thing and we had our own anyway, but it was inconvenient. This is the first time that I have stayed in a 4* hotel that does not provide tissue paper. Amenities provided is also not consistent. My parents room has bedroom slippers for both stay, but our room had none for both stays. Another inconvenience is that they did not have a kettle in the room and we had to ask for hot water each time my little girl wants her milk. The plus however is the free wifi internet connection. It is extremely convenient to use with our laptop and best of all free of charge! Service : We experienced nothing exceptional. In fact, when we arrived in the evening of our post-cruise stay, there was no bell boy to help with our bags. One of the counter staff operated the service lift and my husband moved all our bags himself with a little assistance from the counter staff. Also, the taxis that the hotel got for us were not honest. We needed 2 taxis to the port. The meter price for each taxi was around EUR16-17. One of the taxi wanted to charge meter price, but the second insisted to be paid EUR27 with no explanation why there is an additional EUR10. He got the second taxi to charge the same EUR27. We could not speak spanish and just paid the amount. When we informed the hotel when we returned from the cruise 12 days later, the counter staff told us that we must inform them the very same day of the incident and it is too late now. Frankly, we were already at the port. Did they expect us to call them from there? Their attitude is nonchalent and not helpful at all. I now wonder if the hotel staff got a cut from the taxi driver. Even if they have surcharge on our bags, EUR20 seem excessive as we had only 1 large bag, 4 medium bags and 2 small bags and a stroller. My advice is to flag your own taxi or perhaps book a transfer. I was offered transfer by Barcelona Day Tours at EUR50 for all of us but did not book that as I had read on this forum that taxi to the port was less than EUR20. My mistake.

Couldn't have asked for a better location, round the corner from Placa de Catalunya and las Ramblas. It's quite pricey but if you're only there for a couple of days you're better staying right in the heart of things so it's definately worth it. The room was a good size, and the bed was the best I have slept in for a long time. My husband was impressed with the fact that we had 4 pillows and they were perfect! I had arranged beforehand for champagne to be delivered to the room as it was my husband's birthday (many thanks to Vanesa for all the help on this) when we returned from a bit of sightseeing and shopping it was there waiting for us with strawberries and little cubes of chocolate brownies - very yummy. We had a problem with the tv in our room which we only knew about at about 10pm and a nice young man came to the room straight away but couldn't fix it, he then came back to tell us that it would be fixed first thing the next morning (sunday!) and it was. I couldnt fault the staff at all, very polite and helpful. Barcelona's a great place and has a lot of shops and museums. El Corte Ingles is huge but not as good as it used to be. The shops in the Rambla de Santa Monica are much better and it's not quite as hectic. The Picasso museum is really good and well worth a visit. There's a chinese/dim sum restaurant accross from the hotel that's great value for money - 4 courses and a drink fro 10euros!!! It's not the best chinese in the world but it is fresh and hot. if you decide to go on the boat tour around the harbour, make sure it's a warm day and not too windy for obvious reasons!!! Here's my top tip - make sure your travel itinerary has on it what terminal your flight leaves from as ours didn't - we got the airport bus and it dropped us off at Terminal 1 but we should have been at Terminal 2, we then had to get a shuttle bus then walk for ages to get to the correct check in area then walk right to the end of the terminal to our gate - it's a very long walk!!!", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cWanted it to be nicer\u201d", "Author": "travplaces", "ReviewID": "UR50372334", "Content": "I am an avid user of trip advisor so I felt it was time that I began to help other travelers in their hotel decision making.

The hotel itself is just moderate. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The decor is very minimalist. We had just come from the Westin Palace in Madrid...a true 4-5 star hotel. This hotel just isn't. There was a really weird odor coming into our room every night...almost sulphur like. There was a vent in the bathroom that vented into an interior shaft and when I closed the vent, the smell subsided somewhat.

We stayed there for 4 nights. THE ROOM: Modern and spacious (positively huge since we just came from our tiny room in Paris). The room was well appointed with two double beds, big LCD TV (some English channels), huge bathroom with bidet, separate area for sink and tub w/shower, lots of desk space. We requested a quieter room and got room 219, it was fairly quiet. Our bathroom did have a view of the back of the El Triangle sign that faced Carrer de Pelai. THE LOCATION: A block from the Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. The train, subway and airport shuttle bus are all within a blocks walking distance. The shops of Eixample and Diaganol are a close stroll. Food and drink wise are abundantly close and of varying prices and quality. There are great places to eat at everywhere. We tried to avoid eating on Ramblas since we thought it was all touristy. There is a Co-op supermarket directly across the street from the hotel. From the hotel it was an easy walk to Gothic Quarter, Barceloneta Beach, Born District, Eixample shops. THE SERVICE: We had arrived at 9:30 in the morning and the staff were very helpful getting us the best possible room. We were surprised by a bottle of champagne in our room. The manager had sent It for our 10 year anniversary. We were always greeted warmly by staff. The location of the hotel made it close to everywhere. From experience, we've come to realize location is the key to a great vacationing experience. Hotel Regina certainly has that in spades. Literally steps from all the action, yet still a quiet night rest. We could easily drop off shopping or siesta in the afternoon yet still be in the thick of things once we were ready to go.

We realize that the hotel can't be responsible for this, but unfortunatly it wasn't the only case of noise we experienced. Everytime someone in the hallway closed their door or when the cleaning staff was working in the room next door, it felt like they were inside our room. During our final night we weren't able to sleep until 3 am due to a \"celebration\" at the hotel next door. We decided to give the reception a call but weren't able to reach them because our telephone was malfunction. When we told the friendly receptionist about our problem she was very polite and did all she could to resolve the issue. We will definitely visit Barcelona again as it\u2019s a beautiful city.

Our family group was quite large (18 people) and we had 8 rooms. We arrived on several different days with some of us staying 4 nights and others only staying 1 night. Luckily we all had a wonderful experience. Most of the rooms were ready when we arrived (around 10 am) and for the few that were not ready, the hotel held the luggage and contacted us when the rooms were available. The rooms are spacious with plenty of storage. The bed was very comfortable. My husband and I shared a triple room with our 9 yr. old daughter. This was a great set up!! She slept on a twin sized bed in a small alcove in our room. She loved having \"her own space\". The breakfast buffet was a nice treat. We enjoyed having a quick, delicious breakfast before starting on our sightseeing each day. The fruit on the breakfast bar was especially tasty and we loved all the pastries. The hot choices were always the same, but that was fine. Most every afternoon around 5 pm we found ourselves gathering in the bar/lounge area to decide where we were headed for the evening. The bartenders were very nice and took good care of us. The sangria was delicious. On our first night we were so tired from the day, that we decided to eat dinner in the bar area. We had several different foods, but the most popular was the hamburger!! Everything tasted fresh and was served quickly. As you can tell, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Regina. The location is great for walking and sightseeing on Las Ramblas and the Metro station is so close that any area of town is easily accessible. Even with all the positive things I have already mentioned, I saved the best for last....the best thing about the Regina is the service. Everyone who worked there was fabulous...helpful, friendly and kind. Lucilia at the front desk is absolutely a gem!!

There is in fact an entrance to the Placa de Catalunya station literally across the street from the from front door. There is a little supermarket across the street and an abundance of cafes and shops closeby. Due to delays to our already late evening arrival flight, we turned up for check-in somewhat tired and bedraggled at about 11pm. The entire check-in process was conducted in a very efficient and friendly manner by Navarro, and we were assigned a very spacious double room on the fifth floor at the front of the hotel with a balcony overlooking the street with a view of Placa de Catalunya to our right. Navarro also gave us a little guidebook and map of Barcelona along with our keycard which was a nice touch. The double bed is basically 2 large single beds together and was extraordinarily comfortable. (This is quite usual in European hotels) The decor has a contemporary feel with wooden floors and a white and chocolate colour scheme. The room was immaculately maintained by the excellent housekeeping staff daily. Room 502 had plenty of open storage space (ie while there isn't a wardrobe, there was plenty of space for hanging clothes, two neat drawers and lots of shelf space) The room is also equiped with a standard hotel room electronic combination safe, flat screen TV, good lighting and large mirrors. There are an array of toiletries supplied, including razor, shaving cream and aftershave balm, comb, lip balm, mint foot massage gel, toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, shower gel and body lotion, as well as bathrobe and slippers. The sink is actually in the bedroom which is a little unusual but it's an idea that works well. The shower (no bathtub) was spacious (with a full height glass door) with an excellent supply of hot water (and not one of those uncontrollable scalding hot and then freezing cold systems some many hotels seem to have) The actual shower room does feel a little small, partly due to the lower ceiling and also the slate grey wall tile colour scheme, but I'm nitpicking now! Some reviews complain about noise, and I can see what they mean. Yes, it is possible to faintly feel the trains go by underground and yes there can be street noise, but to be honest, the noise we found most irritaing was the commotion made by other tourists in the hallway outside our door yelling at some of their friends further down the hallway! There are 3 computers with free internet access available on the ground floor which is a nice touch. (Ideal if you want to check out Tripadvisor restaurant reviews!) The bar has a fairly extensive menu and cocktails average \u20ac8 (which is cheaper than the bars where we live!) We did not avail of breakfast at the hotel. The staff we encountered (reception/bar/housekeeping) were all terrifically friendly and pleasant at all times. There is a little wear and tear evident in some of the carpeted areas around the bar, but I can't really fault the hotel or its staff at all. We found it to be excellent value and in an excellent location. We would recommend it to our friends (and already have) and we would return again.(This was in fact already a return trip) (Complimentary access to a nearby Holmes Place Leisure Centre is available though we did not make use of this.

Better late than never! The location could not have been more perfect at the top of Las Ramblas right on Plaza Catalunya. So convenient to everything without being right ON Las Ramblas which would have been a little too crazy. The decor was hip sleek and contemporary, a surprise given the beautiful old building it is housed in. Our Room, 410, was fabulous. Beautifully appointed with a sinfully comfy bed with luxurious bedding, luxurious feather quilt, and fabulous slippers. We loved the fluffy towels, robes, and slippers; all kinds of toiletries (his and hers), a big safe, double sinks and bidet . The large balcony, accessed from either the bathroom or the main room, delivered amazing views of Plaza Catalunya and down Las Ramblas. One day we left the room, forgetting to lock our safe. We came back that evening realizing it was wide open, yet none of the contents were missing or disturbed in any way--even though while we were gone, maids had come in for turn down service and a hotel employee came in to leave us a note regarding a message that had been left for us. I don't know of many U.S. hotels where we would have been so lucky. Bravo to the staff and management for their honesty and ethics! The front desk staff for the most part was efficient and polite....not particularly warm and fuzzy, and some but not all of the clerks were a tad snotty, but helpful and professional and never rude, which was fine with me. Optional Breakfast is amazing, but pricey--a very impressive spread. However, we opted instead to grab coffee and a scone at the Starbucks directly next door to the hotel, with inviting tables and chairs outside on the plaza. The hotel has a very nice, classy, comfortable bar and lounge with free unlimited internet access and very friendly bartenders. . The only negative I can report is that, as in a couple of other (nice) European hotels, the glass shower door only extends half way down the length of the tub, making it impossible to keep water from flodding the beautiful marble floor. I wish someone would tell me why they do this--it's such a mess! Suggestion: request a room with a balcony looking out at Las Ramblas. Room 410 was awesome. Barcelona Tip: Although we were not pick-pocketed ourselves (and we felt very safe in and outside of our hotel), we heard stories every day of other tourists who were expertly separated from their valuables, usually without even realizing they were being robbed. Best to keep your money and other valuables in an inside pocket (preferably zippered or buttoned), not in a purse, backpack, or back pocket, and do leave whatever you can safely locked in the hotel safe.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, OR", "Title": "\u201ccentral and clean, but a tad small with tiny window\u201d", "Author": "acornsowner", "ReviewID": "UR29626541", "Content": "My mom and I stayed at a twin room at Hotel Regina in mid April. We picked this hotel for its location and we weren't disappointed. Everything was either walking or subway ride away, subway station was definitely less than 5 minutes walk away. The staff was OK but they sure made us wait when checking in (previous group was large and took forever). The room was rather small (we got room 211). I think we were facing the back side of the hotel but couldn't tell too well because there was only one tiny, narrow window facing walls with hardly any light coming in. The lighting in the room was fine, so we didn't feel all that bad, but a view would have been nice. We did hear some subway noise during the day time, but that didn't wake us up early or anything. Also, the room was kept quite warm, so we didn't even need the blankets when trying to sleep. The bonus was free access to 3 computers at business center-I wasn't expecting it, so it was nice to have. And there was a little supermarket right across the street, which made it easy for us to buy water and other snack items. Overall, I thought the hotel was clean, modern looking and in a great central location.

I e-mailed Mr Sanchez ahead as the purpose of our stay was our 10th Wedding Anniversary and 1st trip abroad without the children. My husband is a light sleeper so I requested a quiet room. That's exactly what we got. We overlooked a small courtyard garden with no view but that was exactly what we wanted. Very, very quiet. On arrival in the room, we found a note congratulating us on our special ocassion which was a lovely touch. Five minutes later, we got brought a bottle of sparkling wine and some chocolates! We had a very spacious room. The bed was huge!! Everything was spotless. The bathroom was a great size. Twin sinks, bathrobes and slippers included, with some lovely toiletries. The best part of the hotel was the location. You could not get ANY better than this. The hotel was 2 minutes walk to the top of La Rambla and the same distance to the main bus and metro stations at Placa Catalunya. The airport bus dropped off across the square from the hotel for 4.25 euros. Bargain. MUCH cheaper than a taxi and so easy to do. Barcelona is a wonderful city and is packed with amazing sights. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Bus Turistic. It cost 27 euros for a 2 day pass and you can hop on and off at your leisure. The problem we had were the horrendous queues - and we were only using it on a thursday and friday. God knows what weekends would be like.On Saturday morning as we were leaving,the queues were miles long. The circuit was 2 hours all round and only went in one direction. So if you missed something, there was no way of going back unless you went right round the circuit again. On Friday, which happened to be a public holiday, part of the circuit was closed off due to a demonstration. We were not advised of this so after sitting on the bus for an hour to reach our destination, we had to get off and walk as the bus just returned to where we started. A real waste of 54 euros!The ordinary bus and metro stops are all close to major attractions so I would suggest this way of getting around.

Our continental breakfast was amazing and the room service staff very attentive, and we also had the buffet breakfast for our last day in the lobby where the staff remembered who we were from the day before which was a very friendly gesture. We also relaxed in the bar one evening with some snacks and some drinks which were very good value for money. The only slight downside was that you could hear the Metro from our room quite easily, but it was easy to get used to and seems to be an issue with every hotel in the city. Prior to my stay at the Regina I was staying in the Alimara in the north of the city, miles out from the centre, and people complained about the noise of the traffic there too so I think it's unavoidable. The location of the Regina is perfect - out of the tourist-trap of the Ramblas and close enough to the north of the main street for the Gaudi houses and the nicer restaurants.

Go to their websites they are true to what you will find upon arrival. HUGE PLUS they offer free internet which GREAT and it is reliable...everyone loves free.

As with many hotel rooms, it appears that a request for twin beds yields a bigger 'standard' room than a request for a double bed in the same standard room. Something to keep in mind if you don't want to pay extra for a bigger room! The rooms are a good size, cosy without being tiny - although I know the bigger superior rooms are very spacious. Cleanliness is excellent, although it takes a couple of days to get used to the fact that the room is not made up until early afternoon - a problem only if you are not out for the day. Location-wise the hotel is in a great position - literally a 3min. walk to Las Ramblas, the tourist heart of Bcn, but without the noise and dodgy characters that abound along it, particularly at night. Unusually for Europe in my experience, the hotel also offers free internet access from 3 computers near the bar - not just wifi connectivity which was very handy as I don't carry a laptop. Service-wise the staff are generally excellent. In particular Lucila (I think) who is speedy, efficient but does not sacrifice good service. There is an older man who works there, a Snr, who is much grumpier. One night when I had a number of recommendations for restaurants I asked for directions - he simply told me he didn't know where 2 of them were and was completely uninterested in looking it up for me on the internet. On the other hand, Lucila spent much time clarifying a business address before showing me its location - and even made sure the taxi driver knew exactly where to go! A big difference there. Restaurant recommendations were not bad, but not superb. The hotel sent us to a restaurant called L'Olive, which was nice - but very expensive considering it is just local food. I would rather the hotel provided local restaurants that would have been equally good.

My experience with the hotel staff before AND during the stay was top rate throughout. The General Manager Mr. Sanchez was extremely helpful during the rate inquiry process and answered every email. I'm from Bangkok and took this trip during the Bangkok airport closure first week of December and therefore had to fly out from a military airport 200 km north of Bangkok. This made the trip extremely tiring and I was a zombie when I got into Barcelona after a 20 hour trip. I had to check in early as my flight landed from Singapore at 9 am. The room was ready and they did not charge me extra. Mr. Sanchez surprised me with an exceptionally gracious gesture. First, I had requested for a room with a view over the square during the reservation process but did not expect to be accommodated as I had booked a standard room. Much to my pleasant surprise, he had arranged for a corner room with a perfect view and the bathroom and bedroom area was huge. I strongly recommend Room 410. It was perfect after a long journey. Second, as I was unpacking a knock on the door came and two hotel staff presented me with a bottle of bubbly and two boxes of chocolate covered pistacchio nuts. All complimentary!!! This totally took my tiredness away and I was totally impressed by Mr. Sanchez's hospitality. He even had a welcome note personally signed to welcome me to the hotel. All this is totally unexpected, especially in Europe where you're often put into a room facing another building's wall if you're paying standard rate, and the sincerity and care of the hotel's GM is totally heart warming, the best I've ever experienced in Europe. The room was airy, with floor to ceiling French doors and very bright. Hardwood floor and very comfortable bed and sheets. I had asked for restaurant recommendations and Mr. Sanchez sent a letter under my door with list of top restaurants in Barcelona literally minutes after I'd talked to him on the phone (he is also GM at the next door Pulitzer Hotel). Everything is absolutely first rate at half the price of what you'd have to pay if you were to stay at the Le Meridien just a few blocks down. The location was excellent, just steps from Plc. Catalunya underground station. Thank you again Mr. Sanchez for a wonderful stay in Barcelona. I never had a chance to thank Mr. Sanchez in person as he was on holiday just after my arrival but the service I received was more personal than many other hotels I've stayed at.

Perhaps the noise problem has been addressed since talking and other noise from cleaning staff was kept to a minimum and did not bother us at all.

Good points: 1. Hotel is very central - just off from Placa de Catalunya. Good for almost everything. Top marks for location. 2. Decor and furnishings around hotel are fresh, modern and to a consistently high standard. 3. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. They gave us a map, brochures and booklets of local attractions and events which were very helpful. 4. Room was small but bright, modern and stylish. Flat screen TV, hairdryer, dressing towels, slippers and his & hers toiletry kits (nice touch) supplied but no tea or coffee making facilities though. 5. Room had a modern safe controlled by pin code and didn't cost extra. 6. There's a mini supermarket across the road - buy snacks/drinks here at a fraction of the minibar prices. Things to watch out for: 1. Hotel breakfast runs until noon but was very expensive (12 Euro for basic coffee/juice/croissant or 16 Euro for wider selection) although poor value for money hotel breakfasts seems the norm in big cities. Tip: try the excellent cafes near the hotel including the Happy grill (sounds cheesy, I know!), a five minute walk up Rambla de Catalunya where 2 Euro gets you a croissant and coffee and 5 Euro gets you a freshly squeezed OJ and cooked breakfast with toast. Or try the mini-mart across the street that sells croissants etc. Save your cash for the many amazing (but expensive!) Gaudi buildings that must be seen. 2. Hotel bar very expensive e.g. 8/9 Euro for a whisky. With lots of fantastic bars and cafes in the city, we gave the Regina's a miss. 3. Because of its central location, be prepared for sirens and the very regular rumble of the underground until it shuts for the night. Also the walls seem very thin - you hear everything that's happening around you. 4. The 3rd floor is the smoking floor (all rooms). While the smell wasn't too bad, it's one for non-smokers to avoid if possible. 5. When we checking out, the hotel had added a 7 Euro minibar item to our bill which we disputed although to their credit they did remove it without any fuss. 6. We booked through an online booking site however local tax (7% I think) was not included in the rate we were quoted and was added to the final bill - watch out for this. Recommend Taller de Tapas (lots about) for good food and La Luna (Gothic Quarter, Guinness sign out front) for a very nice bar. Avoid La Pomma and on Rambla and Fargo on either Rambla or Gracia, can't remember which. Recommend Maim cuban bar - amazing setting, very friendly relaxed atmosphere and killer mojitos for 5 Euro! If you're in another party of the town at night e.g. Barrio Gotico or Gracia then a taxi will cost between 6 and 9 Euro to get back to hotel, although metro system is excellent and runs till very late at the weekend, you can get a ten journey ticket (\"T-10\") for 5 or 7 Euro.

It was spacious and nicely decorated with modern dark wood furniture.

We were unlucky to have the cleaner's cupboard just outside our room and at 07:00 in the morning we heard everything they did and said ... very annoying! There is a 1.5 cm gap under the door which makes anything said in the corridor like if said inside your room. While fully equipped with bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, towels etc for 3 people (which is good, you usually have to remind housekeeping of the third person), we thought the bathroom was very small and the double sink next to the bed was weird.

Whilst central and very close to La Ramblas, the Regina enjoys the quiet luxury of being on a street slightly off the main thoroughfare and is therefore not too full on when you don't want it to be. A one minute walk away is the tour bus stop, from where you can gain access to the wondrous cultural and historic sights of Barca. I'd never been on a tour bus but trust me, in Barcelona it is so nice to just tour and jump off at a place you fancy. The room itself was spacious, very clean and well maintained and stylish. Personally I really enjoyed the balcony. Standing there at bedtime or in the morning before heading out and consuming the sights and sounds of such a brilliant place, the different characters and local people just going about their daily business was fascinating. Thinking about it now, I really am not sure if I have ever slept in a more comfy bed. Such good sleep, it was real proper comfort. I also received cake and Cava on my birthday, which was an unexpected surprise and a lovely gesture. The staff at the Regina were great. My lasting impression is of a quiet confidence and professionalism. I was highly impressed on our check out day. I mean OK, most hotels (good ones) have a luggage room but on our check out day I did not feel hassled at all. There was no rush and we were still being treated as guests. We had a small issue with our flight and the super people at reception let us use the hotel phone and generally cared and concerned that we were OK.

Also, as it was my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s birthday on the day of our arrival, he was treated with a delicious birthday cake and bottle of Cava as a surprise. He was delighted by this warm welcome to the beautiful city of Barcelona! The location was ideal; we were based in the hubbub of the city but without the noise and bustle. A 2-minute walk to a city tour bus stop (which is the best way of getting to the hidden and more well-known sights and areas of Barcelona) and Las Rambla (with its marvellous variety of street artists, cafes, markets and people). A 5-minute walk to the enchanting Gothic Quarter and 10 minutes to the Arc de Triamf whilst surrounded by the spectacular architecture of Gaudi. In fact, the Hotel Regina was so well located, everything was within in easy reach. As a couple on a romantic break, we wanted privacy, comfort and a touch of sophistication from our hotel and room. We weren't disappointed. The staff were friendly, non-invasive and very helpful even abiding our poor but eager attempts at speaking Spanish with wide smiles of amusement! The bar seemed more suitable for business/non-intimate guests due to its layout and but was perfect for intimate late night drinks after exploring the city\u2019s nightlife. This is another great appeal of the hotel; with Las Rambla 2 minutes away and its many cobbled side streets leading to mystically lighted and delightful squares, there were an endless variety of bars and restaurants catering for all people, tastes and budgets - morning, noon and night. The room and en-suite bathroom were very spacious, clean and beautifully designed in modern decor. And now, for the beds! It was like sleeping on a cloud; with no noise from the street or air conditioning (which was superb); this was an amazing experience in itself!

Anytime we left the room the Air conditioning was turned off, resulting in a considerably warmer room upon our return.

We brought both of these problems to the front desk after our first night, even explaining where the shower was leaking from and nothing was done to correct either problem.

The hotel is located 2 minutes from Plaza Catalunya and could not be in a better location to get around the city. We got the airport bus in which leaves you off outside the Corte Ingles right opposite the street the hotel is on. When we arrived, check in was quick and the staff could not be more helpful. They gave us a family room for 4, a triple room for 3 and a superior double which also had an extra partition with a bed in it. The rooms all had bottles of champagne, large bathrooms with 2 sinks and lots of toiletries. The beds were huge and very comfortable and each room had a 32 inch plasma screen. We asked for rooms on the first floor and they were all located together so it was like having your own little section of the hotel. I contacted the manager who is also manager of the award winning Hotel Pultzier which is next door and we were also able to use their amenities too. The manager arranged for us to have rooms plus breakfast, which turned out to be the best choice and well worth the extra money. It was a buffet breakfast with a variety of breads/ croissants/ cakes/ cheeses/juices/ cereals/ tortillas/ fresh fruit and salads and more.. The staff were extremely helpful, in particular Lucila who heled us get concert tickets. The food in the hotel is really good and reasonably priced and the bar staff make sure everything is perfect for you. For some of the group, it was our 2nd time in Barcelona and it was even better this time around. before we stayed in Barceloneta beside the beach which is a bit of a trek into the city centre. Everything is within walking distance of Hotel Regina and it really helps when you have somewhere luxurious to come back to when you have had a long day playing the tourist.

We were looking forward to a spacious, comfortable room and good service. On arriving at the hotel at 1pm on a Saturday we were impressed with the pleasant and quiet reception ( the surrounding area is extremely busy and in retrospect not the place for a relaxing break). However, we were greet by a middle aged male receptionist who was less then helpful or friendly. We were told we could could either have the 4th or 1st floor, on asking which room was nicer he simply shrugged. We took the 4th floor, however on opening the door of room 421 were greeted with a room the size of a matchbox with NO window and right next to the maids room. As this was Saturday and were paying 224 Euros for the night, this was unacceptable and I returned to reception to request the room on the 1st floor. The receptionist was not pleasant about this and grumbled in Spanish to his colleague and waived his hands in the air. The bell boy took us to room 107 and on the way confided that they always had problems with room 421. Room 107 was just as small but did have a window, as we had no choice we took it ( I must comment there was no cava or chocolates either) However, on arriving home late on Sunday night we were overwhelmed by the stench of sewage coming up through the drains in the bathroom. We informed reception who were already aware of the problem but had not tried to contact us. They then moved us to room 202 and we had to pack our things at midnight to switch rooms. Again 202 was a very small room. On the Sunday we had also asked the bell boy for a restaurent recommendation and were recommended Case De Tapes which was nearby, as far as we could tell there were no Spanish eating in this restaurent , only tourists. It was an unpleasant atmosphere, it was overpriced and the food was below average.

We ended up staying here by default due to a problem with the aircon in our original hotel. ( See review on Casa Camper). The transfer was handled beautifully.From the moment we arrived things looked up. There is an air of understated elegance as you enter which is most relaxing after the bustle of the outside world. The manager appeared from the sister hotel next door to welcome us, bedraggled and bereft of sleep, and we were shown to our room. Unfortunately, we did not get the cava and chocolates that other reviewers have mentioned, but I suspect that it was simply the nature of our arrival that resulted in this ommission! The room was light, airy, spacious and, most importantly, the aircon worked! The room had a relaxed contemporary feel, anhanced by the simple colour scheme. The bathroom was somewhat small, but adequate. The alcove for the sofa bed was fine. Television, mini bar, safe, toiletries were all present. There was plety of storage space. We found the beds to be comfortable and slept reasonably well- except for the noise outside. Having complained in the previous hotel we had stayed in, I was slow to make a big deal here- but I would recommend travellers to request a quiet room. Breakfast was super. The selection was very good- and though one could not get eggs, omelletes etc cooked to order, there was plenty to choose from...Breads, rolls, toast, fruits, yogurts, croissants,pastries, caprese salad, cold meats,cheeses, scrambled eggs, sausages and sauteed potatoes, teas coffee, juice....essentially a very good choice. The breakfast room itself was light and airy and offered views on 2 sides of the streets outside; so one could just eat breakfast and watch the world go by. The location of this hotel is second to none- 2 minutes from the Placa Catalunya, where the tour buses leave; and 2 minutes from Las Ramblas pedestrian street. Taxis are easy to get if you want to travel farther afield. We visited the bar in the Pulitzer- a little of the poser crowd, but pleasant. The bar in the Regina was relaxed, intimate and I was able to sip my wine and read my book while the boys spent 45 minutes on the computers. I appreciated the faact that I could watch them easily from the bar....and that there was no cost for this service. Speaking of cost, I do not know whether I gto a good deal or not. Due to the hotel change, I was offered the room for the same rate as the casa camper. I suspect that I lost out but , to be honest, was so pleased to be gone from the other hotel that I did not even query it. My views were mixed on the reception/concierge staff. Some were very helpful. Others not so much. Unfortunately, i cannot remember the names. On arrival we were given a booklet on Barcelona. I chose 2 Italian restaurants and asked reception to book them. I was advised that the restaurants did not take bookings and that we could just take a taxi. Reception booked us a taxi at 715 but when we arrived we found that the restaurant did not open until 830. This meant that we had to walk around for over an hour- not such a nice prospect with an 8 and 11 year old in tow, after a long day touring! We called into the Astoria hotel for a drink to pass the time and got chatting to the concierge; who telephoned the resaurant and booked it for us.On return to our hotel, I mentioned to the reception staff that booking was possible . Surprise was expressed! I asked him to book another restaurant for the next night but, again, was told that it was not possible. I asked him to check...and the reservation was made! I feel that if a hotel if giving these guides to its guests, it should be familiar with things like opening hours and reservation policies. As someone with children, it is very important to me to plan carefully. Regarding the restaurants; we like Italian, so the following may help other travellers:- Ottimo - enric granados 95 : we loved this stylish place. food was exquisite. lovely for a romantic meal for 2- though my romantic meal with my sons was also most enjoyable. Lovely pea and asparagus starter, consomme with ravioli, beef, pasta. This is not a pizza joint. A classy experience. i Sapori dItalia- Aribau 152_ Again, we enjoyed lunch here. Choice of set menu or a la carte. Good choice. Pizza available. We ate here twice. Non solo pizza enric granados? - what a charming little place. Great buzz, great food. small simple menu with daily specials. No pizza but great pasta. My sons loved the steak here. Very limited wine choice- but the athmosphere is great. One word of warning: the idea of Starters does not really apply here. We ordered caprese salad and 2 penne arrabiatta to begin but the portions were monstrous. When the bill arrived I realised that there is one size, one price ....so maybe share the salad..or just stick to main course...and lovely tiramisu and sorbet. We ate here twice. We ate at one pizza joint near familia sagrada- cant remember the name- piazzente??recommended on this site but, in our opinion,- it was awful. Undercooked pizza with too much mozzarella, unclean tables and place almost empty. If you like Italian choose from Ottima, I Sapori dItalia or non solo pizza. We did the bus tour on 2 days- great way to see the city. Luckily, it was sunny. The day we went to the aquarium it lashed rain. My boys loved this place. We also went to the Cosmo Caixa, which I highly recommend. It is a great experience, with lots of interactive educational fun for everyone. In all, I would highly recommend the Hotel Regina. Were we to go back to Barcelona we would stay there. However, I feel that it is not a city i would rush back to anytime soon. We have the sense of \"been there, done that\"; and it may be hard to broaden the experience until the children are older. That said, the same is true of any city when you have youngsters!

We have both been to Barcelona several times before so we knew the area, the hotel is in an excellent location just of Catalunya Sq, 5 mins from La Rambla. Don\u2019t get a cab from the airport, take the bus it\u2019s 4 Euros from the airport and runs every 10 mins and stops in Catalunya Sq, get of the bus look across the square for the BBVA clock and Habitat, the hotel in 2 mins walk across the square between the two buildings. We were in Barcelona for my birthday, we booked a superior room and requested a high floor room with street view. We arrived at 11am expecting to be told you can leave your bags as the room is not ready, not so, checked in OK as the room was ready (I would not expect this though, as the time we went was a quiet one) upstairs to rm 405 \u2013 high floor, street view !! 5 mins later their was a knock at the door, a bottle of Cava and two glasses with a birthday wish compliments of the hotel ! Our room was large, clean, bright and airy it felt more like we were in an apartment than a hotel room, the only slight disappointment was that we had two single beds pushed together to make a double rather than just a double, but it was very comfy all the same. Some people have commented about train noise etc. We didn\u2019t experience any of this, in fact once the balcony doors were shut outside traffic noise etc was virtually non existent. All areas of the hotel we found were clean and tidy at all times. The hotel bar (at the time we were their) was quiet, I would recommend the cocktail bar at the Pullitzer next door (part of the same group) I stay away through work quite often and make a point of avoiding eating in any of the hotels I stay in. My wife commented on how whenever we go away the first nights meal is always the worst as you never know where to go and are just to tired to bother. If you have dinner at the Pullitzer next door on the first night I guarantee you will not be disappointed, the food is superb. We didn\u2019t have breakfast at the hotel \u2013 got up to late ! I\u2019d avoid the diner/restaurant across the road (rude & surly staff) Starbucks is 20 yards left out of the hotel. The last time we were in Barcelona we had lunch at one of the many outside eateries on the Ramblas, my advice avoid this overpriced tourist fare, go into the market on the Ramblas and head for the \u2018eat at bars\u2019 at the back the food is cooked fresh while you wait in front of you and is very good. Whilst we are talking about food L\u2019 Olivia (left out of the hotel, cross the road and up the passage between the shops) is very good. I would definitely avoid Les Quinze Nits in Placa Reial just of the Ramblas, we queued for an hour to be served tasteless food and when we complained the manager said \u2018how do we know what it should taste like\u2019 !! with your back to Les Quinze look to the left corner of the square and go to Santa Monica, good food, great staff. If you go down to the marina/Port Vell, Luz de Gas (the blue boat) is a must, the atmosphere and the tapas is excellent though you will have to queue if the sun is out ! but once you have sat down your table is yours to soak up the sun and atmosphere for as long as you want it. If however the queue is to long walk past Luz de Gas to the history museum, take the lift to the 4th floor (entry is free) the caf\u00e9 serves superb food and if it\u2019s sunny you can eat the superb food on the terrace with excellent views over the marina.

As an American who speaks very little Spanish (and certainly no Catalan), I was put at ease by the staff who spoke very good English and were extremely accomodating. Both the front desk and bar staff called taxis on a moment's notice, filled all requests for needs in a timely manner and were very helpful with directions and providing local information about transportation, restaurants, etc. The room was modern, comfortable and included most of the usual ammenities (no coffee maker). Hairdryer was not very powerful and there was no iron (but desk provided one upon request). Unfortunately, my room was next to the maid's closet, close to the elevator, and view was of a small airshaft (from which I could hear the people in the same room on other floors when my windows were open). I believe it was room # 12 (212, 312, etc). If you get this room I would suggest moving as it is very noisy. I am returning in April and the front desk suggested I book a room at the front of the building. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel, as the cost was 17 Euros ($25 US), which seemed quite overpriced, but there are several places nearby to get breakfast or coffee - Starbucks, Cafe Catalunya, etc. The bar at the hotel is quiet and relaxing. My coworkers and I found it a great place to relax and have a cocktail after returning from dinner most nights. The location is very convenient, as the subway has several stops within a few blocks, the tourbus stops at the end of the block on Placa de Catalunya and, of course, the infamous Las Ramblas. Las Ramblas is about as touristy as it gets (do NOT eat there), but I would highly recommend visiting the market. As I'm sure you have heard already, be very aware of pickpockets. One of my coworkers was targeted on the subway and almost had her camera stolen out of her purse which was inside her backpack!

The hotel sits on a street not far from Las Ramblas in an old building that has been redecorated in modern European style. My room, while not large was attractively decorated and had french doors leading to a Juliet balcony overlooking the street. As far as I was concerned this was worth the cost of admission. The bed was comfortable and in a alcove and out of the way. There were great Bath amenities and the Bathroom was good sized and well appointed. I still don't get the glass half door thing on the tub, but there you go. There is a great bar although one night it was full of unpleasant americans (and I am an American) and a decent restaurant in the sister hotel next door. I had breakfast that came with the meal and the breakfast was excellent and the room attractive The location is great near the main plaza, Las Ramblas and El Corte Angles (great department store) is nearby. There is a tourist bus stop across the way. I found it conveniant to walk to many things. A few caveats (which would not keep me from going back) Several times early in the AM someone would rattle the room door And the staff while friendly and efficient was unable to cash a travellers cheque or convert currency which I found odd.

We were greeted by the Manager who took details of our missing baggage report and said the hotel would look after the enquiries.

We had a room with shower only ,but it was big enough for a whole group to use. The bed was very comfortable, I don't think I slept in better. As a previous reviewer has stated, there were some really good toiletries- essential in our case as our luggage was still in England somewhere. Then our next surprise, room service arrives with a complimentary bottle of Cava and cake to celebrate my wife's birthday. The look on my wife's face said it all.

Believe me, I looked through nearly every hotel in Barcelona! I chose Hotel Regina because it ticked all of the boxes and because the manager had taken the time to respond to tripadvisor (always a good sign!). Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely woman at reception who was all smiles. Nothing was too much trouble either. We were given a guide to Barcelona and a map (another nice touch). Our room was on the fifth floor and overlooked the small square where the hotel backed on to. About 5 minutes after we arrived, one of the bar staff came to the room with a complimentary bottle of cava and some chocolate pistachios. Amazing! Now to the room. It was everything I'd hoped for and more! The bed was deleriously comfortable; the room was very spacious and the furnishings modern. Included in the room was: room heating controls, free wi-fi, desk, mini-bar (packed full with snacks and drinks), in-room safe, 2 wardrobes, 2 sinks, his and hers toiletries (what a nice idea!), hairdryer, flat-screen tv, phone. In the separate bathroom was the toilet, bidet, combined bath/shower, bathrobes, shelving area and slippers. Honestly, I didn't want to go home. There were some particular small touches like the individual toiletries and Barcelona postcards that made it special. The staff were impeccable. The bar staff / room service staff in particular were incredibly helpful and accommodating. When we arrived back at the hotel with a cheap bottle of wine bought in a supermarket, the staff brought up an ice bucket to use and also included some chips / nuts for us as well. Nothing seemed too much trouble. We asked for a hotel recommendation in the area and the man on duty reserved us a hotel at the excellent (and highly recommended) L'Olive. The location of the hotel is excellent. We caught the Aerobus direct from the airport (\u20ac3.90 per ticket) and it was only about a 200m walk across Placa de Catalunya to the hotel. We walked everywhere in Barcelona, but the metro and the bus stops are only a very short distance away as well. The bar area was wonderfully decorated and the drinks were cheap (coming from Ireland it was a nice surprise!). We didn't use the computers provided but there was 3 or 4 for use (including a printer as well). We also didn't use the gym/pool facilities in their sister property (too much to do!). Now, to suggest some improvements! Tea/coffee facilities in the room would have been really welcome, but I did look through a lot of hotels and it didn't seem to be the norm in Barcelona. We had come prepared with a travel kettle so weren't put off at all. As some others have noted, the walls are a bit thin between the rooms and the corridors. This didn't bother me at all, but if you're a light sleeper it may affect you. If I returned to Barcelona, I wouldn't look at any other hotel.

My 10yr old son and I stayed here over Christmas for a wonderful week and this was a real treat. The location is fantastic - incredibly central for walking, public transport, airport buses and the Bus Touristic (highly reccommend doing this) with hot and cold running taxis and lots of great food nearby esp on Rambla de Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia. But the rooms are really quiet - no street noise unless you open the balcony doors. There is a lovely smell when you come into the hotel and everyone on reception was welcoming, efficient, friendly and helpful. On Christmas Day we had an unprompted phone call from reception to say that they were there to help us with anything we needed. On our last day, they were happy to bring down and store our bags until we left for the airport at 4pm which was a great relief - nothing was too much effort. I had emailed the manager Mr Sanchez (who impresses me by replying to every review on tripadvisor) to ask if we could have a twin, non smoking and street view room on a higher floor and he accommodated us completely giving us a huge room on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel. The rooms are in the \"Minimalist\" style but luxurious, very comfortable and CLEAN! The beds are fantastic we had a twin room and the singles are huge and very comfortable! Gorgeous cotton sheets that seemed to be changed daily - not 100% on this but the pillow cases certainly were. Big fluffy towels changed daily if you wanted and a good selection of toiletries and things like razors, shower caps etc. Black out curtains under the main ones are a great idea, especially for those early summer sunrises. The huge telly was a bonus with BBC/CNN News, National Geographic and music channels as well as the rest. Took along a portable DVD player that can be run through a TV which came in very handy for playing the odd film. In our room, the sink was in the room which works well when two of you need to get ready. A little dissapointed with the tiny bathroom. In 502 there is a shower and a loo and whilst the shower is lovely and powerful the sealants are a little grubby. It looked like the chambermaids gave it a good clean but it needs something more drastic! Wouldn't have minded relaxing in a bubble filled bathtub after a day spent on the feet but then I did not specify a bath! And our room was huge. The safe was easy to use and a pefect size. A very welcome fruitbowl is a thoughtful touch. There is no noise between rooms but you can hear noise from the hallway. Perhaps the doors could be soundproofed during the next renovation...Because we were in Barcelona to sightsee, I didn't mind hearing the chambermaids in the morning as it got me up but I can see that this could be a problem if you wanted to lie in.. Had breakfast in our room on Christmas day and wow - fresh, great selection of pastries and cheese and gorgeous coffee/juice and brought up with a cheerful smile and hola! When we got back early that evening, we had been left a gourmet foodie present and card! Didn't try the breakfast room as we were never really hungry in the morning having eaten so late the night before...The bar area is great - super service and a nice place to chill out. The internet had a fast connection - made a few restaurant bookings via toptable (reccommend doing so for 7 Portes) and also checked in and printed off our boarding cards the night before we left. Can see where this would get busy when the hotel is full...(Oh by the way Mr Sanchez, the printers need ink as they are running low..) We got a little lost getting off the airport bus when we arrived (in the rain and in the dark - not my best thing) and would like to mention that the hotel is located on a street (Bergara) off the Placa Catalunya, opposite to the El Corte Ingles side (which is where the airport bus stop is) in what is known as the Triangle which houses FNAC (our point of reference from then on) and Habitat.
