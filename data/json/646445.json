The facade is old, but the bulding inside is new. Take the subway the connect with the tram, refuse the shuttle because it's a nightmare to drive through the city. Or jump from the minibus when you reach the tram line and take it, it's much faster. The location is close to Topkapi, Galata Brigde and to the ferries at Eminonu. Tram stop right behind. The lobby has a kitchy feel, big as a train station, high chandeliers, polished marble and grotesque golden armchairs. Some rooms have windows opening in this lobby, you don't want to book that ! Staff relatively helpful, but not very smart. We had to repeat a few times that we want a quiet room, on a higher floor (they kept offering us 1st floor). The room is BIG !. Beautiful proportions, high ceillings. We had 3 arched windows, separated by pillars. Not very good sound insulation, but the area is not noisy, it's rather dead at night. Open view, overlooking a mosque and a cemetery, quite atmospheric. Some stains on the carpet. Good quality bedding and sheets, like in international hotels. Pleasant, overall, elegant. The bad surprise was the bathroom ! Mold stains between the tiles. Yellow stains on the tub and the sink. Every narrow corner was dirty. Really unhygienic and disgusting. Have they heard of scrubbing brushes? The breaksfast is on the top floor, in a warehouse-sized space. Abundant but not refined. Cheeses and raw vegetables mostly.

The room was really small and the only window was inside the hotel, over the reception. Therefore there was no possibility of having air ricirculation or natural light.

Rooms: They all of different size, as I saw about 30 rooms before group arrival. Some are very small, like broom closet, some are nice with view.
