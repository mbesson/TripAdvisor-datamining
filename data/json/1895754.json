We stayed at a number of places during the trip, but none measured up to The Palazzo Donizetti in terms of service, value, location, and amenities. I could go on about the ways that this hotel distinguished itself from others-- for instance, the small on-site spa is a very nice perk-- but it really was the staff that made our stay so enjoyable. From the moment we first walked through the door we were greeted with friendly smiles and hearty welcomes. Despite not having a reservation, we were treated like welcome guests. During our stay, the staff expressed a genuine interest in making sure that our time in Istanbul was a pleasant as possible. No detail was spared. From the bell captain who asked us every day about our most recent exploits to the doorman who secured for us only the most trusted taxi drivers. If you are going to Istanbul, you should stay at Palazzo Donizetti. Unlike the sleepy confines of Sultanahmet where good restaurants and bars are tough to find after dark, the neighborhood around this hotel is alive until the wee hours of the morning. And yet it is close enough to the major tourist attractions (e.g. Ayasofya, the Spice Bazaar, etc...) that you could get to them in a matter of minutes. And, it is luxurious enough that you will get a good night's rest before traipsing back out into the busy streets of Istanbul. In short, the Palazzo Donizetti should be your first and last choice when looking for a place to stay in Istanbul.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPerfection\u201d", "Author": "sselhorst", "ReviewID": "UR127783424", "Content": "My boyfriend and I have always preferred to stay in different areas of the cities we travel to, and we have never in years stayed at one hotel for more than 2 days at a time. On this trip, even while we made plans to move each day to another location, we were ultimately unable to rip ourselves away from our home away from home, and ended up staying a record 7 days, knowing that we were unlikely to find anything as wonderful elsewhere. Having wandered in off the street looking for a hotel for that evening, we were offered the corner suite at what I would consider a ridiculously reasonable rate, considering the size and beauty of the room and the amenities offered. The staff were not only helpful and professional, but personable, authentically friendly and genuine in a manner that is unusual to find in the industry. The bedding and shower were both heavenly, the view spectacular and the location ideal. Also, they offer access to the their steam room and sauna at no extra charge. It was very loud, but not in a way that I would consider noisy. All of the ambient sound was that of the street and the music from the neighboring club on the weekends (the music was stellar as well), and not the noise of construction trucks or other undesirable nuisances. I am a girl who likes to sleep to the sounds of the city, however, so I would recommend an interior room to those who prefer silence at bedtime (and Istanbul never sleeps!). All in all, I miss my home away from home and all of the friendly faces that greeted me there. The Palazzo Donizetti has my highest recommendation.

The hotel is very near a large cosmopolitan shopping boulevard which has all the big designer label shops, fashion stores, shoe stores and expensive cafes and is in quite an expensive part of the city- great if 1. you like shopping in all the usual shops no matter what country you are in and 2. you have a few quid with you! We were aware that the hotel had just opened. Our room was nice though my boyfriend who had made the booking via an online agent was un-sure of whether we were allocated the correct type of room. Our room was not very big and located at the side of the building so had no view and overlooked a narrow side street. The shower in the bathroom was on its way to falling out of the ceiling! the hotel was lovely looking though appeared to show evidence of some cheap builders work! The lift stopped working on several occasions with us in it! it basically stops and you stand there in darkness for about 10 seconds and then it starts again. The receptionist gave us some reason for it why it does that.....though this is not really acceptable if you are not as easy going as we are and are paying alot more money to stay there! The hotel is still un-finished and I am sure will have a lovely roof terrace and other facilities when it is finished. The breakfast is good though the hotel was very quiet and there were 3-4 staff working on the breakfast shifts. on the second morning I felt quite uncomfortable as we were only 2 of 3 guests eating breakfast and the staff just kept pacing up and down, up and down, the restaurant, trying to look attentive, though clearly had nothing to do as there were only 3 guests eating and the staff were actually just quite annoying! i would have liked to have eaten my breakfast without the continuous passing of the waiter next to our table, who was just walking past, looking out of the window, and then walking back, and then again. I have worked in the hotel industry for the past 9 years and did not feel that this pacing was of any benefit to us as guests. on check-out we were charged 8% tax on top of our bill which was unexpected, the receptionist told us we could claim it back at the airport- we could not as the airport told us hotels were not included for tax reclaim (?!!) we need to investigate this further as it is not good if the reception staff are giving out incorrect information.
