We got a room with a window facing fabbri street, so you can hear everything going on there, like in the morning when they are opening all the business places (metal doors rolling up), but I kind of like that, that way you have an early start and enjoy Venice. Even if you have a map of Venice you will get lost half the time, so we just put the map away and walk on! ( and so did most the people there!) its nice just to get lost and keep on walking cause anywhere you go is nice.. The guy on the reception was Mario, he speaks English, Spanish, french,and 3 other languages. Breakfast included witch is the same stuff in all the hotels in Italy, coffee, juice, different types of bread, cereals, milk, ham, cheese, salami, fruit etc. The only thing we didn't like much was the shower that its on a bath tub with no liner, so you get water all over but just use the extra towels for the floor and you are fine, you will get fresh towels everyday, at least is better then Paris were the shower was just a bathtub with no liner and no shower head! remember you are in Europe.

The room had all you'd expect for this type of hotel - TV, safe, hairdryer etc. The bed was comfy but the aircon was playing up so it was a little too hot for me to sleep properly. Breakfast was a continental affair and fairly average, the usual meats, cheese, bread, cereal etc. I only have a couple of minor gripes about the hotel, first was the weird waiting area on the 2nd floor which seemed to attract people congregating on a night causing noise - quite why they didn't put an extra room there instead is beyond me. Second was the faulty aircon which could not be turned off heating mode. Overall though, a good hotel, well worth what we paid and in a fantastic location for exploring the city.

Our other arrangements fell through and we ended up scrambling to find a new place to stay during our time in Venice. We REALLY lucked out. Gorizia is located about halfway between the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco. Which made it really easy to see those spots as well as pretty much anything around them. The really nice thing about the location of this hotel is that it's pretty close to water bus (#1 bus I believe) and there is only one small bridge to go over. If you are familiar with Venice's layout, only having to cross one small bridge (if you take the water bus to the Rialto stop) is a huge plus. Getting all of our luggage to the hotel was really easy. Most of the hotels that are more accessible are far more expensive. My group was about 8 people, and each member of our party was happy with the accommodations. We were traveling to get to my wedding so we had a mix of friends and family which included a big age range and everyone was easily accommodated at the hotel. Ease of access was good and there was a small elevator (not always a guarantee in Venice) which helped my people get their bags to their rooms. The air conditioning was strong and easy to control, which was great because it was HOT when we were passing through. The hotel itself was clean and quiet. The rooms were a comfortable size, mine included a \"daybed\" that was the size of a couch as well as a queen sized bed for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I. There was plenty of room for our bags and to have a guest or two sit and relax. The shower had great pressure and there was plenty of hot water.

As it was Carnivale, we knew finding another room elsewhere would be difficult but we eventually found another room in a much nicer hotel for a lower price and it was clear from our search that day that we were getting completely ripped off at the Hotel Gorizia as our decrepit room was $400 USD per night. Upon returning to the hotel to claim our things and go elsewhere, we found that there was only a security guard on-staff who claimed he didn't have access to the system and could not cancel our reservation and that we must cancel in the morning when the front desk staff returned. Knowing that we wouldn't have enough time to return before our flight the next day, we were forced to spend the night and discovered a number of additional surprises in the room. My sister's bed was stained with blood and she was forced to sleep on top of towels. The shower door was broken so that it didn't close and the bathroom was drafty. There was mold on the lampshades and dust everywhere. The doors don't lock securely as they lack a deadbolt and the hotel did not turn on the heat all night even though temperatures outside were in the 30's (farenheit).

Hotel was easy to find. Take Ali lugana to San Marco enter the square then take a right at cafe quadri, 500m. The ride is about 1hr but if u want to go a bit faster take the Ali Luguna to Rialto. Checkin was easy. Staff spoke english and was very helpful. This hotel has a lift and we stayed on the 3 third floor. The hotel was decorated in Venetian style. The room was big and clean. I wasn't too keen on the clothlike wallpaper. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was clean and there was a powerful shower with toiletries provided. The room was nice and warm especially after walking in from 7 degrees outside. We then noticed that the room got really warm, actually hot to the point of being uncomfortable. I tried to turn the heater down but it was broken. I had no choice but to open the window which cooled the room down nicely. Breakfast was continental. Usual cheeses,ham,bread,cereals,yogurt and juices. There is lot of room and it starts from 730-1030 so quite good if u wanted to lay in a bit late. Venice is a nice city, loads to do and see and loads of places to eat. I found it difficult to choose. I ate at restaurants with pictures and with an english menu. But that was a mistake i think and they are tourist traps. The food at these places didn't taste bad but it wasn't value for money. It would have been better to eat at the true Italian restaurant. I would recommend doing all the usual sites and going up the tower as u get great views. I didn't take a Gondola ride but I think its worth it, these guys have to maneuver the boat for an hour not easy I think, when I went the lowest price was 40 Euros. I took the boat up and down the grand canal it was great, 40minutes one way. If u like soft drinks I would recommend buying them from the supermarket. Lol. On the 2nd nite, the room was getting unbearably hot again and with the window open the mosquitoes had a field day. I should have asked to move to a room where the heater wasn't broken. My partner was bitten like so many times and it made sleeping very difficult bcz of the buzzing. With the window open, its wasnt too noisy. I liked the location of this hotel, the first nite sleep was great but after that it was just too hot and the mosquitoes was bad. I am not sure what happens in the summer. The hotel had wifi but it was 8 euros for 1hr.

The next day we discovered that there was another operator, Swisscom, not contracted by the hotel, whose signal could be picked up on the first floor, for the same price. The rooms are very very old, which is normal considering that we are talking about Venice. But they could be better decorated. To get to the bathroom, we had to climb three steps. There was a bar nearby with loud music until late. The hallway had a very unpleasant smell, sewage-like. The breakfast is simple but satisfactory.

Thank goodness for the breakfast room staff for her warm service and a few tips to help us negotiate our way back to the train station on departure day. It only took us 5-7 minutes to find the vaporetto stop and we only had to climb up one small bridge. Although the breakfast was excellent, management might want to upgrade the TV size in large rooms.

We had a wet room style bathroom which seems great as it feels bigger, but everything does get soaked, so put your toilet paper in the bedroom when you shower! My main complaint with the hotel would be the bathroom smelled of sewerage every morning. After they cleaned it and all day/evening it would be fine, but in the morning it was unbearable. Friends in the next room to ours had no problem. Lucky us! The breakfast was really good for a continental one - there were croissants, about 6 types of bread, butter, cheeses, meats, cereal, muesli, jams, yoghurts and lots of fresh fruit. One tip to save some money: In Venice, drink water and don't touch the bread! Drinks were about 5 euros (even for a coke) whereas water was usually about 2 euros. They put a basket of bread and breadsticks out on the table wherever you go, but if no one eats any they don't charge you for it.

It drove us crazy because he could see us standing there and he would glance over then ignore us. I think one time we waited 5 minutes (which is a LONG time when you are staring at him chit chatting on the phone). Anyhow, I didn't pay all that money to be treated like a pain in the butt. Too bad.

When they didn't get a reply (it was our honeymoon...) they phoned and asked us to leave the room as a maintenance man needed to deal with the bathroom. Apparently the fact that our bath wasn't sealed properly meant that water was sporadically leaking into a room below - though not at that precise moment, I hasten to add. I told the lady that they'd have to give me us twenty minutes to freshen up, but she seemed quite cross that the guy was to be kept waiting. I think this should have been arranged with us in advance, we wouldn't have minded at all with a bit of forewarning, but it did seem a little harsh to be kicked out with no notice.

No tray or anything to put the soap on. We had no problem with flooding as others did. The continental breakfast is good, but no fresh fruit or eggs. The Rialto market is a 10 minute walk away. Go there and get fruit at a good price. I'm baffled by the previous reviewer who complained of an unfriendly staff. Same with the smell of urine. We found the halls very clean and both the day and night desk people polite and genuinely caring. As for restaurants, the biggest surprise is that so many of them serve pizza. And if you order a glass of wine or beer they give you a small bowl of potato chips. For every round, more potato chips. Seafood is the big thing in most restaurants and, of course, pasta. Veal seems to be more popular than beef. If you're on a budget there's something to be said for the Tourist Menus. Most restaurants have a cover charge just to sit down. And the better places have a cover charge and tip included with the bill. Places who don't have a cover charge advertise this. It can be as high as 3 Euros per person. Definitely check out The Lido. We didn't know much about it, but when we got there (a 10-minute vaporetto ride) we found it breathtaking. No canals. Cars. You get off at the dock and walk straight down the main street (or take a bus) and after 10 minutes you're at a beautiful beach and the Adriatic Sea. If you have a good map and comfortable shoes, you can explore all of Venice on foot. It's not as big as it seems. We thought we'd be jumping on and off vaporettos and we didn't take one. The Gondola rides are tricky. The cost can be 80-120 Euros (music is extra, so is a night ride). The gondoleers are more like carnival hucksters trying to lure customers. Some are charming and funny, others have attitudes. However, at about 8 locations on the Grand Canal there are stops called tragettos where gondolas will take you across the canal for 1 Euro.

Hotel Gorizia wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the top hotel in the ratings, but any bad comments it had seemed quite trivial. As it turned out it was ideally sited, probably 10min walk from St Marco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square. I had looked at hotels on the main-land and on the spit of land called The Lido, intending to travel into Venice for days out, but that would have been a bad, bad mistake as we would have missed out on the night life and spent an awful lot of time on water busses. ( more about water busses later). So location is excellent. Its looks were deceptive, not a very imposing reception area but the bedroom was very Venation \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style and had everything you need for a weekend stay. The window view wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, but then we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to experience Venice through a window, you can do that at home watching travel programs on TV. My only real gripe would be the wet room shower in the bathroom, where the floor gets completely soaked unless you position towels around the base to hold in the flood! Tip No.1 ! The breakfast was of typical continental style \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ham, cheese , bread etc.. etc but was of good standard and sufficient for us. The people on the desk were genuinely helpful and spoke some English \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however I find you will always get a better service if you learn some \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplease / thank-you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phrases in the native tongue\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and of course it makes it more fun. I had a bag lost on the flight in from Schiphol, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear on the baggage carousel, there were lots of other disappointed travellers that day too. But (Tip No.2 ) we had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccross packed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 our bags so I was not completely without a change of clothes. Indeed if you do lose a bag, always get a form from the airport the form stating when/ where / times etc as you will find the insurance folk will want this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but we all learn this way. The hotel desk staff insisted on making a call to the airport to chase up my lost bag, , so they were keen to correct this failure. So plus points for the hotel on this one. We opted to collect the bag from the airport when it arrived from Brussels or somewhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this potentially wasted half a day on those noisy & hot water busses (this was Aug, so hot anyway). We probably should have trusted the Italian delivery service and requested delivery to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but at the time I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced.

Here are the highlights: (1) Location - can't beat it. As soon as I walked out the door I could take a left and walk to Piazza di San Marco in 10 minutes or hang a right and end up in Rialto in 15. And I loved every step of the way in either direction. (2) Adorable rooms. I lucked out with a queen sized bed with plenty of floor space, but what really captured my imagination was the antique-style Venetian furniture including an ornate headboard, armoire and writing desk. (3) Top notch service. The staff was polite (certainly not overly effusive which works for me) and as a woman traveling alone, I appreciated their custom of taking my key as a left the Hotel and having a doorman ready 24/7 to let me back in. There were a few minor details that cast a slight shadow over my stay. The one small window in my room faced a stucco wall. The lobby was restrained to say the least, but that is to be expected of smaller hotels. The continental breakfast was unimpressive, but the 10 pounds I lost during my short stay more than made up for it's poor performance. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for anyone seeking an affordable option and would stay there again if I wasn't driven by the need to patronize nearly every hotel on the planet.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location in a wonderful city\u201d", "Author": "032610b", "ReviewID": "UR6185682", "Content": "We based our decision to stay here on the reviews from tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed.
