We are studying abroad in Spain and on a tight college student budget, but splurged a tiny bit because of the occasion.

We bought a Rome map at termini station to find the hotel and use during our stay, but once we easily found the hotel they have maps provided. We checked in quickly and the receptionist was very nice and funny. That night we were tired and asked for a dinner recommendation, unfortunately the restaurant they suggested was slightly disappointing, oh well. Breakfast was nice, I loved the chocolate cereal they had. The one pitfall was the level of street noise, but this was my 3rd hotel staying in Italy and all 3 had loud street noise, so I wasn't too surprised. I called down to the front desk for some extra pillows, and he said it would be better if I came down and got them, which was fine with me.

Upon arrival, we were informed that there was some overbooking problem, and that, since we were only booked for one night, they would put us up in an apartment. We followed the guy at reception through a run down yard that displayed open garages filled with stores and old stuff....really very shoddy! We were then given the key to a large glass door. Inside, we found ourselves in a large, rather modern duplex. To be fair, it was clean, but seemed unfinished. We had a choice between two bedrooms, two bathrooms...so all in all, we decided to accept this offer, even if it was rather eerie to stay in this duplex all alone.....walking through that yard in the middle of the night made my wife very uncomfortable. The duplex was air conditioned, and we had a large flat screen t.v.so we couldn't really complain. Breakfast was a continental buffet, with ham, cheese, bread and croissants.

I have to say the morning/afternoon clerk was extremely nice and helpful and the breakfast was decent (you had a wide range of meats, rolls and typical continental breakfast). The location was OK it was a bit of a walk to and from the main attractions maybe 20mins (mainly up and down hill) but we did not mind. It is about 15mins from Termini station which was handy. Unfortunatly the bad overides the good when it comes to this hotel: It was old and tacky. The room, you could not swing a cat in, the Air con (not that it worked) kept me awake every night because it was loud and rattled. The shower is ancient, the walls have carpet material on, the bed spread made me itch and when I got home this afternoon I had bites all over my body. The TV- to be honest I did not see the point in there being a TV because it small and it was like watching TV back in the 90s with the fuzzy reception. The garden/smoking area needs a darn good revamp and it was like sitting in some tacky bar in Benidorm. The night clerk I thought was rude and made me feel unwelcome. I asked for a bottled water and he simply looked distressed at the fact he had to get off his chair. Last night he was carrying water bottles and my boyfriend opened the door for him and he just grumbled at him; not even making the effort to say gratzie or thank you. He was scruffy looking and he stared a lot at us which made me feel uncomfortable. Yes the hotel is budget but for \u00a3100 a night you expect a decent shower, TV and polite staff (only night staff in this case).

Check-in was quick and the gentleman on reception spoke good English. The hotel is located opposite an embassy and the 1st floor room we were given had a small balcony which overlooked the embassy gardens on the road side. Unfortunately the hotel is located on a busy corner and there was quite a bit of loud continuous road noise during the day, but little between 11pm-7am. The room and en suite were on the small side but they were both clean and I found the bed firm but comfortable. Breakfast is basic continental fare: cereal, yoghurt, toast, ham, cheese and croissants. It was fine. There is a metro station about 5-10 minute walk from the hotel but we walked to most of the tourist sites. The Vatican is about a 30 minute walk from the hotel. The metro is good value at 1euro per trip or 4euro for a day pass. I'd stay at the Brasile Hotel again as long as it was one of the cheaper alternatives. *Rome now has a tourist tax, this is 2 euro per night per person and must be paid on check out in cash. *Restaurants near the tourists traps are hideously expensive you can half the cost of a meal by simply walk a few hundred metres away from the crowds. Also watch out for the \"cover charge\" that restaurants and cafe's apply to the bill, some charge it directly others make you pay for the bread they serve at the start of a meal - it's around 10%.

The carpets are really grubby and dirty with stains. The bed linen was dirty and the blankets, i did not want even near my skin.

The bathrooms are incrediably small and you cannot sit even sit on the toilet without the shower being in the way. The mini bar, if thats what you call it had two bottles of water, one of which had been opened by a previous occupier and filled with water from the tap and put back in the mini bar. The lift is quirky, like an old fashioned film, and we laughed about it. the breakfast was the most dissapointing, its just cereal, cold meats and cheeses, bread roll, and dry packets of crispy french toast. There were of course fruit juices and tea and coffee. Its not enough choice for different pallets. Even a toaster and bread would have been better, so we went hungary.

My experience . Booked on line in a hurry and had no choice as most hotels in the area were full. Asked for a double room . Got two single beds pushed together to make a double. My wife found this very upsetting as she prefers to sleep close to the centre of the bed and she kept ending up on the edge of the mattress which was a bit worn out .It did not help her backpain . Pillows were flat by my standard and only two per room. The lift is very small , like many hotels in Rome, and only holds 2 persons in comfort. The firts floor is not served by the lift . The first room which I stayed in , was one of the smallest double I have ever seen. Just enough room to stand tightly around a double bed.The same can be said about the bathroom, so small that I had to go out of it to dry myself with the towel.Towels are paper thin and only two a day are provided. Not enough if a couple take two showers a day. Talked to the reception and was immediately offered and accepted a very nice room on the first floor which was twice the size of the first , with a reasonably sized bathroom. Only used the room to sleep, as spent most time out . Good points : - 1) Receptionists, are older gentlemem who offer good advice and help to all enquiries. 2)Buffet breakfast served at 0700 till 1000 was fair and service was clean. 3)Hotel area is safe , due to patrols by Embassy Security across the road. 4)Well served by the buses just round the corner , which take you to the Vatican and all the Piazzas . 5)Reasonable priced 130 euros for a double . 6) Rooms clean and recently refurbished with double glazed windows and air conditioned . All this was taken in stride , and the Hotel served its purpose,as a base for a short weekend in Rome centre. Unlikely but , If and IF I ever book again, I would ensure that I get a large room, not a squeezed room, and get better towels . I wrote this , to help anyone , but mostly the Management of the hotel, who could fix most of these small problems and make the Brasile a true 3 star Hotel , from the 2 Star which I would rate it , due to these problems.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSmall and Dingy\u201d", "Author": "ZoeBan", "ReviewID": "UR18250762", "Content": "The hotel was very tight, the narrow hallway, the miniscule lift and small room and bathroom.
