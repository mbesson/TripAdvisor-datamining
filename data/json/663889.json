{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A liittle gem of calm We found ourselves stuck at Beijing airport as we had subload tickets and it was a national holiday.Luckily we met a stewardess from Cathay Pacific in the same boat.She took us to the Hutong Inn, having rung her uncle, and negotiated a deal even though it was the last room available. At 220 Ruan/night for 2 B+B it was as cheap to stay 2 nights instead of risking another overbooked flight next day.All the above 4* reviews are correct. Great clean value minutes from the Drum and Bell Towers. Two large curries and beers next door cost \u62e24 total. An easy 30 min walk to the Forbidden City etc.Highly recommended! Thankyou Selina !P.S. The only hotel we stayed in China with BBC World and 2 free movie channels.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR819827171", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Phuqnose"}, {"Content": "A temple of solace within a busy Beijing I had difficulty adapting myself to the chaotic energies I found in Beijing. I expected a calm zen filled experience but was immediately greeted by a torrent of persistent demands for my attention.The Hutong Inn was a marvellous escape from it all.We got picked up from the airport for 200 RMB (Very overpriced) by the manager of the hotel and viewed some of Beijing in all it's magnificent glory during our 20 minute ride to the hotel. The hotel is off the main drag so don't feel worried if, at the end of the ride, you start driving down tiny streets with local people going about their daily business.Passport photocopied and 2 days advance paid we went up to our room and unpacked. Around the same size as a Travelodge room and using a card for door access and electricity. The room was meagre with a basket of local snacks on a dressing table (You pay for what goes missing from the basket, also overpriced) and a small water closet.You can hear the business of the hutong from your room, which consists of neighbours talking, fruit salesmen yelling, kids playing football and the odd motorbike with a swiss cheese exhaust driving by. This in comparison to anywhere else in Beijing is golden silence.The staff were pleasant, had an almost basic grasp of English (with the exception of Vivien and to a lesser extent David, who had almost perfect English) and very efficient. Breakfast was mostly doughballs and pieces of fruit and coffee. As we were leaving China western food had found its way onto an evening menu and seemed to be very popular with guests.The hotel is around a 30 minute walk South from the Forbidden City or a 5 minute walk from a very good underground rail system. There are plenty of shops around and a long street lined with restaurants and bars a stones throw from the door. You can stroll through the hutong and reach the Confucius temple in under an hour. Bicycle hire and booking a taxi for the day can be done from reception (also too expensive).All in all an above average experience for a Chinese hotel/up market backpackers hostel - not really comparably with UK/USA hotels as the constant pursuit of pennies from pocket would put almost everyone off, but this is standard practise across Northern China and allows for the practise of haggling skills (180 RMB is the standard double room fee over Summer in almost every hotel in China - they all come down from their initial prices to this when pushed). As long as you know everything is inflated by at least 300% you should be ok.This hotel, like so many others lacked enough toilet paper to satisfy even a miserly soul like myself.When compared to my overall experience of China; it's an above average, decent place.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR135246418", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "m0r1arty"}, {"Content": "Nice area, mediocre hotel My expectations for this hotel were quite high based on the reviews I had read. Though the location is quite nice, the walls are not thick enough to allow you to sleep through the noisiness of the early-morning hutong. The heating was only available at night and the rooms were not particularly clean. Do not expect rooms to be served if you are staying for multiple days. The service was also very unpleasant.

We changed rooms before the 1st night was over. Room 116, street level, was too close to the alley and very noisy. I think also the fact it was on the 1st floor, it may have had some gnats or fleas. I got a couple of bites on my leg within an hour of laying in bed. Because of the noise we asked to change rooms to something quieter which they happily accomodated. We moved to the 3rd floor (no lift) on the other side of the building and it was fine. The rooms are small but ok for two of us with twin beds. We had a bathroom with a toilet sink and a shower spout tha's not separately enclosed. The whole floor of the bathroom gets wet. The walls are thin and you can easily hear your neighbors down the hall talking or the tv next door. The breakfast provided consisted of toast, Chinese buns, coffee, tea and sometimes eggs. It was ok but they don't start serving until 8am which is late for many people who want to get their day started. Also, the dining room is crowded because by then everyone is waiting for breakfast. The hotel is down an alley but very safe. There's a 24 hr 7-11 type store nearby for drinks and snacks. Several restaurants are also within walking distance. The subway, as someone previously mentioned, is not 250 meters away but more like 800 meters. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. In room free internet was a definite plus for us. I would stay here again but remember it is very basic but clean.", "Date": "Apr 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR366387342", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "highloyo"}, {"Content": "Loved the atmosphere !

It is literally 250 meter from the metro station and also within good proximity to sights like the Drum Tower (you can see the top of the tower from the hotel). We had a double-bed room with a private ensuite and it was wonderful. The room was big, easy to manouver around with the two of us. The bathroom was immaculate and always stocked up everyday with fresh towels and soap. There was a nice bathtub aswell which comes in handy to relax after a day of sightseeing!! There was also a desk/dresser in the room with a nice flat-screen tv (with lots of English channel though). Breakfast at the hotel as very excelent.
