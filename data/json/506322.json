I am certain that once you are aware of what transpired, you will be as appalled as I am. Here's what happened: We are a group of 8 locals planning to visit our relatives from Guangzhou, China who happened to be in Singapore for holiday. As soon as we reached the hotel lobby, we request this male, skinny, wearing specs and a white long sleeve shirt at the stationed at the recept counter to help call of our relative in room 315. The immediate response from him was unfriendly and hostile attitude, demanding whether our relative was a male or a female. Nevertheless, we continued to provide the necessary information even with such attitude as we are looking forward to see our relatives (which occupies three rooms) Soon after, my relative came down to the hotel lobby and wanted to bring us up to their hotel rooms for some catch up. However, we were stopped by the same rude, unfriendly, hostile, male counter staff, again with the uncalled-for attitude demanding that he cannot allow so many of us up to the room, and only one of us is allowed. Please note that we've made it clear to him that we just want to have some catching up session and will leave in a short while and we are NOT staying for the night. Luckily, at the same instance, another male staff, dressed in long sleeve purple shirt behind this rude and unfriendly counter staff comply to our request. Upon leaving the hotel, within half an hour, the same rude, unfriendly and hostile male counter staff glared at us all the way till we went out of the hotel lobby. The whole incident totally ruined our happy and excited mood being able to catch up with our relatives. Such rude, hostile and unfriendly attitude from any service industry staff is totally unacceptable, especially so for a hotel staff, where it not only reflect badly on the hotel as well as the country! This bad incident had really left a very bad inpression on all of us as well as our relatives. As you can imagine, the experience fell far short of our expectations -- considering the friendly image which the hotel protrayed. I am not certain at this time if I will ever feel comfortable returning to the establishment.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely, horrible receptionist\u201d", "Author": "lizzieL", "ReviewID": "UR126844423", "Content": "Just came back from visiting my relative from Guangzhou, who was a room guest at hotel 81 palace. the service at the reception was absolutely terrible! we had requested reception to call our relative in a particular and was met with absolutely hostile and condescending questions, such as name, exact part of China that my relative was from, gender and so on. Reception staff also tried to restrict the number of visiting guests from going to the hotel room and demanded for our IDs, which we refused to be bullied into giving. Upon exit of the hotel after 30 mins, the same rude and hostile reception staff glared and stared at us.

The room (Unit 7-06) is a bit cramped for storage, traveling solo works but fits 2 at a pinch. The TV works with a few stations but has no remote control! Shower is ensuite but has no curtain so expect a bit of splashing around. Hot and cold water works perfectly. Room has basic coffee - tea maker, hair dryer, two towels and minimal toiletries. Airconditioning got too cold past 1am but I survived by turning it off thru the night. Free wifi available! Just needs you to request for a new account+ password every 24hrs, and everytime the signal drops you need to log in again. Everyday the room and bed is tidied up, but the floor isn't swept clean. Occasionally I noticed the lift had a slight durian smell inside, but after I commented to the front desk it seemingly disappeared. They offer free taxi-calling service, which is a big help. Be sure to bring your own umbrella esp if you plan to take the MRT daily (nearest: Aljunied Station, 8-min walk from Hotel 81).

We really took a risk in booking this hotel since there were no pictures available through TripAdvisor. Arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed by the front desk. They were okay, they were not really that much warm and welcoming but just okay. It was the fastest hotel check-in ever. No questions asked, we were swiftly whisked with the hotel key and off we go to room 603, a double bed. We weren't even charged a deposit which on the room rates board, said $20 SGD. The hotel is just right not, really big comparing it to the major hotels in Singapore. It is right in front of another Hotel 81 which is Hotel 81 Geylang. It is I think 8 stories high. There are 2 elevators connecting you from the lobby to the rooms upstairs. The corridor to the rooms are well lit, quiet and clean. We didn't meet any Geylang Girls with an uncle with them if you know what I mean. However, there is a peculiar strong bleachy smell along the corridors probably it's the bleach they use to clean the rooms. When we entered the room, we were surprised to see it okay, clean and comfy. Although small, it was cozy. You can see on the pics I posted it was well lit, has a wall mounted TV which has about 8-10 channels some are in Bahasa Malaysia, some are in English. No CNN, no ESPN but there is an HBO however which we didn't really watch. Beside the door is the bathroom which was just okay as well. It looked clean however it smelled cigarette smoke. We really disliked the smell because we were not smokers. We kept the exhaust on for a couple of minutes, splashed cologne and thankfully, the smell went away. The shower has hot and cold which worked fine. Has a big roll of tissue that never seemed to empty. There is a hair and body lotion (soap and shampoo in one) dispenser which also never seem to run out, a supply of a comb, 2 toothbrushes with some sort of dried up toothpaste packaged with it just in case you forgot your toothpaste, I tried it felt like using baking soda for brushing, a shower cap and a sanitary bag. The toilet bowl was clean and flushes well. There is a huge wall mounted mirror over a clean sink. The whole bathroom gets wet when you shower but dries up after a few hours, the door shuts close and the floor outside doesn't get wet just to let you know. Beside the bed was another mirror over a table which has a box of tissue a hair dryer and a 220 AC plug for charging. There is only 1 available plug for you to charge anything with a 2 pronged plug so if you need to plug in more, you need to bring your own extension. This was a problem to us since we had 2 cameras that needed charging. We tried to unplug the TV and had a hard time plugging it back, the water heater and the blower though has 3 prongs. The vanity had a small ottoman for sitting and beside it was a small table with a small drawer for stowing other items. On the table was a tray with a water kettle, 2 mugs, 2 coffee stirrers, 1 3-in-1 coffee, 1 3-in-1 tea, and two bottles of water. Now the bed. The bed is mattress type but the foam was covered in faux leather/synthetic linoleum, the like that covers a leatherette sofa for some reason. There is a layer of heavy bottom sheet made of heavy combed cotton, then a layer of cotton linen and another one as a top sheet. Now here's one thing I found interesting. There are 2 pillows which had a disturbing cover. It had disposable covers. I hated the disposable covers cause i thought they were not absorbent. You can see on my pictures. I just can't describe the material but in our country, we use them to wrap gifts. So i removed them, i brought with me a pillow case which i used to wrapped the pillows. The pillow covers however worked great to put used clothes in. So that's a WARNING. I'm not sure with the other Hotel 81s but I think that's how they eliminate washing of the linen covers. Air-Conditioning Temperature can be controlled from a wall panel, though it's hot in Singapore, we turned it to the lowest setting at night since it's very cool for us. TV There is no remote control for some reason so you have to get up and manually press the buttons. Cleanliness The room sad to say is not spotlessly clean. I was just a little concerned over some hairs over the bathroom drain. There were a few strands of hair as well over the bed after we removed the covers. There are some spots in the room which had some black spots, hoping it's not mold. It's found near the opening of the aircon, the lower part of the canvas and the frame of the painting in front of the wall of the bed and something i discovered at the back of the thick curtains. In my opinion, i don't think the curtains are washed regularly for the black spotted stains to remain on it. The next morning, we saw an auntie (the housekeeping woman) outside the room so we asked her personally to clean our room. She was kind but when we came back, we were surprised though the room was made up, the cups we used weren't cleaned. They were just washed on the faucet but never cleaned thoroughly. They were also inconsistent with replacing the complimentary stuff sometimes we get just one water, or just 1 pair of the sachet drinks etc. Check-out was also a breeze. When using the phone to call locally, call the front desk first to inform them and they will charge you SGD$1 for unlimited local calls for 24 hours. Not sure how much for international calls. We had left a package of clothes for a friend to pick up at the front desk and they were willing to accept it for pick up. We also got the packaged our friend left at the front desk. ALSO to avoid the hassle, never ever ever lock the door from the inside when you're leaving the room. We were not told that the doors cannot be turned from the outside and can only be opened with a key. If you lock it from the inside, you will not be able to open it with a key. So just pull the door close when leaving and it shuts automatically. From the Changi Budget Terminal, take a free shuttle bus that will take you to T2 connecting you to the city by MRT which costs somewhere around $1.60 SGD (plus refundable $1 card deposit). We figured that the nearest MRT Station to Hotel 81 Palace is Aljunied Station at the East-West Green Line. We thought finding the hotel was easy because the streets had large signs and ordered numerically (Lorong 20,19,18,17,16). From the station it was probably 10-15 minutes walk and arriving at noon, the heat was unbearable. Booking this hotel through Agoda, we had some apprehensions since it is located in the so called Red Light District but to our surprise, we didn't see much Geylang Girls around. Probably one or two but generally, the location is safe at night. The place really lights up at night. The area had corners and corners of food shops, and hawker centers (one right across Lor 16 was G City Food Court which is a cleaner, more comfortable and okay place to eat specially at night since it is air-conditioned as opposed to the food stores around. You can order char kway teow or stir fried flat noodles with pork, Singapore chicken rice, a variety of noodles, hot pot, clay pot etc.). The area also has lots of fruit stands at night and for very affordable costs you can try durian and dragon fruit just for the adventure but don't forget to buy lansones, the small yellow-brown teardrop fruit clusters which are very very sweet and fleshy as well as other fruits like peach, apple, oranges, pear and other local fruits that are really fresh. When looking for the hotel, try to locate the Shell Gas Station along Geylang Road, and to the right of it is Lorong 16. When going to Vivo City, where Sentosa Express' Station Harbourfrount Station is located, just go to the bus stop located near the Shell Gas Station, take bus 80 for a fare of i believe less than $3SGD and it will take you to Vivo City Mall. There is also Bus 2 which will take you to Little India. Also a bus that will take you along North Bridge Road to Clarke Quay. The bus stops are clearly marked with the service routes. Buses coming from the city however alight on Sims street which is the street opposite from Geylang Road. The closest of the bus stops is the one infront of the Xiu Fu FTY building (or something that sounds like that) because Lor 1 and Lor 23 bus stop are too far from the hotel. I believe I have done a thorough review. Overall, since this is one of the cheapest next to Happy Hotel, strongly recommended by Hotel 81 website, I liked the hotel and will definitely stay here again because of value for money.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery good value the hotel\u201d", "Author": "AlexMiten", "ReviewID": "UR82004731", "Content": "Very very value hotel I've stayed.

However, my girlfriend did notice that the Hotel rented rooms by the hour and two hour. I can only come up with one reason why that would be the case in the middle of a redlight district. You can come to your own conclusions. We also awoke to the sound of \"business\" being done one morning and heard the clop of high heels in the hallways several times late at night.

If you are a single man (especially a foreigner) walking alone at night, you will be constantly hounded by them. If that's what you're looking for, then look no further. Nearly every hotel in the Geylang area has this same problem because of the neighborhood. If you're the type that has dinner and goes to your room by 9:00 p.m., all this might not bother you. The hotel itself isn't really that bad, however, it was designed and built not as a place to stay for a few days, but as a place to stay for a few hours. There is no closet or clothes hangers, just 4 hooks on the wall. You will literally live out of your suitcase, since there is not much room to put anything. The bathroom is about 5 feet by 5 feet, and the entire room becomes a shower stall, as there is no separate shower or bathtub. Everything gets wet in the bathroom when you shower. The bed has a water-proof mattress pad which I found uncomfortable as my skin couldn't breathe. The disposable pillow cases are not made of fabric, but of a synthetic tightly woven mesh material. (The sign in the lobby says that for hygenic reasons, they have \"upgraded\" to this type of pillowcase. What's next, the sheets too? I spent the night tossing and turning. The TV had several channels in English. The room was very quiet as I had specifically asked for a quiet room and I got number 532 at the end of the hall. There are blackout curtains which kept the room dark when closed. The central air conditioning was quiet and worked well. The front desk staff was friendly.
