{"Reviews": [{"Content": "practical but... We found the hotel whilst driving into Florence.It seems to have been recently renovated, and we were all looking forward to a comfortable nights sleep.However the beds are really soft so none of the group could sleep well. The bathrooms looked really clean on the first glance but there were a few stray hairs around. The power shower cabinet did not work well and did not drain well.Breakfast was not worth it, Much better to drive into the city and have a real coffee.But the price was ok and we could park easily.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR306661219", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Misscaramel"}, {"Content": "Cleanest bathrooms in Europe The hotel rooms and service were nice. The bathrooms were immaculate! I couldn't believe, cleaner than my own..and a nice size for European standards. Breakfast was good, but not great selections...not very breakfasty for American standards. HOWEVER, they claim to have A/C, but they never used it. It was some of the worst sleep we've had and we really needed it after long days of walking and sightseeing. Sleeping with the windows open wouldn't have been bad if not for the extremely noisy street the hotel is on and it's location in Mosquitoville. My husband and I were covered in mosquito bites each morning (seriously 30+ each). The hotel management couldn't believe we had difficulty sleeping, there were no other rooms anyway.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR921745804", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "lrs17"}, {"Content": "Home away from Home This was a great hotel! I loved the fact that it had a bed and breakfast feel to it.

We stayed here for 2 nights and honestly it was just okay. It wasn't very clean - the ceiling had cobwebs!! There's no elevator so we had to lug our big suitcases up 2 flights of stairs.

We've been to various countries in Europe and several cities in Italy, and have had occassion to stay in various types of hotels. For us, it's important to have a clean room with a/c that is centrally located. This one probably rates as one of the worst for our tastes. If you are the type of person for whom central location is important, don't stay here, as it is about a 1/2 hour walk to the Uffizi/Duomo area. There are a few shops and eateries a number of blocks north, but for the most part it's located in a really quiet area. On balance, there is a bus available, but it's not the most practical of solutions to the location problem and you can find a comparable hotel that is closer. In addition, we had problems with our air conditioning not working or having been shut-off, and despite complaints, they never resolved the issue. Sleeping with the windows open created an insect issue, as the hotel is close to the Arno. In addition, there is ongoing construction next door, though we never had any problems with it because we were gone during the day. Also, if you are an early bird breakfast isn't served until 8:00--which can put you behind if you have a packed itinerary. However, the room was clean and the bathroom modern.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR610537264", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "r17012002"}, {"Content": "The place to stay in Florence !!! My husband and I visited Florence around the middle of June, we loved our stay at Hotel Lido, the rooms are spacious as well as the bathroom which were extremely clean. It is well located in Florence . The bus station is only 2 blocks from the Hotel and you can reach downtown in approximately 5 minutes by bus. There are a lot of shops and restaurants within a short distance from the Hotel.Lucia was incredibly helpful to us, she even made reservations prior to our arrival for Galleria dell'accademia, and for Eurostar trains to Rome and Milan.

A real gem! We loved this hotel. The two sister, Lucia and Elisabetta running the hotel are simply lovely. They speak an excellent english, they are welcoming and helpful. Elisabetta gladly provide good tips on things to do or places to eat that might not be included in your guidebook. The hotel is located about 20 minutes from the center (walking time), it is a pleasant walk. If you take Via Vincenzo Gioberti, you can find many shops and cafes. Your other option is to walk along the river, which is always pleasant, or you can simply take the bus.The room was very clean and spacious enough, and we absolutely loved the high ceilings and the bathroom (shower with jets). Breakfast was excellent with freshly made-to-order cappucino, rolls, cereal, ham, salame, lovely cake....pretty much what one can expect to find in most places.

Our rooms were on the ground level and the view was of the family's porch. But there was the great benefit of being allowed to make use of its washing machine. The rooms are spaceous and very clean, the air conditioning worked just fine. Yes, there is construction (structures designed to blend in well with the older ones) on this block, but there was no noise to speak of, and the views of the porches and garden were beautiful from the terrace on the second floor. Our shower was a bit difficult, we flooded our floor on one occasion, feeling awfully guilty. (Our friends' next door to us worked just fine.) Lucia, the owners' lovely daughter, took everything in her stride. She is fun and incredibly accomodating, speaks fantastic English and has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of truly fine restaurant recommendations. And she makes wonderful capuccinos. The breakfast was great. The whole family who has lived here for 30 years is charming and helpful as are their staff. On the terrace or in the lobby you might find the two housecats. We couldn't have felt more at home, and the rates are very reasonable! The location is convenient, steps from the Arno River near the Ponte San Niccolo, and the excellent area restaurants were a bargain by Florentine standards.

Once upon a time, that was probably true. However, right now (June 2004), it is the last building standing in a block that is being flattened and rebuilt. The building noise started at 0700 and was very intensive, so much so that you simply had to leave the room. The air conditioning did not work and so we could not close the windows to reduce the noise. Friends staying in an adjacent room to ours also suffered from the building noise with the addition of exceedingly loud snoring from a neighbour throughout the night. Booked in for 3 nights, we checked out after one.
