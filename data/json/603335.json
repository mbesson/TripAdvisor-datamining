{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Viceroy Ubud, Wow! Wow, what a place. It's situated at the top of a valley with views of a working rice paddy across the valley. The pool is incredible, as is the food ...albiet rather gourmet for us simple Aussies.The room was something else entirely, and possibly the most beautiful hotel room we're likely to stay in for quite some time. There was a plunge pool on the terrace of the villa with an outside bathroom. A word to the wise, don't leave the outdoor bathroom lights on while you're out... the bugs go crazy.Everyone was very friendly and professional. The hotel was perfect for us, on our honeymoon, as it was completely quite. Everyone has a sense of quiet about them, even the guests which was lovely. We felt like we had the place to ourselves.We'd already arranged a private driver in Ubud and we HIGHLY recommend him. We were glad he was available again for us to use as he was a genuinely nice guy. We found him to be much better value than the hotel's cars too as we had a long drive ahead of us (Tembok). His name is Dewa and you can contact him on [--] or email: [--]. We urge anyone else visting Ubud to get in contact with him as we found his english to be the best out of any of the other drivers we'd used and his knowledge of the area was fabulous. If you are looking for Balinese furniture and handicrafts he knows all the good places to go and has experience in shipping and scouting for his regular clients.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR773029174", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jbebb"}, {"Content": "A little bit of paradise       The huge bed", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR844351417", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JazminNYC"}, {"Content": "the best! Having had an incredible experience in Malaysia at The Datai, I wanted a similar type of hotel in Bali. I was trying to book into the Four Seasons in Ubud but with no luck (thankfully) so started to look elsewhere. I was very nervous of the advisory warning but checked other travelers forums (fodors etc.) and there were glowing reviews everywhere. I was very nervous as to what i would find but from the meeting at the airport to our gracious reception and then our glorious villa that is something from a storybook it was perfect. It is small (only 11 rooms) and feels exclusive. Our own private villa looked the river valley. The plunge pool was perfect temperature and private enough to skinny dip. The bed was beautiful and so comfortable. all in all a magnificent villa. We had friendly drivers supplied by the hotel that were happy to do anything we wanted to do. They waited for us through dinners discreetly until called for and for less than the price of a cab ride in Toronto. The hotel is immaculate. The spa is magnificent with the same beautiful view while being pampered and staggeringly reasonable. The food was great and beautifully prepared. I kept asking my husband to pinch me as it was truly perfect. The owners were quietly gracious but knew who we were and made sure we were being well treated. We then unfortunately moved to Nusa Dua for a conference and although nice enough it couldn't hold a candle to The Viceroy and Ubud as a destination. I could go on and on but simply the Viceroy in Ubud was perfect. Like The Datai, I want to keep it a secret so that it isn't spoiled.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR759396931", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "carorab"}, {"Content": "beautiful property Stayed in a Vice regal Villa. Srevice was very good. Owners were most hepfull. margaret and her son, from Sydney I believe. Beautiful property, amazing location, total privacy, entertaining characters at nye dinner, sooo much fun. Nothing the staff would not do to acomodate any whim. however would have expected wifi and up to date top of the line audio visual gear for the price bracket. room service was a bit sloppy considering top prices charged. $US20 for a sliced banana. Transfers included. Not chargded for any vehicle transfers.....and we used the service a lot, all over ubud....even to our second hotel ritz carlton, a 50 minute drive. Would recomend to friends, esp couples. This review was a little late coming.......amazing hotel..... so much better then Amandari, chedi, hanging gardens......on a par with Como Shambalah, Four Seasons......on a smaller scale. Amazing Spa. Restaurant great for complicated amazing dinners.....however struggled with simple lunch/room srevice requests. Just wanted a ham sandwich........apparently too hard!

We have spent four nights in the Viceroy. I was a bit sceptic due the tripadvisor comment on the manipulation of the reviews. Anyway, we booked it and did not regret it. This hotel is fantastic. We had the chance to be upgraded to one of the Viceroy Villa because ours had a problem. We were stunned by the quality of the infrastructure, service, food, spa... Staff is friendly and helpfull. Also, don't forget that you're in the middle of the forest so don't be scared of the various insects you can find (we also had a monkey once in the garden !). Ubud is also an amazing area to stay. We also stayed in a hotel in the beach areas in the south of the island but you've regret it. If we knew, we would have stayed in Ubud.

We each flew in from different parts of the world to catch up, relax, eat and be pampered with spa treatments.From the moment we all arrived, we knew this hotel was going to be special. The relaxed ambience, the wonderful Balinese service, the well-appointed villas and the fabulous view over the valley were just some of the Viceroy's finer points! I had the best massage I have ever had in my life (truly!) at the hotel's Spa and throughly enjoyed the cuisine. The degustation dinner menu together with the wine pairing is well worth sampling and the Indonesian menu is also good. The Viceroy is small and intimate and that in itself makes the hotel very appealing. We felt like we were the only guests staying there, even though we knew there was100% ocupancy.

My wife and I decided to spend our honeymoon between Bali and Singapore and I wanted to start it in style, a few nights in a super luxurious hotel. After a long and detailed search on the internet the Viceroy Bali was the best choice. And now I can say it was absolutely the right choice. The honeymoon package they provide is quite amazing, we\u9225\u6a9de got free breakfast, warm flower bath on arrival, 2 hour SPA treatment for each one of us plus 20% off further treatments, a candle-lit romantic dinner, a brilliant honeymoon cake, a choice of cycling or trekking trip, return airport transfer. And because we stayed for 7 nights we only paid for 6!As soon as we got off the plane we were met by one of the hotel staff who sorted out the visas for us and helped with customs and introduced us to our personal driver for the trip to the hotel. The driver was very helpful and knowledgeable. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were given cold refreshing towels and flowers.The villa\u9225\u6a9a are just awesome. Very luxurious but yet simple and airy with complete privacy. The view is impressive. We stayed in a pool villa and from your bed you can see the forest and rice paddies on the other side of the river. The resort is surrounded by green rainforest and rice paddies and from the pool you overlook the valley. The service is top notch. They drive you and pick you up from your villa by a golf cart whenever you want. The staff greets you with your name. The service is very personal and warm. The hotel staff went way beyond their duties to satisfy and meet our requirements and demands.Staying in The Viceroy will guarantee you a luxurious stay that you will not get anywhere else. We truly loved our stay there and we sure recommend it for any couple who are looking for the honeymoon of there dreams. We will go back there for our anniversary one day!", "Date": "Sep 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR323158526", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sooba_m"}, {"Content": "The Viceroy - exceeded expectations My husband and I just return fom Bali where we spent 6 nights at the Rtiz Carlton (see review) then 6 nights at The Viceroy.

Their Restaurant (CasCade) is well known through out Bali and guests sometimes arrive by helicopter. The food is first class on an international level.
