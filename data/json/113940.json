This is definitely a European style hotel; small rooms, older building, no heat in the hallways, tilting and somewhat creaky floors. All that being said, we loved our stay and the charm of the place which is why we chose it. Would definitely recommend a room with a fireplace if your going during the colder months and also ask for a top floor room as we moved from our second floor location due to the ceiling above use creaking noisily every time the occupants above us walked across their floor. The breakfast buffet and wine reception are very nicely done and set in the cozy space downstairs from the entry area. We didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff but everyone we encountered was very nice and helpful. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the bed is probably one of the worst I've encountered in my travels. Every time one person or the other moves or turns over the entire bed moved and shakes and neither my sister nor I are restless sleepers. Needless to say, we did not have a restful night of sleep in our 4 days. The other slightly negative mark is the lighting is very difficult. They are using cfl's which I completely understand for environmental reasons but there are new, better models available. The lighting in the lamps over the beds cannot be dimmed so if you wish to read you feel like you're under a spotlight; the bathroom lighting is difficult until you let the lamps warm up to reach their full brightness.

For a small extra (which was refunded later - for reasons I'll mention shortly) we were offered a room on the ground floor (#16), which had much more light but was frozen (the fireplace couldn't do the trick), and noisy - the sound of people walking over our heads on the wooden floors or the showers they took have woken us every day at 5AM!! Its location near the dining room didn't help either... Finally we moved to a room on the top floor (#56) which was much more quite (but you could hear very well every time someone opened the faucet in the next room or just left an alarm clock and wend out for dinner!) and a little warmer.

What a little gem this place is. Firstly I would like to say how excellent the location was with only a block and a half away from the cable cars cross street stop and only 3 blocks from Union Square. The rooms themselves are quaint and very homely. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was immaculately clean. The room had a beautiful little fireplace which was perfect for coming home getting warm on a cold windy night and the room was spacious enough for us to store our 4 large suitcases and still have room to move. Please do not pay attention to any reviews complaining about times that the front desk in unattended becuase there is always somebody available either at their front desk or the desk at the white swan which is directly next door and litterally 20 steps from the door. The staff were so kind and very helpful, they gave us reccommendations on where and where not to go around the city for nice meals and sighseeing. Each night the hotel had a complimentary wine/cheese reception which we fantastic - for us travelling from Australia it gave us the opportunity to try different californian wines which and to enjoy lots of the home cooked delicious treats which tied us over until dinner time. For the people that like to mingle with other guests / travellers this is a great way to meet new people and share stories about good places to visit around the area but if mingleing is not your thing you can go and help yourself to a couple of glasses of wine, some yummy food and go and sit on one of the comfortable lounges and read a book or listen to some music or even go up to your room. Fresh cooked breakfast of a morning was tops and the chef was so friendly and helpful. There is a fridge in the downstairs kitchen which offers complimentary water and soda - this extra little touch definately did not go un noticed with us as having the convenience of grabbing a refreshment so easily and complimentary before heading out for some sightseeing or returning home for the day was a great gesture that went a long way. Every day there was also fresh home baked goodlies left in a jar in the foyer so everytime we walked in or out we were able to indulge in some delicious treats. This hotel goes above and beyond to make you feel like its a home away from home and I have no hestitation to reccommend it to anyone. If ever we make the trek back to SFO we will most definately stay at Petie Auberge again. If you have time make sure you head to Pier 33 and do the Alcatraz Tour with audio headsets - this was a great day out. We also did a Nappa & Sonoma Valley Wine Tour . Although the person selling us the tickets told us it was 6 wineries we would be visiting it ended up being just 3 however this ended up being ok as we were able to take our time and enjoy the 3 places we went to other than rush through all. The red bus ticket seller also failed to tell us that ontop of the tour fee we would actually have to pay each winery a $5 or $10 per person tasting so make sure you factor in another $40 ontop of the ticket. If you have the time try and check out Yosemite National Park - We were picked up at 6am from the hotel, we found out it was actually a 5.5 hour drive to Yosemite each way plus more time for pit stops and coffee breaks so we only got 3 hours at the actual park before heading back for another long bus ride home. Our tour driver was really nice and very informative which did make the trip go faster but it was a long day because we were not dropped back at our hotel until about 10pm at night so the 12 hour tour that the red bus ticket seller sold us on ended up being a little over 16 hours. We were budgeting on being back in the city at around 6-6.30 pm so getting home at 10pm basically meant we lost a night of sightseeing which was pretty disappointing however in the grand scheme of things it was ok becuase we don't regret having the opportunity to going to see Yosemite and will remember the day forever. For a great dinner check out Loris Diner (Opposite Drake Hotel). For a diner this place was AMAZING ! I ordered the roast turkey dinner and it was honesty the best meal I had in the entire time in San Francisco. The 2 previous nights we dined fine dining and paid about 3-4 times the amount we paid at Loris but the food didnt even come close. Crazy! Even when I ordered a strawberry milkshake I was anticipating the normal artifically flavoured drink but it was made with real strawberrys and was amazing. The service was fantastic too and our waitress was such a sweet girl and very friendly. If you go on a Friday they serve their house specialty of Clam Chowder which my husband ordered and said it was nicer than the chowder he tried down on Pier 39 / Fishermans Wharf.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot the type of hotel we usually choose but we are glad we tried it.\u201d", "Author": "delaine", "ReviewID": "UR120249840", "Content": "Chose this hotel because of reviews on this site and so glad we did.

Not modern and very french in its quaint appearance. The most significant part of our two night stay was Andy, who was the friendliest person at a hotel that I have ever met! I have no idea what Andy's job title is, but he was everywhere we were in that hotel. He was so helpful with advise and information, it was great that he steered us in the right direction with many helpful hints. Also, Joel, (I think his name was Joel), the chef for breakfast, was wonderful and very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was wonderful with homemade irish soda bread and lots of nice goodies. There was a wine respite in the late afternoon, but we were not there for that. And when we returned from dinner, there were lovely pastries awaiting us in the hallway. I don't know if they were good, because I did not try any. Petite Auberge is pretty centrally located. Chinatown is close by and Fisherman's Wharf is just a bus ride away. The rooms were small-ish. They were very tired looking and could use a coat of paint and new carpet. It was a very warm October and without A/C I don't know how anyone can stay here in the summer. We left the windows open to sleep and the noise from a bar/party close by had the noise level at a fever pitch. There was a very nice gas powered fireplace, so winters can probably be very nice. We are not in the room except to sleep, so all in all, not so bad.

Firstly, when booking online we got a great deal for 2 nights. Our plans then changed and we had to book an extra night. However, we were not able to get the same rate online, and it was considerably more, so I emailed the hotel directly to ask if we could stay an extra night at the lower rate we were paying. Their reply was prompt and they were happy to oblige; this already gave us high hopes for our stay there. A few reviewers have highlighted the issue of having to go 'next door' to their neighbouring hotel to check-in etc, when there is no one manning the desk at the Petite, but this really isn't a bother as it is seconds away and they are reachable by phone if you have any questions. The place itself is a haven from the city, with their comfy sofas and a fireplace. We did have a room that was next to the lift, but it wasn't too much of a bother for me, even though I'm a light sleeper. Others may want to request a different room if they are light sleepers! Our room was small, but very adequate and cute. It was clean and the shower was great. The breakfasts were hearty and put you in good stead for the day, the fridge of water and sodas is a brilliant idea, seeing as other hotels can charge up to $3-$5 for water! The homemade cookies in the jar on the little table and the wine/canapes evening, are touches that give this hotel real charm.

At first glance, being used to the typical corporate chain hotels, we were both disappointed when we arrived to our room. However, the charm of this place becomes apparent rather quickly. We too, had a corner room, just like a previous reviewer - room #51. It is immediately next to the elevator, and facing the street. The room is plenty big for 2 people with a fireplace, sofa, an upholstered chair and a desk with chair. I see no reason to avoid a room by the elevator - on the contrary, I found it quite convenient. The street noise is present, but either sleep with your windows shut or turn on the provided \"noise machine\" and you'll be fine. The amenities are such that I've never experienced at any other hotel before. They keep a refrigerator fully stocked with bottled water & sodas, for you to take whenever you'd like. There is always a bowl of apples available, coffee & tea. Starting in the afternoons, and going straight through to after dinner, there is a cookie jar kept stocked with fresh baked cookies. A different type of cookie appeared every day, and often times we were at the jar while the cookies were still warm! When dropping off your parcels or running in to change clothes, having a bottle of water and a small snack is a welcome find. The breakfast is adequate. It's enough to get you started on your day. I agree that the set up is a bit of a disaster, having the coffee/tea immediately outside of the elevator doors. I enjoyed my daily cup of coffee and croissant with jam! We did not take full advantage of the wine/cheese reception. We did stop in, grab a few glasses of wine to take up to our room while getting ready for dinner, but the people who were down there were social and it was a friendly atmosphere.

There were many, many great reasons to stay here. And a few things you should know (nothing terrible)... read on! We liked the location quite a bit. We like to walk and were less than a 15 minute walk from most of the things we wanted to see. The BART stop was about 10 minutes. The hills are significant but that's the case almost anywhere you stay in SF. The hotel itself is super cute. A real gem. It has an old-world charm with most modern conveniences. By \"most,\" don't expect an oversized bathtub or two sinks in the bathroom. We had a room (51) which was oversized with a fireplace. Really a nice setup. That room is also nice because it's at the end of the hall, separated from other rooms by the stairwell, so it was also quite quiet. The breakfast was included in our rate and was tasty. Each day had a different hot dish (quiche or breakfast casserole), pastries, breakfast meat, assorted cereals, yogurt, etc. Tasty. Finally, you'll be well fed. A cookie/treat jar is stocked all afternoon (fresh baked) and there's an afternoon happy hour with wines and light snacks. For full and fair disclosure, there are a few things you should know so you're not surprised: - The front desk is only staffed a few hours each afternoon. If you need something you need to call or walk two doors down to their sister hotel. Not a big deal. - The lobby is on the second floor and there are also rooms on 3, 4 and 5. And there's one old-fashioned elevator (the kind where you have to open a door and slide a cage door manually). We never had to wait for the elevator -- but there's only one. - Our bathroom was clean... but could have used some updates. The tile was from the '70's. The wallpaper had minor peeling and stains in spots. - The windows were filthy. And most could have been washed from the fire escape. - Finally, although the breakfast is quite tasty the breakfast area is not \"calming.\" The food is along one wall and the coffee/tea/toast is along another wall near the elevator. Everyone ends up bumping into each other trying to get their food and drink. I actually think this could be fixed by reconfiguring the setup. (Sorry... it's a disease.

The quality of the food and many choices available at the included breakfasts were especially welcomed to start our day. The menu is varied and the quality and quantity of the food is excellent.. The cosy and warm fireplace area used for the wine social and morning coffee is very pleasant. The afternoon wine socials were very enjoyable with a generous amount of high quality California wine available. We thoroughly enjoyed these social times with the other guests.

Petite Auberge has many quirky aspects to it, all of which I enjoyed. For example, you need a key to open the front door. That's different. The elevator has those cool grated doors that you slide open before entering or exiting. You can always sneak down to a cooler near the kitchen and grab a Coke, free. If you're looking for a grand lobby, this place is not for you. There pretty much isn't a lobby and most of the time I was there, there didn't seem to be anybody at the front desk. So, if you're looking for a super-attentive concierge service, this isn't your place. But it has a wonderful homey kind of vibe that grows on you. I'm not a big breakfast guy, but where else can you get quiche, sausages, baked French toast, amazing little pastries, a do-it-yourself oatmeal station with fruit and nuts and grains and stuff, great coffee, a toaster, jams and jellies. The breakfast room in the lower level is homey and small, so everybody is friendly and makes conversion, which is a great way to get tips on where to do and what to do. One couple that I met had been coming to Petite Auberge every year for 25 years, It's that kind of place. There's an afternoon wine and cheese reception in a small living room area, which also has the same friendly feel. The room was relatively small, but comfortable. Everything worked. Free Internet. Again, if you're looking for a USA Today under your door every morning and a gift shop and room service meals, this is not your place.

He gave us advice on avoiding parking tickets in the restricted zones near the hotel and told us where to save $$ on parking. He helped us to find a room we liked. We appreciate the very nice breakfast experience at PA, that makes a relaxing and nutritious start to the day. Quiche, croissants, wonderful bread, great coffee, fresh fruit, etc. etc. The chef, Joel, did a great job every day. The eating area at PA is a bit small, but if you want more room (when there are a lot of people at breakfast) you can pop over next door and have breakfast at the Black Swan. In general, PA is the smaller hotel of the two places, and I think the rooms in PA are smaller than at the Black Swan. Get a room with a fireplace. A little more $ but more room. We were there in January and the fireplace added to the ambience. I like the location of the PA, but you have to do hills to get around from the hotel. This is SF after all! But its near Union Square, Nob Hill, Chinatown, Financial District. We used ZipCar during our stay and there were three or four sites within a couple blocks.

Prior to our arrival, a couple of us called the hotel with questions that were thoroughly answered with genuine enthusiasm. Without a doubt, the staff elevate this hotel to an exceptional level as a warm, friendly place to stay in a large city. The hotel's location is superb. We walked to Chinatown in 10 minutes, had easy access to cable cars and, when necessary, used taxis. Because our group was big, hotel staff would arrange for a couple of taxis to pick us up but for a smaller group, a single taxi would be easily hailed. Rooms are bright, cheery and very French in decor, and each of ours had a gas fireplace. Rooms varied in noise level; Rooms 46 and 26 were at the back of the hotel and faced a quieter street than Room 41 which faced Bush Street and had moderate street noise throughout the night. All of us heard some noise from rooms above, but very similar to what's heard in a European B & B. Room 41 is a Deluxe King, with a pull out single twin bed. All rooms were very clean and serviced promptly each day. Free internet access in our room was excellent. In addition to the rooms, the hotel has other pleasant features.

There was a community fridge stocked with complimentary sodas and bottled waters. The tasty breakfast was consistently croissants and assorted pastries, quiche, oatmeal, dry cereal, toast, sliced fruit, sausages with hot beverages and juices.

Perfect after before going to bed. The breakfast is fantastic, with many choices and everything is home made I think! There are fresh fruit, juice, porridge, wheat meal, bread, croissants and more.. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning! And in the afternoon it's time for free wine and some snack. It's different kinds of snack every day, one day the staff had made some delicious salad and salty bisquits with different kinds of cheese and pesto. It was also a nice opportunity to have a chat with the other guests since the wine is served downstairs in the \"Livingroom\" in front of the fireplace.

The location is very good, walking distance near cable cars and a multitude of restaurants. We checked our bags early at the sister hotel, White Swan, and the staff there was just delightful in welcoming us. We were disappointed in our room experience; my husband had asked for a room that was away from the street noise, but as it turns out we were placed in a room very near Sutter Street, which had a bar on it that was very, very noisy when patrons stumbled onto the street in the wee hours of the morning. Also, the room that we were in had a horridly-loud vibrating noise emanating from the bathroom ceiling light, at times it seemed louder than the street noise! Breakfasts were quite yummy with lots to choose from; the breakfast serving room at Petite Auberge is quite cramped and the staff on duty at the time was quite slow in busing tables; we had to do some of this ourselves to find a spot to eat. Although they served the same items at both Petite and White Swan, the breakfast experience at White Swan was definitely better, roomier and more relaxed. Apparently the front desk at Petite is not staffed after a particular hour in the afternoon, which can leave you feeling a little stranded.

TIP: There's almost never anyone at the Petite Auberge front desk, so go to the White Swan next door to check in. They tell you this in your confirmation e-mail. There's also a sign outside to direct you. I booked a cozy queen, but they upgraded us to a deluxe for free! More space and a fireplace! I'm glad about that; the cozy queens are VERY small. If you want space, go to a Marriott. As far as I could tell, there was no A/C, but we didn't need it. We had the windows open every night and were very comfortable. Fair warning to light sleepers, it does get noisy outside at night (it's a city after all), but the front desk provides free earplugs if you need them. Location can't be beat. We were told to head down the block to Walgreens to buy a 3-day muni pass, but you really don't need to. It's so close to everything, just walk! Seriously, it's 5 minutes to Union Square, 10 minutes to Chinatown, 20 minutes to the piers. WALK. Breakfast was incredible each morning! My favorite was the French toast bake. The fruit was fresh, the coffee was strong. We only made it to the evening wine and hors d'oeuvres once, but what a great perk. Awesome cheeses and pastries, and the chance to meet friendly fellow tourists from all over the globe. The cookie jar in the lobby was always filled with tasty treats. The chocolate almond bars were out of this world. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel was a big plus, as I had to do homework while on vacation :( The dining area and lounge downstairs had big comfy couches, a fireplace, and a book swap. We spent a couple of nights down there reading or doing work. The only downside to our stay was the super nice, but super disorganized staff. All I wanted was an extra towel to dry my hair. I called, and they immediately sent one up. Then the next day, housekeeping took it away (and no, I didn't leave it in the tub like they ask you to if you want your towels changed)! I called again that night, and no one showed. It took 3 calls to the front desk over 2 days to get a freakin' towel. We were also supposed to get a complimentary bottle of wine for being a member of the Joie de Vivre loyalty club, but didn't until the last night of our stay.

The price was a little high but I figured would be worth it for comfort and a charming stay. We were there for five nights and I am afraid to say I can only give this hotel an \"average\" rating for the following reasons: Teeny tiny rooms: They say they are \"cozy\" which is a nice euphemism for cramped. I realize that many of the older hotels in San Fran are like this, and it can be part of the charm, but please be warned if booking online that the pictures they show of the rooms here are of the large sized rooms, not the majority which are much smaller. Ours barely had a room for a bed let alone the dresser and t.v. and the bathroom was cruise ship size at best. This would have been fine for us for a 1 or 2 night stay but after 5 nights we were itching for larger rooms and space to move around, particularly in the bathroom. View: Had a \"lovely\" view of the decrepit building next door (mostly window sills slathered with pigeon poop). Make sure you request room with a view, as we did not. Noise: I can't really fault the hotel for being noisy as it's San Fran, a big city, and in a noisy part of town, but almost every night around 3 a.m. I was awoken by sounds of people rolling metal tins down the alley way below the window. So be forewarned if you are at all a light sleeper, this may not be the place/location for you. Positives: The rooms were, for the most part, clean but the bathroom needs work. Ours had what looked like black mold under the wallpaper by the windows. Staff were generally friendly and polite, and the old-style lift elevator is neat. The place always smellt really nice, like lemongrass, and the appetizers/wine in the evenings is a nice touch. Breakfasts overall were always good although yes, they do serve the same basic thing everyday (quiche, hard boiled eggs, canadian bacon or sausage, oatmeal or cereal, toast, fruit (usually melon), yoghurt and cottage cheese and sometimes assorted pastries. I found there was enough variety for me (am a somewhat light eater though) and better than what you'd find at most other hotels with free breakfasts. The coffee was hit or miss (mostly miss) so be warned if you're a hardcore coffee enthusiast. Also I should mention, every morning when I went down for breakfast I found most other guests who were there eating seemed to be in grumpy moods, just eating their food solemnly and then leaving, not any lively chit chat or anything. Maybe it was the french music they had going every morning? I dunno.. Overall, I recommend this as a place for active older couples (NOT families or people who want peace and quiet) who are staying for a few days , want to mix and mingle with other travelers and experience sleeping in a historic-type of San Fran hotel, and who are not light sleepers. For a romantic getaway, or even just a quieter place to catch up on sleep after a busy day touring San Fran, there are quieter, roomier hotels down along Lombard Street (that have convenient bus access and walking distance to many of the hot spots) that may be better suited, as was our case.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cUnique and charming, with everything you need\u201d", "Author": "SeaReview", "ReviewID": "UR76235505", "Content": "For those who appreciate European-style lodging, treasure unique experiences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and want to stay in the heart of downtown SF on more of a budget (not that SF is cheap), this place is ideal.

Check in was quick and easy, and the attendant was very friendly. There were cookies in the lobby, and free sodas in the kitchen. We didn't go for hors d'oevers so I can't comment on them, but we did go for the inclusive breakfast which was tasty - we had quiche (or tortillas), sausages, toast, muffins, tea and coffee.

I would recommend that you request a top floor room and if a queen at the very back of the hotel. The breakfast was truly great--the best I have ever had at a hotel. One day it was scrambled eggs, quiche, various pastries, cereal, yogurt and fruit, biscuits, and juice. Another included quiche, sausage patties and all of the above. The afternoon wine reception was excellent--not the ususal crackers and cheese but included brownies, crackers and cheese dips, deviled eggs, a salad and more. Served in the cozy little lounge downstairs with the fireplace glowing and friendly guests to chat with, it was a really nice experience. Also, left out until very late and we ended up spending an entire evening sipping wine and eating the goodies.

They also kept our luggage for us after we checked out until we headed for the airport. The promised Golden Gate Volunteer guide did not happen which was a disappointment. Apparantly they need at least a week to arrange for the volunteer which I thought was a little odd since it is supposed to be an ongoing program.

My sister and I stayed in room 51 on the top floor, a deluxe king with fireplace. Here's what we loved: top floor and no adjoining rooms, which meant no noise from other guests; large, comfortable bed with bed tables on both sides, reading lamps with enough light for reading (!); fireplace which came on with a flick of a switch (and yes, gas fires are just as cozy as wood ones when you're tired and ready for bed); comfy couch in front of said fire; writing desk; One entire wall of windows looking out onto Bush Street, with window seat no less); windows that open to let in the breeze; a heater that is, wait for it, easy to turn on and off; and that's just the room. Breakfast was included in the cost of the room, was delicious, and served in an adorable and quaint breakfast room next to a parlor with comfy couches in front of another fireplace, and a couple of cozy reading nooks. There is also a space to sit outside, weather permitting, that is quite charming. Staff? All competent, all friendly, all ready to help, with a smile. If this sounds too good to be true, go stay there and see for yourself. Also, the location couldn't be better. The show we saw was on Nob Hill (three blocks); the restaurant where we had dinner just off Union Square (three blocks), and once we parked the car (yes, they valet) we didn't have to think about it again until we left. Will stay here again in a heartbeat. i should mention that there is a bit of street noise, but I wasn't bothered by it.

The old (1920s?) elevator was really neat; if you have kids, tell them to watch through the small window in the elevator door as the car rises to your floor, to see the ursine stowaway attached to the elevator cable. Our deluxe room was spacious and renovated but kept in the Victorian style. The TV got a lot of channels via cable. (Note: It sits on a sliding platter that pulls out of the armoire.) The gas fireplace in particular was wonderful; it was almost as lively and convincing as a wood-burning one. I was glad to see that in addition to curtains, there were actual shades on the windows. To my surprise, it was not at all noisy at night; one great thing about San Francisco is that people hardly ever honk their car horns. (I did wear earplugs as a preventive measure. The inn provides them if you ask.) The shower water pressure was incredible! I also give them points for putting a recycling bin in the room next to the trash bin. And they have free wi-fi in the lobby! (Plus a computer you can use next door at the White Swan). With historic inns, you're trading absolute consistency and modernity for charm and personality. You have to accept that going in. In the case of Petite Auberge, we could hear the footsteps of the people above us very clearly. But this is to be expected in a building from the 19th Century. There was a tiny bit of wallpaper starting to peel in the otherwise very inviting bathroom. (Wallpaper in a steamy environment never works; someone should get the word out to hotel owners.) One of the window shades was stuck, but they sent the service guy to fix it quickly while we were out. The heat is controlled centrally, so you can't adjust it in your room. But the gas fireplace puts out a lot of heat, and you can open a window or ditch the comforter if you're too warm. We found the temperature comfortable. There is not always someone at the front desk, but the staff were exceptionally helpful, with a genuinely cheerful attitude that is so often missing at big hotels. (You can also call 0 at any time to get someone at the White Swan.) The free breakfast was really sumptuous: several types of pastry, fruit, quiche, cereal, great sausage links, a couple of kinds of juice. They also have a fridge full of drinks for guests to help themselves to. The evening reception has a couple of wines and some nice hors d'oeuvres (cheeses one night, bread pudding the next). It's a good chance to chat with other guests. Before our trip, I had worried that we would find aggressive panhandlers everywhere in San Francisco; however, there were almost none where we went.

Going through the 5 different categories above: Cleanliness: Good standard of clean each day; Location: Excellent. Right near Union Square (shopping area), the cable car lines and generally quite a cool area; Rooms: I think I was in the \"Deluxe with fireplace\". The concierge said, as he waited for the lift to help with our things, \"oh I didn't look at your room, you're in a good one\" with a surprising tone. I thought the room was pretty average myself; quite small, not a comfortable bed and just generally felt quite tired. It is worth noting that the room is done in quite an antiquey style, so if you like that then you may well like it more than i did. I am pretty indifferent to an antiquey style. Slight problem with the squeaky floor boards in the room above, but nothing major. Value: paid \u00c2\u00a3150/$240 a night. I expect a lot more than I got for this and finally... Service: There were a series of incidents which lead me to give this only 1/5: 1. Whenever we needed to speak to the concierge/front desk we were pretty disappointed that there isn't one most of the time. There is a sign up at the entrance of the petite auberge which simply states - \"please go to our sister hotel - the White Swan Inn\". It is only next door, but given I didn't have a key to it and that I was under the impression that my hotel would have its own reception I wasn't massively impressed. 2. Checking out was quite annoying, mainly as a result of the above again. I rung the reception (which didn't answer within 10 rings each of the 5-6 times we rung during our stay) and asked for my car from the valet (see below) Trying to save time I took our stuff out of the room and walked down the corrindor to the entrance. However there was no car for a while, I tried to call reception again (only the white swans of course) and there was no answer. I walked around the reception and asked if he could just call reception in the Petite Auberge, which I was sitting next to, unmanned of course, waiting for my car with our stuff. I was told that he didn't know how to work the phones so that would be possible. 3. They ask that you give 20-30 minutes for the car to come from the valet. 20-30 minutes? Madness. I can only assume it is because they have so few staff working at any one time to actually serve the guests. (There is a lot of mention of the cost of the valet in other reviews. This, however, is a red herring in my opinion. $32 for valet parking a night is actually the cheapest I saw in central San Francisco, so not a big deal. It is just an expensive city to park in. Possibly it is cheaper than the other valet because they require such long notice...) 4. Finally the non reception staff seem to have been hired cheaply.

We used those ammenities to create a small lunch. Cocktail hour, or whatever it should be called was an extreme highlight. Supposedly from 5:00 -6:30, although it often went till 9:00 pm, wine is put out for guests along with cheese, crackers of various sorts, and often came with a salad and some other food such as a pasta dish one night, and a spice cake the other. During the week, we made a habit of attending this. Eating the food in a living room setting with a fireplace helped facilitate conversations amongst guests. Almost every day, we spent around 2.5 hours just talking to different guests. I have never experienced anything quite like it. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, but they took a hands off approach which allowed guests to really feel like they could mingle. All in all, it was an incredibly positive experience that I would recommend to others.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, California", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly Dream\u201d", "Author": "heavenlydream", "ReviewID": "UR28706658", "Content": "This French Country Inn hotel is off the chart!

The posted photos show both styles of room and I would guess that some other reviewers thought they were getting the large room when they had paid for the small one. There is no A/C in the room and in SF you almost never need it but we were there during a hot spell and had to ask the front desk for a fan which was delivered in about three minutes and worked wonders. The open windows let in street noise but living in the city as we do we're used to that. The service and attention was terrific. Freshly baked cookies are available 24/7 and one evening we came back from dinner to face a home made pound cake with chocolate frosting: We were too full to say yes but I still regret it. The breakfasts are wonderful. For the life of me I can't understand why other reviewers would complain about them. Fresh quiches, fresh rolls, fresh fruit, fresh breads, boiled eggs, homemade oatmeal, juices and really good coffee. We could hardly believe it it was so good.

Usually, I choose a hotel very close to Union Square for the best price I can find. This year, I wanted a special hotel because we would also be celebrating my daughter's 16th birthday. When I made reservations at the Petite Auberge, I mentioned my daughter's birthday. A week before our arrival, the hotel staff called and offered an upgraded room in honor of my daughter's birthday. Very generous! The hotel is charming and quiet, within walking distance to Union Square. The hotel is not as close to Union Square as other hotels I have stayed at but I will definitely return to the Petite Auberge instead of staying somewhere closer to Union Square. The hotel staff are incredibly friendly and accomodating. We arrived at 10am and the staff had no problem holding our bags. They would have let us check in early except our room was not yet vacated. We were allowed to valet-park our car early as well. The valet parking staff are very responsive and we did not have to wait for our car to be parked or retrieved. The housekeeping staff knew what room we were in, directing me to the correct floor before I even realized I was on the wrong floor. Our room was clean, comfortable, and spacious with a bay window and fireplace. The bathroom was a bit small and the lighting in the bathroom could be better. The robes in the bathrooms are cozy and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast room on the lower floor was small but quaint. The breakfast itself was average. One nice touch at the Petite Auberge is the help-yourself refrigerator near the breakfast area. Complimentary bottled water and soft drinks are always available.

There is much to love and a few things that just should not be at this kind of property. First the positives: great staff - very helpful front desk, service at the wine reception and breakfast was great and our housekeeper was absolutely delightful. The afternoon wine and nibblies were great and breakfast was the best we had during our 3 weeks in Northern California. The neutrals: we had one of the smaller rooms (cosy queen) and it was adaquate but nothing special (rather basic). For such a great location, the value was good by having the smaller room. Now the negatives: the biggest is the internet service. Petite Auberge is the only property that charged for internet service ($7.99/night) on our 3 weeks in Northern California. This was not disclosed (that I saw) on the Web site. At a property of this stature, I feel that this is a bit cheesy. The second issue is that many rooms face the back alley. Because nights in SF, even in the summer are quite cool, having the windows open is a delight. [BTW - I did not see A/C availability in the room but it might have been - open windows were great]. In the back alley, every morning around 5 a.m. is the garbage pickup. For about 10 min. there is quite a racket that you will not sleep through. So if you have a back alley room and do not have the windows closed and the heat on, I would inquire about the A/C and if available use it.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dominican Republic", "Title": "\u201cA Lovely and Warm Place To be\u201d", "Author": "BrendaPaish", "ReviewID": "UR8016666", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for our holiday in San Francisco.

The bed was big, nice and comfortable; they even put a RUSS teddy bear on the bed (Not for guest, it is only for decoration). Although the room was quite small, we did not find it a problem at all. The bathroom was nicely decorated, in French-countryside style. We had a shower room - and the water that comes out of it was so, so powerful, it almost skinned us! It was a GREAT shower with very high pressured water. The thing we need after a long walk around the city. On the basement was the breakfast and wine room. (Wine room meaning; the hotel serves cheese and wine in the afternoon). The breakfast was always quiche, plus a lot of fruit and maybe some sausages. I would rather have an English breakfast, but the breakfasts we had there were good. Coffee and tea 'flow' all day, all we have to do is to go to the basement. They also put some apples and cookies for guests. There is a small library at the basement, where there were few sofas and coffee tables. Also there was a fire place, so it made the room cozy. The staff at the front desk were very pleasant all throughout our stay. They give good directions and recommendation to places. The car park fee is USD32 a day, and when we were checking into the hotel, there was a car park right in front of the steps of the hotel,and we unloaded our stuff. Apparently, a car is allowed to park at that spot for several minutes, just enough time to take the things out of the car and checking in. Once we were finished with the front desk and got our room, the staff took our car to their car park, some 30 minutes away around the city. It is recommended that you ask the staff 1 hour before you actually need to depart or go somewhere. Having said that, we did not encounter any difficulties in getting our car. (At times, when we just got back from touring out of San Francisco city, our car was parked for more than an hour at that spot and the staff did not seem to worry to much about getting the car parked at their allocated car park area.) I like the hotel, because it is close to anywhere we wanted to go by foot. It is close to Chinatown, Fishermen's wraft, financial district and shopping centres.

We found it to be very comfortable, no frills in the SMALL room but everything you could need, except from maybe a bathtub (we stayed in a standard queen maybe other rooms had them). The bedroom was small but comfortable with a TV (in the cupboard however the top draw pulled out and the TV rotated so that you could watch TV in bed), heating, bathrobe and toiletries. The hotel was quiet, our room was not directly over the main street (Bush Street) which could have been a bit noisier but did not seem too busy a road for a big city like San Francisco. The view from the side of the hotel was over a run down building however this did not bother us as the room was quiet and you could open the windows. We arrived about an hour prior to check-in however the room was ready so we were able to check-in. Breakfast was nice with cereals, toast, pastries, hot sausage and bread and butter pudding. There were cookies available all day in reception, and also nibbles and drinks in the early evening. These were served in the basement where there was a sitting area with sofas and a gas effect open fire, a nice area to relax after a busy day. The soft drinks in the fridge and hot drinks were available all day free or charge so this was a bonus. There were a few steps leading up to the hotel from street level, which could maybe be a bit awkward with heavy cases for the less able, but there was a very helpful guy available to help if needed.

They sent us to a wonderful Mexican restaurant. The housekeeping staff and breakfast/appetizer hosts were extremely friendly every time we passed them. We went down to pick up a couple of bottles of water on our way back one night and the breakfast host was down there cleaning up and he offered us some cake to take back to our room and some wine. He chatted with us for at least 20 minutes. The hotel definitely was charming. We liked the way it was decorated. It really felt like a quaint French inn. The location was perfect. We were close enough to Union Square and the cablecars without being in the middle of the crowds. We loved the cookies and complimentary beverages that were always available. It was nice to grab a soda or bottle of water and a couple of cookies on our way back in after a day of walking the numerous hills. The wine and cheese in the evenings was a nice touch. Cons: The room was very tiny. We booked a cozy queen and \"cozy\" is an understatement. We were constantly bumping into each other. There really isn't enough room for 2 people and luggage. The bathroom only had a very small shower stall. I kept banging my elbows on the sides. The included breakfast was nice but we were only able to take advantage of it one out of three mornings we were there. It started at 8:00 on weekends and holidays. We had some early tours booked and had to leave by 8:00 so we couldn't have breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast was one of the selling points of the hotel but we ended up having to go out and buy breakfast twice. That was a big disappointment as well as a waste of money. The noise in the mornings was unbearable. We were awakened at 5:30 a.m. two mornings (including Memorial Day) by garbagemen. It sounded like they were out there for about half an hour. After that we couldn't go back to sleep. Many times we walked by the front desk and there was nobody there. We had to walk next door to the White Swan if we needed help. That was a little inconvenient. It also made me feel a little uncomfortable to think that there was nobody there in case of emergency. Overall, the Petite Auberge was all right.

We even left one morning for a quick snack and returned to a completely cleaned room - it was almost as if they were hiding in the halls waiting for us to leave so they could start cleaning.

All of this was informal so you wouldn't have to include yourself in the conversation if you chose not to. Sometimes just a good breakfast or glass of wine was all we wanted - and that was all we got. All in all, the value of our room was outstanding. We got so much more than we paid for. There is no doubt in our minds that we will stay at the Petite Auberge each and every time we come to San Francisco!

Our room was right next to the kitchen, which was stocked 24/7 with soft drinks and bottled water at no charge. Breakfast was always good - great coffee! Free newspaper and weather report every morning at your door. Front desk staff GREAT - they recommended the best restaurants that we would have never found otherwise. Kitchen staff was also very friendly. Our favorite thing about this place was the nightly wine and snack service. This was a great way to meet people - we made friends with so many! The Adeva products were a great touch, too. The hotel is within walking distance of many things, and the cable car line is not far at all.

The breakfast is much better than the continental breakfast offered at most hotels. They also offer round-the-clock complimentary fresh-baked cookies, coffee, teas, soft drinks and bottled water. Every night at 5 p.m., they offer snacks, wine and cheese in the cozy downstairs area of the hotel (complete with a gas fire).

My husband and I came after a trip driving up the coast and when we pulled in, I went in to find out what we would do with our many various bags. I spoke to an amazingly nice woman at the desk, Kahulia and was impressed enough so that in my jaded New Yorker manner, I walked back out and told my husband \"she's too nice, it's a little scary!\" Well, she continued that way, giving us maps, a route of things to see before we returned our rental car that afternoon and plenty of suggestions. We were able to upgrade our room, luckily b/c I think the poster 2 down may have been correct in their assumption of the room sizes. She said \"you may not fit in your originally booked room with all those bags!\" We had a great room with a fake fireplace, very clean, lots of cozy pillows and really enjoyed the room. The free water/soda at our disposal was so convient, I've never seen this at a hotel, makes starting your day (or coming back after a long one) so much easier, and you save lots of $ on water! We loved the wine and cheese hour, just a nice little touch and helped us refresh before heading out for a night. The breakfast was acceptable, everything good, but the reviews I read led me to have Very high expectations (someone said it was \"the best they've ever had?\"), it was a normal complimentary hotel breakfast. No turn down service as noted, but we did not care. Overall, the staff really gave the place a nice touch. We had one woman at the front desk who was sour and unhelpful, (in stark contrast to Kuhulia) but still better than you get at a major chain. 2 different bell-hop men were very helpful, one gave us extra wine after we missed the end time in the evening and another gave us a great rec for a restaurant for Dim Sum. Location was impressively convient...a short walk to Union Square where we got the cable car to go other places, we thought the neighborhood was a great location for tourists! We got the price of an on-line service which is part of why we were so satisfied.... I think the regular price if you call them directly is probably much more. We highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again!

We booked the \"cozy queen\" room which I believe is one of the smaller of their rooms. The price was $150.00 per night plus tax. The hotel is quaint, neat and clean and within a short walking distance to cable car transportation to the Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Chinatown. And it's within walking distance to Union Square. The problem we had with this hotel is that the room was so small that there was no place to lay your luggage other than on the bed. There is not much moving around space in the room either. The bathroom is tiny too but was very clean. The hotel offered free continental breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese at 5:00 each day. If I would have known I would have booked a larger room and I believe those come with fireplaces. But, even with that, I believe the price would have been even higher than what we paid for the cozy queen and I think for what you get, it's too much.
