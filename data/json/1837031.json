I would consider the rates to be reasonable for a hotel on Hong kong Island. Comparable hotels at that point in time will be Kowloon Shangri La on Mody road however I chose this hotel because it was 1 of my friend's first time in HK and my friend wanted somewhere near H&M. This hotel definitely has a superb location; To start with, it is very near to the airport express central, by cab it is probably 10-15 mins away depending on the traffic. On wellington street, this hotel is just walking distance to the famous 'Yung Kee' roast goose restaurant, the 'Lan Fong Yuen' famous milk tea cafeteria, old school dim sum place 'Lin Heung Tea House', 'Tsui Wah' 24 hrs restaurant. Roadside stalls also surround the hotel. Food is never a problem staying here. It is very convenient for u to walk around and shop as well, it has a few brands there which most people will like. Transportation wise, cabs are pretty economical, if budget is on your mind, MTR Central station is within walking distance from the hotel 7-10 mins. If u are thinking of nightlife, pubs, clubs and drinks u are in luck, Lan Kwai Fong the famous spot for Hong Kong's nightlife is just 7-10 mins walk away, popular club like Magnum club is also in the vicinity and it is a pretty neat one. Room is nice and spacious very unlike the typical HK type of small and cramp rooms. It is clean, clean sheets and towels. The bed is comfortable enough for 3 persons sleeping in it. Bathroom is pretty decent as well. Hardly any view from the 9th floor though, just street facing. As for it's service, I wouldn't fault it too much as they are prompt, efficient and professional but I find something lacking, perhaps they are not too friendly, I do find most of the staff a bit cold. They just lack the WOW factor, if they were to be slightly better I guess this review would have gotten a 5/5. Only thing I hated about this hotel is the street beside it, Graham Street, as it is a wet market in the morning it gets very dirty in the middle of night with a lot of rubbish stack up by the curbside near the hotel entrance, waiting for the rubbish truck to pick them up. The other thing to note will be, the actual hotel's reception is 1 floor up when u enter through the door, there are 2 lifts, use them and go 1 floor up for check in. Concluding this, hotel is in a very very good area, very accessible, near to almost everything, rooms are nice and decent, service is ok. Price is reasonable. Definitely a good choice, especially when u are visiting Hong Kong for the 1st time.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good value\u201d", "Author": "Condie84", "ReviewID": "UR133197485", "Content": "Stayed for three nights on the way home from OZ and found this to be a perfect location for exploring this amazing city.

And given the cleanliness of the hotel, the beautiful decor, the staff service, and great location to work and pleasure, I realized it was even more of a bargain. Check-in was efficient and smooth, I was upgraded to the top floor Deluxe room. Although it had 2 twin beds, I didn't mind. The room was larger, and quiet as it was on the top floor. Room was clean and had amenities such as complimentary water, hot water boiler, and fridge. At the end of my stay, they kept my luggage for me through the day until I boarded my midnight flight, which was very helpful and convenient. The one detraction is while there are air conditioning services for cooling, there is no central heating. Thus if you're in HK during a very cold period, you might want to bring extra layers even in the room. All in all I would highly recommend the Butterfly on Wellington, whether for business or holiday.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "orange county, ca", "Title": "\u201cLocation and Value\u201d", "Author": "Orang_County_greg", "ReviewID": "UR129516496", "Content": "Small rooms and not a lot in the way of amenities(it's a small boutique hotel) but clean comfy rooms and an awesome location.

Hallways are narrow but not necessarily a let down! When we got to the room we were amazed! It may be only 16 sq.m. but it's definitely 16 sq.m. of asian elegance! The room door, headboard, side tables, closet door, writing table and ref cabinet were in elegant varnished wood finish with weaved mat accents. Nice asian touch! The wall colors were mixed well with the asian feel. Everything just clicked. Bed was very comfortable and the sheets and pillowcases were smooth on the skin. Bathroom was small, but definitely does not feel it as the color and design made it feel good. TV, ref, safe, free wifi and writing desk rounds out the amenities.

This being my second time to HK, I decided to stay in the heart of the action on HK island.

Near the midlevel esculators, shopping, nightlife (happy hour is between appox. 3pm-9pm, everywhere near the hotel). I only slept and showered in the room. A good thing to note about the Midlevel esculators ( or travelators as they are called there) They go down from 6am to 10am and go up between 10am and midnight. They were after all built for the rich people's maids ... not tourists lol. I suggest taking a cab to the hotel if you are at all unfamiliar with the area. You can walk to the hotel though the mall connected to the train terminal via skyways until you get to the midlevel esculators... or you can save the time, effort and pay about $4.00 US for the ten min. taxi ride to the hotel. Taxi's are cheap !! The hotel does not have breakfast but, why bother with the choices around the hotel. A small bakery across the street, kitty corner to the left, cheap and good. Or the famous 'flying pan' for an english/american breakfast. Take the esculators up and you will spot the sign for the flying pan on the left, you're a traveler you'll figure out how to get there once spotted better than I can explain. I had a regular room, it was small, but well appointed. The bathroom with the sliding 'glass doors' are strange, and could break it for some if you're not comfortable going to the bathroom in front of whom you're traveling with --- Nightlife around the room is abundant -- but, not sketchy. Could not hear anything in the room, and only 8 floors up. It is upscale, and very expensive for most people of HK. A cheap happy hour drink will cost your around $5, double or triple that after 8-9pm when most people start to come out. Which is still a good price for such a metropolitan city. Sunday and Monday you will find lots of food and drink deals. Almost everywhere a 10% service charge is added, if not you should add. However a large carlsberg beer in the can at the 7/11 will cost you about $1, there are three with in a block of the hotel. The area right around the hotel at night, can be a little dark, but a block over is the soho area, In the morning it comes to life as a food market. So, don't be shocked.

I had never spent ANY time in Central, and in particular in the area near Butterfly on Wellington. So getting to the hotel by taxi from the Airport Express Central Station seemed twisted in knots. Driving down Wellington heading to the hotel, frankly I was worried I picked the wrong hotel in a dicey location.... I could not have been more wrong! Butterfly puts their hotels in the center of the greatest neighborhoods - and once we walked around, discovered that this is the place to BE in Hong Kong. Everything is in walking distance or escalator trips. So many restaurants! Pubs! Shopping! Malls! Seriously good fun for 2 days. The Hotel is set up a little differently from the Butterfly on Pratt. The door takes you to an elevator, and reception is on the 2nd floor. Check in was easy and quick. The \"lobby\" was quiet, with rich wood decor and comfortable seating. We rushed up to our room, with 2 single beds for my work companion and myself. The room was fresh, clean, perfect. Not that small, I expected much tighter quarters. I have a huge luggage case, and was able to open it, stow it, and keep it out of the way. Bedding was world class, and the beds were softer than most in HK. The bathroom was typical of the Butterfly Chain. Great detail to materials, sinks, faucets and showers. I was pleased to see that all Butterfly hotels use the same shampoo - a great citrus scent - I actually looked forward to that scent, after 2 weeks travelling in China hotels with industrial strength \"complimentary\" shampoos. Finally, the view from our window looked back up Wellington street towards the esclators. The city view was awesome from our windows. The room was quiet, no noise from the streets nor the elevator. One last treat...walk up Wellington at night and look back to the Hotel. You will see huge, colorful Butterflys floating up the exterior walls of the hotel - a neat trick with LED lighting. I highly recommend the Butterfly on Wellington, and will make this my new home base for some R&R at the end of business trips.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "penang", "Title": "\u201cexcellent good and great front desk service!\u201d", "Author": "lynnypl", "ReviewID": "UR120739945", "Content": "i walk in around 9.30pm and needed a room to rest but limited resources.

The Butterfly on Wellington is located close to just about everything, thanks in no small part to its proximity to the mid-central level escalators. Central is the place to be in Hong Kong, so an amazing amount and diversity of shops, markets, and restaurants are nearby. We've stayed here a few times, in both the standard rooms as well as the executive rooms. Both are nice, but the executive rooms are noticeably larger. Otherwise the amenities are similar, a nice bed, LCD tv, and a small fridge and kettle. The bathroom does smell a bit musty, however this is Hong Kong, water and humidity are somewhat inescapable; just close the door and no drama. The lobby has a few computers, free papers, and coffee (via a nespresso machine) in the morning. For those of you desiring a more substantial breakfast (available 24 hours a day, mind you), you can't go wrong with The Flying Pan, just off of Hollywood rd. To get there, head back towards the skyway, but walk up the street below it. When you get to Hollywood rd, the skyway takes a sharp turn to the right. Continue up the street straight and The Flying Pan will be about 50 meters up on the right. On weekends there will be a wait, for good reason. Getting there: As mentioned, the hotel is very close to the mid central level escalators. To get there from the train, exit the metro at central, and take the escalators up into the IFC mall. Exit into the skyway towards the post office, and make your first right past the post office onto the walkway that takes you past the backside of the IFC. From there, walk to the end, until the walkway bears left. Follow the walkway through the enclosed art gallery space, and onto the first of the mid level escalators. One more escalator and you will see a sign indicating an exit onto Wellington st. Head down the stairs, turn left onto Wellington, and the hotel will be a block or so down on your left. Around: While walking to the hotel from the skyway, you'll notice quite a few restaurants, especially some nice ones on your left. Thai, Egyption, Indian, and lots of others. In addition, a block past the hotel, on the left, is a great little sidewalk bar that we found ourselves at a few times. Just past that is the 7-11 shop, should you just want to retire back to the room with a few cold ones. Other things: The doorman is on duty 24 hours to help with taxis or directions. The lobby is actually on the second floor, so head past the doorman to the elevators and stop on two to check in. The lobby staff are great, strong english skills and very accomodating. We have another trip to Hong Kong coming up soon, and you can bet we will be at the Butterfly on Wellington.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cPrice & location\u201d", "Author": "Outcider", "ReviewID": "UR119960147", "Content": "We stayed for 6 nights during a trip to Hong Kong to visit friends and sightsee. Butterfly is close enough to the never-ending escalator, Central train station, and the ferries that you pretty much have the city & surrounding islands at your feet. The decor is a pleasantly modern upscale Chinese style, lots of red and gold; the bathrooms are lovely Euro style with large showers, and the front desk folks are good at English and know the neighborhood well. Take their advice! There are several what my friend calls \"cat alleys\" nearby that have very inexpensive but nice souvenirs, including jewelry and household items. It's close to a great Dim Sum place, and right down the street from the 24 hour Tsui Wah, as well as many other good places, so you will eat well for cheap. If you start to miss western fare, there's a place called Classified, up on Hollywood Road. That's also a good place to go in case everything else is closed for a holiday. Butterfly is also a block above the financial district so I had good access to my ATM for our trips to Lantau Island/Big Buddha, Ocean Park, and Ten Thousand Buddha Road. If you like pricier bargain shopping, IFC mall is at the end of the neverending escalator, two blocks away. Wellington Street like much of Hong Kong, is quite run down and dirty, but you'll get over it. It's safe pretty much day and night, there's lots to do, and it's so convenient. The downside of Butterfly is that when you get in before check in they will tell you to upgrade if you want a room-- not a terrible thing; but also there are some plumbing ventilation issues that cause the rooms to smell a bit musty if you don't keep your bathroom door shut at all times. They'll change your room if you complain, but I can't say it makes a lot of difference till you figure out the bathroom is the source.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful hotel in the heart of actions and food!\u201d", "Author": "LTJ71", "ReviewID": "UR119246533", "Content": "It is a real gem, minutes away from major restaurant like Yeung Kee, the famous roast goose place, Lieung Hieang which is literally minutes away.

However, I would question some of the hype around this hotel as there are many alternative places that I have stayed in the area that offer better all round value - the room price quoted was far from \"budget\" priced and nothing is especially spectacular about the place. The rooms are certainly not large but quite adequate on the basis that Hong Kong is somewhere to explore and enjoy rather than to spend time in a hotel - the glass enclosed toilet and shower was rather unexpected and might be an issue for some visitors who prefer the privacy of an enclosed room but was no problem for us (in this, the design was similar to that adopted in my room when I stayed at L'Hotel Nina - see my review). Coffee facilities in the reception area was rather a gimmick and we ignored it in favour of finding out own brekkie outside. Location is the key winner of this hotel, as it is literally a stones throw to all the sights of Central. We got a taxi from Hong Kong Airport Express train station on the way to the hotel to check-in, but on our check-out in the early evening for a night flight to AKL, we found that there were simply none to be had. We even lugged our luggage over to a nearby road that was busier, but still no luck. The concierge could have been much more proactive and helpful here, but pretty much left us to get on with it. We eventually had to carry our luggage all the way to the in-town check-in desks of HK Airport Ecxpress Station, across the streets and walkways of Central. Not fun, but at least it was not summer heat or pouring tropical rain, but this issue alone, and the poor attitude of the hotel staff to help us, would dissuade me from staying here again unless I was on a very light luggage trip such as a short business trip, or where I could work in an office and have the taxi organised by colleagues from there.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cgood spot\u201d", "Author": "n-opp-1e", "ReviewID": "UR118177991", "Content": "stayed here for 1 night. its a great little hotel. service good. unfortunately no breakfast there is a nice place down the road were you can have breakfast. we arrived at the hotel at 8am unfortunately we had to wait till 12. which I can understand but didnt appreciate especially after a long flight all you want to do is have a nice lay down. 4 hrs waiting is pretty long. its nice and quiet.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!

Rooms are small, but this is Hong Kong, and that's pretty typical for most small hotels. It's a small price to pay considering the location of the hotel. For single or two person travelers, room size shouldn't be a problem. If I could change one thing, it would be the lack of wi-fi in the rooms. You had to go down to the lobby to access the free wi-fi they have, which was fine, but a tad bit inconvenient. Some previous reviewers noted a smell problem. We didn't notice it. In fact, the hotel interior smelled positively fresh and flowery compared to the marketplace outside. To sum up, for the price this hotel is an excellent value.

From airport, just take Airport Express, which directly arrives at HongKong stn, the nearest stn. Also, convenient to take the subway(MTR) to both HK island side and Kowloon Peninsula side. -Many choices for eating-out. From early morning to late at night, many reasonable local restaurants are available around. -Close to both business / shopping area, which means good for both business traveler / individual sightseeing. -The staff are very helpful and work efficiently, which is quite HongKong-ish I think. -No many group guests are staying. Not good: -In the guest room, bedroom and bathroom is not well divided. It's hard to explain, but, in the superior room I stayed, the bathroom is just a corner divided with glass door. it's very unique and stylish, even use the limited space efficiently at maximum, but still I suppose some will not like it. -Some smell comes out from the drain. I guess because it's surrounded by local shops and restaurant, still again, some will not like it. Well, in HK, you have bunch of choices regarding hotels.

The washbasin itself was also extremely small, looking nothing like the ones I have seen in the hotel's promotional photos. There were no shelves for our toiletries either, apart from inside the huge shower enclosure, but I think this was also to make maximum space for wheelchair manouevring. I suppose we could have asked if another room was available, but as we had already unpacked following a long flight from New Zealand, all we wanted to do was get to sleep quickly in the very comfortable bed. The staff in the reception area, which is manned 24/7, were very helpful , as was the doorman who found us a taxi at 5.00 am on our last morning. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no restaurant in the hotel but the room did have tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge, plus a couple of bottles of mineral water. We found a very nice cafe up the road (turn right out of the hotel) called something in Mexican (Cafe del Cielo?) where we had orange juice, coffee and a cinnamon whirl each morning. I would definitely recommend Butterfly on Wellington, mainly for its location, and would go there again if I ever visit Hong Kong, but would try to avoid the disabled room. Good to see that they provided one though!", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAn authentic Hong Kong experience\u201d", "Author": "vacancestoujour", "ReviewID": "UR101345870", "Content": "We stayed at this property for 6 nights and was upgraded to an executive room on level 20.

It was decorated in modern chinois, had a large L shaped chaise lounge, comfortable bed, a spacious working desk and a nice bathroom with a rain shower head.

I enjoyed trying the local small eateries, seeing the 'real' markets and walking in the small labyrinths and lanes dotted with market stalls. Soho and Lan Kwai Fong is around the corner which was handy after a late night out. There is a wash & fold service a few doors away and an ironing board and iron are provided by the hotel on request.

Our room was also excellent, being in the corner and having windows on two sides. The bathroom (which did not include a long bath) was also clean. Unfortunately the bathroom had a pungent odour (which reminded me of sewage and a small dead animal). A call to the reception drew a quick response. A chap from Housekeeping came up and sprayed some anti-bacterial cleaner into the WC. That helped a little. Subsequent feedback to the reception drew an acknowledgment but no further concrete action to resolve the situation. We even suggested that they give us some potpourri to suppress the smell. Given that the rest of the hotel had a pleasant fragrance from potpourri, the absence of a response from the hotel was surprising. In the end we gave up and bought our own air-freshener spray from a shop nearby. So overall, we would say that the experience would have been perfect, if not for the smelly bathroom.

This is a perfect hotel by my standards - clean, comfortable, quietly luxurious, superbly located, and by giving me exactly what I need and none of anything else, it packs an incredible value. This is a small, simple operation. The Butterfly is not a luxury hotel by typical standards - it doesn't have 3 expensive fusion restaurants, or doormen in fancy uniforms, or a line of taxis and Mercedes Benz hotel cars, or a shopping arcade, or even much of a lobby. What it does have is a humble but extremely convenient location on a very local-feeling HK street, wonderful rooms, modern in-room decor and amenities, thoughtful touches, and a fantastic sticker price. The hotel is at the corner of Wellington and Graham streets, on a narrow and pedestrian part of Wellington. While it's not the prettiest block in HK, it feels like the real HK. Graham is just an alley climbing up the hillside, with a street market in full swing, stalls selling vegetables and fish and meats. Wellington has teahouses and retail shops and restaurants that cater more to locals than to tourists. But fear not - it's a block to the Mid-Levels escalators to take you to Soho. A few blocks farther is Lan Kwai Fong and its restaurants and nightlife. There are probably a dozen coffee shops within 3 blocks walk, and restaurants of every price point surround you. And just a few blocks away are Pedder Street and all the luxury boutique shopping you could ever want. I walked here from the Hong Kong Airport Express station via the escalators in about 15 minutes, even with a roller bag. You're even closer to Central MTR station. The Star Ferry is also 15 minutes away via the escalators and a number of very comfortable flyovers. There is a small laundry operation 4 doors down that can wash and fold your laundry for a song. The location is simply divine. Once in your room, you'll find it compact but plenty luxurious. The furnishings are done in a tasteful modern Chinese, with plenty of wood, a sexy bathroom with a rain-style shower (no bath, unfortunately) and vessel-style sink. The decor is very well-done, feeling fresh, clean, modern, and new. The bed is very comfortable, with a nice down blanket, and suffers no shortage of pillows. The TV is a nice flatscreen on a tilting, swinging mount, economizing space but not reducing function. The desk is wide and comfortable, with plenty of room for work and storage. Internet access is wired and plenty fast. In an especially nice touch, the wall outlet is equipped with a foreign plug adapter, so my laptop plugged right in. There's even a DVD player. The climate control is powerful, modern, easy-to-use, and very effective. The only complaints I'd have are small. Rooms do not have irons or ironing boards, a big miss for business travelers. Stylish though the desk chair was, it was not high on comfort. Others have mentioned a slight sewer-y smell in the bathroom - I can confirm this was pretty much ever-present. The toilet was also a little cramped. Lastly, my door never seemed to want to close all the way - probably just needed a little adjustment. I had to make sure I closed it hard whenever I left the room. My room on the 5th floor could be noisy from the street action below, but I did not experience any unpleasantness from neighboring rooms. The elevators aren't great; they're a little slow and not as fashionably done as the rest of the place, but they are secure, requiring keycard access to get to guest floors. Service is minimal. There's a doorman at ground level who has some maps, but he's no concierge. I'm not even sure if most of them spoke English. The lobby is on the next floor up, and while it looks presentable and has 2 public iMacs for free use, it's thinly staffed, and besides checking people in and out I'm not sure they had much to do. I did get help printing a few documents, but I did not get offered help with my bag (not that I would have accepted). Now for the best part - I got all this for less than $160 USD per night, all-in. It was an outstanding value. I travel to HK several times per year, usually for about a week at a time, and I've traditionally stayed at another, much larger, much more full-service hotel. I've given that hotel good reviews, but their price crept up and up and up to the point where I needed to try something new. I'm so glad I did. If you don't need all the glitz and shine, but still want comfortable, clean, luxurious appointments in more of a serviced apartment vein, and need a great location, I don't know why you'd even consider anything else, especially considering the price.

Why a boutique hotel? Our preference for a smaller, more select clientele, faster checking in and out, more personalized service (if required) and usually less \"worn out\" rooms. Fortunately this hotel recently opened its doors a few months back so everything was very new and that was a big plus in our filter. There isn't much of a front entrance/lobby so make sure you print out the map and address. Taxis are very efficient from the Airport Express Link to the city and know their way around (but of course!). While it is possible to walk from the train station I didn't fancy lugging my suitcases around past midnight and unfamiliar with my surroundings. The hotel's fast and efficient check in staff made sure that we were comfortably settled into our room after a late night check in. There are large windows but not much of a view from where we stayed, the view is blocked by many sky scrapers that dot the city. Everything that was supposed to work, worked from the (branded) capsule coffee machine, TV, high pressure shower cubicle, firm mattress. I know many people enjoy soft pillows but I'm not one of them, preferring a firm, foam pillow. Fortunately it didn't affect my sleep. If you are a foodie, Wellington Street boasts many well known eateries from end to end including the 24 hour Tsui Wah toward the Lan Kwai Fong pub area. There are lots of well known restaurants but make it a habit to call ahead of lunch and dinner to avoid a 30-45 minute wait. There isn't a restaurant or cafe in the hotel. They do serve tea and coffee at tea-time at the reception but with the amount of cafes and restaurants all within a few minutes' walk, it would be pointless.

It offers a very personable, professional staff; well-maintained rooms and common areas; free internet; and they say complimentary access to some of the city's establishments (from what I remember), though that was not something I was made aware of until I completed the guest survey. HK is jam-packed and you're in the center of it all! Some come to embrace this for so much culture, great shopping, ease of access or necessity (business, etc.), and others are UNpleasantly surprised by how much a commodity space and quietness is in this city; if the latter is the case refer to my review for Le Meridien Cyberport. WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW: The hotel is a bit hard to locate -- even for cab drivers -- so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you bring the hotel's name, address and phone number (preferably ALSO written in Chinese), a map along with street intersections and two or so landmarks. The hotel's fa\u00e7ade and entryway is quite low-key. You'll see a guard/greeter in the entryway, then proceed to the second floor. My experience: Upon arrival, I was a bit a little apprehensive that even a resident cab driven didn't know where this hotel was (which is actually part of what makes Butterfly on Wellington so great; you are SO ENTRENCHED in the city, and HK has so many small streets with a lot of establishments on them). I was warmly greeted and it almost seemed like reception was expecting me at that exact moment. I was seated and offered a beverage while everything was processed. My room...well, it's HK, so do NOT expect a lot of space unless your favorite hobby is spending. Everything was in order, so I was a happy camper. In comparison to my last stay in HK at Le Meridien where it is isolated and very quiet, I was expecting a loud night and a hard time sleeping. It was actually very quiet. Don't count on a view. Well, count on a genuine HK view...lol...one with lots of buildings in close proximity. That aside, the hotel's location is GREAT! I felt like most things were within walkable distance. I also loved the fact that you don't feel like you're on tourist island, kept away from the \"real\" side of the city. With Butterfly on Wellington, I felt immersed in residential/domestic everyday life. The hotel also offers free internet and there are computers located in the lobby for guests to use at their convenience. Tips: DEFINITELY take Peak Tram, the cable car close to the zoological and botanical gardens, in the evening hours. Also, reception (from what I remember) advises that breakfast is served in the morning. While I was there, all they offered was coffee, I think some juice and small biscuit cookies w/ a local newspaper. If you need any sort of toiletry, tylenol, drinks or snacks at any hour, make a right outside the hotel, walk up a block and make a left.

As an ex-pat who has lived in Hong Kong and stayed in many hotels in HK on trips, I have something to compare to. Pros: To be fair the staff are generally lovely with a few grumpy exceptions, and they do try to do their best to give you what you want. The location can't be beaten, and the decor does look lovely when you first walk into your room. Here is where it ends. Cons: 1. Smoked out non-smoking rooms. Our non-smoking room on level 17 smelled like a smoker\u2019s apartment, and was two single beds despite booking a double, and we had to stay in that room first night because the hotel was fully booked and it was all they had. Moved the next day to another non-smoking room on level 12 less smoky, but you could still get a whiff of smoke from time to time. Clothes not yet worn that remained in my tightly Zipped up suitcase reeked of smoke from that first room. 2. Noisy, hence very bad sleep. Water gurgles in pipes all night, you can hear somebody cough in the next room, the housekeeping staff start at 7 am and bang their access door about 50 times loudly, which sounds like it's right in your room. 3. Beds. Despite booking and paying for a double bed we ended up with a two single beds, nearly fell out a couple of times, haven't had to sleep in single bed since I was about 16 years old! Pillows were rubbish, flatten out into a pancake like thickness. even two together were terrible. 4. Bathroom. Water pressure is really bad in this building. In the room in level 17 we could hardly get it to flush. The rest of our stay on level 12 the hot water oscillated between scalding and chilly on a cycle of 30 seconds each on rotation. The water pressure went up and down accordingly. Having a shower was really not fun at all and took longer as you hopped around in the shower to avoid getting burnt and frozen. Overall: this hotel is young and is already wearing very badly. The baby poo brown carpet although only a few months old already looks like 30 years old. The housekeeping noise is fixable, but the rest of it is a real problem.

My sister and I found it very convenient to get to LKF and back but in the afternoons it is an extremely busy area and it is generally quite difficulty to get a taxi around there.

Friendly and helpful concierge. Great location as surrounded by eateries for all budgets (but see downside later). Our room was on 6th floor facing back and although wellington street is busy we were not disturbed by noise and got restful sleep. For me ( in a relatively compact manual wheelchair) the disabled access room was very satisfactory in term of size, layout and amenities. However hotel would not provide a chair for the shower area. i purchased one and have suggested they make this small investment. bed firmness fine for me (I'm prone to backache and therefore quite fussy about beds!) Cons: location wise the street is on a hill, luckily my b/f is fit and strong and was able to push me around. Some of the surrounding streets are quite steep and/or have steps so you need to do a reccy and work out best route for you...but that's part of the challenge/fun of travelling. Overall i thought the room rate was good value. Services provided by hotel minimal (eg. no restaurant, no gym/pool) but we didn't need those.

Staff couldn\u2019t be more attentive or helpful and went out of their way to look after their guests. They don't have a restaurant but there is a relaxing area in reception where coffee is on offer each morning, a morning paper for those who want one. and internet facilities. The bed was firm but that is normal in HK hotels. Lovely quiet room with beautiful bathroom and generously stocked. The huge point of value, the room had generous storage for luggage, clothing, the fridge wasn't cluttered with a minibar, but for those wanting a drink there was no shortage of outlets close by where one could buy anything they wanted. We felt well looked after and our custom valued. We\u2019d definitely stay there again and are happy to recommend. Lovely location - walking distance to public transport. Don't forget your Octopus card. Fruit and vegetable stalls very close by and market stalls down most side streets that lead to the main roads.

I think they are offering promotional rates at the moment, as their brochure talks about room rates of about HK$2,100 upwards - I paid much less.
