The biggest negative I experienced all weekend was that I could not get wireless. I was told to hook into the Cafe's wireless but the signal was too weak. The front desk gave me the password, which I think they assumed I already had, but it didn't work, even after a second call down to confirm that I had it right. But, you know, they would have solved it if I had pursued it (I had my iPhone so I didn't) because they were just nice like that. Okay. Phew. Glad that's over. Now let's move on to the really good things about this hotel. This was the perfect choice for a quick weekend getaway to catch the Pacific Standard Time shows at the MCASDs. I reserved an \"Argento Single\". Too small. No place to even hang clothes. I ran back down to the front desk, asking for a bigger room. For a slight price increase, Room 320 is a larger (I didn't say LARGE) corner room with a balcony overlooking the hub of Little Italy. A place to hang clothes, a desk, mini-fridge and windows on two sides. Perfect...for one person (or two who really like each other). I did see, through an open door, a much bigger room so they do exist. But Room 320 was perfect for me. The room was very clean, chic decor (recently redone), comfy bed. It's not a luxury hotel. The amenities were few; shampoo (no conditioner), soap (no lotion), a hairdryer. I didn't see a clock in my room but who wants a clock when you are on vacation? Beyond the room, the hotel is charming. Great front desk staff, helpful housekeeping, a mascot terrier, low-key attitude and peaceful. The four or five-block Little Italy Farmer's Market on Saturday is right outside the hotel and the great band that was set up on the corner opposite my room made a nice Saturday even more enjoyable. Somehow attached to the hotel is Cafe Italia which is where my mornings began (also great sandwiches for lunch). The street is loaded with restaurants and bars (this is where central location of your hotel might come in handy), a couple of nearby convenience stores plus walking distance to many other points of interest. All that right outside the door of this wonderful little hotel.

I was in San Diego to attend a conference and needed an Internet connection for work. Some how, I ended up in a hotel without in-room connection, so after the first night I hunted around for a room. There were not a lot of choices under $200 night (my budget), but I found La Pensione. Just to be sure of the hotel and its service, I went to the hotel before making the reservation. I spoke with a woman at the front desk and confirmed the in-room Internet service, which is also advertised on their site. Given the great location and relatively okay look and feel of the modest hotel, I made a reservation. When I showed up to move in, I again confirmed the Internet connection. That first night, after my conference, I tried to log on. No luck. The person at the front desk \"rebooted the system\", but still no connection. I had to send out several lengthy emails thru my cell phone. The next night, the same thing. I was very disappointed and would have understood were they to tell me that the system was down, but they could not have been less interested in the issue. That night, I approached the manager, Javier,at the front desk. He said that the Internet didn't work as well in some rooms of the hotel. I told him that I had expressed my need for the Internet very clearly on more than one occasion. He then said something about it being Comcast's problem. I requested a price reduction, given that I had paid their walk-in rate of $129 for a very (underscore very) modest room and expected Internet to be included in that charge. A very modest $10/day would have shown me that he cared about the inconvenience, but he said he'd have to check with someone who was traveling. This morning, I woke up and went to check out. The woman who had originally told me that the rooms had Internet was at the front desk. I told her about the conversation with the manager last night and asked if they final bill reflected a rebate. It did not, and she had not heard anything about it. She would have to try to get a hold of the manager, Javier. I left my suitcase there and went off to my conference. I returned at noon to retrieve my suitcase and settle the bill. The woman said that Javier denied any kind of reduction. When I asked her if she thought this seemed wrong, given that she, herself, had \"sold\" me on the Internet service, she replied, \"I dunno\". Anyway, it's left me VERY upset. I could have dealt with the service interruption if they had been decent about the issue, acknowledged it and sought to make me feel better. Customer service at this level needs to be pointed out.

For good walkers, you could easily walk to the Gaslamp District. Pros:Price and Location .Cons: may not be parking onsight and if you do get a spot, it is a very tight parking garage, small rooms, noise from low planes coming in for landing to nearby airport and train one block away so you could hear horns blow (but we got used to it). I know it seems like alot more cons than pro's, but I am just being honest about what to expect.

I like the area very much and it is a very convenient location if you are attending an event at the Convention Center, which is about ten minutes away via trolley. I had high hopes for La Pensione - the location is wonderful and the pictures on their website made it look like a cute property. It really IS a cute property, although it could be a great property with a little more attention to detail on the part of the owners. I had a corner room with a nice view to the bay. The room had a rather odd layout - a hanging bar (but no closet) with four hangers and a sort of bar sink (although it was a full-sized sink) over a small refrigerator. The bed was a standard double bed, I think and there was a small desk and a sort of armoire with a television and drawers below. I'm not a huge television fan, but I couldn't help but be surprised at what a small TV was provided. I haven't stayed in a hotel for years that had such a small TV. The size of the TV and the fact that it is a typical old-fashioned \"TV tube\" type was perfectly in keeping with the rest of the experience of the room - it was OK, but really not state of the art. The bathroom was clean and the bath/shower liner looked to be pretty new, but the shower head was pretty ancient and the paint/caulking where the top of the shower liner met the wall was pretty moldy and cruddy looking. There was no storage of any kind in the bathroom except for the toilet tank and a small funky shelf below the mirror above the sink. There was a wall-mounted shelf on one side of the bed, but nothing on the other side - no bedside table, nightstand - nothing. There was no alarm clock or radio of any kind in the room, so if you brought your own alarm clock and slept on the right side of the bed, you'd have to put your alarm clock on the floor. The bed was OK - not bad by any means, but definitely not a high quality bed. Okay - so that's the bad - most of it. The website advertised that there was a dataport in the room - and there was - but I had no Cat 5 cable. I asked at the desk and the young women replied that I didn't need one: there was WiFi. Okay, there were several wireless networks that showed up in the room - none of them was the hotel's. Apparently, the hotel's free WiFi only works in the lobby and the atrium. In truth, I could never log on to it, but I was able to use the free WiFi from the Cafe Italia located on the ground floor if I sat in the atrium. So if the ability to use the internet in your hotel room is important to you, don't count on having that capability at La Pensione. The property is attractive, is in a GREAT locations vis a vis the trolley (light rail), the many great restaurants and stores in Little Italy and the downtown area. The staff is friendly and helpful and there's a sweet dog who lives in the lobby and appears to own the place. The price was very attractive also. Would I recommend La Pensione? Sure - but I'd be sure to enumerate the drawbacks that I encountered. The owners could easily drop a couple thousand bucks per room and make the experience of staying in their property a really first-class one. Give the rooms a facelift - maybe revise that funny layout on those corner rooms, new beds, new TV's, get the WiFi working, flush the air out of the boiler system so the radiators in the rooms don't gurgle all goddam night long, have your elevator company fix the hydraulic leak in the elevator so it doesn't stink of hydraulic fluid all the time. You might think about installing air conditioning in the rooms so that people who visit in the summer don't have that to complain about. You have a nice staff, a swell hotel dog, a fantastic, unique location, a great 'skeleton' with which to work - so what's holding you back? Spend a little dough and make your property all that it could - and should - be.

It reminded me a bit of a newer version of the French Hotel in Berkeley--which some of our visitors loved and some hated.

The girl at the desk, obviously mortified, tried to make out that this was his sense of humour. When I returned and asked to speak to him I realised this was no joke. Simply for asking what he had said to my girlfriend he told me I was \"messing with the wrong guy\". I asked why he had approached her in this manner and he made out that, yes, she is a liar and also crazy and he wanted her removed.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at La Pensione and will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, California", "Title": "\u201cStill a Deal\u201d", "Author": "Bay_Arean2", "ReviewID": "UR6738833", "Content": "La Pensione Hotel is a very basic budget hotel very similar to those budget hotels/pensions in Europe in size and character (except La Pension does not serve a free breakfast). I've stayed at La Pensione on over five different occasions when I visit San Diego. This review is based on my last visit in December 2006. The hotel is located in a great neighborhood called Little Italy. The neighborhood has prospered since my visit three years before. A major problem can be the noise. Noise from the nearby airport, train station, trolley station and the crowds in neighboring establishments can be overwhelming during the day. Things do quiet down into the evening and definitely by midnight. I personally like rooms facing Date Street (closer to India Street) the best, since they're the least noisy. They also get the morning sun, but not the afternoon heat. The rooms are described as having a queen size bed, but during all my stays, none of those beds were ever bigger than my bed at home, which is a full size bed. So I will say that the rooms are on the small side, each with a full size bed, a mini-refrigerator, a sink (with garbage disposal), a desk, a television, a desk fan and a ceiling fan. The rooms used to have a modern decor, but have recently been renovated to a warmer, welcoming decor which I like better. The quality of the television and reception has always been spotty. This time, the television and the reception was great. Hopefully this is the case in all their rooms. There is no closet space, just a dresser, upon which the television sits, and near the entrance, a rack with hangers. There is a bathroom which simply has the toilet and the bathtub/shower. The mirror and wash basin (actually sink, with garbage disposal) is in the main room near the entryway. Air conditioning has never been a problem for me since I've rarely visited in the summer. If I came in the summer, I would not stay here, but would opt for a hotel with air conditioning. The San Diego winters are mild, so I've never had an issue with heating the room, either. Prior to my last visit, parking was free. It is now $10/night. Parking is very tight and limited. It is difficult to maneuver a compact car let alone an SUV, and there were SUV's aplenty on my last visit! Also, you might not find any parking available if you come back from a late night around the town. You may not even need a car, thus not pay for parking, if you use the San Diego trolley to get around. I definitely make use of the trolley when I can, but it does have limited destinations. During this last visit, my room was $10/night more expensive. Having to pay for parking is an added insult to injury. In my opinion, this hotel is on the verge of becoming overpriced for the accommodation/services received. However, the prices are still reasonable and I will continue to return until rates are raised above what I feel a room is worth.", "Date": "February 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cherry hill, nj", "Title": "\u201cSimply a Good Deal\u201d", "Author": "emilee_leblanc", "ReviewID": "UR6527145", "Content": "We stayed at La Pensione for several nights.

We were there in October during a cool and rainy spell, so AC wasn't an issue for us. With the windows open, the street sounds were invigorating... for the first hour or so. After that, it became just plain noisy until midnight. Our room overlooked several restaurants with sidewalk seating, so there was a buzz of conversation and traffic anytime we were in the room. There was also the roar of jet engines as planes came and went from the airport not far away. It was a little wild to look out the window and see the jets coming in for a landing over the rooftops of Little Italy! With the curtains drawn for privacy from sundown on, our room felt very small and crowded, although it was clean and nicely decorated in a simple European-feeling style. The towels we had one day were surprisingly thin and frayed at the edges, but the replacements the next day seemed a little newer. The mattress seemed extremely hard and the pillows very loosely packed and uncomfortable. There was a night table on one side of the bed but not the other, which was inconvenient. The plumbing was quite noisy. No coffee available in the room, and the nearest java was downstairs in the overpriced cafe that appeared to be popular with neighborhood locals. We did have wireless internet access, which was a bonus. The desk staff appeared to have been schooled in similar urban ennui. Parking under the hotel is limited, with tight spaces.

Located just a few blocks from the I-5 freeway, it is also easily accessible by car to all other areas of San Diego. The rooms are small with only one queen bed and feature a contemporary decor with granite vanity and updated furnishings. The only negative is the lack of air conditioning. The room features a ceiling fan, a desktop fan and two windows for ventilation. On most days this would be sufficient given San Diego's normally perfect year-round weather. Unfortunately, on the first day of our stay, the city was experiencing abnormally high temps and high humidity. In spite of this, we slept comfortably warm on the first night. The second night, the temps had cooled down to being more comfortable. Our room was on the top floor (4th) and I would suggest requesting a room on the 3rd or 4th floors for the best ventilation.

(which is actually located in the room itself, and not in the bathroom.) This time I got a room with a door that opened onto a shared balcony with the room across the hall from me. When I opened the door in the morning, all of the great smells from the cafes below came up and made me want to get something to eat right away. There was still a dog in the lobby, as I saw at my last stay. But, it's either a different dog, or they gave it some obedience training, as it was very calm and it stayed out of the guests way. I also noticed the courtyard that is between the hotel lobby and the cafe. It has a very beautiful \"Tuscany\" feel, and the walls are painted to look like an ancient fresco that has worn away with time. For the price, I would recommend this hotel. Yes, it's small and there's alot of street noise, but it's also clean and affordable. Especially if your attending a convention downtown and all of the hotels are either too expensive or booked up.", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGood with a couple of caveats\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3649077", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at La Pensione during a 6-day stop in San Diego not long ago. Overall, we had a good experience but there are a couple of things that I think are important to share: - Parking was an issue for us. The free garage underneath the building was almost always full (except during the day on weekdays). The parking spots are quite narrow and as a whole the garage is very tight. Our rental car was a fairly big Buick Century and that didn't help much - a compact car would do better here. Street parking so close to Little Italy was tough sometimes - spots are few and far between and are often restricted (limited parking duration during the days, and one day of the week off-limits for street cleaning). We had supper one night at a restaurant and marveled at how it only took 20 seconds to fill an empty spot in front of us. - We are both fairly sound sleepers, so noise wasn't generally an issue for us. We had a north-facing room (417). Noise from planes/trains/trucks was present a lot of the time. The pillows could have been better too. - The shower wasn't comfortable - it varied too much from too hot/too cold. As a whole, the room itself didn't get especially hot. Other than that, what can I say? It is really good value in a relatively expensive tourist destination like San Diego. The room was quite clean and the in-room mini fridge was helpful to us. The dog in the lobby is friendly and the hotel has great access to freeways. La Pensione has a lot going for it, and I would recommend it to people who are looking for a decent budget hotel. ps.

None of the rooms have A/C. That was fine in March, but may be a problem in July & August. All rooms have ceiling fans, which produced a good amount of circulation.

Considering I was to spend very little time inside my room, the cost per night ($ 80.00 with tax) was a steal. Sure, you can stay at the several hotels in the downtown and waterfront areas, but unless your on an unlimited travel budget, why overspend?

The trouble with La Pensione is that it *looks* great, it really does. Decor is great, twinkly fairy lights on the outside at night, really extraordinary mural on the inner courtyard wall... sounds great. Enough to sell it, anyhow. The lack of air conditioning didn't even bother me much, even it was slightly sweltering in July, the ceiling fan noise wasn't so bad. They weren't so efficient, either, though, and the minute you pull back the funky purple curtains to open the window... the noise hits you. Front facing rooms are on a crossroads, across the street is a tacky 'English Pub' with outside tables and lots of noise over weekend nights. There's lots of light right outside the window, its near the rail tracks and airport and there's lots of foot and vehicle traffic that got really bad on the Friday/Saturday nights - not fabulous if you want to crash and get a good nights sleep... What really bugged me was that, booking several months in advance, we didn't realise that each room only has a single queen size bed. (I don't recall seeing it on their website at the time, and it would have been a factor in choosing a hotel - I note that they do make a point of it now on the website.) This wasn't the case at any of the dozens of other places we stayed at, and it really wasn't big enough if you need a twin room. If we had realised, we would have booked 2 rooms and been done with it - of course, that wasn't an option when a convention had just descended on town, so we were stuck for the next 5 days. We weren't the only people caught out by this - there were at least 2 others in the queue ahead of me with the same problem when I went to bug the receptionist about it. What annoyed me more was her attitude - it was quite obvious that she would rather have been getting back to the dinner she was apparently eating behind the desk at the time!! None of the staff were particularly friendly or helpful (except the bellhop who fetched us blankets!) and you generally got the impression they would rather the guests weren't there intruding on their precious hotel. God forbid you should want an apology for anything, cos you're not going to get it! I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been so bad if we'd had another room, or hadn't been stuck there for quite so long. Little Italy is pretty and quaint, but the Gaslamp Quarter and Convention Centre is a good 15 minute walk away and it's probably worth spending a bit more and getting a bit nearer if you're conventioning...
