Very good value at that price. It is near to Museumplein and concertgebouw. The room was lovely, clean, comfy beds, quiet, nice view, warm, nothing could have been better. The breakfast was tasty, but chaotic. They need to have more staff on duty as 2 was not enough to cope. The 2 staff were busy making hot rolls and cooked egg and bacon. This meant they didn't have time to replenish the breakfast buffet area. At one point there was nothing out, no coffee, orange juice, bread or cheese. When an item appeared (by request) it was soon snapped up by hungry breakfasters. The staff also didn't have time to clear tables when people had finished so new people coming down had to sit in the remains of someone else's meal. I felt sorry for the staff, trying to cope.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mons, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cBasic, Central, Perfect for students.\u201d", "Author": "Nicothecalifornian", "ReviewID": "UR124701965", "Content": "We went there with a group of friends.

The guys at the reception were very nice and helpful. We were surprised as how the rooms were very clean and big, nice beds and nice decoration as we only paid +- 30 euros per night. The only negative point would be the breakfast (included), because it's only from 8 to 10, and if you arrive at 9h45, there's nothing left, and also there's not a lot of seats, so you sometimes have to wait for people to finish their breakfast and leave; But overall very nice hotel, central not too expensive, perfect if you're in your 20's, don't care about luxury and go there with friends to have a good time.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cShockingly bad hotel...smelly and costly\u201d", "Author": "Paulb12345", "ReviewID": "UR123999635", "Content": "A terrible smell pervades through the hotel.

The price was really cheap so I wasn't expecting much in fact I was dreading what I was going to find. I was pleasantly suprised, the room was a little on the small side but the main thing was that it was clean. Had a weird small but once we aired the room it was fine. Bathroom was sufficient and clean also had a weird smell. Our friensds room was a lot bigger but faced the front of the building and they said they were a little disturbed from traffic noise and church bells. The room was always warm which was nice when you just got in. Staff were helpful whenever we needed something. Breakfast was included in our room room price and was decent with lots to choose from. Location is ok you are right in the Museumplein but to get to the shops, bars, coffeeshops and food places it was a bit of trek. I would say about 15- 20 mins walk to Leidsplein where its more lively. I would stay here again for the hotel and its price but not for its location.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coggiola, Italia", "Title": "\u201cbasic, good position\u201d", "Author": "elybrera", "ReviewID": "UR121108415", "Content": "The Concert Hotel seems to be a rather old, all of wood, typical, but they should remove the carpet from the stairs from the reception and from the rooms, as soon as you enter you immediately smell the typical unpleasant odor because of too many years of carpeting. Apart from this disadvantage, if you are not too sophisticated, is a great hotel especially for the price / location, the center can easily be reached on foot otherwise just opposite the hotel you can find tram stop (number16). Also very comfortable bus 197 from the airport. Comfortable beds and clean, TV, wi-fi, coffee to tea and coffee, shower gel shampoo etc. ... and hairdryer. when I will return to Amsterdam I will book again this hotel, unless I find an other hotel for the same price, but with the same convenient location with breakfast included.

With my expectations being set really low, I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel has started operations again after 5 years of being closed because of some property dispute. They have just completed the renovations and resumed operations. This means that some things are really new. For instance, the bed, which was very comfortable, appeared to be really brand new, so were the linens. The location of the hotel is spectacular, in a safe and upscale residential area, and within a stone's throw of Museumplein and Concertgebouw. The reception is now in the building itself, and the tall blond gentleman who greeted me was very nice and helpful. Their breakfast room is lovely, and they serve a fantastic breakfast, with smoked salmon, and champaign. You can make your own mimosas. I am not sure if champaign is available on weekdays too, but it was certainly there on the weekend. My room was rather small, and felt even smaller perhaps because the bed was for two people, but the bed was very comfortable. I would have rearranged the furniture to make it more pleasing to the eye, and the bathroom was very small too. This comes from someone who travels in Europe often, and is used to the smaller scale of European hotels rooms, in general.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "fife", "Title": "\u201cHotel is a sham and very rude reception\u201d", "Author": "sweethart241", "ReviewID": "UR105761788", "Content": "hotel was supposed to be re-furbished 8th april so my husband and I booked with another couple for his birthday, upon arrival workmen were everywhere finishing hotel, rooms had no running water so no toilet facilities and there was nowhere to hand clothes not a wardrobe, pole or even a hook for them, no kettle or tea and coffee in room and workmen thought it was okay to just walk into your room without knocking or waiting for you to let them in, paint tins all over the staircases, no lighting in staircases, I went to reception to ask to be moved rooms and the guy on reception was a complete nutter, he was laughing at me saying all british people moan and that if i wasnt happy to leave (after already paying), he was very aggressive and very rude, had to change hotels in the end after threathening him with the police if he didnt change his ways and give us a full refund, he had both myself and my friend in tears and it was supposed to be the first day of our holidays, the museum square hotel next door managed to find us a room in the end and they were excellent far superior to the concert hotel, please don not stay here if you have a choice!!", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "AMS Hotel Concert Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d232319-Reviews-AMS_Hotel_Concert_Inn-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$82 - $244*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">De Lairessestraat 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1071 NR</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232319", "ImgURL": ""}}
