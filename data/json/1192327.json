Again, we have left very happy with our experience although we did wonder at first. On arrival the smell in the room from the bathroom was awful and got worse. Then, after the hot water was not running, we spoke with the front desk, The willingness of the staff to sort our problems cannot be faulted. Within a short period the water problem had been resolved and we had been moved to a new larger room without problem. We couldn't have asked for better service. I would say that if you take the time to read reviews on this site and take them as a broad average then that is pretty much what you get. For us we found the place to be clean, the rooms are large and well equiped and a strong wifi signal exists throughout. The staff, as said, are very helpful and have a good command of English. The lack of tea / coffee in the room was a minor irritant and one that they could easily resolve if desired. The lockers for storing bags on your final day is a nice touch. There is much talk on the site about location. Yes it is near the local funeral home and supporting businesses that surround it. That said, as you are rarely there we did not find this an issue. You are a short walk from the metro / tram stops and 10 min walk from Familia Sagrada and the Citidelia park so that was great. There isnt much around the hotel so you will need to ventrue out in the evening but the place felt safe. We had no experience of the noise some reviews refer to although being a very cold Feb this might be why. The neighbouring Melon Cafe is bob on for breakfast or a quick snack.

Computer access and free WIFI. Location is excellent, we used the marina and bogatel metro lines and the tram. We got 5 day travel cards and you can do as many journey's as you want. Did get a taxi to hotel in first night and that was reasonable. The 'melon' cafe next door was great for our evening cup of tea, a must for us English. I would like to suggest to the hotel they follow the example of all English accomodation and provide a small tray with kettle and coffee tea making facilities on in each room or a hot drink machine in the reception area. Now onto the reason for my title, SADLY our first 4 nights in rm 201 (don't stay in it) we hardly slept. We assumed the first night was a one off for the noisy groups passing the hotel but i had to ring reception at 4am on Saturday as a group had congregated right underneath our very badly fitted windows for 2 hours shouting and talking. Thank goodness for rain Sun and Mon evenings. it was quieter. We live on a busy main road so I am used to traffic noise but not screaming and shouting. Saturday it went on til 7.30am. I would love to recommend this hotel as so much about it was excellent, but 4 nights disturbed sleep (thank god for earplugs) makes it difficult too recommend it. Only way i would jump at another stay is if i could be re-assured of quiet nights. Both of us will definately visit BARCA again as its the most amazing place we have been too but staying at APSIS I am not sure sadly.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat base for city break\u201d", "Author": "lovesunshine85", "ReviewID": "UR119655595", "Content": "Fab hotel in great location, 5 minute walk from metro station and just 3 stops on the red line to Placa de Catalunya.

We are a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids aged 12yrs, 12 yrs and 3yrs) but we also had with my mother with us (6 of us in total). We had booked a family room which could only accommodate the 5 of us if my youngest son stayed in a cot which they provided free of charge. Instead, we ended up declining the cot and one of my older sons slept in my mothers room, however there would have been enough room in the family room to easily accommodate a cot. The family room was brilliant for us because we could put my youngest to bed in the bedroom and not have to turn out all the lights and sit quietly in the dark! The living room had a double sofa bed, (unequipped) kitchenette and a breakfast table. As we only stayed for 2 nights, we only needed a fridge so the fact that there were no utensils in the kitchen didn't matter. The bathroom was very modern and clean. The only problem we had was that there was only 1 TV which was in the bedroom so when my son went to sleep, we couldn't watch anything - again not a big problem for us. Although, there was a definite space in the family room for a TV so perhaps it was being repaired. The free WIFI was excellent and the best WIFI connection that we had during our whole 6 week stay in Europe. The breakfast was great although probably expensive, but with 3 hungry kids to feed each morning, it was an easy option. They provided a couple of cereal choices (cornflakes and museli), cold sliced meats and cheeses, eggs and sausages and toast/bread. The staff were all brilliant and extremely helpful. They all spoke English very well and we had no difficulty communicating with them. The location was OK, but certainly not in the heart of everything. We comfortably walked to the large shopping centre (Glories) and we also walked to the Casino (beachfront) from where we caught the red Hop On, Hop Off bus.

The lighting is well, the bathroom is big and well equiped. The roon tnd public areas are clean. As we keep Kosher, breakfast wasn't a big catch for us. A tip for Kosher keepers and vegetarians: there are fat-free whale grain rolls, just ask which are they. Strangely, they keep the salt and pepper in the drawer, so you'll have to ask for them as well. A very big advantage: the whole hotel is wi-fi area and you use it for free even in your room.

Although the hotel is not centrally located, it is well placed for metro, tram stops and is easy walking distance to the beach, Glories and Sagrada Familia. Other reviewers commented on the smell of the drains. This was not a problem for us. Although we smelt this all over Barcelona, particularly near to the coast, the hotel smelled fragrant, so either they have sorted it out, or maybe it is only a problem after heavy rain?? The room was fantastic. It had a separate bedroom and lounge/kitchen-diner. As we only stayed 3 nights, the kitchen was no use and it was a little odd that there was no kettle, but we did make good use of the sofa and TVs with BBC World and CNN. Although the bedroom had 2 twin beds, these were easy to push together and were very comfortable. The curtains were thick and we had no problems with thin walls or noise, so we slept very well. The rooms have climate control air con which was useful as it got a bit chilly in the evening (October). Unfortunately the beds had no quilts, just some of those blankets to put over the sheets, but these did the job. I found the staff to speak adequate English and they were helpful. I would recommend the breakfasts. There is a good choice and it is replenished frequently; though I would not recommend the scrambled egg (!) The hotel had guests of different nationalities, both for business and leisure; couples, families and individual travellers and it had a nice atmosphere. The hotel has free wi-fi in the rooms and communal areas, though it is quite slow in certain places. There is a sundeck (access from Floor 6). In October, although we were lucky to have lovely sunshine and it was very warm, (by UK standards - about 21 degrees celsius), the low aspect of the sun meant that this only received sunshine for a few hours of the day.... but then we didn't go to Barcelona to get a tan! I only gave the hotel 4/5 for service because I felt that there was a lack of information on the local area for the guests, such as how to get to the nearest metro and nearby bars and restaurants. We had to ask the reception, who were sometimes busy or there were difficulties with communication. On our final day, we had a late flight . The hotel offered to look after our bags so we could make the most of our limited time in the city.

There was a kitchenette, but no utensils or serviceware. However, I was told you could get it from the front desk. The front desk was friendly and quiet helpful. They gave up wake up calls, got us cars when needed and even recommended a great restaurant that was open for dinner on our \"American\" schedule. They also have free internet and computers to use in the lobby. The area is undergoing change. Right in front of the hotel it looks like a building was just knocked down and on the side streets graffiti abounds. However, our tour guide told us that some of the most expensive housing in the city is in this area, so I imagine it's undergoing a regentrification and should be beautiful when done.

The bathroom was like a wet room and a good size. Breakfast was included in the room rate we paid of 200 euros for a family of four for two nights. I've seen some reviews which said it wasn't worth it but it was a good spread with ereals, fruit, bread, ham and cheese along with some hot selections including fantasti little chorizo-style sausages. Secure underground parking is available for 16 euros for 24 hours. The nearest metro is about a five minute walk and then two stops to Las Ramlas. The tram stop is also nearby with restaurants and bars near the Olympic Port about 15 minutes away. And the open topped hop on hop bus stops about 10 minutes away.

Originally we wanted a nice hotel for a decent price. After a lot of searching around for a place in Barcelona that fit our criteria, we came across this one. This hotel looked great from the photos but we were worried it wouldn't live up to its expectations...it did!! After a long trip we were happy to come to a clean, nice smelling hotel with lovely aircon. The hotel staff were very helpful at all hours of the day (and night), and we were surprised with the efficiency of the room service, and politeness of the waiters in the restaurant, who served us at 9.30. There was enough room in the rooms, the bathroom was lovely and everything was modern and worked as it should. The walls were nice and thick as well so we had a lot of privacy. We had access to the wifi whenever we wanted it. Our rooms were cleaned daily - the shower had a habit of flooding the floor, and the cleaners/maids gave us new towels and cleaned up the flood every day. Our beds were made, and our things were untouched, which I appreciated because I do not feel comfortable with people I don't know touching my belongings when I am not there. There could have been more plates, knives and forks, but all this took was a call to reception and this could be fixed. There were no coffees etc in the rooms, which we knew when we booked, but none of us drink coffee anyway so it was not a problem. Reception staff were very helpful, English-speaking, very patient and excellent at recommending places and giving directions. They were able to deal with anything and everything we threw at them (not literally) The doors were closed late at night, but we were able to get in without much of a problem. It was very easy to get to Las Ramblas, a few minutes walk from the hotel and then just two steps on the metro (the metros are amazing and leave very regularly, probably every two minutes, and only take five minutes to get to La Rambla). The upstairs sun-deck was lovely, very relaxing. On the day we left we were able to extend the room without much of a problem, for a small fee.
