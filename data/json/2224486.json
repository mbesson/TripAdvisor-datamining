We stayed for four nights with a bunch of friends celebrating a significant birthday. Reception staff were excellent, rooms were bright and spotless. Bathrooms were very nicely done - great first impressions!! Now for the not so positive side. 1. Water pressure is very poor and trying to have a hot shower is a hit and miss experience - this was probably the worst aspect of our stay - all guests were complaining either about not being able to shower or having cold showers! 2. Walls between the rooms are paper thin - you can hear people having conversations next door very clearly (not to mention all the other noises!!) and every footstep either down the corridor outside or in the room next door is clearly heard in your room 3. Cleaning staff start early and have no idea how to be quiet in the mornings so early mornings are the normal here! 4. Breakfast is adequate but not really anything special In conclusion, great location, rich history in the hotel let down by poor operational aspects.

Positives: - Top location, walkable to every major attraction - Staff very friendly & helpful - Rooms clean, well equipped - Good value for money for the deal we got - Front of house areas well decorated etc - Breakfast, served from 8-1030am is very good - selection of coffees, teas, fruit juices, cereals, white & brown bread, white & brown rolls, jams, cheeses, meats, hard boiled eggs, it was delicious & really set you up for the day, we'd feel hungry mid-afternoon & grab a small snack or share a pizza. Negatives: - The noise. Whether from the corridors. the street or the room next door, it can be very loud. We stayed overlooking the main side street and we we're woken very early each morning by people talking normally, it was like they were in your room. The hotel buzzer/people entering echoed down the corridors and people in the rooms above/next door could easily be heard. - The Bed. Was quite uncomfortable, hard & lumpy. Coupled with the noise, it wasn't always easy to get off to sleep or doze off again in the morning! - The shower. The above 2 points we could cope with, but the shower was quite poor. It needed a while to run hot water water and it only did if the shower thermostat was turned fully to the hottest it could go. This then meant that the water pressure wasn't really there and it dribbled sometimes out of the shower head. If you turned it slightly anti-clockwise for colder water the pressure increased slightly but it was cold water. In effect my girlfriend struggled to wash shampoo from her hair and we just never enjoyed having a shower, after a full day walking or when you're about to sight-see all day, a powerful refreshing shower would've been appreciated! Overall this hotel is so close. We could cope with the bed & noise, but something should be done to help mitigate this. & the shower, whilst disappointing, I'm sure they can continue to improve upon and will get this fixed. Once they have, it will be a very good place to stay. Little tip: The restaurant on the corner, Osteria Pizzeria Agrippa, was superb, went there on our last night & had the best pizza of the holiday by far, one of the best I'd ever had.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff... A work in progress.\u201d", "Author": "travelerRN83", "ReviewID": "UR126070061", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my boyfriend and I for a trip through Italy to start in Rome. Unfortunately, we arrived during the cold period that was going through Europe. Rome was still in stand-still and in fear of the possibility of snow. Most places were shut down, including major monuments. My fiancee never got to know the magic of Rome... In any case, this hotel is in a little back-street of Rome close to the Pantheon. It was a little confusing when we arrived because the entrance door is actually a fake, and you have to walk across the door and take a little elevator for 1 person to the second level. There is not much of a lobby, so do not expect this place to look like a 3 star hotel as in other parts of Europe or US. Past that lobby, the hallways are very nice. We had a room behind the breakfast room which was nice. My only complaint about it was that it seems like the water from the bathroom produced a certain smell in the shower, and we constantly had to light aromatic candles to deal with the smell because it was so strong. The rooms are very simple. I would have to say that the best part of this small hotel was the service. The staff was amazing. The waitresses at the breakfast room are polite, sweet and helpful. The front desk staff is very helpful but I personally have to emphasize how great Emmanuela is. She was just outstanding in her service. Friendly and warm. Even after she had to stay for almost 24 hrs in the hotel due to the snow, she always kept a genuine smile and was extra helpful. She was a little sad not to be able to go out in the snow, but like we told her, it was too messy out there. One thing tha worried me about this place was the sense of lack of security, as anyone can just ring the bell downstairs and come up, and I guess, ask for a room key. I am assuming they memorize the guests' faces as it's a small place. Like I said, this place is a work in progress as fixing and construction was still going on. Would I go back? Maybe. I'm not used to such small hotels, even for Rome, but the service here is what would make me go back again. I hope they keep it up because once this hotel is finished, it will be a little gem of Rome! Oh, and breakfast is very good!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mollydarcey", "ReviewID": "UR124946328", "Content": "Great little hotel only 2 mins from the Panthenon, and a short walk to the Trevi fountain and Piazza Navona. Located on the first floor of an apartment building, in a quiet lane. Rooms were spotless and kept very clean during our week stay, with fresh towels and bedding changed regulary. The bed was comfortable and the room was newly decorated and of a decent size, with Sky Tv, free internet access and a kettle with tea and coffee left daily. The heating was great and the bathroom was newly tiled with very a good shower. Breakfast was fresh and light with a choice of cerials, ham, toast, eggs, chesse, croissants and numerous cups of coffee, served in a small but delightful room, by lovely staff. Reception was very helpful in fact all the staff we met were attentive and kind. On the negative side, the walls are slightly thin and we were kept awake late at night and early morning, on our last 4 days by a baby crying in the room next door ( although we can't really blame the hotel for this, it was just unfortunate) There was also some building work going on in the small street outside (bad timing, so still can't blame the hotel). The big negative for me was the wardrobe space, The wardrobe was very very small and there were no set of draws, apart from the tiny ones (which we could not close) next to our beds. A weekend is ok but for a couple staying, but for more than 2 nights, there is no where to put your clothes, we had to leave ours in our suitcase, this could easily be resolved with larger wardrobe and clothes space. Also the room would benefit from some coat hooks on the doors, as there is nowhere to hang damp coats after a day out in the rain. These are small problems that could be easily sorted, and apart from this, the stay in this hotel was great and we would definatley use this hotel again.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLovely Central Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Conor O", "ReviewID": "UR123636477", "Content": "Very nice location in the heart of Rome, everything you can think of within walking distance.

The rooms are are closed in between other building which is what you get if you want to stay in old Rome. If you are looking for a great view and lots of daylight in your room then this is not the place for you. The staff is very friendly but some of them are not knowledgeable about restaurants and such. They did arranged very reliable and reasonably priced private car service for us 3 times. There is a good breakfast that is included and the breakfast staff were absolutely wonderful. It is a great location if you want to be close of all the touristy stuff in Rome. Since it is a small hotel you cannot check in early unless your room happens to be unoccupied the night before.

They gave us as many maps as we needed and always seemed happy to see the boys no matter how loud they were. The lady that tended the breakfast room always had a table ready with a high chair by the time we made it down the hall. She probably heard us coming.

A couple of minutes in the other direction and you have the tram stops of Largo di torre Argentina which will take you to Trastevere and beyond - assuming you've had your fill of the wonderful ruins where Ceaser was stabbed! Santa Maria sopra Minerva is practically right outside your door. If you're feeling a little more energetic 15 minutes stroll (and I do mean stroll - I'm no fan of fast walking in the Roman Summer heat!) from your room finds you at the Trevi Fountain or, in the opposite direction, Piazza Navona. And a little more walking will find you at the Spanish Steps or St Peter's. You could walk to the Colosseum from here (my friends did), but I chose to take the air-conditioned tram and bus from Argentina. The hotel has no restaurant, but there are an abundance of good local eateries and cafes, particularly around the Pantheon itself. Or you could visit Trastevere (walk or a couple of tram stops) where there additional places. All the local places seemed to speak English well and were gracious enough to understand my limited Italian. The rooms are very generous in size, particularly for a European city centre hotel located in an old building, with high ceilings adding to the spacious feel. The furnishing is stylish but not intrusive. The rooms are clean and the air conditioning good. My room was on the street side and I overlooked a shrine embedded into the walls of what was the dome of the Baths of Agrippa. Although a very quiet side street, I'm a light sleeper and if I had the window open at night, the noise of the occasional reveller wending their way home tended to wake me up. But as the air conditioning was quiet, I could just close the window, put the air conditioning on and all was well. If you're after a relaxing place to stay, within easy reach of a large number of tourist attractions, where you can find places to eat and drink without too much effort, then Le Clarisse al Pantheon is perfect.

The other minor negatives were all small details about the room like no pen or paper or no soap dish in the shower. We were too late in trying to get a reservation at Al Duello, but the front desk staff recommended another restaurant that was excellent (I am always a little skeptical of restaurant recommendations). There is also a restaurant approx. 1 minute to the West called Ristorante Vecchia Locanda that is very good (the only negative review on tripadvisor is someone complaining about smoking in the outdoor seating).
