{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice SPA in Beijing Excellent SPA in south Beijing. About 50 different pools with minerals both indoors and outdoors. Specialty is pool with baby pirayas eating minerals from your skin and giving nice experience.Massage also available with reasonable price, 1 hour about 15 euros. Spa pools open until 2am, same time upstairs provides snooker and other activities, karaoke etc. Finnish sauna in Spa department, nice service and nice decoration. Rooms a bit pricey but nice. Beds are excellent, bathrooms brilliant. TV in room and have English movie and news channels.Food is good and you can choose what you want to eat and how much you want to eat. Drinks - even beer - included.How to get there? Hmmm... no idea. No public transportation nearby, maybe taxi is only way. But it is about 1-1,5hour from Beijing city center - depends about traffic jams. Located somewhere near 6th ring road in south-west Beijing.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR719737812", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PeterBeijing"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d598408-r7153674-Longxi_Hotspring_Resort-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "598408", "Price": "$175"}}
