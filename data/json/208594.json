This was the cheapest hotel I could find that will accomodate four that is relatively near Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. We paid about E170 per night which is still quite steep for what you get, but I presume prices are usually higher for hotels in the summer anyway due to influx of visitors. Let me start with the Positives: The hotel's location is great. As I mentioned, it is near Placa Catalunya, which is the heart of the city. Maybe a five to ten minute walk. It's also ten minutes to La Rambla, and I'm glad I didn't pick a hotel there as it's more expensive and La Rambla is quite unpleasant in my own opinion. It's also quite near the Catedral and Barri Gotic. There are also lots of food options in the area, plenty cheap otions for those who are budget-conscious. The metro is also a minute walk from the hotel, which though we only used once, I would presume will be helpful for others. I felt safe in the area, though somebody warned us that it is pickpocket central especially in La Rambla and Placa Catalunya. (No issues though for us). The people manning the front desk are generally nice and helpful. They all speak great english so communicating with them is not a problem. The man on our last day though did not speak english but was still helpful. Since we were leaving early for the airport and breakfast starts at 8, he gave us several croissants to go, which I felt was a nice touch by the hotel. For a 1 star hotel, the amenities in the rooms are great. There's an electronic safe in the room, a big flat screen TV that at least has CNN, airconditioning in the room, free fast WIFI, and private bathrooms. There is also an elevator in the hotel. Breakfast is also provided though it's only continental breakfast but enough to get you by in the morning. Now for the negatives: on our first night, the airconditioning was not working too well. Rooms got very stuffy so we had to open the window. We complained about this but I think they just thought we didn't know how to operate the AC. We were staying just one night at that time anyway so didn't make a fuss. They placed us on a different room when we came back from the cruise and thankfully the AC Is working perfectly. Though this room was in a worse shape than our previous room. There were black spots and molds in the shower ceiling which really looked gross. Also, the sheets were also not very clean. Considering that the rooms were just renovated last year, they didn't look very new to me. Also, the elevator is creaky, which freaked us out the first time, but we soon got used to it. There was also once that the elevator doors won't close! We got out, tried it again, and thankfully it didn't malfunction. We still used it for the duration of the trip, but I used the stairs when I didn't have any company as I was afraid, God forbid, I get stuck alone. Overall the hotel is just okay. I would stay there again if I was on a budget and staying in Barcelona for only a few days as the pros overcome the cons. Is it good value for money? Hmm not too sure about that as we still paid quite a lot considering it is a one star hotel.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGot a single bedroom for the price of a Double, unacceptable!!!\u201d", "Author": "Edgar075_11", "ReviewID": "UR113736648", "Content": "I just want to advice people who want to stay in this hotel to be careful regarding the room they get.

We arrived quite late, but check-in was prompt and we were very happy with our room. The decor of the room is extremely modern and funky, and it was kept clean throughout our 5 night stay. There is a flat-screen on the wall: note there is not one English channel: not a problem for us as it was quite fun trying to work out the news in Spanish). A small balcony looks out onto the main street which can be loud in the night if you are a light sleeper, but with so much to do in Barcelona, we were extremely tired out by the time we had our dinner. A fridge is also provided which we filled with snacks from the supermarket 2 minutes away (told to us by the friendly receptionist). Breakfast was lovely; taken in the restaurant next door, with a selection of juice, cereal, pastries, sandwiches, coffees and tea. It is not buffet but enough to keep you going until it is time for a mid-morning snack or lunchtime. The staff on the reception were brilliant; they were always extremely friendly and kind and willing to go the extra mile to help us understand the Barcelona transport system! Note: This is one of those hotels where you leave your key at the front desk, and the doors have to be opened and closed by the receptionist, therefore making you feel very safe. There is also a computer on the first floor with free internet, and given the size of the hotel, we were able to quickly check our emails everyday. The area itself was spot-on, right in the centre of Barcelona, with a metro stop practically on the doorstep, and placa catalunya a mere few blocks away. Once you get to grips with the metro system, it is very easy to use and a useful tip is to buy a one day travelcard (called T-Dia on the ticket machines) which will get you anywhere you want to go regarding attractions such as Nou Camp or Sagrada Familia.

Urquinoana roundel/square is at the edge of the medival city & close to the shopping districts of the new city, a 5min walk to the top of Las Ramblas. The area felt safe at night as does a lot of the city. Places to eat are too numerous to mention & the restaurant downstairs is certainly not one star with a good menu & cellar. There is a metro stop literally outside the door which makes sight seeing on a short break much easier. I would recommend taking a metro on the out trip, then working your way back on foot, though the city is so compact it's not needed other than as a time saving device. The old city , Park Guiel & The Sagrada Familia in all it's unfinished glory are must sees, after that it's whatever you like. Night life is everywhere but we found Las Ramblas a little overpriced & a bit seedy at night. We were glad we didn't book a hotel there, ok to visit but nice to leave. Ironically we found the most popular place for the locals was an Irish bar across the roundel/square from the hotel. Can't remember it's name. Smoking in the bar, non smoking in the big back lounge. The bar seemed to be popular with young Americans. The lounge bar had live music sometimes followed by a DJ. Lively later on! Overall this hotel is fine for a few nights for people who are there to explore the city & not the staying in types.

We had to catch a flight for Madrid, and needed to check out at 4:00 a.m in order to do so.

So, I was quite surprised and taken aback when I went to check out with my credit card and the new front desk clerk (who was not who arranged the cab for us) and who looked quite shady, demanded that I pay in cash because he didn't know how to work the credit card machine. He wanted me to go around and get hundreds of dollars out of an ATM in the dark. More than even my bank will let me take out! I was livid to say the least. I explained that I reserved with my credit card, and they could charge it later if they couldn't get it to work at the time. I was not handing over cash to this guy. He kept arguing with me, and wouldn't let me talk to a manager. It felt like a scam. Luckily the cab driver was able to help the guy work the machine, but it was while the meter was running, so we ended up paying more for a taxi, and almost missed our flight.

And until my stay at Hotel Urquinaona, I had never been disappointed with a bargain hotel. Let's start with the pros. The hotel is about five steps from the metro station and you can easily walk to different parts of the city; the water was hot when all three of us took turns showering. Now the cons...the room was by far the tinyest room i have ever stayed at. Literally the three of us had to put our suitcase on our beds in order to be able to open them. Secondly we had a window that faced another building about a foot away, i felt like i was in a cell. The bathroom had no sink space and the tub had mold all over it. We saw some spiders and our last day there we woke up to someone screaming, we still have no idea what that was all about. And at this point i was still \"ok\" with the room. The tipping point was what the staff demanded when we left. Let me preface this by stating that the night before we asked to have a taxi requested at 4:00a.m. The staff said it would be no problem and when we booked the hotel we were told we could pay with credit card. Well imagine our surprise when at 3:30 a.m. the staff member states he doesn't know how to work the credit card machine and that we need to walk to an atm and retrieve 450 dollars. The three of us are all young and in our twenties, the last thing we were going to do was walk five blocks in the pitch dark and get that amount of cash. We insisted to speak with a manager since they already had our card number and were still demanding that we go to the atm. The staff member refused to call the manager at home. The cab driver came in and thankfully helped explain that it would be unsafe to walk to the atm and that we could not be expected to have that kind of cash. Luckily the cab driver taught the man how to use the machine, but we ended up having to pay the cab driver for his time anyway because the meter was running.

Our room was on the 3rd floor, not big, but fine for us. The bathroom was clean, tub, shower, mini-wall hair dryer, etc. And, of course, the big bonus, a bottle of Cava awaited us in the mini-fridge! We drank it on the porch later that night. The only little gripe I had was the bars are open there until 5AM and those kids paarrrttyyy. We like to have a good time, too, but we are in our early '30's and it was just a bit too much. Honestly, we wish we would've gone to Seville or some smaller city in Spain where we could've really enjoyed the food & culture. Barcelona was a very international city, with different languages flying everywhere and it's a very 20-something party town (and $$$). But we still had a good time and this hotel rocked our needs and our budget. The next door cafe was perfect for our (free!) morning breakfast. One last note, don't eat on Las Ramblas!!

I'd searched the web and using Trip Advisor had seen lots of good reviews for this hotel -- and I agree with other reviewers on the very good points of this hotel. The Hotel Urquinaona offered just what we wanted for a 3 night stay... we were out all day and just dropped into bed each night after tapas and tapas and sightseeing. There was a free wifi connection in the room and a free interenet computer just outside our door as well, plus a free bottle of red wine in the fridge. I've rarely seen a bottle of wine offered in 4 or 5 star hotels and often the more stars a hotel has the more it costs for Internet. Kudos to Hotel Urquinaona for a wonderful stay. Don't be put off by the 'just' one star listing for this hotel. Hotels in Barcelona are pricey and parking even more so. We drove down from Paris so the car needed to be in a parking lot... well, there was a public car park 50 meters from the hotel that cost nearly as much as our room for our stay. This hotel does not have its own parking, but it is a minor point. The hotel staff - on duty 24/24 were very helpful and mutlilingual and the cafe just next door was perfect for breakfast or an afternoon drink though this street side cafe was a bit noisy perhaps, or just a nice city sound. It'll depend on your mood. This is a modest hotel in a big city at a fair price.

I strongly advise using Trip Advisor rather than looking at Expedia Recommends etc before booking anywhere to stay. Firstly, we were just looking for a budget type hotel. Nothing too tatty, and that we (my girlfriend and I) felt safe in. That is definately what you get with this hotel. Upon arriving in Barcelona and braving the train to the city centre and juggling the underground we appeared from the subway and felt a bit lost as the signage sometimes isn't obvious. Didn't have to go far - as, no word of a lie, the hotel was about 30 foot from the underground. Excellent transport links. Easy check-in. The guy on the desk was very friendly. However, at this stage I was still worried as to whether or not NY was a fluke and this was going to be a dump of a hotel. I was pleasntly surprised! Upon taking a rough ride in the small lift (it makes a few noises - but can carry lots - so don't worry) we found our room. We had air con, a hair dryer and plenty of space in the room. Our own bathroom. (It was a bit small with the beeday (can't spell) in there) but you can manage well enough. We even had a great free bottle of Cava in the fridge which we thorougily enjoyed. The room was clean and made every day. It included plenty of storage and a safe within the room. I really felt as though I could leave my valuables. Nobody is just going to walk into the hotel - as the door is controlled manually. ( You may have to knock on arrival!) The hotel is on a sometimes busy road - but I found it pretty easy to sleep... Especially after opening the door and nipping out onto the small balcony for an ice cold beer! ;-) Breakfast was served in the restaurant next door - not much, but enough to keep you going. If you are a greedy man like me, you will probably want something else abour 11am. The hotel is ideally located to the underground and a few minutes walk to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. We used the transfer from Placa Catalunya to get to the airport. Cheap - and not far to get there. In all, I would recommend this to couples who aren't too fussed about comfort and want somewhere to feel safe and crash at night. Saying that though - the hotel and room were very clean.
