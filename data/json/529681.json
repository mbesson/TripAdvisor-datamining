{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location, nice B+B I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, it is on the 2nd floor ( no lift ) of a 17th Century palace and had frescoed ceilings and dark wood floors. It was easy to find from the S. M Novella station, about 5mins walk, in the San Lorenzo area. The church and Medici Chapel are literally on the doorstep, and only 10mins walk to the Duomo, the location was perfect for us.It is run by a mddle age couple, who were ok, not very forthcoming but pleasant enough. They did not speak much English but I speak a little Italian so we muddled through.The room was a triple room and was quite spacious and spotlessly clean. my favourite was the bathroom it was small but perfect and like new, the shower was a cubicle, unusual for Italy, previouly we have had a wetroom, and a curtain if we were lucky. there was a safe in the wardrobe which cost 10 euros.The breakfast were not much to talk about, just a roll and jam, juice and coffee, and on one morning there was yoghurt. There was a terrace off the breakfast room but no view, only backs of apartments, but I like to see that, an insight of Italian life, with washing on the lines and people shouting over to each other. The door is locked at midnight, but you can still buzz in, we were a little late one night, but they were not best pleased. The other poster that mentioned you had to leave the keys in , its true but that is usual practice in Italy, we have always had to do that, and they always keep your passport the 1st night, by law.The area has plenty of nice shops and restaurants, San Lorenzo market is on the doorstep, also an internet cafe next door. Ciro  sons restaurant opposite was nice but expensive, we were charged 11 euros service charge. Regginellas ( opposite the Medici Chapel ) lower down was fabulous, good food and friendly atmosphere, the waiters are a hoot. The bar opposite Ciro's was great, we got free nibbles and panini with our drinks.Overall, We could not wish for a better location and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "Jul 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR960444708", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jessybobs"}, {"Content": "Hotel Giotto - Great location but.... My wife and I stayed here when we first arrived in Florence. The hotel is located on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old building. We stayed for one night before moving to another hotel across the street (Residenza Castiglioni). We were not very happy with the place. We had 2 heavy bags and was surprrised they didn't have an elevator. This hotel also requires that we deposit our passports with them at night and do not allow us to keep the door keys when we're out. Worst of all they asked us to be back early at night. The main door is also closed rather early and you would have to ring the door bell to get them to open it for you. No CNN or BBC, only local Italian channels in the room. It also cost more than Residenza Castiglioni, which we moved to and stayed for 4 nights. No problems there.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR661436572", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ivanxx"}, {"Content": "Hotel Giotto This is a nice hotel however please note that the air conditioning does not come on after 10.30 at night which is exactly the time you want it on when trying to sleep.. anytime we did go back to our room to drop things off i only ever felt the air conditioning on once. Location is very central. Also when we asked about the sun terrace we were told that there was none or else we were not allowed to use it..", "Date": "Sep 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR983747952", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "irish_tourist2"}, {"Content": "Great Terrace to relax       What a view", "Date": "Mar 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR422522404", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Excellent accomodation  Spent 2 nights at this accomodation  would definately return.
