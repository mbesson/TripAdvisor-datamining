{"Reviews": [{"Content": "served it purpose... My wife and I were part of a sightseeing tour that stayed at the Jiangxi Grand in Beijing for 4 nights. There weren't any serious complaints, but very few compliments either. The room was a very good size. The king bed was extremely hard. I strangely enjoyed the bed, but my wife did not. The floor was stained and looked dirty so I felt compelled to wear the complimentary slippers at all times. The glass-enclosed shower had no water pressure, fortunately the shower in the tub was just fine. A softer bed, clean carpet and a clean shower with water pressure would have made this place great.My wife was also disappointed that the gym didn't open until 7 am, but that's another story...", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR988640160", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Roman_Tacomans"}, {"Content": "filthy hotel rooms with good breakfast buffet We just came back from a china tour and jiangxi hotel in beijing was our first stop. Honestly we didn't know what to expect until we went to xi'an, guilin, suzhou and shanghai. In comparison, Jiangxi hotel in beijing was the worst hotel we stayed at in china. The hotel room was filthy. Muddy carpet and filthy wallpaper. The shampoos and bathfoams in the bathroom were used -- probably leftovers from the previous guests. The towels were like dish rags. The TV has 2 chanels, only in Chinese. The location is remote so you have to take a cab for 30min to get anywhere downtown. We walked around the hotel which is a in very poor and rundown neighborhood. We enjoyed seeing the authentic day to day real life of the people, but if we didn't know better, the neighborhood looked like a ghetto. The good thing about the hotel is its buffet breakfast, they have different chinese and western selections every morning which is quite uncommon and nice if you end up staying there for more than a few days. I would not stay in this hotel again if I were to travel to china on my own.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR875157699", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "TravelerFrmPA"}, {"Content": "Nice rooms with good showers We stayed (group tour) at Jiangxi Grand Hotel during Chinese New Year. There was not much to see from your rooms except fireworks going off from different buildings near us. There was a convenience store just outside the hotel. The hotel seemed relatively new and modern. The breakfast buffet had a good selection of asian and western dishes. The TV channels were all in Chinese (mandarin) except maybe one news channel (no HBO). What I remember the most was the bathrooms were well appointed with nice bathtub and showers. The rooms were clean and new looking.", "Date": "Feb 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR823391344", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "adfasdfjkl"}, {"Content": "Decent Hotel - middle of nowhere For a group tour hotel this was very nice. The tub was deep and wonderful for a soak after a busy day walking the sights in Beijing. My TV never worked, and they never cared to fix it. The breakfast is pretty good if you have the 2 guys make you an omelet - they use real eggs. Rooms were large, clean and had nice furniture since the hotel was new. There is really nothing in the area but if you have someone driving you it is not a problem - while the local area is definitely 'local' in character the hotel itself is safe and many many tour groups stay here.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR300970605", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ctcomanchepilot"}, {"Content": "Very nice, new hotel in Beijing Jiangxi Grand Hotel (in the Fengtai district in Beijing, China) is a new business hotel. I was booked into by a China Focus group tour. There were very few people at the hotel and it had just opened, The rooms were very nice--very firm beds (like most hotels in China)--baths included a seperate tub and shower--many amenities--free internet--turndown service with slippers and robe--in room safe big enough for a laptop (but not bolted to the floor). Location wasn't very good, but with a package tour there really wasn't any free time in Beijing, so the location didn't matter. Breakfast was from 3 set menus (a buffet may be available once occupancy goes up). Many staff--usually at least one with okay English. Would exchange US cash but not traveler's checks.
