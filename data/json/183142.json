In terms of service (nice, knowledgable staff, fast check-in, great services for park n fly guests), comfort (the best bed/pillows ANYWHERE), and convenience (covered parking in Canada is a must if you travel in winter), I have not found another hotel on the Toronto ariport strip that offers any of the above.

Upon arriving, we parked our car first in the very user-unfriendly garage. The signage was pitiful - with no signage indicating dead ends ahead and no arrows telling you that you should go left to park when you first enter the gates. We parked on the first level near a sign where it indicating that you could get to the lobby. Check-in was smooth, easy. The front desk person was knowledgeable and courteous enough. The front lobby does have a flat screen tv showing all the departure stastii from Pearson airport nearby, which is the best thing about it. There was also the fruit dipped water jugs for guests that was a nice touch. But other than that, it really was an unremarkable entranceway. Our room was a decent size, but it seems that they are currently undergoing renovations. There was a plastic covering on the entire length of the hallway carpet to our room and beyond. This didn't seem so bad, until we were in our own room and could hear the crack, snapple, pop of all pedestrians in the hallway at all hours of the night and early morning. Honestly, it sounded like there were a bunch of kids popping bubble wrap out there! The biggest gripe about this so-called four star hotel, was that there was no in-room safe. Really Marriott? If I wanted to stay in a hotel room and keep all my valuables lying about for intruders or (and this has never happened to me -knock on wood) the cleaning staff to steal, then I would have chosen a hostel. And plastic soap dish and amenity stand? Really? Plastic? And you had to find the ugliest shade of poop-on-me-brown for these unhigh-class bathroom decorations? The door peephole is too high. Anyone under 5'4\" tall or about 160 cm will not be able to verify their knocker's identity before opening their door. So if you plan to stay here, bring your own stool for the sake of the peephole, or just don't ever answer the door or order room service. The other big PEEVE is that damn shower head!!! That has to be the weakest pressure ever on any hotel shower head that I have used. I seriously had to sit under it for longer than 10 minutes to get all the shampoo and conditioning agent out of my hair. It is impossible to take a quick shower in there. At the end of the day, I got the room on a good web special price, so for the price it was just barely satisfactory. But if I had to pay the rack rate for this hotel, expecting four star quality, I would have been furious. Next time, I'll try one of the newer three star properties in the area that offer an in-room safe, free parking, and wifi. Oh BTW, no wifi access in the room, not even a paid option, just a wired paid option. Only free wifi is in the lobby - and it won't let you go to a competitor's website. Now I want to further deduct another star....", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cConfortable bed and nice room\u201d", "Author": "OnlyMe48", "ReviewID": "UR117494635", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights for a business meetings.The beds were confortable and the place was nice and cleaned.

Upon arriving at the hotel we were very impressed with the look and feel, the lobby was beautiful and the front desk looked great. When arriving at the check-inn counter, admittably I was wearing shorts and a tshirt and didn't look like I belonged in a 4 star hotel. (clothing asside, I'm a business professional). The girl at the front desk was very dismissive and simply gave me my room key without telling us what type of room we were in, what floor we were on, checkout time, parking or anything. We had to ask where the elevators were, and we were still given a 'just over there', (they are down the hall around the corner actually). Once we found the elevators finding the room was very painless, although I was quite upset with being treated like I didn't belong, if the hotel didn't want the rooms to be discounted, they shouldn't be listing them on priceline. The room was absolutely stunning and worth every dollar, it was very clean and the furniture and TV was all modernized. Our room even came with VGA and hdmi hookups so you can hook your laptop up to your TV. They even simplied the cable in the room for free! We visited the basement to checkout the pool as well, didn't get a chance to use it, however it looked amazing and so did the jaccuzi. My dissatisfaction with this hotel is purely based on the customer service. Even when checking out, I requested the site to leave feedback for the hotel, and was given a card which I was told contained an email but had nothing but an address and phone number on it. She then asked \"did you have any problems with your stay?\" which I replied a yes to, and then she thanked me for staying at the Marriot.

The room was comfortable and clean. The fitness center and pool were adequate. My wife used the fitness center while the kids and I enjoyed the pool for four nights. The hotel staff (from front desk to maid service) was very pleasant. Our first night, the front desk person offered my sick kid some soup. We politely declined, but that was very thoughtful of them. My kid got better on the 2nd night. With that said, a few things you should know about the hotel and the surrounding area. 1. No free WI-FI in room (this should be standard in all hotels nowaday). Even Red Roof Inn has free WI-FI in the room. Free WI-FI is available in the lobby. Grab a cold orange flavored water next to the front desk while you're there. 2. Hotel parking (outdoor or underground) is $18 per night. Steep. I think one of the hotels down the street is only $15. So for four nights, it's like paying another night at the hotel. 3. There are Hooters, sports bars/restaurants, and Strip clubs down the street. The nearest drug store is about 3 miles away. 4. The name of the hotel gives you an idea. It's next to the airport. So you will occassionally hear the midnight flight taking off. 5. The pool and fitness entrance is a little confusing on the initial visit. The entrance is not as obvious as you think. I watched myself and others have done the same thing. Listen to the click sound on your left. Don't grab the door in front of you. That's an exit. For the value I thought it was about right.

We're not used to sleeping in such a small bed, but it was comfortable. The room is well equipped; nicely furnished and has an ample bathroom. The main areas of the hotel are well appointed as well. Staff are very effecient and friendly. The pool and fitness are are very nice. The hot tub was a bit TOO hot, and I pointed this out to a maintenance man who passed by. He immediately took exception to my comment even though he hadn't even confirmed the temperature of the tub. Other guests were there and all agreed the tub was extremely hot. It might have been comforting to know that he took our concerns seriously and checked the actual temperature of the tub instead of assuming it was exactly 104f as he said it was. I have been in hot tubs, and this tub was WAY hotter than 104f! Anyway, it was clean and the fitness room was very well appointed. No complaints there. I'm not sure if the pool was heated or not, but it was 35c that day, and it felt wonderful. Other guests said it was too cool. I enjoyed the cool water after being in that blistering heat outside. The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the airport, which is handy if you are flying in or out. The dining room is nice; prices are typical of a hotel; $15 for breakfast. VERY few other options in the area, but Casey's in the Travel Lodge across the street is opened for breakfast at about $10 instead of $15. Not much savings. No other options anywhere close by, so if you are a breakfast eater, prepare to pay over $20 for a meal with juice and/or coffee. Parking: They actually charge $18 a day for parking at this property, which is kind of ridiculous. Park and Fly is right across the street, so perhaps they're trying to dissuade non-guests from parking? It's a kick in the pants after paying for the room.... All in all, a nice stay.

The female clerk was curt and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to apologize or explain why there was no bell available.

Back to the room, Parked the car, went to our room which turned out to be better than we could have expected. Very clean. Roomy with two nice beds and some nice pillows. Bathroom was clean and roomy with the sink outside of the shower room. And I HAPPY to report that the room was very quiet!!! I only have two complaints with this hotel, the internet cost $14.95 a day. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little over priced. But my biggest complaint would be having to pay $18.95 to park my car for one night, That is over priced to have to park a car. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if the hotel is around the Toronto airport. It is not at the airport. I only stayed for one night, so paying to park was ok, but if I had to stay for more than one night I think I would have to try to get a deal on the parking. Overall the hotel was very nice and I will stay there again.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maplewood, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Clean Rooms, Crappy Internet\u201d", "Author": "victorylow", "ReviewID": "UR65052534", "Content": "Stayed overnight at the Toronto Airport Marriott Hotel for business.

Since the rennovation of the rooms and common areas, the quality of the hotel has improved. It is a very comfortable property and a great place to stay prior to an early morning flight out of Toronto's Pearson Airport. The room had one queen sized bed and a three seat couch that was placed in an odd looking location directly in front of the window. The couch looked out of place, but was functional. The separate sink area from the toilet and shower is a good idea. Bath and Body Works shower and soap were a nice touch. The room was comfortable, although the standard hotel hall noise: loud guests and the seemingly required constant slamming of room doors was present for most of the stay. However, I did get a good night sleep with my ever present ear plugs. Wake up call came as promised. The wake up call system is fully automated and easier to figure out than the alarm clock. Email and Internet access is not free from the room, but it is available free of charge in the lobby. The airport shuttle comes at regular intervals both from the hotel and the airport. It is not necessary to call or pre-arrange. The shuttle is shared with the Courtyard Marriott, which is next door and the Sheraton which is just down the street. The Marriott is the second stop on both the pick up and drop off. This makes getting to the hotel or airport about a 10 minute trip. Allow for 15 minutes to Terminal 1 as it is the second stop on the trip. There is a restaurant on site as well as a small gift shop which has basically everything that one would need. Free newspapers are available in the lobby. USA Today is delivered to the room each morning. The Keg, a local steakhouse chain is a good food option. It is across the street beside (behind) the Travel Lodge hotel. A short 3 minute walk WEST on Dixon Road. To get downtown, the Malton 58 bus on Dixon Road goes directly to the Lawrence West subway station, although this is a slow 45 minute option. It would be faster to take the hotel shuttle to the airport, then board the Airport Rocket route 192 that goes directly to the Kipling Subway station on the highway. The entire trip takes about 15 minutes and costs the same: $3. Another option is to take the GO bus, same bus stop as the Malton 58, but you have to flag the bus. Is a large coach style bus that is white with a green stripe down the side. The sign on front says \"York Mills Terminal\" It stops at the Yorkdale subway stop as well as the York Mills Subway stop (different lines). I'm not sure of the cost, but it would be less than $5; however the frequency is every hour. It would pass by the hotel (Dixon Road & Carlingview Drive) at about 15 minutes past each hour.

Called front desk and they gave me another room as ordered but made it very clear they were not happy with my complaining and kept me hanging on the phone for 20 minutes before 'finding' the right room as booked. They even suggested they'd put in a roll-away cot if I wanted an extra bed but I don't know where they'd put it as there was simply no room. The hotel was very busy for a Saturday and they only had two people on check in, so we had to wait twice ... once for checking in to the wrong room and again for finding the right room. The right room was larger, but not by much. The self parking is a zoo -- 4 floor of it but only 2 floors with elevator service so be prepared to carry your bags up/down stairs as a lot of the cars are there for 8 nights due to one of their other 'deals' where you get 8 nights parking if you stay there one night...great if you are flying away for a week from the nearby Pearson airport. Not so great if you self park. Room decor: Old Marriott. Except for the (quite hard) Revive bed the rest of the room was tired - even a little 25 inch CRT TV. No Mini-Bar or fridge. Carpet real old (green). A/C blew all night no matter how high we made the temp. Room cleanliness left a lot to be desired - there were corks and papers under the bed and sofabed that the maid never even looked for.

Every January and August the gift show takes place and many of the airport strip hotels are full of exhibitors and attendees. The Congress Centre and the International Centre are very close. So if you are wondering who stays in this hotel besides those not wishing to have a long drive before they catch that early flight to the Carribean in the morning, you will find a lot of business travellers. Having said that, the Marriott is a very comeptent hotel. They have just gone through a renovation - for those of you who have visited this hotel in the past, the Mikado restaurant is gone, the bar/club is gone. There is now a bar next to the restaurant which style-wise I think is nicer - that old billiard bar always seemed out of place. However, they need to adjust the lighting for the outer part of that bar, it is way too bright for a bar. The part closer to the restaurant is more pleasant. The service in the restaurant is very warm and helpful - their staff seems to stay there for years and years, there seems to be a big loyalty factor. They remember my name even though I have not been there for six months (and I have not left on my name tag from the show!) The food is very good, and the restaurant has a nice ambience with a view to the back lawn and wooded area which is pleasant (seeing that it is an airport hotel). They have a vegetarian ravioli dish which I could not get enough of, I could have had it every time I ate there. The rooms are nice and the bedding is fantastic - nice puffy duvets and pillows. I love it. Cannot say anything bad about the rooms. And I didn't hear noise even though it is close to the airport. The hotel is located very close to the airport, but don't take a taxi, it costs almost $20 which is ridiculous. Take the shuttle. It depends on which terminal you are in for which post wait next to, but ask someone as you follow the signs for shuttle buses, OR call the hotel and they will tell you. I have never had to wait that long and I go there often. It is a pleasant ride and they stop at the Marriott first, it is not a milk run like some of the other shuttles. They have a business centre which is handy, you can go on the internet, etc. and print (for a price). What kills me when I stay here in the summer is the lack of an outdoor pool. If you stay at the Holiday Inn Select across the road they have a fabulous outdoor pool (and indoor as well). The Marriott only has an indoor pool. And if you sit outside in the back, try getting served a drink. In this area the Select has it all over the Marriott. However we don't want to switch back and forth between the Marriott and the Select, it gets confusing for our group, so we stick with the Marriott. Also the Marriott has a good points program, make sure you sign up. One final note: they can handle themselves in a crisis - a number of years ago there was a blackout in Toronto. It affected a large area of the city, hotels included.

Unfortunately, if you are without your own wheels there are only 2 restaurants and a coffee shop within walking distance, although the hotel does have a couple (overpriced as usual) restaurants of it's own. The hotel is middle aged, but nice looking with well kept grounds and ample parking which will cost you an extra 12$ per night. It is easy to find and sits right on the main drag by the airport with a wide lane for dropoff. You can park right in front while checking in and getting your room setup. Lobby and Check-in: The lobby area is expansive with luxurious sitting areas, a bar, restaurants and class typical of Marriott and other 3-4 star hotels. Check-in was speedy and staff are friendly and efficient. I also got this hotel for 36$ through Priceline (3 separate times) and service was not diminished by this. Rooms: Rooms are clean and quiet but otherwise unremarkable. The room comes complete with TV, phone/internet hookup (12.95 for highspeed but I didn't use so can't report on this) desk and chair, coffee maker, minibar, lounge chair and closet. Like I said, your typical 3-4 star but nothing extra special. The TV was sufficiently large and modern and offered a large selection of cable (40 channels) and movies on demand. The chairs and desk were comfortable and acceptable for minimal use, but I wouldn't want to attempt an all-nighter as it is a tad small and the chair wasn't quite high enough. The bed was OK - I'd give it a 7/10 rating on comfort and the comforter was nice and thick although I would have liked the pillows to be a bit thicker. I would also say the hotel has done an excellent job of soundproofing and while hall noise is at times notable, there is no sound from outside the hotel. Amenities & Restaurants: Disclosure: I used the pool with my kids but did not frequent the restaurants. The pool is excellent. It is quite large and sits in the middle of an atrium where you can watch planes overhead as you swim. It was very clean and warm without feeling soupy. The hot tub was also... hot and clean, and there are a number of tables and chairs so you can sit and read/work while the kids swim. The fitness centre is small but adequate for maintaining fitness with 4-5 bikes and treadmills from which you can watch a small TV with Sports running. The free weight selections were quite good although the universal system was a bit dated. There are 3 restaurants and a bar. The bar prices are expensive although coffee in the morning is OK and they serve Starbucks brew (no espresso type drinks though). There is a high priced sushi restaurant, and North American upper class dining restaurant and a pub. The Pub would be your best bet for cheaper food of the 3, but I can't speak to quality as I did not eat at any of the 3. Check-out: Check-out was quick and uneventful, and can be expedited by completing checkout on your TV prior. Service: Service was friendly and accommodating, although I had little interaction aside from a phone call to book and check-in/check-out.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Grove, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cToo Expensive for What you Get\u201d", "Author": "JusticeSalmon", "ReviewID": "UR5763065", "Content": "The hotel is really expensive for a standard, business as usual Marriott.
