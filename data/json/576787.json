Two days before our arrival the concierge emailed asking if we needed anything for our stay and offered to range discounted car service. We took them up on this offer as it wasn't much more than cab rides and I like car service because there is no searching down cabs nor do you worry about them taking 'the long way' to your hotel. The concierge took are of all of it and our driver was there waiting for us as we entered baggage claim. Very nice. We arrived quite early, before lunch. Even so they allowed us to check in. We were upgraded to a city view on the top floor without charge as Gold HH members. We were offered water as we waited to check in. I find this simple thing to be such a nice touch since bottled water in hotel rooms is always so expensive. Every contact we had with an employee was stellar. Every one was smiling, happy to work there and were very helpful. Quality staff for sure. The room itself was lovely. Nice furnishings. Wonderful bathroom. Work desk, seating... all of it was enjoyed. We loved that the hotel is connected to a mall via a sky walk. Easy access to the food court was great.

I really enjoyed the fact that there was so much right within the hotel grounds. I could walk through the 2nd Floor of the Hotel into the mall, to the food court, downstairs to restaurants both casual and upper class such as Panara Bread or Ruth's Chris Steakhouse; cinema, and everything else downtown Indianapolis has to offer. I saw both standard rooms and a corner suite. The standard room was just that- small and basic and clean. The corner suite which I ended up staying in was very nice, large entrance way to the living room and guest washrom, followed by a large master bedroom and comfortable en suite bathroom with shower and tub. I expected the tub to be larger in such a suite, possibly even a jacuzzi. Not so. It was decorated finely and felt more like a condo living space. I ordered room service twice: for dinner and breakfast. All other meals I went into the mall or restaurants downstairs or outside. The dinner was a Kobe Burger which was delicious-however the bun was not. The service was extremely friendly which made up for a crappy bun I wasn't going to stress over. The breakfast was great- lots of added touches. I did not visit the fitness center or pool so cannot comment. Really enjoyed the locale of the hotel and all the things to do within a short walk (or even covered walk inside). There was some confusion with the bill at the end of the stay which could have been handled better, and the guest services agent was not being proactive to get a manager to sort out the issues he did not know how to fix. Hailing a taxi was interesting as 3 door men stood around chatting and it took way too long to get my taxi to the airport.

The room was clean and terrifically decorated and equipped; the marble bathroom was \u201cdie for\u201d but after an engineer came up to fix our television, every time the occupants of the next room slammed their heavy room door, the TV flicked off. At 10:00 p.m. we retired for the evening. Around 11:40 PM, I was awakened by the loud party next to our room. Their door would open, someone would shriek like a banshee, music would boom out, and lots of loud voices and laughter could be heard. I\u2019d fall back to sleep. Then, another guest would show up, same thing. The coup de grace was when a loud male voice announced (in a non-smoking hotel -- 17th Floor that is) that he needed a lighter to light his cigarette. I stumbled to the phone and called the front desk (Conrad Services). The obsequious voice at the other end said he would send Security, which he did. The Security man talked to the twenty-something young woman who registered the room; she had 8 or more people partying with her as guests. As soon as Security left, same thing. My husband woke up and went to the phone and complained. Security came up again; told the party next to us to be quiet. As soon as he would leave, the noise would start again. After the second visit from Security, the music next door was no longer audible, but the talking and laughing and shouting got all the louder. My husband swears he also heard noise coming from another party a couple of rooms to the left of our room. For all we know, there could have been people moving between the parties in the two rooms. There was an outer security door in the hallway, separating our room and the room to the right (containing most of the party noise) from the rest of the guest rooms on our west end of the 17th floor. One of the partygoers decided to shut that security door (which needed a guest room pass card or a key to open), so we were essentially locked in with this going on next to our room. Each time Security came up, the security man would unlock that security door and prop it back open, and 5 or 10 minutes later, one of the partyers would shut it again. One of the guests came out, shouting, \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Give me your elevator pass card.\u201d My husband called the front desk again. He said the noise was intolerable. More people arrived looking for the party; my husband, standing at the door\u2019s peephole in his undershorts, saw two of them. A thirtyish man in a black suit, holding the necks of two bottles of champagne in one hand, was loudly looking for the party. On the fourth call, the man at Conrad Security assures us that the party was being moved to the 2nd floor (Why they did not do this to begin with is a mystery). As the party left, my husband counted ten people walking out, one carrying a chest-size cooler and another one a boom box. The front desk was checking their room inventory because he said there was no guarantee that there wouldn\u2019t be loud noise when these people returned to their room. My husband hung up. So, at about 1:15 A.M., as we were getting ready to pack up and possibly check out and drive 76 miles home, the phone rang. It was the front desk. We were told that a bellman was coming right up to move us to a different room, on a different floor. Of course, the bellman could not reach our room because the partygoers had shut that security door again on their way out. Do you know what it is like to repack your belongings to go to a different room in the middle of the night? For this nightmare, our stay was free of charge, and we were given two breakfast vouchers worth twenty dollars for the Capital Grille. And, mind you, a breakfast including two eggs over easy cost fourteen dollars, and a 3-egg omelet was $12 or $13. For a top hotel like the Conrad, a reputation for incomparable customer service is the most important asset. We were grateful to be \u201ccomped\u201d for the room instead of being charged, but why did it take 4 calls and more than 90 minutes to reach a solution to this party noise problem? To sum up, a four- or five-star hotel doesn\u2019t mean you are not going to be put in a room next to folks with total lack of manners and respect for others. I think a Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn would have been better. At least, I could have called the Police. P.S.

We were fortunate to have our room on the 18th floor with a nice view of the state capitol dome. The one thing that is even my 9 year old son mentioned was how nice everyone is here Dad, I would be remiss if did not mention that that everyone here was far and above the best in customer service or customer care. From the valet to the housekeeping staff, everyone my family encountered was \u201cwarm and welcoming\u201d they all seemed to care about their guests. World Class Service in the Circle City!!! The only drawback was on the first night when the room next to us was partying and play loud music at 2:00 AM, they woke all four of us up and those around us that mentioned to us in the hall the next morning. The Conrad security took some time to address it and when I mentioned it the next morning to the front desk they said nothing more than \u201csorry\u201d as a Hilton Diamond member I was a bit disappointed. Also on the second night the hot tub was not functioning (no heat) not dire to me but my sons were quite disappointed and when I mentioned to the attendant she did not seem to do anything about it and I did not see anyone look into to the problem the entire hour I was at the pool. Still I would give the Indy Conrad a first class rating anyway!", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay for the Nite Ride 2011\u201d", "Author": "littlegiant10", "ReviewID": "UR119977002", "Content": "We were a group of several couples participating in the NITE Ride which is a bicycle ride in the city of Indianapolis starting on a Saturday night at 11p.

But if you are looking to get away from things for a few days to relax and to spend the day at the spa, the Conrad Hotel in Indianapolis is the perfect choice. Rooms: The rooms are modern and elegant. The bathrooms are quite large with separate shower and large bathtub. If you just have to continue to watch your favorite show while brushing your teeth, you can do that with the television in the bathroom. The beds are comfortable and you can order from a pillow menu for additional comfort. Just ask about it and someone will be up to provide the variety of pillows available. The double beds, I believe, are a bit small for my taste, but the king size beds are quite nice. Spa: The day spent at the spa was just right. The staff were so very attentive and friendly. Make sure you book your treatments early. It looked like there were a lot of weddings and receptions going on in the hotel so the spa books up pretty fast. The prices are reasonable too so fill up on as many treatments as you can! Service: Hotel staff were friendly and always willing to answer questions about where to go for lunch, questions about the room, or just about anything. Anytime we asked for some assistance, room service or needed something for our room, the staff was right on top of it. We never wanted for anything. Transportation: The best way to get to the hotel is to use IndyGo's Green Line route. It takes you right to the hotel and back to the airport. It runs about every 20 minutes and is about $14 roundtrip. The hotel may suggest a car that can pick you up and take you back to the airport but I wanted to save my money for the wonderful spa treatments available at the hotel...so IndyGo was the choice.

The hotel is very nice, the beds are very comfortable, the staff is very accommodating. When we checked in and they brought us up to our room it smelled like smoke and the smoke detector had been tampered with so it was buzzing. They upgraded us, no charge, to a smoke free room (we choose a non smoking room due to my son's recent asthma attack). The upgrade was AWESOME because we just got out of the ICU at Riley with our son and we were trying to avoid triggers such as smoke. Now the bad part. My mother in law needed an extra key to our room and I was not aware that she went down to get an extra key. This was completely fine, BUT The front desk gave her the key after she said she was staying with us and had the same last name. They did not ask for ID nor did they call up to the room to confirm this information. She just simply asked and got a key. I am staying here with my son, had I been staying alone - this is super scary that anyone can get a key to my room. The front desk person does not personally know me or my family. She only knows that my husband's name is on the room. I get that it is my mother in law and she knows me, had it been someone in passing or sitting next to me at a restaurant that happened to overhear where I was staying, that would have been different. I feel like there should be some type of protocol for safety like you need to check with the registered guest, check the persons ID or at the very least call the room to confirm.

Upon arrival, we found an exquisitely decorated table. And, of course, as an etiquette consultant you know what I looked at next\u2026the table setting! If the table setting is set correctly, guests should be able to look at it and immediately know which courses will be served. As expected, the Conrad Hotel gave us a perfect table setting. What was most impressive was the manner in which guests were served. First and foremost, the wait staff was professionally dressed. Their uniforms were well-maintained and the servers themselves looked put-together. Here lately, at four and five star restaurants, I've observed way too many servers that look like they just rolled out of bed! Kudos to the Conrad Hotel for knowing the appearance of its wait staff plays a critical role in how it is perceived by guests! One by one, guests were treated to a beautifully choreographed presentation of the meal. In unison, five to six servers emerged from the kitchen doors and, in single file, walked swiftly into the dining hall with plates in each hand. With excellent posture and pride in their step, they circled their designated table and stood at attention with all eyes on their lead server. After a brief pause, the lead server gently nodded his head at which time each server placed one of their plates in front of a guest. Returning to attention, all eyes were again on their lead server as they waited for his nod to serve their second guest. When finished, again in single file with pride in their step, they quietly returned to the kitchen. BRAVO! Applause! Applause! Even better\u2026the hotel's wait staff served from the left and removed plates from the right which is the correct way to serve a meal. A true class act! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most efficient way to serve a large number of guests. I am always disappointed when four or five star restaurants use the \"large tray of meals\" method to serve multiple tables. There are two things wrong with this. First, it is not efficient. Each guest is served one-by-one by a single server who inevitably runs out of meals before the entire table is served. As a result, the server must return to the kitchen while the guests who HAVE been served must sit and wait while watching their meal cool*. This approach can take anywhere between two and ten minutes to serve a single table of eight to ten guests! *It is bad form to begin eating before everyone at your table is served. Secondly, the clinking and clanking of plates along with ten to twenty servers scurrying in and out of the kitchen and throughout the dining hall is loud and distracting. Overall this dining experience at the Conrad Hotel was one of the best I've had in a long time in the Indianapolis area. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to say, \"Congratulations Conrad Hotel. You are truly a class act!\" One last note\u2026I absolutely LOVE that the Capital Grille \u2013 a restaurant affiliated with the Conrad Hotel in downtown Indianapolis \u2013 immediately selects a color of napkin for its guests based on the color of their slacks or skirt. This ensures that noticeable lint will not be left on the guest. More sophisticated restaurants will always have white and black napkins available. Never hesitate to ask for a color that is similar to the color you are wearing. Unless, of course, you are dining at the Capital Grille where the ma\u00eetre d' takes the initiative to do that for you! If we choose to spend our hard earned dollars at a four or five star restaurant, we should most certainly expect to be treated to the finer details that make it a truly pleasurable experience. I am thrilled to say the Conrad Hotel and Capital Grille know how to do just that.

The carpet in the small room, the dust ruffle, and the upholstered bench at the foot of the bed were stained. The full-length mirror in the bathroom had hair product on it - little sticky spots. There was an almond on the floor of the closet - a whimsical touch but not for us! One of the reading lights made a loud buzzing noise. We complained twice about all of this and were told that housekeeping would receive a note. We checked out, did not stay, and got a refund. I even asked if that Conrad is the 5-star; I thought perhaps I'd mixed the 5-star up with the other Hilton downtown. No; that was it. It's run down, ordinary, and by my standards, dirty.

I am a businessman, but I am just not into the parlor room look. If I had my choice (the conference I attended required that the attendees stay at the Conrad.), I would have chosen the Courtyard by Marriott. I dig the looks of either Hampton Inns or Courtyards because they are modern contemporary (though the Hampton Inn-Downtown Indianapolis was in a historic building, it didn't mean that the interior needed to be historic, as well...but this review isn't about that particular Hampton Inn.) Room service was excellent. Housekeeping was super friendly about washing my laundry. That alone is a great example of the excellent customer service they provide here. The room looked nice despite my lacking interest of the parlor room look. The bed was nice and comfortable and loved the feather pillows. I also liked the glass shower. I didn't try Tastings or Capital Grille (I tried ordering nachos from the Capital Grille, but it was one of the things they didn't offer). I ended up having nachos from Champps Bar & Grill across the street, and they were mediocre at best (but was far better than the Cici's Pizza I visited a few hours before....) I also like that the Conrad (along with Embassy Suites, JW Marriott and the Omni Hotel), is connected to the Circle Centre Mall (owned by Simon Properties, which are headquartered in Indianapolis), which has your middle to upper class stores such as Express, Johnston & Murphy, Forever 21, American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch, Brookstone, etc. My only complaint was the pool's size. You'd think for a luxury hotel, they would have a larger pool. The chairs alongside the pool with towels, apples and bottled waters were a nice touch. Not that I used it since I have my Sprint EVO 3D 4G and can use it as a hotspot (and by the way, unfortunately, Sprint service isn't the greatest inside the hotel...ESPECIALLY in the ballrooms), Wi-Fi Internet cost $13.95 per day.

Here are some of the items that I thought were most pertinent: -Valet parking is $33 a night. We found that a bit steep, considering additional tips. We decided to park at an overnight parking garage (Merchant's Garage, I think). It was $16 for 24 hours and less than a five minute walk from the hotel, which we figured would be faster than doing valet. Do some research on Google Maps to look around for what is best for you. -Yes, the elevators are fast, but they also say that you are on the desired floor seconds before you actually stop. This gave me a few brief heart attacks when going to the lobby thinking that we were crashing into the ground. -The rooms are very nice, but somewhat small for what I expected. We had a King room. -The TV is very large for a hotel, but with a limited channel selection. I don't think anyone really wants to watch the exercise channel when on vacation or on a business trip. -The bathrooms are FANTASTIC and very clean. I did not find any hair in the shower like I normally do in other hotels. They include a soaking tub, glass shower with a duel shower head, phone, TV, dimming lights, hairdryer, and a make-up mirror. Towels are over sized. -Lots of fun bathroom goodies including shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, body lotion, q-tips, dental picks, mouthwash, nail file, and a dental kit (which includes the smallest- and therefore, cutest- toothpaste I have ever seen. The products were all very nice and of good quality. -The hotel offers free bottled water at the desk if you ask. However, it is not chilled. -Turn down service includes getting the bed ready, dimmed lights, light sconces by bed turned on, music, and free bottled water and ice. -We ate breakfast at the Capital Grille using the coupons we were given (I think because we are Hilton Honors members). They were good for a free continental breakfast (assorted pastries and fruit with coffee, juice, etc.) or $10 off a meal. My husband opted for a meal that included eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast, fruit, and coffee (normally $14). I got the Healthy Start meal with came with fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries) and tons of yogurt and yummy granola (normally $11). Both meals very excellent. However, it was a very fancy restaurant, and we felt under dressed in jeans among the business travelers we dinned near. However, when we left we saw many others dressed like us. It was hard to tell what the dress was before entering because you cannot see into the restaurant before you enter. -The hotel is connected to a sky walk (called the Arts Garden), which will take you to the Circle Centre Mall (lots of good shops!), without having to go outside. -Yes, the hotel charges for internet, but we saw a sign in the Arts Garden for free wi-fi. It is connected to the second floor of the hotel with lots of places to sit if you really don't want to pay. -There are plenty of restaurants surrounding the hotel, Rock Bottom Brewery, Weber Grill, Panera, Champps, Hard Rock Cafe- just to name a few.

I asked him if they served hot breakfast at the restaurant and he said, \"I'm getting to your vouchers.\" He never explained the internet service, didn't offer to have newspapers delivered, and was very unfriendly. My colleague who checked in with a different staff member had top notch service from someone who was very friendly, asked which newspapers she would like delivered, explained the breakfast vouchers and was just generally friendly.

The mark of a hotel's quality is always how they handle a tough situation. I was a bit tough. Long week of traveling, little sleep. Highway exits not marked very well as to where/when you should exit for downtown. On sleep . . . the drapes are so dark and the bed so comfortable, I could probably have slept all day. It was a noisy neighbor who woke me up, not sure what he was doing in there but it was pretty loud as the rooms are sound insulated quite well. Wrestling with the goose neck lighting or something. Who knows. My only complaint is that the Room Service menu is so steep since it comes from Capital Grille. Not that it's not worth the money but sometimes you don't want a full blown entree. Tastings is great although it is not a very welcoming space to the single traveler from a design standpoint and as good as the FD team was, the guys in Tastings were good but a little bit distracted despite the bar not being all that full. I also don't like that they are wearing Colts jerseys. I get why because of the fans and players coming in but they should do something more classy.

We had planned to stay 2 nights, but checked out after only 1. The rooms were decent - although somewhat small. For such a new property, and especially a Conrad, I was expecting better. I am a Gold Honors member and stay at Hiltons quite often, so this hotel was very similar to the upper end Hiltons I have stayed at. That being said, the service at this hotel was not good in my opinion. Granted it was New Years Eve, and people are expected to be partying that night, our floor was like a free-for-all anything goes bar brawl. All night long people were yelling and screaming, there were fights in the hallways, and people were knocking on our door in the middle of the night drunk. I called security several times and nothing was done about the issue. Again, I know it is New Year's Eve, but this was ridiculous. This was going on until 6am. There was also a big New Year's Eve bash at the hotel and a lot of party goers probably got rooms at the hotel, but the hotel environment was beyond ridiculous. The next morning, I complained to the manager of the hotel who kept insisting that this was due to it being New Year's Eve and that once a year, people like to let off a little steam and the other 364 days of the year, the hotel is fine. I explained that I wanted to check out immediately and would not be staying the additional night on my reservation. Yes, I understand that Conde Nest Traveler has this hotel on this Gold List - so I expected the management to promptly listen to my compaints and quickly refund the cost of the room. I have had similar problems at other properties, and as a Gold Member, this is what I would expect. However, after 15 minutes of explaining to the manager that the safety, comfort, and security of hotel guests should be a priority, he finally said he would take 1/2 off the rate. To make it worse, I just noticed the hotel charged a $75 early departure fee, which is absolutely unacceptable. This fee was not on my receipt at the time of checkout, and I was checking out early because there was a problem at the hotel - plus the manager did not inform me of the early departure fee upon checkout.

I don't know if it has a new General Manager (a FAX sent to the GM outlining the details of my stay has had no response) but this hotel is now a nice property, well located, but poorly managed. I haven't checked to see if other guests have posted on here, but as I was having breakfast in the Capital Grille, one guest stormed out saying that she waited a very long time and had been seated, but nobody offered her a menu, so she left. Here's what happened on our stay. Around midnight, we got a call from the operator. Could we let engineering in to fix the plumbing in our room? The room below us was flooding. We were very tired, so we asked if we could wait until the morning. We turned in, to be called again. Please, they asked, could they come in now? We would be provided with a free night stay. (big deal, the rate was $199/night off-season) but we figured it was urgent so we let them in. Two men came OK that story is getting long. Then, the toilet stopped up. Called engineering, they fixed it. Then the tub stopped up and wouldn't drain. Engineering came to fix it, working around the taped up tiles from the repair that came earlier. Lightbulbs weren't changed - called, for a third engineering visit. The AC power on the desk wasn't working, I reported it but it probably didn't get fixed. An important FAX that was to be sent out never got sent. A fax that I sent to the hotel with a cover sheet saying that I would pick it up at the front desk got held for morning delivery (it had my boarding pass) Here's the clincher. When I reviewed my bill, the free-night stay was not credited. I mentioned it to the front desk agent, who said she would adjust it and email me my bill. Not only didn't they not credit the free night stay - they charged an amount equal to an extra night after I checked out! So I called and FAX'd the GM, and have not had a response. I have sent all of this to American Express Centurion travel, so they are made aware of this change in service quality. A hotel is not the property, that's not the product. The product is the combination of service and facility, and this product is half what it used to be. Guests planning on a trouble-free stay with no aggravations should check their expectations now. It is not the property it was a year ago. If you are a business traveler, or a meeting planner considering the Conrad, understand that it appears to be understaffed and aloof.

We checked in and just dropped our bags off to go to dinner at oceannaire (fabulous). When we returned to the room, around 11 pm, we realized we'd been given a handicap accessible room--not a big problem, so we thought. We tried to read before bed, but BOTH of the reading lights were broken. 1 just hung limply and couldn't adjust except to hand toward the floor. The other DID adjust, but the bulb was burnt out--so no reading. In the morning when we went to shower, we realized that the HIGHEST the shower head would go was mid chest. (tough to wash one's hair, unless you crouched down, not to mention your neck and face). It was also a very small shower--unlike our friends who had the great double shower head large shower. Oh well. there was also only ONE large bath towel, although the room was clearly booked for 2 people. We looked for robes after our shower--NONE. (our friends room DID have them). So I don't know if all handicap accessible rooms are like this, or just ours, but for our special occasion, it certainly put a big damper on it. I will say that the beds were VERY COMFORTABLE, the TV was great, so there were many good things about the room--but no reading light, a bad shower and no robes, we were very disappointed.

Everyone we encountered both inside and outside of the hotel was friendly. Unfortunately, the reviews I'd read on this site had me expecting perfection. That was not delivered when I discovered a glaring stain on the cylindrical throw pillow on our bed. It was not delivered when I called the front desk asking for ice and was told that there was a machine on the floor above mine ( the in-room booklet stated ice is delivered and replinished daily ). It was not delivered when I opened the coffee drawer in the morning to find only 2 packets of decaf - no tea, no regular. Friends in another room had no bathrobes in their room. Could phone calls have resolved these issues? Probably - but should this many \"fix-it\" calls be necessary in a hotel of this caliber?

Where do I start? Everything was wonderful. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating. No wait to check in. As a Gold Hilton Honors member, I asked for a room upgrade and was upgraded to a King Corner Suite. We were also given vouchers for complimentary continental breakfast each morning. The lobby is warm and inviting and you can access both restaurants off the lobby upon entering. We were given a room on the 6th floor which is the same level as the pool/fitness center/and spa which was very convenient. The room itself was fabulous. You enter through a door that takes you to a small area with a guest room to the right and the suite door directly ahead. Upon entering, there is a small hallway with a half bath. The living room area is set up nicely with a sofa, 2 arm chairs and a desk area. Both the bedroom and the living room have huge plasma screen tvs. We had a great view of the city and the artgarden. The bedroom has a comfy king bed and another small loveseat. A nice touch are the small reading lamps that come out of the wall on either side of the bed. They also make a great nightlight. The best was that each bathroom had a small plasma screen tv. Great for catching the news in the morning while we were getting ready. The full bathroom also has a dual head shower and a deep soaking tub bath. And unlike the Embassy Suites next door, you control the temperature of the room. Both the bedroom and living room have thermostats. Our last stay in Indy was at the Embassy in November and I remember being miserable both nights because the room was so hot. There are robes and slippers provided in the closet and a complimentary umbrella next to the door for use during your stay. The pool was very clean and quiet. Larger and warmer than most hotels we have stayed with. The hot tub was very large and very clean as well. There are padded lounge chairs around the pool and bottles of water are provided. We did not use the spa or fitness center, but both looked nice as well. The hotel was quiet and we never saw more than 4-5 other people at the pool area while we were there. We ordered room service the first night, the service was quick and the food was great. Continental breakfast was in Vitesse restaurant. The selection was quite good and consisted of oatmeal, several types of pastries and croissants, yogurt, cereals, bagels, toast and fresh fruit consisting of watermelon (suprisingly good considering it is off season), raspberries, and strawberries. There were also apples and oranges available. Coffee, tea and orange juice are brought by the server. The service was excellent. We forgot to get an additional voucher for our children,but each morning the server took care of it for us. The hotel offers valet parking for $32.00, but we chose to park ourselves. The Embassy Suites garage charges $20.00 a day and you can take the walkway from the Embassy over to the Artsgarden and enter the Conrad from there. There is also street parking, but we did not feel safe parking our vehicle on the street. All in all a very relaxing and enjoyable stay. I can't believe this hotel is not rated #1. Except when we travel to Orlando, we only stay with the Hilton brand. Out of all the hotels we have stayed at, this hotel takes care of their VIP's better than any of them. We used to stay at the Embassy Suites next door, but after a bad experience there and the wonderful experience we had at the Corad, there is no question where we will stay upon our next trip to Indy.

Because I had a great deal of points, I decided to splurge my points on the Conrad since I wanted to treat myself to a well deserved rest. Conrad was rated so much better than the Hyatt (& even the Embassy which was right next door). So instead of using the freebie breakfast, etc. which comes with the Embassy, I chose to use the 200,000 points for the Conrad. No problem with booking through the Hyatt rewards program. Got checked into the hotel (which seemed fairly vacant during my stay) all right. Very pleasant front desk personnel & was shown around my room by the luggage porter. The room itself is VERY nice. The bed was so inviting, the bathroom was large & the shower had 2 large heads. TheTV in the room was crystal clear (great for watching the Olympics). It's great to have a TV in the bathroom for watching the morning news while you're getting ready. That part was excellent. Things just went downhill from there, considering the type of hotel this is. I stayed 5 nights & every single day brought a new & unnecessary challenge. The coffee maker is a Keurig & it comes supplied with various single serve coffee/tea cartridges. That was great, but the sugar/creamer that was left was only enough for 1 cup. Call me weird, but I like a decent amount of sugar (real) & cream for my tea. On the first night, I also realized ththat the bathroom TV remote didn't work. I left a note for housekeeping that I needed more sugar/cream & about the remote. Came home Mon. afternoon from my class & the remote was repaired, but no sugar/cream was left. I went downstairs to ask to have someone replace it when I went out that night. That night I used the comfy robe in the room after my bubble bath (by the way, the way the tub is situated, there is no choice but to flood the bathroom floor because the water that spills out on the sides funnels right to the floor -- design flaw!!). I hung it up & when I returned from class on Tues. night, it was gone. Assuming it was replaced, I looked in the closet, but no robe. Wed. am, I left another note (with a tip daily) to replace the robe, sugar/cream reminder, shampoo replaced, etc. I shampoo/ condition daily & left the mostly used bottles in the shower, but they never got replaced, even when they went empty. Even soap was iffy. The towels were either 2 face clothes & no hand towel, until I asked for one. Well, I got the robe back, but no shampoo or sugar/cream. By this time, I was pilfering the sugar/cream from our coffee table at the Hyatt and was doing a slow burn over this. I didn't think another visit downstairs should have to happen since the first time should have cleared it up. Wed. afternoon I finally got another bottle of shampoo, but the hotel must have still been out of sugar/cream. The first 2 days a Conrad bottle of water was given, but it ended completely after that, so I don't know if that was a one time only thing. On Thurs., I left a soaked robe that I hoped would be replaced (from another flooded tub soak), but when I got back around 5pm from my class, the room wasn't made up. I left about an hour later to go to a banquet & when I returned after midnight, it still hadn't been made up -- NOTHING!!! I went to bed, no new towels, robe or anything. I was too tired & didn't want to yell at anyone. I checked out at noon on Fri. & told the front desk that my room wasn't made up. The poor girl didn't know how to respond, but muttered that I wasn't the only one that complained about that. I don't know what on earth is going on with housekeeping there, but it needs to be addressed. I hope management reads this & reacts to the problem. Totally inexcusable for the type of hotel this is. I opted for this hotel since conferance hotels are usually overwhelmed & service suffers, but did this backfire on me or what? I'm sure this is not the norm for the Conrad brand, but my experience certainly was disappointing. The room was the only saving grace (but not when I didn't have clean, dry towels), but I just wanted to cry at some point.

The air coming out of the vent was cold. We called, and of course it was fixed right away, but after a while it got to be 80 degrees and stayed that way the rest of the stay. We couldn't use the room at all. It turns out that the registers have to be adjusted manually to either hot or cold. So if your room gets too hot, it requires an engineer. Both the toilets stopped flushing at the same time. We called downstairs and then left the room to have breakfast. An hour later they were still not working. We called again, and somebody finally came up. Turns out he was busy fixing a problem in the garage. The hotel only has one person who can use a plunger? I took a shower just before we were ready to leave. I opened the drawer and discovered the hair dryer was missing. I waited about ten minutes (3 phone calls) with dripping hair before somebody delivered the dryer. None of these items are a big deal, but this is a hotel that claims to be special and unique and as far as I can tell, the customer service is NOT either of these things. I probably won't stay at the Conrad again. If I were the manager of this hotel, I would make sure that more than one person could come up with a plunger so that a guest doesn't have to wait. And what about a checklist for the cleaning people. Bathrobe, check, shampoo, check, hairdryer, check.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville", "Title": "\u201cRoom for Improvement\u201d", "Author": "turk26", "ReviewID": "UR12273353", "Content": "I just returned from a two night stay and disapointment is an understantment.

I booked a corner King suite initially and then 2 of my daughters decided to come along, so at the last minute the hotel accomodated us with another deluxe room with 2 double beds that is right across a little vestibule (which has it's own access door to the hallway). So, we can leave both of our rooms open and just lock the door to the hallway! (Not your traditional connecting room, but it works!) First let me say that we have been coming to Indy for Thanksgiving for over 20 years. We have stayed at the Westin, then the Hyatt, then I found the Conrad online through a search of hotels that connect to the Circle Centre Mall. From the moment we checked in there has been nothing but exceptional service! The rooms are outstanding, from the flat screen televisions (In a corner suite you'll have 4!) to the enormous soaking tubs, to the mini bars, and the nightly turn-down service in which they leave bottled water and fill up your ice buckets! The room service menu is 24 hours and the food is delivered in 30 minutes or less. Excellent food and consistently more than expected... If you order a scoop of ice cream they include a homemade chocolate chip cookie! I spent a day in the Spa Chakra and I do not have words to express the exceptional sensorial experience! Lets just say Spa Chakra provides the ultimate experience in day and destination spas. I really must mention the level of \"quiet\" that this hotel offers (no banging overhead or people coming on and off the elevators) actually allowed my husband to oversleep this morning...BLISS! All this to say we will be looking forward to coming back next year and we still have 3 days left on this reservation!", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay at the Conrad\u201d", "Author": "ChgoDiver", "ReviewID": "UR10544003", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Conrad in Indy. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Conrad and would highly recommend this place. This is a relatively new property that is head and shoulders above the other hotels in Indy. The Property: The lobby is beautiful and well appointed. We noticed two things: First, there is little to no furniture in the lobby. Although it was a slick lobby with polished stone all over, it certainly was not a \"cozy\" lobby that invites you to sit and socialize. In fact, the hotel had little if any such areas save for the bar/restaurants. Somewhat bizzare. Second, the restaurant/bar is not closed off from the lobby. So when we arrived from Chicago and entered the lobby a cabaret singer in the bar was ironically belting out \"Sweet Home Chicago.\" Her voice reverberated throughout the lobby (not surprisingly given the lack of furniture). It was so loud that I could not even hear the front desk clerk inform me where my room was. I liked that they had live music, but didn't like the set-up. The Room: The doors to the rooms were noticeably thick and made of polished wood. Our room was a little small, (perhaps 320 sq ft?) but we had a great view. Our room was overfurnished giving it a crowded feel. Nevertheless, it was tastefully decorated and well-supplied with bottled water, snacks and various amenities. The centerpiece of the room is the hutch that holds the very large flat panel television. And for the first time ever in my hotel experience, the high definition television actually broadcasted high definition television stations. BRAVO! What a nice surprise. The bed was luxurious and remarkably comfortable. Perhaps it was the highlight of the room. The bathroom had nice stone work, including marble countertop (single vanity). Molton Brown amenities. The mirror, however, was poorly and crookedly installed. The television in the bathroom was a nice touch and indicates that the Conrad had the solo business traveler in mind. I suppose that's why they did not have a separate water closet for the toilet. Understandable, but not convenient for guests that may need to use the bathroom simultaneously. The restaurant/bar and the Capital Grille: we did not eat at the restaurant but ordered a drink from the bar. They poured a generous glass of wine and champagne for us; not stingy at all, which is refreshing. The restaurant appeared to serve a continental breakfast. We opted for something more substantial at the Cap. Grille which did not fail to satisfy. Nice breakfast. The workout room/pool: The workout room is very nice. It has complimentary botlted water. They have TechnoGym equipment which looks nice, but is, in my opinion, inferior to several other brands (Nautilus, LifeFitness). The pool was small but well maintained and clean. I would guess 18-20 yards long and 2-3 lanes wide. It did not seem to be designed for fitness as they had no swimming lines on the bottom of the pool, no lane lines, and no swim fitness equipment (i.e., bring your own). They had a hot tub in the pool area which was fine. We did not check out the \"spa\" facilities. The Service: The front desk clerk was courteous, but not necessarily polished. The bell staff and valets were attentive, but were a little lethargic or reticent in approaching the guests to inquire about assistance. The use of \"Mr. and Mrs ______\" was absent other than when we used the phone (and our names flashed in front of the guest services person). Overall, this is a great property. Because of the good, but unpolished service and smaller, crowded rooms, I would not classify this property as five star. Its employees need some extra training and presence for that to happen. The property is nice, but not extravagent. The rooms do not have the room size or layout of a Four Seasons or a Ritz which are a little more generous with space (less crowded, double vanities, separate water closet etc). Nevertheless, this is a high end hotel that is definitely the best stay in Indy.

The 1.5 year old hotel benefits from an excellent and helpful staff, large/modern rooms (huge flatscreen, multiple extra power outlets, wireless, bathroom TV, etc). Rooms were very clean with great beds, shower and furniture. The location is walking distance to downtown and the valet is prompt. I did not have a chance to check out the gym facilities. The only negative was surprisingly poor room service quality. While my order was delivered exactly on time (and to my specifications), there is a lack of breakfast diversity (nothing close to healthy or creative) and the food quality is low. Given the lobby steakhouse, perhaps lunch/dinner are better. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

We ate at the Capital Grille in the Hotel. The food was good if not a bit overpriced but we found the waiter a bit standoffish. Perhaps it was because we had a 6 year old with us and this is mainly a business hotel. The hotel has access to the shopping Mall via an indoor skywalk which was a great plus as it rained on our first day. This is a lovely hotel but be careful when parking your car. When we asked for our car on our departure morning we were told we needed a new battery as the car would not start. There has never been a problem with the battery in this car. The staff said they tried jump leads but could not get the car going and they could organise a new battery. I was not sure whether this was genuine or they were looking to make a fast buck. Turned out they had left the lights on overnight and this drained the batterry. The car was restarted after my sister went to check out the car and the valet eventually got a car with a bigger house power to connect the jump leads too.
