When I called the front desk, it took 3 attempts before anybody picked up the phone. When informed of the internet problem, they sent a 65-year person (Hernandez) who is responsible for maintenance to fix the internet issue. He had no clue of what the technical problem was and returned without any resolution. I had to call the front desk again and after 1.5 hour they reset the servers/routers which allowed for internet access to work. - There is a stinking smell in the hotel (room and hallway) like they have sprayed some detergent or carpet deodorant. It is disgusting. I am not sure if they change the bedsheets after each guest checks out. The reason I say this is because the beds are itchy, sheets felt used and worn out, and kept me up most of the 2 nites I stayed here. I am never coming back to this property again!!! - I had a business dinner I had to attend on the 1st day. I wanted to take a shower before heading out. There was no hot water in the bathroom. The front desk asked me to let the water run for 5 minutes. I did that for 15 minutes and the best I got was lukewarm water. The maintenance staff told me that they turn down the water heaters in the afternoon and they will turn it back again to heat up the water. That was just unheard of and very disappointing. I was significantly delayed for dinner! - The staff at the front desk is very unresponsive and unfriendly. I requested for a cab. They told me that the cab would arrive in 10 minutes. I waited for 25 minutes and requested the staff to call the cab company again. The lady (jenny at the front desk) told me that I just had to be patient. The cab didn't come for 40 minutes and it was unfortunate that Jenny didn't see the urgency to call the cab company again! - This property doesn't provide water bottles or in-room mini fridge where you can buy beverages. I called the front desk if I can get a water bottle since I was thirsty and it was 10pm at night. The gentleman at the front desk indicated to me that he would send a water bottle, but they would charge me a couple of bucks on my hotel bill. I told them that it was not a problem. 20 minutes goes by and there is no water bottle. I called them again and this time Jenny picks up the phone. I asked her on the status of the request. She tells me that they made a mistake and they were not planning to send any water because it was not their responsibility. I told her that other gentleman had informed me that he would send the water and charge me for it which was fine by me. She became rude with her responses and basically indicated that the other gentleman made a mistake and I would have to just get my own water bottle myself. I felt that this was not very customer-friendly response and the staff didn't follow up after they made a service committment. After all, I was not asking anything for free. If they had told me upfront that they wouldn't do it, then I would have planned for other option. Anyway, I went to sleep without drinking any water that night. In my opinion, Jenny is not meant to be in the hospitality business. Bottomline - I am not visiting this property in Miami.

Also, the neighborhood contains several other interesting ethnic restaurants. The staff were friendly, competent and helpful.

You can likely take a spot at one of the garages, but when you check in at 1130p at night, I'm not hunting for a garage. But this means that you have to call down well in advance to have your car ready to go. When you're pressing for time in getting to a morning meeting, factor in HEAVY traffic in the area (particularly northbound on the Dixie Hwy) and the wait to get your car. Almost cost us getting to our 9am meeting. And why do major hotel chains get these cheap, loud wall units and put them in an otherwise perfect room? Anyone who travels for a living has dealt with this problem - the compressor turns on and its so loud that it breaks your sleep cycle. That made for two very uncomfortable nights.

Very nice! The parking situation is a bit laughable at times; just be aware that you're pretty much stuck with the valet parking prices, and thanks to the VERY limited availability, you'll be leaving your car in a jumbled mess, near the hotel's entrance if you return late in the evening. The parking attendants were very good about explaining the situation, though. I understand the area, and the fact that their hands were tied. Hey, what can ya do? They clear the cars as soon as space became available, so no complaints. The hotel itself was fine. Clean and spacious common areas, Small and efficient excercise room and pool. The property is situated across the street from a Publix grocery store, which was big, clean, and seemed to cater to the residents of the surrounding high-rise condos. A tip: SKIP THE HOTEL BREAKFAST. The Publix offers a variety of fresh pastries, a sit-down cafe', deli, and even a little booth which sells some great -tasting (and REALLY CHEAP) Cuban coffee. The hotel is about a block away from SW 88th St. which offers a variety of dining and shopping options, including the HUGE MALL. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The bathroom was spacious, with enough vanity/counter space to accommodate my wife's seemingly endless amount of cosmetics. Though we did not have much of a view from our room, aside from the Publix parking lot, we were able to focus more on what was happening inside the room. Which we truly enjoyed. Let's get something straight: This is NOT a resort. What you're paying for is the convenient location. The pool is small, as is the exercise room, which in my opion, are just fine.

Normally I stay across the road at the Dadeland Marriott, (must have stayed there more than two dozen nights (including a whole week) over the last 3 years, always with son or husband or both) but because I was travelling alone this time, and breakfast was included, in the great room rate of $101, I decided to try the Courtyard. I was not at all disappointed....rooms actually larger than the Dadeland M standard king/ 2 queen rooms, or at least have more free floor space. Comfortable king-size bed, (loads of pillows) comfortable couch, usable coffee table, usable desk and a connection box in front of the large swivel mounted TV where my IPod plugged in...There was an empty working fridge, great for the few things bought from the next door Publix.. Wireless internet connection in the room made using Skype from my ITouch very easy and best of all FREE. Ironing board and iron in the closet. No in room safe though. The bathroom, was roomy, spotless (and I am a clean freak) with loads of towels. (They did have a chlorex odour, (as in a previous post) but faint so it was not that bad, and at least proved they were clean???). The shower was powerful and there was plenty of hot water. I am short so managed a nice soak in the tub, but would not be much of a soak for anyone tall. There was a slight stale smell in the room when I arrived (no problem at all with an early check in at 11am), but when I mentioned it to the head housekeeper, (I met in her by chance in the corridor), she was very sympathtic and I think the carpet was given a shampoo while I was out, certainly the room did not smell stale when I got back about 5 hours later . The front desk staff were bright and helpful and welcoming, replacing a broken hair drier in a few minutes, and when my keycard didn't work in the door, someone was there to help before I got back from reporting it on the corridor phone...(of course the key then worked first time). (Apart from stale smell...minor points) The free breakfast was much better than I expected, with a choice of cereals, fruit, pastries, sausages, bacon, and a chef preparing eggs to order, there were waffles, toast (toaster took ages though) and hot oats etc. Even so if I had to pay it would only have been $13...very good value. Not as extensive as some places, but definitely 100% better than say a Comfort Inn style buffet breakfast. In the lobby were two large fridges, one stocked with beverages (including beer) and one with things like prepared sandwiches and salads...also trays of snack type foods - help yourself and pay at reception. There was also complimentary coffee, tea and iced tea in the lobby and use of a microwave. I like this area, because the Dadeland Mall is about 5 mins walk away (JC Penny, Macys, Saks and Nordstrom as anchors). There is a Metro station practically in the Dadeland Marriott and one stop away is Bed Bath and Beyond, Target and Best Buy Superstores (plus Sports Authority and Michaels) . (Metro now with a $5 all day ticket, great because can go back and forth the one stop and save having to pay $2 each way!!!). Across the highway are some others large stores like Payless, Borders etc. all within walking distance. The Free airport shuttle (serves both Marriotts) will drop off and pick up from the mall (great if you are laden with tired feet). Now the same shuttle even does a run to the Dolphin Mall for $15 return... I would happily have stayed for the week, and will definitely stay there the next time I need some retail therapy....

The rooms are very well done. Flat screen TV, VERY comfortable bed, clean, overall great. However, there were a few problems. First, their internet was down for over a day. I had to find a Kinko's and print a business report I had to have first thing in the morning. They did not pick up the Kinko's tab. Second, the parking situation is HORRIBLE. You have to use valet which is $10 per day. Your only other option is to park at the grocery store behind the hotel and down the road. Now that I think about it, I should have done the latter more often because the valet took forever to bring my car. One evening, I needed the car to drive to the Cheesecake factory and I stood there for close to 20 minutes waiting for my car before I finally gave up and walked there.

One of my co-workers had a standard King and said the room was \"on-par\" with other mid-grade hotels. Besides the pillows from hell, the only issues we encountered were slow elevators and a long wait for the valet (we should have called down).

It was quite funny with him wrestling with the plastic sheet stuck to his body. Marriottt....please, please update your bathrooms to have a large shower stall !!! We did not have breakfast there, since we had plans elsewhere. Check-out was quick and great. No annoying maids bamming on your door at 7:00 am either. Staff seemed very well trained, and spoke very good English, even the late night staff. Yes, there is no on site parking. All the web sites for this hotel tell you that. But, it was fairly priced at $10, and the valet service was quick. Miami parking for $10.00 is a steal ! Trust me! Overall, a great stay.

The hotel was only 4 stories which meant you never had to wait very long for the elevator! The lobby of the hotel has like 4 computers with free internet access which is the most I've ever seen available at a hotel. The price was reasonable for a Marriott.

When I get my luggage about 10:30pm I call and they tell me the last shuttle leaves the airport at 9:30 and I will have to find my own way to the hotel. I get transfered the Courtyard front desk after disputing this and they tell me to take a cab. I say \"And you will reimburse the taxi cost, right?\" She thought about it and said yes. So they took care of that but still a hassle I did not want. So I get the hotel and ask \"Where can I get some food at this hour?\" She says no where really, but say some fast food might be open a 10 min walk away. I hike it the place get some food and come back and see in the lobby some sandwiches, pasta, salads, etc. She failed to mention any of this and let me walk to get my food. The room was ok, little noisy. Fairly clean and good sized. Free internet. I did expect much more for the price though. The staff did not seem too interested in my needs either.
