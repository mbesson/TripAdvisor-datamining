My biggest complaint was the shower head could have been replaced or descaled but the shower serviceable. Breakfast in the vaulted basement was brilliant, I doubt you;d find a place with to have breakfast with more history. Great Italian coffee, big pots of real Italian coffee made on an Espresso machine, heaven. As to location you're surrounded by really good Italian restaurants.

The location is really downtown and very accessible by public transport, taxis or (preferably!) by foot. But be aware: all these lovely narrow streets are NOT easy to walk on on your high heels!

I was surprised that despite the professional attitude the welcome for a just-married couple was totally plain: not even a tiny chocolate or a small complimentary card on the bed or desk. Apparently this hotel receives its guests continuously without making any effort or it would at least make a small gesture as appreciation for choosing this hotel on a honeymoon I would say. The staff is friendly. Except for the lady that served us breakfast: my husband was kind of afraid to ask her for another espresso because of her non-verbal communication! Breakfast is ok: lots to choose from, but very standard quality. A narrow elevator brings you to your floor (we were on 3rd, streetside).The room is quiet and a bit dark with dark furniture. The bed is a bit hard, but I slept really well. The bathroom is small, but kept very clean. We didn't watch any TV because there was no interesting international channel.

We stayed in room 2 in the 'annex' which is the largest of the two rooms in the apartment-style lodgings that are located just seconds away from the main hotel. We really loved this arrangement because we felt we had extreme privacy, yet we enjoyed the services of being in a hotel (breakfasts, tourist advice, wake up calls, room cleaning, etc.). Here are the pros: - Fabulous Location: Just a two minute walk away to the the heart of Campo di Fiori but on a quiet street. We didn't have any issues with noise and enjoyed being able to stroll to Campo di Fiori, Piazza Navona, the Jewish Ghetto and Trastevere. - Complementary Breakfast: from 7am-10am daily, there is a breakfast that is absolutely sufficient to get you on your way - salami, cheeses, yoghurt, breads, hard boiled eggs, cereals, cakes, fruit, etc. There is a barista who will also make and bring you cappuccinos, espressos, teas. I gotta say - the Ponte Sisto has a better breakfast (food and setting) but it's also a pricier hotel. - Friendly and Helpful Staff - Everyone we encountered was very friendly and open to help with advice and assistance. We had an issue with our airport shuttle and Americo (sp?) was incredibly patient and helpful in sorting out the issue by calling the company repeatedly and resolving the issue. - Spacious and lovely room - the room where we stayed (number 2 in the annex) was very large and bright with huge windows and lots of storage space. Bathroom was also absolutely fine. The bed was the size of a king-size bed. It was two single beds together but it never felt like that. I had thought that perhaps we would fall through the crack (!) but that never happened and it never felt like two beds. - Air Conditioning - was amazing - so cool with remote control. Worked perfectly. Cons: - If you have mobility issues, you should be specific and request that you stay in the main hotel. I counted 50 stairs up to our room which could be a bit of a drag after coming home from a day of sightseeing, but it was absolutely bearable (and I was 4 and a half months pregnant). - the mattress (in our room) at least was incredibly hard. My boyfriend loved it, but I actually ended up folding two blankets in half and putting them under the bottom sheet to give it a bit more cushion. I heard from another guest in the main hotel that her mattress was also hard so this may be hotel-wide, but not sure. - TV didn't work - we mentioned this to the hotel the day we checked in and they said someone would look at it the next day. No one ever did, but we weren't interested enough in TV to raise it again. I'm sure if we reminded them, someone would have come by.

CONS: 1) Campo de Fiori is a very dirty area in Rome. The area is full of graffiti, very loud, and trash pilled everywhere. I did not enjoy walking in this area. Also, Piazza Campo de Fiori is nothing special. 2) No FREE Wi-FI, its 5cents a min. 3) Night reception staff is unfriendly. I didn't want to ask questions because they were rude. 4) Rooms are small and walls are PAPER THIN. I didn't get any sleep in this hotel, you can hear EVERYTHING. The rooms face a parking lot, alley, and restaurant. Its VERY noisy. Also, you can hear everything from other rooms, even people talking. The beds are very hard and were difficult to sleep on. 5) The room was fairly clean but very old. The bedspread looked ancient and I didn't want to use it as a cover. Too dirty. I had to walk up 2-3 flights of narrow stairs carrying my luggage. I also had to walk past 2 large trash cans INSIDE to walk up the stairs. The smell was unbelievably FOUL. I had to hold my breath and run up the stairs. This was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in a hotel. Overflowing trash indoors stinking up the entire hall and stairwell. I included a picture of this. I stayed in the Annex which is a separate building than the main hotel. Stairs may not be an issue in main hotel but noise level is the same. 6) We had a very early flight out of Rome and booked the car from the hotel to airport. It was a 30 min ride and we got there on time. Just be prepared that the driver does not speak very good English. We had to stop at a few terminals before we found the right airline.

The location is quiet. Breakfast is perfect, even a freshly made cappuccino if you want. The internet is not free but quite reasonable fee. Paulo at the front desk was extraordinarily helpful (he was on duty most of the time we needed anything). As it was August, many of the restaurants he suggested were on vacation but as the hotel is a minute from Campo di Fiori and not much further from Piazza Navona, there was no trouble finding a place to eat. The location is perfect. We walked every where (didn't go to the Vatican this time but could have walked there also). We also had two tours, one of the sights of Rome and another out to the roman towns in the hills outside the city as it really was too hot to walk about too much during the day (though we still did on one day and all the evenings). We booked our tours through Paulo at www.drivingguide.com and the guide he arranged (Antonio) was excellent, even with my elderly parents. Take time in the morning (except Sunday) to see the market at Campo di fiori, not too big but interesting and not just for tourists. This is an excellent location to base yourself to see most of the historic centre sights.

It was my 3rd trip to Rome, so I knew the area quite well and picked this hotel mainly because of it's location but also because of the history it lies upon. It is a stones throw from the Campo dei Fiori (a great little market square) where we sampled Limoncello; the amazing Pantheon (my favourite site); the Jewish quarter/ghetto; and easy access to transportation (if needed - although the best way to see Rome is to walk!). Upon arrival, after waking at 4am to catch flights, and walking from the terminal station (mistake!) we were relieved to be greeted by a very friendly woman, who checked us in quickly and made us feel welcome, instantly. The room was delightfully chilled (thank you for air con!) and very clean, simple and rustic with the wooden beams in the ceiling. We hardly spent any time in the room because we were always on the go, ready to see more but it was a lovely resting spot, a base for our days outings. The room was cleaned every day after we had left, and was always spotless. Breakfast is a real treat, as you get to eat in the ruins of the Pompeii Theatre (there are pictures on the hotels website) and the selection of food is good for a continental breakfast - pastries, meats and cheeses, fruits, cereals, toast and fruit juices. Most hotels in Rome seem to offer no breakfast, so I appreciated this greatly as it was needed for the long days of walking and site seeing, ahead! The staff were all very friendly, and spoke good English. We were going to a Metallica concert in Rome but it was very far from the centre, and one of the staff was greatly helpful in directing us, and explaining the metro system. When you leave the hotel, you feel as though you've made some friends because it doesn't feel too \"business-like\" but you can have a friendly chat with the staff. The hotel had all the amenities I needed - WiFi access is 0.05 euro a minute, which is great for checking the odd e-mail and writing to family/friends. There was a mini bar (which I tend to just use as a fridge for store-bought items..but it's handy!) and even a laundry service if you need it. Downstairs, near the breakfast area, there are also many travel guides and there are maps at the front desk - very good maps, don't bother buying one! Overall, this hotel offered everything I needed. It was a lovely, quiet, clean place to stay and the personality and charm of the hotel added to the romantic, historical trip I was looking for. I liked the intimacy of the place - with only 13 rooms, the staff know everybody who is staying there, which gives a feel of security.

The only noise I ever heard from outside was seagulls cawing in the early morning. The hallways are small, and only once or twice did I hear other guests from outside our doorway. Besides the main bedroom, there was a second small room with a roll up bed. My daughter used this as her own bedroom. The bathroom was clean, large enough for the two of us, and had relatively new facilities. The room came with a mini fridge, which was handy to store food purchased and leftovers. The TV was very small, but we spent little time watching it (my daughter mainly enjoyed watching Italian MTV). The breakfasts in the grotto below the main floor were relatively large (though not full service) and more than my daughter or I usually ate. My daughter also enjoyed that the hotel had a computer in the lobby/bar area for guest use, though there was a euro per 15 minute charge. We saw many staff members during our stay, and they were generally helpful and friendly. I particularly appreciate the services of one gentleman (whose name unfortunately I do not remember) who helped us tremendously when my daughter lost her wallet (though it was never found). The hotel is centrally located in a small piazza near the Campo di Fiori. We were able to walk to most sights, but the weather was hot, and we took a few taxis during the afternoons. The way to the hotel is off small alleys, and it took us a couple of days to go to and from without getting lost and needing our map.

We then had another key for the door that accesses the 4 rooms that the hotel owns. Well this is where the real awkward part begins. If you have climbed the inside of a duomo of a church you will get the picture right away. The door opens to a narrow marble staircase so if you have large luggage it will not be fun. Then you go up a bunch of stairs and there are 2 doors for rooms and then you turn and head up another flight and there is a room and then a few more stairs and down a tiny hall with a window and we were finally at our room. It was a corner room, very large with many windows, a huge bed and A/C. It was pretty quiet as well! The bathroom and closet area was large and for a romantic spot it was great.

My husband & I did plenty of research on a location and we thought this was the ideal spot to explore most of Rome by foot. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very polite gentleman who provided us with a speedy check-in, a good street map, practical information about safety (Rome is notorious for pickpockets) as well as information on restaurants and sightseeing. Our room was located on the 2nd floor just off of the main staircase/courtyard. The room and bathroom were a nice size and perfectly comfortable for our 4 night stay. The furniture is slightly outdated and the room could use a little modernization, but it was comfortable and the staff was knowledgable and friendly. They go out of there to take care of their guests, specifically when it comes to common sense safety. The bathrooms were a decent size and the shower was particularly large compared to two other hotels we stayed in during our trip to Italy. The only problem we had with the shower was the high water pressure. The water would stand at ankle length, so we adjusted the flow and that solved the problem. Just keep an eye on this as you may end up with an overflow. The hotel's ties to Roman history is evident and eating breakfast amongst the ruins or enjoying an espresso in the lobby is neat. The breakfast is substantial: coffee, pastries, cereal, cold cuts, fruit and etc...Each table is served by a pleasant waitress who brings fresh pots of coffee or tea to each table. It is a nice way to sit & enjoy a meal while planning a day of touring. It can be tricky locating it as it's tucked away, so it's a good idea to have some knowledge of the location before your arrival. We found the location on a map and showed it to our cab driver. Also, if traveling by taxi, be sure the driver turns the meter on. The hotel does provide transport to and from the airport for a fixed rate of 55 euros which we took advantage of on our departure. Be sure to book this prior to your arrival and to double check once you've checked in. The van picked us up at 6am and we were at the airport in 30 minutes. The hotel is located less than 5 minutes from Campo de'Fiori and 10-15 minutes from Piazza Navona and the Pantheon-all by foot. Piazza Navona was one of our favorite piazzas and we enjoyed the people-watching from one of the cafes. Campo de' Fiori is lively and it is interesting to visit both the market during the day as well as the active nightlife. We ate at La Carbonara one night (decent, but not exceptional food) and loved watching how the area transformed to a lively nightspot. Most of the major sites are no more than a 30 minute walk. The Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are less than 30 minutes. The Vatican is about 25 mintues as are the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. If you plan to spend an entire day at the Vatican it may be a good idea to take a cab there as you will be on your feet for along time. Be sure to bring a good pair of walking shoes as Rome is sprawling! The beauty of Rome is walking along those ancient cobblestone streets and coming across so much history. So much of the city is already familiar based on images we've seen throughout our lives that to actually be amongst it is exciting and worthwhile. We were able to visit everything within 3 days, but this could easily be accomplished in 2 with good planning. If you plan on traveling in the off-season (we were there in mid-November) be sure to check the hours of museums and other sites. They do reduce operating times and you will have to plan accordingly. There are a few restaurants that are worth checking out. The first would be Sergio Alla Grotto which is located just behind Campo de'Fiori. Since the weather was ideal during our entire time in Rome (it was in the 60's-70's) we enjoyed our meals outdoors. The tables are lined along the building with quaint checkered tablecloths. The place is filled with locals and is busy, but that makes all the difference in this city-if it's local, it's probably worthwhile. The food is tasty and the portions are large-we'd recommend their pasta or steak. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. Our next recommendation would be a restaurant just around the corner from the hotel called Grotto del Teatro di Pompeo. The owners are friendly and one in particular is a no nonsense woman who takes pride in her work. The meat, pasta and wine were tasty. It is a great people watching spot. Hotel Teatro di Pompeo is a nice place with reasonable rates. In our opinion it is in the perfect location for exploring the city.

I was surprised at the size of the room and bathroom. Of the three hotels, the shower here was the roomiest and had great water pressure. It seems many of the shower stalls in Italy are quite small for even average sized adults(ladies, shaving your legs can be tricky in some showers there but no problem at this hotel!) The room itself was quite large, but the mattress seemed a little old. The staff was very helpful and breakfast in the lower level (part of the original Theater of Pompeys) was sufficient and satisfying with fresh coffee, juices, cereal, meat, cheese, rolls,etc. It's very convenient to many shops and we found a supermarket nearby for wine, cheese, snacks.
