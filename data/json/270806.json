Hotel Noemi is incredibly close to San Marco plaza and only a short walk to Rialto bridge. The staff was amazing and incredibly helpful! When we arrived they actually upgraded us to a deluxe room when we had only reserved an economy. The room was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. Breakfast was served every morning by a very sweet hotel staff and she brought us great cappucinos! I'm actually quite shocked by some of the negative reviews of this place..yes you do have to climb stairs, but if you travel in Europe (especially Venice) you should be familiar with toting your luggage as many of the best places to stay here have character and are older! If you love hotels with character, great service, and location location location...this place is perfect for you! We will definitely recommend to our friends!

Location was perfect! The price was even better which made this hotel a winner. The room was nice, small, but that is common in Europe in general. The breakfast was the best! We stayed in many hotels in Italy during our two week visit and this was by far the most yummy and well stocked when compared to the others. However, read the fine print : Internet is only free for the first hour. I know we didn't come to Venice to be on the internet, but when it said free internet, you expect for it to be free, the entire time. We did bring our two dogs with us (1 medium and 1 large), they were not happy and did give us a hard time, but I emailed them before we booked and told them we were coming with dogs so it shouldn't have been a surprise when we showed up with them. Anyways, it ended up not being a big deal however, the staff were very rude to us the entire trip.

Overlooking this, we checked into our room, which was decorated very elegantly and what we had expected. However, later, we discovered that the sink leaked and the piece that held the shower head was broken and there were exposed wires when we used the hairdryer! This was unacceptable considering how much we were paying, compared to the other 3 star hotels that we had stayed at.

That is because you have to go up a flight a stairs to get to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main level. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the floor you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying on, otherwise you might be looking at another flight of stairs to climb with your luggage; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no elevator in the hotel. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re smart, you packed light in the first place since Venice is all stairs over bridges. I was lucky, one of the owners of the hotel was working at the desk when we arrived so he came down to help bring up our bags. Not that he was pleasant, but at least he helped with the bag. The hotel itself is tastefully decorated in traditional Renaissance feel, though given the tight space in Venice, everything is significantly narrower and smaller. That includes the room, which had no navigateable space to move around. We were in room 120, (220 Euro/night), which is right across from the reception check in desk and right off the breakfast area. Literally, the door of the room opened into the breakfast area. The breakfast was disappointing, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a really large selection and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really replenished wish any sort of urgency, so you basically would give up waiting for more and just make do with what was available, which was minimal meat and cheeses, croissants and minimal cereal options. There was no fresh fruit or pastry option, nor was the yogurt near edible. Surprisingly though, noise from the reception desk and breakfast areas weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue (at least for me). Our room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s window was right off the street below but the window didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let noise permeate through. As for the room, there was a wardrobe in front of us as soon as we walked into the room. Inside of the wardrobe was the safe with a key, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not electronic unfortunately. Having somewhere to unload some clothes was greatly appreciated since there was literally no space to open two small 23\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbags on the floor side by side. We propped one of the bags on the only available surface in the room, which was a chair for sitting. Instead it became a luggage tray! There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely enough room for a small console upon which they placed the tv and that took over the entire space, basically giving us nowhere to lay down your watch or purse or cell phone. Literally there was no room in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcroom.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 There was a bed and barely enough room to move around it. Small ledges were attached to the fabric covered walls to serve as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcside tables\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but trust me all they could hold was a cell phone. The bathroom had better lighting than what we had experienced elsewhere in Italy, but we encountered the same problem of lack of a ledge or sink space for leaving a hairbrush, makeup bag, or a toothbrush. Every day we had to pack up like we were leaving because there was nowhere to leave our stuff spread out. The shower in the hotel was painfully small. Literally PAINFULLY small because I kept bumping my elbows into the glass and the shower door frame. I could only lift one arm at a time to shampoo my hair, which was awkward, uncomfortable and painful at times. Certainly because the room was so small and the shower space was so minimal, we both inevitable kept bumping around the corners in the room. The bed/bedroom was clean but the tight confines were frustrating. There was a Sri Lankan man working in the late evenings, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember his name, but he was extremely nice and chatty. The best part of Hotel Noemi is certainly the proximity to San Marco. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right around the corner from the Piazza, which is great because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where most of the attractions in Venice are. That being said, next time I visit Venice, I will definitely stay either in Dorsoduro or on Lido where the actual Venetians live because San Marco is crushed with tourists, it basically only exists to service them.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing and cozy in the heart of the action\u201d", "Author": "Fokissed", "ReviewID": "UR114434104", "Content": "This was an amazing place to stay for our first trip to Italy, we stayed for the first 5 days here and the location was excellent.

And so in the beginning this smell was making me sober as liquid ammonia, constantly reminding of itself - but after a while you start to find it awesome.... Well, so what I was talking about+ about the hotel: a friend of mine advised it to me and after arrival to Venice - I gave at once the cut-away with the hotel's address to the taxi driver and have shortly said \"Via\"+ half an hour of admiring the city from the car's window and here we are: entering the hotel you can hear polite \"Bon Jorno\" and a nice sincere smile, my suitcases were in the room immediately and I just could hardly thrust some euro tips to the porter though he refused flatly to take it, explaining that everything's \"bene\"... My friend's stories that I can be transferred to the Middle Ages for some time have justified on all of 100 % - a huge classical bed, the Venetian mirrors and the plasma panels with frameworks - in general the interior's in Medici's style, but with all delights of the present. It's located literally two steps away from San Marko square, and coming back in the evenings you can feel yourself so much citizen of this amazing old city that approaching the hotel after walk - it would be desirable to get keys out of your pocket from the door of the palazzo and to open it, I've become so related with this hotel as I felt myself being its part. There was faultless service and cleanliness that was not always met even in Turkey which is famous for the service. I advise to everybody who wants for a short while to plunge into the Middle Ages, without feeling thus any discomfort - it is romantic, beautiful and it's somehow refined in a home-style!!!", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "berlin", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay on walk distance to San Marco\u201d", "Author": "oculus_film", "ReviewID": "UR58364472", "Content": "This lovely hotel next to San Marco offered our crew a good rest after a hard-working day shooting a documentary in the Cathedral and a even better start in the morning with the delicious home made brakfast served in a beatiful breakfast room.

We payed the other hotel and stayed at Noemi with the initial prize. Except the discomfort they caused, the room that we stayed had two single beds with seperated mattresses, collided and not a double bed as we had reserved. The room was clean and nice decorated, but rather small. The bath was also clean, but the bathing foam that they were providing was hardly enough for one shower per day.

Set in an excellent location, just 40 seconds or so from St Mark's Square, this is the best and best-located small hotel I've stayed in in this wonderful city. Newly refurbished, clean and elegant with a mix of old and new, this tiny boutique-style hotel comes highly recommended. The staff / manager were professional and friendly; the in-room facilities (shower, flat screen TV, air con) seemed new and were good, and the windows are aluminium framed double-glazing, which not only look good but ensure any noise from the street below is kept to a minimum if not shut out altogether. The breakfast room is small, however, and we had to wait about, ooh, two minutes for a table to become available. For the sake of accuracy I guess I should report that there was a minimal amount of refurbishment work being carried out during our short stay; these were minimal, only to the communal areas and works were not carried out after office hours, so at no point we were inconvenienced in any way whatever. This work appeared to be the final stage of refurbishment. I don't know what it was like before, but the Noemi is now a rather charming and plush little hotel. As for a location, it's hard to beat. I'd have said it's a hidden gem. A word about getting to the Noemi: the hotel website advises you to alight from the vaporetto (water bus) at the Rialto stop (assuming you're travelling down the Grand Canal from the train station) and take a little (even by Venice standards) side street called Calle Bembo, which is the third turning on the left as you walk away from the Rialto Bridge. (Please note, however, that when searching for Calle Bembo, Google Maps came up with another street of the same name elsewhere in the city, so make sure you get the right one!). This tiny alleyway is easy to miss (we did), so just remember that it's directly after a footbridge on the main sidewalk. Then you just follow the lane as it crosses small openings and squares, even when it becomes known by other names. Just when you're starting to think you've missed it, that's when you'll see it. This is the quickest way, but one could stay on board the vaporetto until close to St Mark's Square as the hotel is much close to this point, but the extra time the vaporetto takes ploughing slowly along the Grand Canal makes this option prohibitively long. Perhaps only choose this option if you have a lot of luggage?
