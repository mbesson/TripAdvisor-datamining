Most of us had our own rooms, but I shared a 2 Bedroom/2 Bath Suite with one friend. Not only did we each have total privacy, but the price was only $50 more than the 1 Bedroom or Studio, making it a huge deal when you split it. The hotel is about a block away from the Lake Union Trolley, which takes you to the heart of downtown in just a few minutes for the bargain price of $2.50 (which we had much confusion about whether we really needed to pay, since no one checks tickets). Our room didn't face the lake or anything, but it was quiet and had the usual amazingly comfortable Marriott bed. (And all of the rooms have balconies, which is nice to get some fresh air, even without a view) The complimentary breakfast was definitely up to Residence Inn standards with a waffle station and eggs plus rotating side dishes daily. The free WiFi is not the fastest in the world, but it was consistent and is free. We did not use the overnight parking. My only complaint is the front desk staff seems poorly trained and not as customer-focused as I have experienced in other Residence Inns or Marriott Properties as a rule.

With the standard elements of predictable architecture, decor and inclusive breakfast done quite well, the enhancements are a marvelous view of Lake Union (a much appreciated upgrade) and great location for exploring all that funky Seattle has to offer. The benefits are that the room rates are competitive and certainly better than the overpriced and bloated full amenity hotels up the street. The frontdesk staff are helpful and efficient if not over-friendly. Downsides are that the underground parking is a complete rip-off. There is only very limited overnight street parking and a near construction zone limits this further. So the $28 per night incl tax charge was both exhorbitant and entirely unjustifiable. (And to add insult we had the tire caps stolen off our car in the garage overnight.) The \"fitness center\" equipment is a little tired and worn but sufficient.

We have stayed at the Courtyard and it is not the same caliber. We actually pass right by it with the dog on our morning runs around the lake. It looks tired compared to the Residence. The trolley also run right outside the door at the Residence, for the quick trip downtown without having to hassle with parking. There is great food steps from the hotel, some right on the lake.

The hotel has their breakfast bar and evening snack and wine tastings which are better than average, but for a great breakfast head up Eastlake to Louisa's Bakery and Cafe.

The bedroom had a huge king bed with the softest mattress cover and a large flat screen tv. The living room was also very large and had a pull out sofa and chair with another large (I think about 42') flat screen tv, a balcony with a view of the lake and a nice size kitchen with a full size refigerator and a dishwasher. Breakfast was served every morning and there was a huge selection. Now granted, it's not the ritz and it was very carb-heavy as some people had mentioned but it is, afterall, free.

The people who were working at the breakfast buffet didn't stop and there was NO texting whatsoever which, as a traveler, is a nice relief since we often see that.

The room was clean and well appointed with everything we needed, and there were no gross, never-cleaned bed spreads which was awesome! Beds were very comfortable and had many pillows of different softness and support levels. Internet was accessible and easy to use. We were able to have friends come visit for dinner and there was plenty of room and seating for everyone. The trolly was very conveniently located and easy to get to. The pool has a hot tub and a kiddie pool, the one minor complaint was that the pool was a bit on the chilly side. The included breakfast was great! Fresh eggs, a waffle bar, oatmeal, fruit, cereal..something for everyone and very tasty. The seating area was very clean and comfortable with a nice water feature for ambiance. Also, the weather cooperated, I am sure the hotel arranged this. :) Overall an excellent stay and we will definitely be back and recommend this to family and friends.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "World Traveler", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sjoconn", "ReviewID": "UR120646711", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay here.

Had an issue with the parking, below is part of my email to Marriott. I initially bid on a one night stay, after successfully winning the bid I was prompted to extend my stay. I was happy to do so after reviewing the location of the hotel, the free breakfast and most importantly the free parking. Because of the two separate reservations, I had to re-check in again for the second night, no big deal. When checking in for the second night I was asked if we had a car with us, which we did. We were informed of the 23 dollar parking fee. I mentioned to the front desk clerk, that it might be on file that I have an email from my successful bid that clearly states the parking was free. (We had the same issue the first night of check in, but I just showed my email and the free parking was granted) The front desk manager Jill took note of the situation and jumped in. Saying very loudly, \u201cNo, NO, NO! You Priceline People do NOT get free parking, never!\u201d It was a little embarrassing to us, that we were being referred to, actually we were being yelled at for using Priceline for our reservation. We mentioned the free parking was one of our main reasons for extending our stay for two nights. Again we were reminded that us \u201cPriceline People\u201d do not ever get free parking . I asked if I should run up and get my phone (which had the email indicating free parking) to which Jill replied at a much louder voice than was required (since I was right in front of her) \u201cyeah, but it won\u2019t do you any good, Priceline People never ever get free parking.\u201d And then something to the effect of \u201cI\u2019d like to see this email\u201d. As I walked away to get my phone and my wife waited nearby, Jill continued to rant about the situation right in front of my wife as if she wasn\u2019t standing there. This was getting very embarrassing for the both of us as there were lots of customers around because the morning breakfast was just wrapping up. I returned with my iPhone, showed the email, free parking was granted, although not without a few extra snarky comments from Jill. No apology, no thanks for being patient, no sorry for the confusion, nothing. Also, worth noting that we were put into a room without a balcony, not sure if that was further punishment for using Priceline. It clearly indicates online that all rooms have a private balcony. If your hotel wants to treat Priceline guest different than other guests, you should probably not make your hotel available to be booked through Priceline.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Deep South", "Title": "\u201cNot bad but not great either!

This was our first days on a two week trip and we stayed 3 nights in this location. As we travel frequently as two couples, the two bedroom suites available at Residence Inns make a very convenient and economical choice of lodging for us.We found the Seattle stay to be both positive and negative. I'll start with the negative so I can end on the more positive side of the stay. To start, we tried to check in early (about 1:30 in the afternoon on Saturday) and were informed our room was not ready yet; this was quite understandable as the start of check in was listed for 4:00, but the front desk clerk asked for my cell phone number and said they would call when the room was available. So we proceeded to go downtown to the Pike Market. At about 3:30 I was called and informed our room was ready. We stayed about 20 more minutes at the market and then returned to the hotel. We got back to the Residence Inn at about 4:15 and tried to check in only to be informed that the room was not ready yet. I said that I had been called and told our room was ready and could read on the list we were supposed to be in a certain room number but the room we ended up with was a different number. I am sure that they had given the other room to somebody else that had arrived between the time we had been called and we had gotten back to the hotel. DON'T CALL IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SAVE THE ROOM! The next problem arose right after check in when I tried to park the vehicle in parking garage. The vehicle we had was a full size SUV, but not the largest size one. The parking lot (supposedly made for larger vehicles) was almost filled and only about three spaces were left, and all were extremely small. I had to make 8 maneuvers to get the vehicle in the space, and all the passengers had to get out before getting into the space because you could not open the doors of the vehicle once you were parked. I had to climb out of the back hatch door once I was parked! I know that the hotel probably has to have a minimum number of parking spots under law,but come on lets expand the size of these spaces so people can actually park and get out of their vehicle! The room itself was good size, comfortable, and very functional, but the chairs and the ottoman were quite worn. On the positive side I thought the beds were comfortable. The gym was clean, had good equipment, and was well stocked with towels. The complimentary breakfast was very good and the atrium was large enough to accommodate the large crowd at breakfast. We were busy seeing the sites of Seattle so we never got to partake in the receptions held in the early evenings at the hotel. After the initial problem with the room, the front desk personnel were quite helpful and knowledgeable. The best thing of all was the convenient location especially the trolley stop right in front of the hotel which made getting downtown a breeze especially since once parked I did not want to move the vehicle again.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cGreat room and very comfortable.\u201d", "Author": "phoenixgirl2", "ReviewID": "UR120047447", "Content": "I was so happy to be able to stay here as the location was pretty great.

First of all, this is not your typical Residence Inn. It most apparently was not built as a Residence Inn and is somewhat larger than your typical Residence Inn. There is a large atrium lobby, and the staff / facility could handle the larger crowds at mealtime (breakfasts / evening \"receptions\" several nights per week). The only less than exceptional aspect of the hotel was the room servicing, where as a result of what both the front desk and we considered to be a \"language\" issue, our room was not serviced one day. We also found stick pins on the floor from a previous guest, and we did not have toiletries restocked one day. Other than that, the experience was very good. Front desk staff were helpful, and polite, but efficient. Of note, I was not acknowledged as an elite member of Marriott Rewards. We were in room 510, overlooking Fairview Avenue. With the balcony door open, the street noise was noticeable, but otherwise, street noise was not a problem, although during daytime hours, the street is fairly heavily traveled. The location is exceptional - although one big warning on that - see below. The location is about one mile north of downtown Seattle. In the immediate vicinity is South Lake Union Park and a number of reasonably upscale restaurants. To get a cheaper meal, one would have to walk a bit. There is excellent public transport immediately in front of the hotel - both the streetcar and the 70-73 bus lines (at least one line is running at all times, with frequent service to both downtown and the University of Washington). It is also possible and apparently safe to walk from the hotel to the center of Seattle (we did it multiple times in daylight without any worries - note that two blocks of Terry north of Denny do not have sidewalks - use Westlake instead). It is also a reasonably flat route - particularly on Westlake. Note also that the streetcar does not run very late into the evening many nights, if you plan an evening in downtown Seattle. The hotel would make an exceptionally good choice for a long term stay for a family of a cancer patient at the neighboring Fred Hutchinson Cancer Care Center or someone relocating to one of the nearby large employers. As much as we enjoyed our stay, I must warn of upcoming construction closures for the Mercer Corridor Project. Check progress on www.seattle.gov and then search for Mercer Corridor Project. For those planning on using an automobile to venture out from the Residence Inn, check the site for planned closures. The detour routes make staying in downtown Seattle or an outlying area a more viable choice, in my view. Also, check for bus detours / route changes / stop changes. In my limited experience with some bus stop changes at the University of Washington, King County Metro does a reasonable job of placing signs at the affected stops, but does not update their web site (that I could tell). This construction will continue into 2013.

There is both a streetcar stop and a bus stop right outside the hotel, which was critical for me since I was on foot and by public transport only this trip.

Pool, sauna, exercise room all in good condition. Manager's reception Monday through Wednesday, nice, but they hit you up for donations if you want beer or wine, which I thought was tacky. No airport shuttle to this location, but you can hire a car from the airport or, for the brave and fit, lug your luggage on the Metro and then hire a car from the station. The front desk is staffed largely with bland twentysomethings who are friendly but will not go out of their way. It's important to keep asking if you want something. Example: Several times I needed to find the right bus route (Seattle transit, God love 'em, was frequently out of route maps.) The staff has access to Google maps and is typically happy to print them for you and was good about doing that -- if you get the right staff member. One morning, I asked the correct route for the U-District. The first twentysomething I asked said she wasn't familiar with the bus system but I could go into the business center and Google the info. I changed lines at the desk and the second clerk immediately offered to print me a Google map. So, keep asking. Most of the staff is very good, but again, the desk is staffed by kids making probably $8 an hour and appear to have no supervision. They do excellent work considering all that. Don't let them tell you that the Space Needle is within walking distance. The way they tell you is only if you want to walk through heavy construction and folks asking for money.

I was in Seattle to visit friends that were in the Navy and to do a little business. While the Residence Inn was a little higher in price than I would like for it to have been, I thought it would be a nice trade-off since there is free breakfast,a few free dinner receptions, a full kitchen, a laundry room, and free Internet. So, I would stay here again, but have lower expectations as to food quality. So, the positives: (1) Good location- it is about an mile walk to the City center with the Space Needle and museums. Two to three minute walk to the trolley which will take you downtown for $2.50 and then walking distance easily down Pine to Pike Place Market. (2) The kitchen cuts down on costs- can bring leftivers back or pick up groceries. There is a Whole Foods on the trolley stop back to the hotel (Denny). (3) The wired Internet was quite speedy which helped for work (I brought an Etnernet cable but there was one hanging in the closet), (4) Good sized laundry room and you can get change at the front desk,and (5) Excellent service by the front desk employees. The two negatives: (1) The food was adequate. I was not expecting high quality, but this was by far the worst food I have had at a Residence Inn. If they have to cook it, it is not very good. Stay with muffins, toast or bagel, etc. The OJ was like orange colored water. and (2) The lake view I paid extra for was not much of a lake view- think partially obstructed view. Overall, I would stay here again, but would know that I would need to bring in more stuff to eat.

Well, either my standards have gone way up over time (which is very possible), my memory is more generous than this location deserves (definitely likely), or the place has just seen better days. There was nothing particularly \"bad\" about our stay, just nothing that knocked our socks off or convinced us that we should come back anytime soon. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with king sized beds and a fold out couch in the living room, so there was plenty of space for our group of four adults. Breakfast was good with an adequate selection of fruit, cereal, muffins, pastries, eggs, and sausage, but whoever's in charge of food service has committed a cardinal sin for any hotel in Seattle: the coffee was intolerably weak four days running, even the brew that was billed as the \"dark blend.\" I must confess that, perhaps, my review is biased by the fact that there were SO MANY guests at the hotel with dogs in tow. I love dogs and have three back home, but it is a pet peeve of mine (no pun intended) when folks insist upon traveling with them and staying in hotels. Thank goodness, I suppose, that there are good hotels who accommodate travelers with dogs, but if this is a problem for you this is definitely not your place. I also agree with a previous review regarding this hotel's high ranking among Seattle hotels. It is quite definitely NOT the 14th best hotel in Seattle.

My wife and I, our 15 year old daughter, and my wife's parents stayed in a 2-bedroom suite which was very comfortable. One room had a king bed and the other had 2 queens. Additionally the sofa bed was quite comfortable according to my daughter, who chose it over the queen bed in order to have her own space (and TV). Having 2 bathrooms was also a big asset for the 5 of us. The kitchenette was small but fine for us. We didn't do any cooking, just heated up leftovers, made coffee, and kept drinks in the fridge (icemaker was nice to have). The living room area was comfortable for all of us to sit around in the evening, with a comfortable chair and sofa, plus the 4 chairs in the kitchenette. We did not have a lake view or balcony but I didn't consider that a downside. We did have a rental car (a minivan), and did not really find the size of parking spaces to be a problem. I was able to drive to the back of the level for full size cars (there are 2 entrances and it appeared 2 different levels), and find plenty of spaces. I will admit that it is a bit of a challenge dealing with the concrete support pillars (which were really more of an issue than the width of the space), but it is possible to park a large vehicle here. I do feel that the cost for parking in their deck is high, but it was a secure lot, only accessible using the hotel keycard. We had barbeque food for the manager's reception (only Wednesday, since it is only done Mon-Wed), and the food was quite good, especially considering it was free. Breakfast was also very good, and we considered this one of the important factors in choosing this hotel). We rented a car to make getting around simpler, but the Seattle traffic (especially at rush hour), bizarre intersections (I counted 7 streets coming together at one place), layers of roads (which confused the GPS or at least my understanding of it!), and parking cost made this less than enjoyable. However, since 2 of our group can not walk very far at a time, we felt this was a better choice for us than using public transport. In a different situation, I would probably go with public transport (or even walk - Seattle Center and its attractions would be walkable). Laundry facilities at the hotel were quite nice and reasonably priced. The room was kept at a reasonable temperature and both washer (30 minutes) and dryer (60 minutes) were one dollar. We also enjoyed the hot tub (except for one night when it was closed due to an \"accident\" in the water :), and my daughter went into the pool, although it was a bit chilly for my taste. There is a nice pool with dept from 3-6 feet, and a smaller separate wading pool. The fitness center was also nicely equipped. One downside of this hotel was that there were no restaurants to speak of within a short distance (especially for walking). However, we were offered menus for a number of restaurants offering delivery. We discovered a very nice pizza at Pagliacci's, which had pepperoni from Salumi's. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful whenever called on. Everything was very clean. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. For a group like ours, the 2 bedroom suite was a great deal compared to 2 separate rooms at other hotels.

The rooms are nice - exactly as they are in the photos. In fact I think most rooms are identical down to the decorations. Noise: I had a 1 bedroom on the backside of the building on the 6th floor. I looked out on office buildings, a play area for a daycare, I5, etc. Not super scenic but quiet, which was much more important to me than a good view. I didn't hear any of my neighbors the entire time and I know it was sold out at least two of the weekends I was there. Despite being above the atrium I never heard the breakfast crowd noise. Cleanliness: The place was spotless with clean sheets and towels. My room had a dishwasher and the houskeeping staff would run it if they saw I had used a number of things. Comfort: The couch was a weird chaise lounge type thing, but otherwise the funiture was great. The bed has a pillowtop which was a little soft for my taste (and I probably only noticed it because I was there for so long). The king bed is huge, so it was a lovely change from my bed at home. Exercise Facilities: The work out room is well equipped with towels, water, weights, machines, treadmills and eliplicals. I never had to wait to use anything. I did not use the sauna or the pool/hot tub but lots of people seemed to be enjoying them. Service: The staff were fine - not super friendly but also not in my business. When I needed more hangars they were brought up promptly. I thought after 3 weeks they might have started to recognize me coming and going. They didn't, but its no big deal. They were there when I needed them which is the important part. Location: It is within walking distance to downtown or an easy bus or streetcar ride. To get to other areas of the city you will want a car or taxi. I had to either walk about 1/4 of a mile to a bus to take an express bus (309) to work or take two buses (I work on First Hill at Harborview) to get there. The neighborhood feels safe. It is THE up and coming neighborhood of Seattle. There is a lot of money being spent on new offices and condos to house Microsoft/Gates Foundation/Amazon yuppies. Once the Mercer Street construction is done it will be way more walkable. If you are looking for a hotel on the lake this is not it--the lake is across a very busy street and behind many businesses. Unless you are renting a houseboat you will not find anyplace actually on the lake. Parking: Parking is very, very tight. I drive a 95 Honda Civic and I fit neatly and snuggly in the spots. They seem to have a seperate garage for SUVs but there were a number of larger cars parked in my garage too. The car got dinged/scratched on the door from someone parking too close/not paying attention. A lot of the cars were rentals so I don't think people were as careful opening doors as they are in their own cars. My car is not new and already has dings so it was not a huge deal but if you care about that you might be best on the street or in the SUV lot. Food: The breakfast buffet was great! Healthy and not healthy options everyday. I have stayed at a lot of hotels that offer \"continental breakfast\". This is a serious buffet breakfast. Mon-Wed there is a \"managers reception\" with food and (on Wednesdays) beer and wine. It varied from hot dogs and potato salad to a nice selectionof greek food to BBQ. Not super healthy, but free. And if you are exhausted and don't feel like cooking yourself dinner it is a great benefit. Internet: the wifi is free after you accept their terms (check a box). The wifi was fast and never went dow the entire time. TV: my room had a TV in both rooms with a nice picture and limited cable channels. Value: the rooms are not cheap and parking is $20/night.

Also directly across the street from the hotel are numerous seafood restaurants right on Lake Union. We ate at Joey's one night and C (something) the next night. Both were excellent. The hotel is less than five minutes to downtown and ten minutes by car to Pike's Market. Reasons the hotel didn't get five stars. Like most properties, their fitness facilities were only okay. Two Life Fitness ellipticals, two treadmills, and a few free weights. There is a very nice 24 Hour Fitness at 1827 Yale Street, approximately five minutes away by car. Their \"evening food\" was plentiful; however they only serve it Monday through Wednesday; what is up with that?? And they only offered beer and wine on Tuesday. Also, during rush hour from downtown this hotel takes a while to get to with a lot of traffic trying to get on I-5. Non-rush hour is a breeze. Staff is very friendly which is always a plus.

We then caught the seattle street car on the corner of west lake and olive (it's on the ground level, right in front of Bank of America in case you get lost), That took us almost directly to the Residence Inn (get off at Lake Union Park or the one right after it). Right across the street they have boat rentals and a lot of other water activities. You can rent kayaks up at the University of Washington if you have a car for pretty cheap. We hit up the Theo Chocolate Factory tour which a must (not even a chocolate guy, but they have the best stuff ever). You can technically walk from the hotel to downtown (we walked at around 7pm to the whole foods downtown and felt perfectly safe) but it's a bit of a trek. The food they serve for lunch and breakfast was really good, better than most residence inns. The pool area was well kept and huge compared to most in the city. They really have a top notch hotel here, and this is the best value you can get in the city.

The hotel has a trolley car that stops a few steps away that takes you into the downtown area for a minimal fee, and is just across from Lake Union, which is a great place to walk, and was being improved at the time of our stay with more walking areas, benches, lake-front viewing, etc. There are sea planes you can watch taking off and landing all day-very cool.

They kept our luggage for us while we were gone for 5 days which allowed us to pack light to Vancouver rather than lugging all the cases with us (other hotels we had called refused to keep luggage in storage for longer than 1 day). The location couldn\u2019t have been more perfect! Streetcar line starts & ends across the road and you can catch one every 15 mins. Buses go by frequently too. Easy to get to downtown yet being abit out of the way from the noise & bustle. We got 2 different room-types and both had lovely terraces with lake views to enjoy the weather, a cup of coffee and watch the float planes take off & land on the lake. It was also convenient for us to take the Argosy Locks tour which leaves from Lake Union \u2013 a 7 minute walk to the dock from the hotel. The Center / Museum for Wooden boats is a 3-minute walk away which is worth the visit and around the corner are the old fire boats, tugs, Historic Steamship Virginia V and also the dock where you take the Ice cream boat (popular for families with kids) and the Queen of Seattle paddle boat. Lots to do & see in this area! Hot morning breakfast was enjoyable as well as the little market stand to grab a beer, snacks or soup at anytime day or night. Although the hotel has no restaurant to serve lunch or dinner, you do not miss this. There are loads of restaurants right across the road including great seafood at Duke\u2019s Chowderhouse. The popular \u2018I Love Sushi\u2019 restaurant is also on the marina \u2013 just a 2-minute walk. There\u2019s an Outback steakhouse just 1 set of traffic lights walk away as well.

There is no convenience or grocery store in the immediate (easy walking) area. Across the street is the Center for Wooden Boats and there will soon be a large park to enjoy. The street car and bus stops are located on the same block as the hotel and go directly into downtown. Only a couple blocks up Valley/Roy is Bucca di Beppo Italian restaurant which has amazing food. We try and go each time we are in Seattle (reservations are highly recommended!). And while not the most scenic walk (you have to walk along a very busy highway)it is within a reasonable walk of the Seattle Center (Space Needle).

I used them a few times as I was travelling on business and it come in handy to go and get some wine and beer which wasnt within walking distance. They waited for me to come back and stood out the front to make sure I was ok when I was in there. The hotel does a breakfast of which I couldnt comment on as we just didnt get time to try it out. They also have laundry facilites which were great and not expensive compared to Australia. They have a gym and indoor heated pool also - we didnt use them but looked to be very nice and adequate. I would thoroughly recommend this property, especially if you are needing a bit of space. Dont discount the fact they arent in the middle of downtown Seattle, it is easy to get around, the people of Seattle we found so friendly and helpful, there are loads of eating options and it is very clean and comfortable.

It only took us about 5 minutes to get to the main waterfront by car. The room was very clean and the bed was so comfortable (which is important to us). Another important fact was it was super quiet. No noise from the outside (traffic) or from the inside (hallway or other rooms). The bathroom was very clean and well laid out. The breakfast buffet was nice, which was pretty basic for a Residence Inn. We did not partake in the managers reception on Wednesday, but it looked nice. The only negative comment is you have to pay for parking (which you have to anywhere in Seattle), but the parking is under the hotel, which I assume would be owned by the hotel. The parking was $19 a day, plus a $3 tax on top of that (which we did not know about). There are several restaurants around the hotel, which were pretty pricey.

One even wrote a thank you note for the daily tip we left. There's an area in the lobby where you can buy soup, frozen entrees, cereal, beverages, etc. or they'll do the grocery shopping for you if you give them a list(for a fee, I'm sure).

I arrived on a Saturday at 3 PM after 11 hours of travel, and the desk clerk cheerfully informed me the room wasn't ready. Check-in is at 4 PM (astoundingly late, I thought). She suggested I kill some time enjoying the sights (and traffic?) of downtown Seattle while I waited. I've seen Seattle. No thanks. I was tired and irritable. I opted to simmer with my frustration in the \"TV Lounge\" just off the lobby. However, within 20 minutes the room was ready, and I was on the way to a really nice week-long stay. Although I prefer the Marriott Waterfront Seattle for sheer luxury, I chose the Residence Inn to take advantage of the space, cooking, laundry and other extended-stay amenities. The hotel is located on the southern shore of Lake Union about 15 minutes from the UW campus and next door to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Tram and bus stops are right in front of the hotel, so even without a car, you can get just about anywhere in and around central Seattle easily. Parking in the hotel's underground garage is $19/night, although this drops to $7 for stays of over 30 days. I had stayed here about six years ago, and I was pleased to find the Residence Inn has been refurbished recently. The place is huge with seven floors and over 230 suites, 40 of which are two-bedroom units. I believe most, if not all suites, have small balconies. Each features a kitchen with a two-burner cook tops, a microwave, a large refrigerator, and a dishwasher. A small dining table divides the kitchen from the living area with a couch (fold-out bed), easy chair, flat-screen TV, coffee table, and computer desk. Internet is free in each room. My suite had a large master bedroom with king-size bed and another TV as well as an adjacent dressing area and bathroom with shower and tub. Breakfast is complimentary. On Sunday and Monday morning, the kitchen simply could not keep up with the demand, and finding edible morsels was like harvesting after a swarm of locusts had passed. However, most of the time it was no problem. Seating is throughout the central atrium, which can be noisy, although you can take your food back to your room, of course. Wednesday night features a manager's reception with tasty food from one of the local eateries. While I was there, Azteca featured Mexican food at the reception with a cash bar. Coffee and tea are free and are on 24/7. The Residence Inn offers grocery shopping service if you can't find your way to one of the local supermarkets. Also, there are frozen and freeze-dried foods and other staples available for purchase in the lobby. Many good restaurants ring Lake Union, too, so you should never be without a decent choice for a meal, even if you have to walk a few blocks or take a short taxi ride. Staff are universally friendly, and housekeeping appears to be quite efficient, despite my initial thoughts. Each day the housekeeper arrived at my room promptly between 9 and 9:30 AM, so I had to shoo her away on a couple of occasions. The Residence Inn at Lake Union is an ideal hotel for short or long stays, particularly for independent travelers and those with families, pets, or special needs. You can save a lot by not dining out every night, and given the level of comfort, I think this hotel rates among one of the best values in Seattle.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Lake Union Residence Inn\u201d", "Author": "Rocklover19", "ReviewID": "UR20917352", "Content": "My family of 3 spent 5 nights here in August.

The hotel is busy and sometimes elevators and such are slow due to this but while the hotel was quite full, we never heard our neighbors (the lobby was a buzz but the rooms were quiet). We had a room that faced the back (not the lake) but this was fine and quiet. The lake side actually is along a fairly busy street so it has a little more noise but you get the views of the marinas, seaplanes, etc. I ran one morning along the lake which was great and I felt safe (and saw other runners out). Of course exercise caution since it\u2019s a mix of nice residential, commercial, industrial and some transient all in the area but overall you should be fine to walk to local places, etc. They gym has decent equipment (but not a lot of it). A couple treadmills, a couple elliptical\u2019s, one bike and some weights (barbells and a universal weight machine). The gym area is small and gets crowded and a little stuffy (indoor right by the pool) but if you go off \u2013hours you should have no problem. They have an indoor pool and spa which is great for the kids and have adult only swimming hours also (later in the evening). The breakfast is extensive but busy. There are also some great restaurants within walking distance offering all kinds of cuisine and many with outdoor patios onto the lake. Nothing beats having a drink or bite on the lake front on a sunny day in Seattle.

I especially loved the flat screen TV in both the lounge and bedroom, and the full size fridge which allowed us to shop at the Safeway (about 2 miles away) and stock up on some comfort food and drinks during our four night stay. The furnishings were all new or meticulously maintained, and the signature Marriott bedding was exceptionally comfortable was one would expect. I slept well in this hotel, and put it down to the warm red color feature wall behind the bed, and the blackout curtains. It was even inviting to crawl back into the bed for an afternoon nap! The only thing I found to be a negative with the hotel was the nightly USD19 parking fee - yes I understand a lot of hotels charge a fee, but this hotel is not truly \"downtown\" and non secure lots in the area charge around USD10 per day. Perhaps it is something the hotel could consider including as part of the rate. The hotel is apparently undergoing rennovation - we could see some plastic sheeting up on the first floor, but we were never bothered by dust or noise.

Last time I didn't have a car but found it easy to get around - there are buses nearby (you can use Google's transit site for easy mapping of routes from, say, King Street Station - Amtrak - to the hotel) and now there's a tram that runs from almost in front of the hotel into downtown. But you can walk to Seattle Center, Queen Anne, etc. or even downtown very easily if you are in good walking shape. This time I had a car and had remembered street parking was free - but if it was before, now all parking on streets adjacent to the hotel is pay-to-park, with \"parking machines.\" As of this writing it's 75 cents/hour (cheaper than elsewhere in Seattle) and there are 10-hour spots adjacent to the hotel where you can park all day (free Sundays and holidays). But you have to get out there at 8am to pay for that day's parking. Next time I'd probably park in the lot for $20/night, given the last reviewer's observation that car windows had been smashed (there was still broken glass on the street when I parked there a few weeks later). But you don't really need a car if you are staying here and limiting yourself to the core Seattle sites, if you use the tram and bus or walk to things, use the occasional taxi.

Every staff person we met was very friendly and accommodating. Though we didn't book a \"view room\" (more expensive), we were upgraded when we arrived and our boys enjoyed watching the boats and seaplanes on the lake and the streetcar down below. We took full advantage of the kitchen as well as the robust continental breakfast. Our room on the 5th floor hadn't been renovated yet but was very comfortable and clean. The king bed was so comfortable, with a nice variety of pillows. We got a rollaway bed for our oldest son and even that bed was comfortable - often rollaways are of the fold up variety and are miserable to sleep on. This was an actual twin bed on wheels with the same linens and comfortable pillows as our bed. The hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant (no room service) but several restaurants (like Outback) offer delivery. The restaurants in the area are either seafood (across the street) or chain restaurants (outback, bucca de beppo). Belltown, with many cool local restaurants and coffee shops, is an easy drive or a 20 minute walk. Since our boys wake up really early (5 a.m.), we really liked the fact that the pool opens at 5 a.m. It was a way to keep the kids occupied and away from the room so that we didn't disturb other guests who were probably sleeping. There is a deep pool, a small kids pool (3 ft) a dry sauna and a hot tub. We opted to park on the street behind the hotel - the meter costs about $10 for the whole day as opposed to $20 in the hotel garage. The area around the hotel is all commercial (a public storage, cancer treatment center, day care center) so the streets were completely empty on the weekend. That's great for finding parking but probably not so great for security purposes. The Saturday night we were there, all the cars parked on the street had their windows shattered - probably about 12 cars in total. We just happened to be at a friend's house on Saturday night so our car wasn't hit. I have no idea what the hotel did for the owners of the cars. The neighborhood seems fine and this was probably just an unfortunate aberration. Obviously, if we stayed here again we would opt to pay for the garage. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, especially families. Having a kitchen is a great way to save money on lunches or dinners and it's also nice to have two separate rooms so that the kids can go to sleep and the adults can stay up a bit later.

Almost without exception, our hotels were real winners, with a couple real gems, and just one clunker. And no one had to sleep on the floor. As it turned out, the Residence Inn Seattle/Lake Union was a very nice place to start our vacation. The location was good -- close to Interstate 5, but close to downtown Seattle as well. It was easy to grab a cab downtown (didn't want to hassle finding a place to park our rental car). We had a spacious and clean 2-bedroom suite on a high floor. Nice and quiet -- just the way I like it. Only negatives were that we had a south-facing room -- over an industrial building and away from Lake Union (would have enjoyed a lake view much better) -- and the hotel's parking lot was hard to get in and out of with our humongous GMC Yukon XL rental car, and hard to find spaces later in the day (we ended up parking on the street because all the spaces were filled).
