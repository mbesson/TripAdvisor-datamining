Natalie - the reception lady - was a wonderful host, she helped me with instructions how to reach different places (including Cevahir mall :)) ). I arrived early in the morning, well before check-in time and I left after check-out time.

It was my first trip to Istanbul, only 2 days stopover, together with friends. The hotel location couldn't be better. Very close to the most beautiful and famous heritage sites (all in walking distance), convenient to reach from the airport, close to nice restaurants but still quite and a fabulous seaview. The rooms are very nice and convenient. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We felt rather like being family members than hotel guests. Already the reservation process was great. Answers came quick and very helpful and very friendly and personall. Once arrived, everything was well organized. The breakfast was wonderful - amazing variety for a small hotel with only 10 rooms. Fresh and delicious with local specialities. You have to try the homemade cookies! In the morning we got a lot of useful hints for our sightseeing tour. And the restaurant recommendations have been very good too. If you like jogging - don't forget your running shoes.

We woke every morning to an incredible view of the Bosphorus, and were greeted by the warm and friendly hotel staff -- most notably Natalie. She was amazing!!! She offered so many great recommendations and always did it with a smile. Do yourself a favor and look no further than Eternity.

Coffee & tea facilities in room, complimentary bottle of wine, water & fruit. WIFI available. Nothing lacking in room in my opinion. I was on the roadside - though did not find it noisy. You can hear the call to prayer - I got used to it - but you could use earplugs. Taxi rank across the street. Breakfast - cold meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, pastries,boilded eggs, tea & coffee.
