On a Saturday morning we decided to book a hotel room in Playa del Carmen. Made a reservation through MagicExpress website, entered Credit Card info and dates. Next morning arrived and was told by the front desk that we didn't have a reservation. I showed her my laptop screen with the reservation number. She found my reservation and told me I had to pay for the night stay. Why if I already paid with a Credit Card? She told me that the accounting department staff was off on weekends and nobody could process such payment. We had to pay in cash. Did we get a receipt? Yeap... homemade and almost handwritten, which tells me that the hotel front desk has it's own hotel business on weekends. Room smells like butane gas. Worse during night time when hotel bathrooms and showers are not running constantly. Had to open the window and rain came in a couple of times. Told the front desk about it. I was told that yes... people had been complaining about it, but there was nothing they could do. Asked to talk to the manager, and was told that he/she could not be bothered with such kind of complaints. Bad place to stay. We have stayed there a couple of times before, and things are getting worse.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel but disappointed...\u201d", "Author": "mospeed6", "ReviewID": "UR87208137", "Content": "This hotel was clean and quiet for our week long stay. While making our trip arrangements, I chose this hotel because in the pictures the hotel looks very new and clean and looking at the map it didn't seem that far from the beach and fifth avenue. The Positives: Hotel staff were friendly. Rooms were clean and quiet. Breakfast wasn't fancy (very very basic) but hey, it was free and one less meal a day we were buying. The A/C worked well. Nice tv with lots of channels. The Negatives: -The beds were small and ultra firm. (Like in firm as a stone bench, we both woke up with sore backs and had very poor quality sleep the entire trip.) -The window leaked every time it rained hard which made the tile floor in the room treacherous to navigate. This was mentioned to staff but nothing was fixed. -The shower clogged everytime someone showered. This was mentioned to the staff but nothing was fixed. -They give you two small bottles of water in your room on check in, but do not replenish them daily when you stay longer than a day. In a country where it tells you right on the bathroom mirror in the hotel that the water isn't potable they should give you new water each day. -The distance from the beach and Fifth avenue. We were getting such a value on the hotel that we did not think it was a big deal to grab cabs and use the hotel's free shuttle. Wrong. The hotel shuttle was not reliable, and that many cabs adds up fast. We would have actually saved money in the long run staying at a more expensive hotel closer to the beach. I had thought we would be able to walk sometimes, but the neighborhood between the hotel and the beach is not one that I would feel safe with an armed escort walking through. Regardless of the negatives, we still very much enjoyed our stay in Playa. However I think our vacation would have been even better if I had chosen a different hotel.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cHad an awesome time in Riviera Maya\u201d", "Author": "ExploringMexico", "ReviewID": "UR60018118", "Content": "I wen to the riviera maya with my family for vacations, our schedule included visiting tulum, chichen itza, cancun, coba, cenotes, etc, so basically we only wanted the hotel to come back at nigh and sleep.

The place is right next to an electrical tower and quite a distance from the beach. We had to take the taxi several times a day back and forth, there is no way to walk that far.

The hotel would not give us our money back, even though they had an empty room for three nights.

Taxi service to return from 5th ave is $5. The hotel is very clean and the staff was very nice. The breakfast is only drinks, fruit, pastries and toast, cereal is fruitloops and coco pops. There is a shopping mall about a 10 min walk that has a restraunt kinda like Denny's called TOKS where you can get good food at a reasonable price. The pool is small and surrounded by a block wall.

We had wireless internet at no extra charge as well as the use of the safe in room. The place is ok and they provide you for anything extra such as towels right away, even though the towells are very old and room need some touches of paint and perhaps change some head showers, but the water pressure is very good. Too bad they did not have hair dryer in the room... I forgot mine. The continental breakfast is very basic and light and served in disposable plates but still you get something to get ready for the day. For the location it is very quiet and you can sleep with no problem. They have parking lot and is very safe. They have a bar with a very decent selection and a variety of places where to eat, not on site, but again we have our car.

It looked very new and clean. We used the safe and were only charged $3 for the entire week because we had some problems programming the code. Free shuttle was a big help. It saves a $5 cab ride into 5th Avenue where all the shopping, restaurants, and beaches are. Rogelio (shuttle driver) was very nice and took us wherever we needed to go. There was almost no wait at all. I wish we were a little closer to the action on 5th avenue and may consider staying there next time to save on all the cab rides back and forth but if you don't like a lot of noise, then this hotel is great. The pool was probably the worst part. I love to have a big nice pool so at first this was a disappointment but by the end of the trip I never used the pool and found that with all the beautiful baches and tours I was too busy to think about the pool! PDC seemed to be in the middle of everything. In a week we visited La Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, and Cancun. Definitely try taking the colectivos (vans) that pick you up along the main highway and drop you off right in front of your hotel. It is cheaper sometimes. For example we took a colectivo all the way from Cancun back to PDC for 35 pesos or $3.50 per person. Must do tours are ferries to Cozumel and La Isla Mujeres for snorkeling. I never really snorkeled before and it was so easy. The views of all the beautiful fish was gorgeous! Chichen Itza is a must to see the ruins. Also go to Hidden Worlds to do underground cave snorkeling in the cenotes. Ask for Skinnyman - they will take care of you! Cenote Ikkil was like something out of a movie - also another cave for swimming. Overall it was the best week I've had in a long time.

Besides, with you're on vacation in a beach laden place, you only need the hotel for showering and sleeping! In any case, some pros and cons to help people decide: CONS: * The walls are thin... so as everyone else suggests, request a room away from the elevator (and the ice coolers at the end of the halls) * Even with A/C, the air tends to be a bit humid... we brought our own beach towels and after the first use, they were never fully dry again! * Breakfast is terrible * No food available for any meal aside from breakfast, and only pizza to be delivered * Shuttle only ran from 7am to 7pm, and only did drop offs, not pick ups PROS: * If you want to rent a car to drive around and check out the ruins (we did Coba and Chichen Itza in one day), there is a Budget rent a car place about 5 mins walking distance away * The shuttle did drop us off at various places aside from the strip * the receptionists and bartender were very nice * hotel is new and clean * can rent internet (about $2.50 an hour) * they will lend your beach towels (but you need to put down a $50 deposit) * you have the option of using the safe in the room * good security * $5-10 cab ride away from main areas (returning there at night) * price was good * there is a small gym in the hotel", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cMuy bien, Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "busybeemc", "ReviewID": "UR15152658", "Content": "The hotel was in a good location, although it's such a shame it was not nearer to the beach and 5th Ave, however, the hotel does provide free transportation between 7am and 12 noon to the beach and other locations such as Plaza's, conference centre's etc. The pictures of the rooms, pools etc is accurate, the rooms could be a bit larger but was adequate and extremely clean, & were kept clean throughout our stay.

Overall the experience was a good one. Here are some things that you might want to take into consideration when staying at this hotel: The hotel is a very far walk from the beach. When we arrived we took the bus from the airport in Cancun to the bus station on Avenida Quinta. We made the mistake of walking to the hotel from the bus station. It was hot and it was humid and we couldnt find any street names and were exhausted after lugging our bags to the hotel. Save yourself the hastle and take a cab ride for $5 US from the bus station. The hotel itself is located on a major highway and there is a big brick wall seperating it from the sketchy neighborhood a few feet behind it. I dont recommend walking around the back of the hotel at night. The hotel and our room were very clean. Our room had a very high ceiling and two double beds (we couldnt get a room with a single bed). The tv was an LCD screen, (a bit small but it did the trick), The bathroom was really clean (the shower is stand up). The room was cleaned every day. The mattresses on the beds felt very hard the first night, but we got used to them after that. We paid a minimum charge for a room safe for our valuables which I highly recommend. Breakfast: Very repetitive. I was getting tired of eating croissants, and muffins all the time. On the bright side its free and I learned how to say Chocolate Frosted flakes in Spanish \"Choco Zucharitos\". Free Shuttle:I didnt know this until I got there but the hotel offers a free shuttle van anywhere in the downtown Playa del Carmen/Playacar area between 7am-7pm. I found this out when I got to the hotel and checked in. We used it a couple of mornings and the most we ever waited for it to come was 15 minutes. If you dont mind having to share your shuttle van with other hotel guests and making the occaisional side stop then you should definitely use it. The staff: The staff was really helpful. The front desk staff spoke English. Some of the other staff couldnt speak English at all but they were all friendly and made the effort to talk to me when they saw me trying to speak Spanish. One day I told the shuttle van driver that we wanted to go see the ruins at Tulum and asked him to take us to the bus station because I thought that was the only cheap way to get there. Luckily he drove us to the Collectivos stop (they are vans that are commonly used by the locals to get around Playa del Carmen and nearby towns. We got on a collectivo that went to Tulum. It stopped right in front of the entrance to the ruins and we only paid $2.50 US each. Overall, if you dont mind not being right on beach then you should definitely stay at this hotel. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great vacation without paying a lot.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corsicana, TX", "Title": "\u201cNice, clean and new... but a few notes on it\u201d", "Author": "01010101010", "ReviewID": "UR13869990", "Content": "We were in this hotel for 3 nights. In short: 1) Getting there: even though is very easy once you have found it (it doesn\u00b4t come in the maps you are given in the airport or in the rental car company), was a little bit difficult, since roads in Mexico are a little bit caotic and then it took us a couple of turns and a some questioning the peds to get there. 2) Hotel: Very nice looking and new. Although the real swimming-pool has nothing to do with the ones you can see in the pics. Who wants a swimming-pool having the Caribbean??? 3) Room: New furniture and LCD TV. Very clean. The bathroom was a little bit too small but the shower was very good. The bed was excellent as well. However, it was very noisy. You can hear anyone talking in the hallway, no matter the level of their voices. The elevator has a very disturbing noise when it opens the door, just like a little music tone that is played continuously. It can get to be very annoying when you are trying to sleep. 4) Breakfast: Poor Continental. A few croissants, cereals and milk. Coffee not bad though. Almost no fruit. 5) Distance to the beach and to the downtown. Far. You could walk but I guess it might take about half an hour to get to the heart of the 5th ave. and to the beach. 6) Parking: Always controlled and wide enough. 7) Staff. Some were very nice, some weren\u00b4t as nice. I must remark that they did not wake us up when we asked to do it the day we had to leave. Fortunately, we woke up on time to get the airplane. Conclusions: - Good hotel. Clean and new. Good price too. - Don't forget: getting a room far from the elevator and bringing your own alarm clock or similar. - Rent a car. It is the easiest way to move around (watch out for the police, they are more dangerous than the traffic itself, so always have a $5 bill in the pocket ready to bribe them) Enjoy!", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Magic Express", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d630613-Reviews-Magic_Express-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$65 - $122*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carretera Cancun _ Chetumal Km 291</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "630613", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/31/04/3104a45b95af8b8833d043f410e1214e7large.jpg"}}
