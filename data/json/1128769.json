It was very convenient to my friend's place in the East Village. We checked in late Friday night and the front desk receptionist was very friendly. My young daughter made an instant friend. The hotel staff accommodated our request for a quiet room and gave us a corner room (2 beds) with a view of the pool (closed for the season) on the quiet side of the hotel. Having stayed at the hotel before, I wasn't surprised to find the darker room due to the dark wood furnishings. Once we figured out which light switches turned on the respective lights, the room wasn't so dark. Here is a list of pros and cons of the hotel. Pros: 1) Friendly and courteous staff. We did not have to wait for our room to become available and worked with a very friendly and capable receptionist. The bellhops/front door security men were pleasant and made sure to accommodate all our needs during the stay. 2) Comfortable beds and extra pillows. I like to sleep with extra pillows and did not have to request more at this hotel. 3) Shower was awesome! My daughter loved the rain shower and the small handheld attachment that was just at her height so she could enjoy her own little shower. The layout was a little unique since the shower was next to the bed and the frosted glass allowed her to \"see\" someone in the shower. The shower in this room was huge and could accommodate 3 people if needed :) 4) Close to many areas of NYC. We walked to little Italy/NoLita and had croissants at Ceci-Cela (great almond croissants and service). We also took a stroll towards Chinatown and stopped to get donuts at Doughnut Plant on Grand and bagels next door (I love NYC bagels). We took the subway to FAO Schwarz (my daughter's favorite part of the trip) and was easy to navigate from the hotel. 5) On-site gym. My husband used the gym and stated it wasn't crowded and adequately equipped. Cons: The only reason I gave the rating a 4 instead of 5 was the toilet handle in the bathroom was coming off. We could still flush the toilet but it took some steps to make sure the handle didn't come off completely. I'm surprised the housecleaning staff did not notice this when preparing the room for the guests. Also, internet was not free (not a big deal but still annoying). Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alba", "Title": "\u201cgood but too expensive\u201d", "Author": "alberto c", "ReviewID": "UR126393729", "Content": "The hotel is really good, the view from the rooms is great but air condition doesn't work an it's very noisy, the lifts are soo slow and never show up (it takes 10 min to get one).

In a boutique hotel i expect a minimum of personalized service, starting from the welcome at the reception, perhaps few information about the area and the facilities of the hotel, this is not the case when you arrive in this hotel. The porter was the only one who did smile once. I booked a smoking room but to get an ashtray in the room i had to call the reception the first day and the second day as well. There is no way you can let her fresh air flow into the room because windows and glass door are blocked. The ac system is noisy and unefficient. The decoration of the room is absolutely standard, nothing which i could define special including the choice of linen and towels of pretty average quality. The first morning we had breakfast in the hotel, pretty poor quality food and extremely highly priced served on very uncomfortable low table. The only positive note goes to the attendant of Greek nationality, the kindest staff of the hotel. (Look for Pulino's bar close by if you like to enjoy an extremely good and fairly priced breakfast!) wifi is not free of charge like in most of the hotel of the same category, a bottle of water is charged 10 usd and you have to double check is the bottle is sealed and not re-filled with tap water. so in general very little attention of details in a town like new york where look and style is so relevant.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location but average service\u201d", "Author": "btorreparis", "ReviewID": "UR126248910", "Content": "Location, location, location as the saying goes for real estate.

The location is prime and the rate was good...and we were staying during the week in March, so the place was pretty quiet. The staff offered us an upgrade to a suite with a great view and a patio for a few more dollars, but when we went to the room it had clearly been smoked in (despite the fact it was a non-smoking room) and we declined (ALL hotels should be 100% non-smoking). The room we ended up with was fine, although my wife observed that the hotel tried too hard to be European. If you've been to a typical European hotel you know their beds don't have sheets and blankets like American hotels but instead have a single comforter thing. I dislike it in Europe and I dislike it more in the US. The room was drafty, too, so we had to keep the heat cranked to stay warm. The lighting situation in the room was abysmal...why do so many modern hotels have ridiculous lighting?? I still think the room was too dark and am still baffled by the crazy light switches. The bar was ok, but the bar staff was not the least bit friendly. About 25 minutes after we arrived the waiter told us he was leaving so we'd have to close out our tab (which is waiter speak for \"I'd really like my tip now, please\") and that kinda soured the experience. The fire alarm went off at approx 04:45 AM (There is no way any human would have slept through this alarm) and I feel the staff could have done a better job of informing the guests that it was a false alarm. They slipped a very nice note apologizing for the alarm under our doors a few hours later that morning, but at the time I really would have like to have known if I was supposed to evacuate or not. IF you do stay here, I highly recommend a walk West on Houston for a few blocks till you come across the Bowery Cafe on the south side of the street.

My television didn't work for two days, again not great - and one night i was kept up til 5am with a party in the room next to mine, and the hotel staff were reluctant to shut it down. I did indeed wonder if i was staying in a nightclub or a hotel! Also, the deep downtown location means you're quite far from the main attractions of NYC.

But here i was in New York for a good week and was visiting my cousins from Calgary. We decided to meet up in NY since it's been 3 years since I came here... We decided to stay in the lower east side area because it was hip and happening from all the TimeOut reviews and articles that i had researched from back home.

We stayed in one of those Studio Kings on the 8th floor which was quite high but the view was not what i was looking for. Anyways, i didn't come here to stay in my room, i was here for my cousins and our good time in NY. During our stay, the staff at the front desk was more than giving, extremely courteous and very attractive i should say... They never said no to anything but came up with some suggestions all the time ... very young staff but i could tell they were in to it... Very cool and not up tight as other standard Hilton's and the Marriotts that we are used to... I was disappointed that they didn't have a restaurant but the front desk staff introduced us to Meatball shop and other neighborhood restaurants which were sooo good... Besides, all that the manager on duty during check-out actually invited me back to the hotel on my next trip to NY and said he'll buy me a drink or two in the new restaurant that they were opening.

Oh how wrong we were, I arrived to meet my friend who had already arrived and she told me she was on the 7th floor terrace bar, I said who...hoo and headed up to meet her. The \"bar\" is really only a terrace/deck with worn material on the not at all comfy or cosy couches, no atmosphere and served me my long awaited Grey Goose/Tonic in a plastic long glass....I was paying a good deal of money and I got my drink in a plastic glass, was I back at my festival days...So we then asked where the \"real\" bar and trendy restaurant that we had read about on the website when we booked the hotel were to be told \"oh we are sorry but they are closed as we are changing mgmt companies\"....Needless to say we were annoyed, we only booked the room a couple of weeks ago and we booked based on photos we saw of the hotel amenities on the internet, but we could not find the places that matched there nice pictures in the hotel, we should have been notified about this at booking time...OK granted the room was very good, really spacious, comfy beds and lovely sheets....But it ended there....There was always about 8 staff in the lobby to any guest so it wasn't exactly the type of lobby you wanted to hang around, as you felt eyes on you all the time...Overall we were so disappointed at this quite high priced hotel and I expressed our disappointment on our last day when we were checking out and really the response we received drove me to write this review, it was an indifferent response, and I just thought...thats it I'm writing this review....so my advice don't stay in this hotel, unless they can guarantee everything you see in the photos is actually there for you during your stay...:)", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe Thompson experience at bargain rates\u201d", "Author": "oibarra3", "ReviewID": "UR124416793", "Content": "I spent a weekend at this property, and enjoyed the stay.

The platform bed is fairly stiff. In all, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s design and architecture are of the worst sort: it makes no effort to respond to what a person looks for in a dwelling but rather tries to contain you within its notions of downtown hipster cool.

Easy to walk to interesting bars, restaurants and boutiques, and a short cab ride to Williamsburg.

I was slightly concerned about out room (after reading a review about the 7th floor) which was opposite the club and right next to the lifts. But as we were out most nights, we never really had any problems with noise as there was a double door to our room, we could slightly hear music and people in and out of the club but never became an issue. We drank at Above Allen anyway one night (great views of the Empire State Building). But I possibly wouldn't have put bedrooms on the same floor as a club. However, we were extremely pleased with our room, it was huge! Gorgeous comfortable bed, amazing rainfall shower and great seating area, it was clean and modern. Maids came everyday to change towels etc and leave chocolates on the bed, we also requested an iron and they were straight up with one. Oh and Kiehl's products! If I could have changed anything I would have like to have seen a kettle and mugs in the room to make a cup of tea and free wifi (there was a laptop which you could check anything on for free at the front desk, but felt a little awkward with people around).

Here's a breakdown of our stay: Good: 1) The staff at the hotel were super friendly, quick and very helpful when asked for extra services (i.e. making up the sofa bed for my daughter, extra pillows, water service at the pool, giving directions to a good local bagel shop). I read previous reviews about arrogant staff but we very fortunate and never encountered a rude staff member. With a young child (our daughter is 4.5 years old), we were happy to work with many hotel staff members that were friendly and helpful. We were on the 8th floor away from the elevator and never heard the street sounds of NYC, loud guests or the nightclubs nearby. 2) Location was great for walking to Little Italy, Chinatown, East Village, NYU, etc. and tons of nightlife. Mixed (Good with Bad) 1) Outdoor pool was perfect for 80+ degree weather in NYC the week we were there. The pool staff members were great, the chaise lounges were comfortable for soaking up the sun but the size of the pool and surrounding area were small. Seats were limited and they filled up quickly with guests. During our stay, the pool was not available to use on Friday until 12:30 PM because there was no lifeguard on duty. The staff informed us that the guests were not allowed into the pool until a lifeguard was on duty. The news was very disappointing to my daughter who had to wait an hour until the pool was cleaned and the lifeguard was officially on duty. The pool staff did their best to accommodate my family and the other guests that were waiting to get into the pool (it was a challenge in 80+ degree weather). Thankfully, the pool was available early on Saturday when we returned to the pool the next morning. 2) Our room was huge (for NYC standards) and decor was modern but the room was extremely dark due to the black wood floors. The king sized bed was comfortable with soft bedding. The sofa bed was comfortable too. The A/C was working and effective cooling down the room for sleeping. The shower was stocked with Kiehl's toiletries and supplied good water pressure. With the black tiles, the bathroom was very dark. My parents are older and had trouble finding things when they came to visit the hotel room. Our room had a view of the pool which was nice for people-watching. Our daughter loved it. Bad: 1) The elevator situation was terrible. You had to use your key to get to any floor. Great for security but if you did not put the key in right or did not wait for the green light before pushing the appropriate button for your floor in time, you were taken to another floor. Very frustrating. I've stayed at many hotels with similar elevator systems and the Thompson's Hotel system needs some work or adjustments to make things easier for guests. 2) $15 for wireless internet service. We didn't try to use a cable to see if internet was complimentary in that format but it was confusing since our hotel reservations stated: complimentary internet access. Annoying. Overall, this is a very trendy hotel. According to my husband, lots of hipsters, Europeans and young people. Not exactly a family hotel but as a family staying there, we enjoyed the amenities and overall experience at the hotel. We've stayed at Le Parker Meridien (great burger joint in hotel and near central park), Millenium Hilton (great indoor pool and large rooms) and other hotels in NYC and the Thompson LES definitely had the trendiest vibe to it. P.S. Rocky's Pizzeria on 2nd Avenue, across the street from AMC Loews Theaters (movies) had great slices (if you like sweet pizza sauce).

Not only feeling unwelcome, but insulted, I called my credit card company to see what the problem was and they informed me that there was already a $1500 hold on my credit card by the Thompson Hotel and an attempt for an additional $1500 charge which the credit card company denied (as it looked fradulent). Basically the gentleman checking me in had put the hold on, neglected to inform me and then had me go through the indignity of paying cash and emptying out the minibar.

There is a trendy rooftop lounge that had a DJ. The lounge is for members only and hotel guests.

The treatment here is a bit more standard among good hotels. The crowd was mostly in their 20s. It was not for us, but looked like fun. Negatives The tower looks like an eyesore to me. It stands out in stark concrete. A north-south view would have been more interesting so that one could view the skyscrapers in midtown and the harbor below, but the orientation of the building is a minor criticism and the view was interesting to explore.

While it definitely strives to be hip and cool, it lacks the warmth of other hip and trendy hotels such as W Union Square and Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. First off, check-in. As far as service goes, the people at the check-in desk were the friendliest and most efficient. No problems there. The concierge desk was another story. I think Thompson was trying to hire smart, good looking student types, but they seemed like they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want to be at work and lacked some social and service skills that more experience concierges have mastered. In every encounter I had with them be it asking the best way to get to the airport or needing help printing a boarding pass, I felt they were anxious to get rid of me. Maybe they were, but a good concierge doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the customer know it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at a enough hotels and in most cases, the concierges have exuded friendliness along with their professionalism. The room itself was very comfortable. The lack of carpet, again, took away some warmth, but it also seemed cleaner without it. The views were outstanding, the bed was comfortable (very) and the flat screen TV was great with easy access to lots of good channels. The bathroom was another story. It was small, very dark, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of room to set things, and lacked a tub. The shower, once I figured out the settings, was pretty nice. However, unless you are okay with the water raining straight down on your head, it seems you have to hold the sprayer. But the biggest pet peeve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c No shower cap! Luckily, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d brought the one I asked for at the other hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned the shower cap in reviews and am probably being nit-picky at this point, but still. It was an issue. Okay, as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably guessed, no in-room coffee. A small pot brought to your room was $10.00. Not a bad deal, but not great. I guess it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot cheaper and easier for a hotel to just leave coffee pots out of rooms, but it makes the ones who keep them in seem more luxurious. The room service menu was great, but only if you like Asian food. It would have been nice to see a few more diverse items included in the menu. Something simple and healthy like a turkey sandwich would have been nice, but there was lots of sushi, noodle dishes and satay. Also, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any wine by the glass. I understand a lot of hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have this, but why not? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather pay $10 for one glass of wine than buy a $40 half bottle I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to drink. The location was pretty good if your plans include lots of bar hopping and clubbing, but if you love shopping and browsing around stores, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only good if the weather is good. The closest shopping area was half mile away, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too far, but if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snowy and icy it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far. If I were going to stay in that area again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably pick a hotel a little closer to the shops.

The concierge service was also exemplary, They got us everything we wanted including a great sitter for our child through the best service in NYC for them. I felt very much at home there. It was super chic, stylish and cool but NEVER snooty that is of course aside from the manager from Above Allen. We had a few complaints about our New Years Eve experience with the bar and although neither the bar or the hotel was responsible for throwing the party.. the name of the bar and hotel is used to sell the tickets so it would have been nice for this person to at least feign a degree of interest in our complaints and maybe some empathy we had to have such an unpleasant experience. Mr. or Ms. Chien showed neither. I take away one star for having such a rude person be the manager at a bar at your hotel. This ridiculous trend of hotels claiming to be different businesses than the lounges on their premises and therefore not accepting any responsibility for any bad experiences you have there or don't have there because sometimes you can't even get in (i.e. standard) is offensive to it's patrons. Those bars pay them money to have their bar there and they benefit from any allure the bar brings. But aside from that.. Thompson LES Rocked. I would recommend it to everyone I know.

This was my first stay at the Thompson, we usually stay at the Giraffe when visiting Manhattan, but for a variety of reasons decided to try the Thompson for this visit. We stayed in a King Suite. First the positives: The room (by Manhattan standards) was quite large, it was clean and well designed with adequate storage, our room was very quiet, the fixtures and furnishings are well designed and very contemporary. The staff was very efficient and responded quickly to all inquiries. There are many restaurants, shops and a great little movie theater within easy walking distance. In explaining my negatives, I should point out I am a senior citizen and my negatives may not be important to other people. First, the lobby has all the warmth and ambiance of a cement factory (concrete floors, ceilings and tile walls). Black and dark gray are the predominant colors throughout the hotel and the low level lighting made it feel as if I was constantly in the twilight zone. The room is constructed primarily of concrete and tile in black or dark gray. Even the wood floors are black. If Johnny Cash walked in the room you probably wouldn't be able to find him. I felt like I should be carrying a flashlight to find the correct button in the elevator; however, the Fellini black and white movies constantly showing in the elevator were interesting. With the lights set at the brightest, I could not comfortably read in the room, except in bed - and that light was difficult to direct. All the lighting was either recessed ceiling, bare bulb or spotlight type with the exception of one small low wattage lamp. There is a small lobby seating area on the second floor which we were told we could use but it has more the feel of a cocktail lounge than an area you would relax and read the paper or enjoy a cup of coffee. The only food service is an Asian restaurant located on the second floor which we tried the first evening. The chef had received very good reviews but we found the food unremarkable. And speaking of coffee, you could get breakfast at the bar area on the second floor but since it wasn't very inviting, I went to one of the nearby delis for morning coffee (no problem unless it's freezing or snowing out). Complimentary coffee to go with the complimentary newspaper would be a nice addition.

We checked in at 6.30pm after flying in from London only to be told the room wasn't ready despite calling a week before and asking that everything was okay. We were offered a free drink at the bar, but really all I wanted was a shower before we went out! We were then shown our room and whilst it was clean and tidy, it stank of cigarette smoke. After more complaining the hotel eventually agreed to move us to another room. Now for the critical stuff. We've stayed in NYC at loads of hotels previously and whilst this one was in a great place, it lacked any sense of charm. It's very cool, but very cold. The rooms were very small even by NYC standards and more could be had for the same money, (try Soho House or The Crosby) with exceptional service in comparison. At Thompson LES we called for room service on the Sunday only to be told that the menu was very limited as it was a Sunday. This would be fine in a rural hotel in Spain, but not in NYC!

I especially liked the light installations over the bed which doubled as artwork. We also had a view to the pool downstairs. Overall I really liked the hotel. Pluses: 1. Location - the LES is fully gentrified now so it was nice to be in the middle of this vibrant, transformed neighborhood. 2. Lots of amazing restaurants around and I loved that they had a wash a fold every other block 3. Pool - enough said. Not easy to come by in NY and being that we were there in the summer, our kids were so happy 4. Service - I love that the staff was almost too friendly. I prefer overly attentive service to little or none 5. Surprisingly, I would recommend this hotel for families. It served our needs well. Minuses: 1. On our third day there there was a pool party. Every hipster in Manhattan was there and wanted to get in to the pool area. We had invited friends to join us to swim but because of the party, there was no way we could congregate by the pool. Fortunately we went up to the rooftop lounge and hung out there instead. 2. On weekends, you can hear noise from the club across the way from our room in the hallway.

If you want that, here you go. If you want customer service, look elsewhere. We arrived at 2:15pm after traveling in Thailand for 2 months. We were exhausted. One person was behind the counter. I waited with my backpack on my back (no bellman offered to take my bag) as two other parties checked in. When I got to the counter, the woman working (cold as ice) told me that our room was not ready. I asked her when it would be ready and she snapped, \"3pm, that is check in time, after all\". We left our bags and went to the second floor restaurant for lunch. At 3pm, we came back down to check in and surprise, surprise, our room was still not ready. We were not in our room until 3:45. We sat in the lobby for 45 minutes watching others check in. It was not a great way to start. Picky things about the room: -The toilet seat wouldn't stay up, it would close on my husband as he was peeing which is obviously a messy situation. -Their bath towels are tiny, when I wrapped it around myself after the shower, my butt hung out. Only one bathrobe per room and no slippers. -Our shower door was broken, wouldn't shut, the seal/hinge was off -Housekeeping \"tidies up\" your personal belongings every day, to me this just feels like someone has rifled through my belongings, I just want the room cleaned -Only sushi for food. I love sushi but my husband does not, so he had no options. -They charge $10 a day for internet. I strongly disagree with higher end hotels charging for internet, it's not costing them more per user, so charging more after you've already paid a lot for your room is an insult. However, if I am going to pay, I expect the internet to be fast. Their internet is not, we could not stream any video and websites loaded slowly. -Bedside lamps have no switch, you plug/unplug them, seemed strange. One of the most annoying things is the elevator key card situation. We were constantly missing our floor and watching the same thing happen to other people because the card reader wouldn't work properly. We rode up with an employee once who said the same, that it was always difficult and even she couldn't get it to work. Today, the icing on the dumb elevator cake happened to my husband when he got in from his lunch. All of the elevators were broken and he had to walk up the 6 flights of stairs to our room. Thank goodness we weren't on a higher floor. Our TV froze on a channel and a volume setting. We had to unplug it to turn it off. The craziest experience I had here was this afternoon, when I placed a room service order at 2:30pm. A woman answered the phone once I hit \"restaurant\" and took my room service order. She even answered a second time when I called back to ask for ice and said no problem. At 4pm, I called back to see where my order was, after all, the only thing they serve is sushi, how long can it take to send me some raw fish? The man I spoke to at 4pm said there were no open room service orders. I explained that I had given my order to a woman who answered at 2:30 and he said that there was no woman working. The order was completely lost. It was nuts. I called the manager, apologized and sent me my order for half off. The whole thing was just so odd. It felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.

She handed over our keycard without a word of what floor we were situated on, directions to our room or any basic information one might expect on check in. Think this 'lady' would prefer to be the other side of the counter or perhaps on a catwalk! Not a good career choice as a receptionist methinks!! Who hires these people? The delightful doorman escorted us and our baggage to our room - talked us through the basics and more than made up for the diva-like experience we had with his sullen colleague. All other staff we encountered were polite, courteous and efficient. The Room: Wow. Initially didnt know what to make of the room. The bare concrete, dark wood, mirrored glass walls were stark - however the luxurious elements over-rode my initial concerns. Within minutes I loved this room and it proved to be one of the most relaxing, comfortable rooms I have stayed in. Our room overlooked the pool and Orchard Street (no city view) but it proved to be a great location insofar as we had no noise pollution during the night. The hotel is situated in the Lower East Side - a wonderful, vibrant area with a plethora of good restaurants, bars etc. To be honest, this hotel may not suit a lot of people, it is portraying itself as a cool, trendy place (it is) and wouldnt be a place I would recommend to my parents. Actually as a 40something year old, I felt a little 'aged' at times. Neither would I recommend it for families (dont know if they supply cribs etc and didnt see any information regarding same) One point deducted due to our experience with \"La Diva\" on reception, apart from that we had a fab time, in a fab hotel, in a wonderful location. Would definately stay here again, provided I got a good rate and would definately recommend to anyone looking for a modern, edgy, hip, different experience. Just keep an eye on their rates to bag a good deal", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoud Nightclub noise from the 7th floor...\u201d", "Author": "Vinn25", "ReviewID": "UR54781970", "Content": "Stayed on a Saturday night on the 9th floor, with views of the projects across the road.

This hotel came off feeling cheapish and clueless. Now I totally get the comparison that another reviewer made when comparing it to the quality of the Royalton. The first thing a hotel needs to deliver is the comfort of it's guests especially regarding a good night's sleep in the privacy of their room no matter what the hotel may or may not deliver in regards to other amenities that go on in the lobby,etc. I asked for a quiet room upon check in after reading a couple of reviews regarding the bar noise.The front desk person adknowledged the potential for noise from the bar in the room e were previously assigned 6th floor and switched our room to the 4th floor,away from the bar which I believe is on seven. All was good ,nice room,we head out to eat drink,etc. Upon returning to the hotel and settling in for bed I started to hear large banging noises sporadically,they sounded like large crates of liquid(bottles?) being dropped on our ceiling but i knew we weren't under the bar so I called the front desk after the fourth noise and mentioned what was going on...he seemed as baffled as I was but said he would investigate. Many hours went by,the noise continued,I slept through it as much as one could,sort of, you know...when you are so tired at one point you could sleep at a bus station or airport(this is how I fell asleep both nights). It wasn't until morning and we left our room that I realized the \"slamming \"noise was actually the heavy doors to the rooms that have no hinges(or not slow enough ones) and slam shut whenever anyone enters or exits their room(no fault of the guest who is oblivious to this unless trying to sleep),and I mean \"LOUDLY\" as there was a long hallway between our door and where we actually slept and I could not hear elevator shafts,voices or any other noises. This is such a SHAME as the rooms are otherwise well insulated(no street noise,couldn't hear adjacent guests,etc.)and I am writing this in hopes that the hotel manager/owners /architects will see this and do something about it. I mentioned it several times and again upon check out and the staff,while polite and considerate, I realize now might have been playing\"dumb\" since there is not much they can do about it anyway(in the moment).I would think they would want upper management to know.Nobody adknowledged being aware of this issue.Upon check out the young lady commented\"well I wonder who was slamming their doors\" and I said nobody\"they slam themselves shut\". This is a hotel I would have returned to if not for the needless noise issue.I really liked the location and the hotel seemed adequate otherwise...I'm not the type to complain over petty issues and in fact only write reviews when I have something really good to say about a place that I would like to share with fellow travelers. Needless to say we had to endure a second night of the same which was sort of depressing going back to the hotel after a nice dinner knowing you were going to encounter more \"slamming\".It's really loud because the doors are so heavy,sounds like a BANK VAULT closing shut each time.Or a JAIL CELL DOOR.Needless to say I had many opportunities to analyze the sound. In addition to the inner doors slamming,we also had to endure the jolting of the balcony door of the room adjacent to us in the wind...I only mentioned it to the front desk when we were rifled out of bed at 3 a. m, and had to go down to the lobby in our pajamas after a false fire alarm...what timing...just as I was finally getting to sleep!

The sofa was dirty and very uncomfortable to sit in since the back was not a cushion but made out of hard material. Also, the room was dark. You could turn on every light in the room and it would still be dark. While this created a \"hip\" vibe there are times when you just need some light.

Obviously there are 100's of choices available in NYC, but the LES is limited for well priced options. Here's what I found as drawbacks: 1.) Found a pair of eyelashes (yes, sticky glue fake eyelashes) affixed to the black lacquer bed when we arrived. Not a big enough deal to call housekeeping, but still uber gross to have to get tp and throw them out. It was like the bed was staring at me. 2.) A prior guest left what I can only assume was toothpaste on the back of the door and housekeeping did not remove it during our entire stay. 3.) Bed had a ledge of sorts on the back (facing window) that had mounds of dust on it - stayed there for all nights of our trip. 4.) Fire alarm went off on night/early morning of day 4 (I believe) and upon return to our room door was unlocked/open. Ran around to make sure we hadn't been robbed and luckily we weren't. Highly annoying because we were tramping down the stairs from a higher floor and did not receive any direction from staff. Finally decided to go back to room when alarm went off and didn't see or hear even ONE other person. Guess it was a false alarm, but firetrucks did arrive and could see them quickly leave. 5.) Front desk called me one evening when I was out enjoying dinner and asked some random question - tried to get more info, but I guess they realized their error and HUNG UP on me. 6.) Only 1 elevator appeared to work. 7.) Not really a negative for me, since it was NYE and I like to party with the best of them - but upon arriving back to our hotel around 3 AM on NYE found random drunken females riding in elevator trying to get off on the 7th floor I believe. Once we arrived back to our room we could hear a party going on. Again ONLY happened on NYE, but I can only imagine how annoying that would have been on any other night. 8.) Shower doors were ever so loud and made a huge slamming sound that would make you believe the glass was about to burst on top of your head. You could also hear this sound from other rooms. Positives 1.) Hotel is newer than most other hotels in LES and for what we paid well worth it.. 2.) See negative #7 - could be positive if you are looking to party 3.) Elevator required a key card to get off on your floor. 4.) Subway stop across the street 5.) Other than #5 all contact with employees was nice and I noticed one of the doorguys from 6 Columbus was now working here. Actually the employees were super nice - so double plus. 6.) Our room was absolutely amazing. We had a corner room which if you stood on the bed (how I came to notice #3 above negative) you could see the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges - or perhaps just the Manhattan bridge. Have to check pictures. Awesome - awesome view of lower Manhattan and if I pressed my cheek against the floor to ceiling windows I could see the ESB. 7.) Other than slamming shower door from above NEVER heard a peep from any other guests. I only saw one other person on our floor the entire time we were there, so I'm not sure if the hotel was at capacity, but I would assume not considering the bargain basement rates this hotel had even the day before we arrived. I didn't try the restaurant, but I loved this restaurant one block south of LES on Allen street called Kampuchea. It's a Cambodian restaurant - yummy. Sugar next door was also very tasty - ask the guy why they don't have strawberries hehe. Whole Foods is about 2 blocks away and has many great options and a cool place you can sit and eat and enjoy street views. There's a crepe place a few blocks away that you should try (but only order one) I suggest a desert crepe. Pianos was fun in the LES as was the burlesque show across the street from Kampuchea. So all in all - not sure if my negatives (mainly surrounding housekeeping) would keep me from recommending the hotel to a friend - but, I probably wouldn't stay there again because I got the eery feeling that in a few months the housekeeping issues would turn into maintenance issues and the whole place would be a dump with great views. Actually I am headed back to NYC for Labor Day and I didn't even look at Thompson LES rates, because come to remember it the bed staring at me was just too gross and everytime I see a black lacquer bed now I'll just think it's winking at me.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "TravellingMancs", "ReviewID": "UR38277194", "Content": "We ( 2 twenty somethings and Mum!) stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in August, getting a last minute discount with GTA hotels.

Not to say we were disappointed, just thought that they need to work out a few kinks. We booked a King Junior Suite. Upon arrival, we went through a fairly smooth check-in process (the doormen at this hotel are top-notch by the way, but I'll explain that later). The room itself was spacious for NYC hotel (although in any other city, our room would be considered an average size King room), nice amenities (C.O. Bigelow bath products, beautiful soft Italian sheets and a very relaxing waterfall shower head). I'm not a big fan of the current trend in hip boutique hotels towards having platform beds but I have to say, this one was one of the more comfortable ones that I've slept in. Our room was on the 7th floor - right across from the \"lounge/patio/bar\". As the night wore on (we were weary travelers who just wanted to sleep), the music from the bar just got louder, the people going in and out of this bar more and more loud and drunk. Also, our room (#703) was situated directly across from an exit door of the lounge that was constantly being used by the bar patrons. I ended up calling the front desk and spoke to the night Manager (Alfie) who was as helpful as possible but didn't have another King room available on another floor until the morning (they had a room with 2 Queens but my husband is 6'4\" and that wouldn't have worked for him). We decided to make the most of the night (well, what was left of it) and would move in the morning. If you find yourself during check-in being given Room 703, try and have it changed unless you are okay with a sleepless hotel night. In the end, they moved us to Room 1103 - a lovely Junior King Suite room on the 11th floor with a beautiful view and most importantly we were able to sleep soundly through the night. The Wifi was down throughout our stay (although we were charged on our bill, they did adjust it ) and during our check out the Front Desk's IT system was down as well so we were unable to receive a copy of our bill. Overall, the staff was friendly (and beautiful - something to be expected). The Doormen however should receive special kudos. They were helpful with making sure our rental car wasn't ticketed when we first arrived since we had to park in front of the hotel for about a half an hour, and they were just great at always making sure our bags were taken care of (luggage and shopping!). My husband (who is less the hotel snob than I am...but that's only because I travel for a living and stay in a ton of hotels) loved the place and would highly recommend the place. Me, I liked it too, would recommend it for its location (right in the heart of the Lower East Side, close to the great shopping and restaurant districts of Soho, Nolita, East Village and LES).

I will definitely consider staying here again on my next trip to NYC. The hotel is located just below Houston St (so at the top of the lower east side within easy walking distance of the east village, SOHO, Nolita etc). I booked my room through an on-line seller and got a good rate and a $100 credit for the restaurant so great value for money. While trendy in d\u00c3\u00a9cor and clearly trying to be a hot spot the hotel is attracting a wide variety of guests and the staff provided good service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often trendy hot spot hotels can have snotty service and attract only hipster guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the case here. Check-in was efficient and friendly as was check-out. Concierge services were helpful and high quality. When I checked in well into the evening I had to ask to have the bedding changed as I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t informed the hotel ahead of my feather allergy and housekeeping came up immediately and dealt with it. Whenever I ran into housekeeping staff during my visit they were friendly and efficient. Three warnings. First, the room heating and cooling system in my room was located right near the bed and the fan blows at the bed. For me this was fine as I sleep best with some white noise and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind air movement. I mention this as I have friends for whom I know this would be an issue - if it would be for you, you might want to inquire about room configurations when booking. Second, the location was great for me since it was located in amongst some of my favourite parts of NYC in lower manhattan. If you are looking for the luxury NYC experience you may not be comfortable with neighbourhood which is certainly grittier than the hotel heavy area just south of central park or the upper east or west sides. Third, the hotel is currently brand new and I think some of the finishes may not hold up well under constant use (for example the bathroom counter-top is already showing some minor signs of water damage) so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be interested in hearing about the condition of the rooms in another couple of years.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a visit to the East Village or Soho\u201d", "Author": "DSchwab", "ReviewID": "UR30080889", "Content": "I stayed there for my daughter's graduation from NYU and because she lives in the East Village.

I would have helped if they had a luggage stand for my bag, but we got over that and just worked out of the bag on the floor. There were only a couple of petty annoyances, one was the 9am test of the fire alarm. We did have to call down to the front desk to make sure there wasn't a real emergency, and the other was making note, because of the alarm, that the fire alarm/smoke detector in the bathroom still had it's pre-construction covering on it, which made it inoperable, just in case there had been a fire in the bathroom. The continental breakfast was haphazard with some fruit and bagels laid out on a table like it was for unexpected guests. Room service would probably be a better choice.

Front desk staff were like robots. No life in them at all. They seem either desperately unhappy or were trying to seem way too cool. A hello and good bye would help in converstations. After asking for directions I received an uninformed and vague answer and then the front desk guy just walked away. I thought he was going to get me more information, but he then started 'serving' another guest at the desk. It was quite awkward. There were no welcomes or farewells at check in and check out. It was all so sombre. Some communication skills and some genuine hospitality would bring this hotel into the league i assume it aspires to be in. The truth is that I would have come back to stay there again right up until I paid my bill and checked out. It was then I think that I gave up on the place.The front desk man barely grunted at me, took my money and without another word walked away into the back office door .

One down side is that Wifi will cost you $10/day. All things aside, the location alone is worth every penny. The lower east side is very cool and not commercialized at all.

We were offered to pay $150 to upgrade to a king suite room, which were told would still be 50% of the regular price of that room. We took it, figuring why not it was my husband's bday and we were just staying over night and enjoying a chance to sleep in while our sitter watched our two little ones. The room was nicely furnished, quite big, but for a hotel that's not that old we were surprised at small wear and tear already like rubber stripping hanging off the balcony door, a loose towel rack hook by the shower, and plumbing pipes made a horribly loud noise for a solid 15 seconds every time you ran the faucet or flushed the toilet. Other complaints about the room were that half the closet doors were blocked by a nightstand and there were two flat screen tvs back to back - one to watch from bed and one to watch from the couch - which weren't working and required a few calls to maintenance. Service-wise the room was only set up for one person in terms of towels and robes, there were no toiletries at all in the tub/shower (just a bar of soap at the sink), a card addressed to another guest had been left in our room, and it took 20 minutes and 2 phone calls to have a bucket of ice delivered to chill some champagne we had brought with us (this was after we'd made the request at the front desk during check-in).

E-mailed ahead to ask for a high floor quiet room, on arrival we were allocated a 6th floor room. Young, slightly aloof receptionist tried to sell us an upgrade to a Thompson Suite on same floor for an additional $50 per night by talking down the Studio King, we viewed both and didn't think it was worth the extra. Staff obviously pressured to make the hard sell in these credit crunch times. Room was spacious, clean, well kitted out but a bit gloomy and dark. Street noise was a problem, so next morning we again requested a high floor. Very helpful guy on reception was moving us to the 14th floor when the original check-in girl from previous day became involved and suddenly only a 9th floor room was available, we were not thrilled but reminded ourselves that we were on a good deal and let it pass. 9th floor was a definite improvement & the new room (a double, double), was quieter & brighter with a better view. A word of warning & to echo the previous poster, I heard numerous people complaining about the noise from the 7th floor bar, in particular a receptionist telling a guest that their were no other rooms available & they would ask the DJ to turn down the bass the next night!! I suspect if you're in a front room on the 8th floor you won't get much sleep at night, fine if you're a party animal, less so if you're not. This I think is the Thompson LES's dilemma, it's a big investment & needs the revenue from all areas, unfortunately this may be at the expense of some of it's other guests. There are many good qualities about this hotel and the rooms are of a high standard but the overall experience just leaves you cold. It's just too cool for school & want's you to know it! We ate in Shang on a Monday night & found it to be a shambles, we waited 15 minutes for menus & 45 minutes to place our order, only managing this by placing it with the celeb chef as he exchanged pleasantries with us! The Singapore Slaw & Sashimi starters were outstanding, we found the main courses & overall service to be mediocre. We loved the area, loads of local bars, cafes & restaurants , try SimonSips just over the road on 1st Street for the best breakfast cappucino & granola we found! Would we return to the Thompson LES? Unless it was another great deal - probably not.

Got one regular room and one suite, the prices were incredible through Quikbook ($150 for a king bed suite with a pull out double couch and $120 for a queen bed regular room). I don't remember ever paying that little for rooms in NY and remember getting really awful rooms for $300 a night in midtown. The hotel is, as my husband put it, \"groovy\". Very modern and \"stylin\", typical NY. But also really nice, clean, nice soaps and shampoos, comfortable. For us the location was perfect. We also fit 4 college students plus my son, whose show we went to see, and one friend into the suite and the hotel knew we had too many people and just said nothing. They were so friendly and the service was amazing. My daughter and her friends had bought a pint of ice cream and called for spoons which were promptly delivered and later a blanket for the extra bed which came up immediately. We had breakfast at the restaurant since there were seven of us and we didn't want to try to fit in somewhere as many of the restaurants and cafes in the area are small. It was delicious, with a beautiful buffet and a great menu. Not cheap but it was worth it so we could all eat together and the room is really nice and light with lots of windows and nice muted colors (big orange lantern type lights, very tasteful). We were only blocks from the little theater we were going to, and ate dinner at a fantastic ethiopian restaurant a couple of blocks away. Transportation is very convenient. Oh and we had amazing views of the city on our side. It was a bit noisy as we were over a club which played til about 2 am, but we were up til about 1:15 anyway. As it was a Friday night, I don't know what that's like during the week. My daughter was in the back which was quiet. At this price, I would stay here over and over and even when it gets more expensive, I'd return. I'd pay double the price per room and more but happily, so far, the price is amazing. There were plenty of people in the place and the bar seemed to have people in it as well, so they may raise the price soon.

But since this is new york city, you need to expect the rooms to be small, but the beds were comfortable and you had some great views. I would recommend staying on higher floors since allen street is a busy one. But there are great restaurants around there and you are a 5-10 minute walk from chinatown, little italy, soho, and close to many subway stops. I booked the rooms at quikbook, so I got great rates.
