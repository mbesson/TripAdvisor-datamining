The hotel had many a positive and negative aspect to it: Positives: - Staff. They were all extremely friendly from the receptionist, the breakfast staff to the housekeeping ladies. All keen to help when requested and always with a smile. My German isn't the best either and so even though we tried the language most politely replied in English. - Location. Located in the Kurfustendam, the hotel had an ideal location for a wide selection of bars and restaurants yet it was set back a street from the hustle and bustle and so was still peaceful. It was only a 5 minute walk from the nearest U-bahn on which it only took ten minutes to get to the centre of Berlin. - Breakfast. The breakfast selection was plentiful. Their we're standard continental options such as breads, meets and cheeses. A range if cereals as well as cooked options everyday. Negatives: - Noise. When the hotel was constructed, I think they had a shortage of stone and so they made the walls with paper. I felt like we were sharing our room with the people next door who were keen on getting 'acquainted' reguarly. Probably not as keen once i'd told them to shut up :-) - Smokey. Since the smoking ban in the UK, we tend to take it for granted that places tend to smell fresh and you can leave a place not smelling musty. However, corridors were definetly smokey despite the no smoking signs. Something that my pregnant wife wasn't so happy about. All in all, we didn't pay through the roof to stay at the Franke and so didn't feel too aggrieved by the negative aspects above. If you are looking for somewhere not too expensive to use as a base for a trip to Berlin I would recommend the Franke. If you were more interested in luxuries I would advise looking elsewhere.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap and Cheerful\u201d", "Author": "Healsby", "ReviewID": "UR124874144", "Content": "Staff were friendly and location was good for getting in and out of the centre of Berlin.

The hotel has a relatively good location, near Ku'dam, but still in a very quiet neighbourhood. When reviewing this hotel, it is necessary to take the price into account. Our double room was listed at 134 EUR/night. If we had paid that much, I would have been very, very dissapointed. However, we booked through a travel agent, and July was apparently not high season, so we paid less than a third of the list price. In that respect the hotel was ok for our purpose. However, I would definitively not recommend this hotel for business travellers. For that the room was a tad too small, there was no ironing board/trouser press in the room, no fridge/minibar and no air condition, so it got very hot. Not so much a problem when you are on an leisure trip, and walk around in shorts, but it would have been hell in a business suit. Pros: - Location - Price (the one we got at least) - Parking in the hotel courtyard, very convenient - Clean. Although the hotel is old and in need of renovation, the room was spotless, but that is pretty much the standard in Germany. Cons: - Breakfast buffet not very inspiring, and the staff did not refill it fast enough. Also, it was hard to get a table for breakfast, since the used tables were not cleared fast enough. - Noise travelled easily from room to room and floor to floor - Very hot (visited in July), especially the breakfast restaurant was like a baking oven. - Soft beds (but you can run into that on much more expensive/luxurious hotels also) Conclusion - I would recommend this hotel for someone on a budget leisure trip to Berlin, if they can get a similar discount.

Also we were asked to fill long registration forms including passport no, full address, full names and so on which is tedious and not usual anymore for German citizens in most hotels to fill in every single field in a registration form after we had booked with most information in the email booking already. Next day staff in the breakfast room and for check out was friendly. The hotel overall is very, very old. 60ties style but not vintage. It is the original old and neverr renovated interiors.

The receptionist was polite which was the only thing the hotel had going for it. The lift was terribly small (4 people max) and took forever (only 6 floors to the hotel).

Unfortunately, after attending the hotel, we now know the truth. I have a feeling that those whose reviews praised this hotel probably have not been to any average scale (3 star) hotels or resorts. Or, they just had to settle for the Franke due to either overbooking to a hotel of their first choice or lack just the lack of research on their end. If attending this hotel don't have any expectations. My wife and I are fairly experienced travelers and found this hotel the worst place of stay. It definitely does not classify as a 3 star hotel. We actually believe it should not be rated at all. It should be a \"Walk In, First come first serve\" hotel. The breakfast is basically a continental breakfast with the addition of scrambled eggs and hotdogs. Not appealing at all. Breakfast out everyday was a better choice. Cleanliness was average. But when you think about of it, it must be extremely hard to keep an already beat up shabby place clean...........Applause to the cleaning crew who do their best to keep this deteriorating place alive. The help (reception/front desk) were not friendly and acted extremely rude. When asked for something, they always had some remark back which made us feel uncertain. The food preparation/dining room clean up help were also not friendly either. When you say \"hello, good morning\", you were just ignored. They did not look very happy or acted like they enjoy doing their job.

The underground was not very close, but the bus stop that took you to ZooGarden (major transfer point) was only only a few blocks away and then there was no more than a 5 minute wait for a 10 minute bus ride.

The room was bright and airy and quite modern looking. The bed was 2 singles pushed together with a thin duvet.

The bathroom was impressive in terms of it's size and cleanliness and the shower was hot and powerful! There was a quite a large tv with CNN but no tv/coffee although this seems to be a mainland Europe thing rather than a fault of the hotel. Breakfast was fine and had tea, coffee, rolls, cereal, fruit, ham and cheeses. More than enough to see you until lunch-time! The location was good as it was off the main hustle-bustle but close enough to the the U-Bahn and the main shopping street (about 15 min walk) if you wanted to walk.

From a location point of view its pretty easy to get to from the airport. If you prefer a scenic (and I think quickest) route take bus 109 which stops at Adenaeurplatz U bahn (25 mins) and its about a 5 minute walk from there. The hotel is just off the lower end of the Kudamm so there are some shops and restaurants around, although we found we had to travel to get to a better selection.

If you are staying here and arriving at the zoo gardens station I would suggest that you don't walk, it is a good 15-20 mins walk and if you have luggage not a good idea. From the station you can get a taxi which costs approx 7 Euros, so well worth it. You can also get a 109 bus but I'm not too sure what the name of the stop is that you get off at is called. The walk from the zoo station is great for a stroll, you pass all the luxury shops, gucci, chanel, rolex etc., the window shopping is great.
