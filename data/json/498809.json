It was supposed to be in a \"downtown\" location, when in actual fact it was at least a 30 minute walk to Dundas & Yonge. It is however close to the subway, so you can get around that way. There were no parking places left when we arrived, so we had to park just down the road at a public carpark for $12/24 hrs with a $20 deposit, which we later found out is $3 cheaper than the hotel charges anyway. The lobby and bar area were clean and inviting, which is more than can be said for the guy on the desk when we checked in. The lift is small and broke down several times, so we were forced to endure the horrible \"cooked oil\" smell coming from the basement restaurant that lingers permanently on the stairs. The room was small and dark. The walls and carpet were stained and someone had punched a hole in the wall. On the upside at least the bed sheets were clean and bed bug free as far as we were aware. Wired internet connection in the room, but we found that we also picked up the lobby wireless connection, though this was very unreliable (even when sat in the lobby itself). The bathroom was tiny. The door almost touched the sink when it was open so in order to use any of the facilities you had to go in and then close the door behind you, which was awkward and would have been impossible for a larger person. Breakfast was minimal - choice of cereals, toast, muffins & fresh fruit with orange juice & coffee. Then the icing on the cake, we came back late one afternoon to get ready to go out for the evening, to find a mouse in our room! We complained to a female receptionist who was very apologetic, but not surprised (so obviously this was not a one off), they offered to compensate us a night and said they would send someone up to \"chase the mouse out\". No offer to change rooms and in the end no one came up while we were there, but as it happened the mouse ran out of his own accord - he obviously didn't want to spend another night in the room either!!!

Selby is less than a city block away, and you can pay for days parking with your credit card, if you like. There is no reason to have to run in and out to feed a parking meter. If you are luck enough to get one of the hotel's 5 parking spots, bonus. If not, it really is not a problem. Yes, the rooms are small. Yes, the rooms are tired, but the beds are comfortable, and the rooms are clean. If the maid service is a bit late, it is because the place is busy!

We liked the price, location and look of the place. Well, those three things stayed the same but when we arrived we were told that they had overbooked. So our reservation was gone, as well as our reserved parking spot. They apologized profusely but we were on our own to find parking (ended up finding parking across the street beneath the grocery store, which actually turned out to be cheaper than reserving one with the hotel). They were out of regular rooms, but offered to upgrade us to a suite for no charge to fix their mistake. 2) A suite! Sounds nice until we got in there and realized it was clearly an old storage room converted into a \"suite\". It sat on the ground floor (all the other rooms were upstairs) between the stairwell and the laundry room with lovely views of the alley! See attached pictures of this laughable \"suite\". I didn't get a picture of the bathroom, which was actually quite large and nice. 3) Aside from the fact that the room was sub par, we found moldy ice cream in the fridge and only two pillows on the bed. That evening before turning in I walked over to the front desk and was ignored for awhile by the employee behind the desk, who was busy laughing with his friend, who was lounging across the way in the lobby. When he finally finished up, I asked for an extra pillow or two. He said I could find them in the drawer of our dresser. I felt pretty stupid because I hadn't even looked there. So I went back, looked in the dresser and found... two pillowcases? Not helpful. I went back to the desk, was ignored again and was finally told he'd find some pillows and bring them to my room in a while. This he did. In a while. Why was it so difficult? I guess they have a pillow shortage as well as a room shortage. 4) This is a weird one: You're not allowed to bring the continental breakfast to your room. What? Maybe this is standard practice at some places but this has been the first place I've stayed at where they didn't allow me to grab a bagel and orange juice and go back to my room. This is not necessarily a deal breaker I just thought it was strange. Are we four years old? Can't be trusted with food in our room? Might smear it on the walls? Otherwise, it was clean, right by the train station and looked cute from the outside. The price would have been good had we gotten the room we reserved, instead of a converted storage space.

They won't guarantee a non-smoking room if you don't book directly, and I ended up stuck in a smoking room, where I found cigarette burns on the bedding! Yuck!

We booked the regular suite specifically because suites have queen beds and the standard rooms have double beds (according to the hotel's website.) My husband is 6' 6\" and a double bed is too short! On check-in, the desk clerk directed us to a room on the ground floor which he said was a *deluxe* suite. We were dismayed to find that it could only be called a suite because it had one room for a sofabed (not in the best condition), the television, and a mini-fridge, and a separate tiny room for the DOUBLE bed. The room also had no remote for the TV, an iron but no ironing board, and no coffeemaker. (The coffeemaker which was provided the next day, along with the other missing items, did not work...) Even worse, when my husband went to the front desk to ask if we could change rooms, he ended up in a shouting match with the desk clerk, who insisted that we were in a deluxe suite, and that the bed in question was so a queen! (I actually took the trouble to measure the bed and look up bed size specifications the next day. It was a double.) Needless to say, we spent a rather uncomfortable night crowded into this small bed. The next morning my husband spoke with a different desk clerk, who was mortified to hear of our trouble and promised to move us to a proper suite on Sunday at noon, which was the soonest that onewould become available. The first desk clerk also apologized to my husband for the argument, although he did try to excuse the problem by saying that the hotel had been overbooked and he \"thought he was doing us a favor.\" And the suite into which we were moved was exactly what we'd expected from the description of the hotel's suites, with the promised queen bed, desk, tub/shower combo, and *working* coffeemaker.
