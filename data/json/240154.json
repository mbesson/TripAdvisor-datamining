It is integrated into the shopping center and has two entrance: the main entrance from the side street, opened 24h, and the second entrance from the courtyard of the shopping centre, which, in turn, is accessible from the main street and closed from 12am till 6am. Our room was pretty spacious, with two wide and comfortable single beds. There was an airconditioning system, old-styled TV, a table, an armchair and a chair. Wi-Fi was quite expensive (5 EUR / 0.5h, 15 EUR / day), so we didn't make use of it. There were no minibar or refrigerator, but there were several glasses in the room, and there were vending machines with pretty good selection of wines, beers, strong alcohol and snacks near the elevator on some of the floors. There were plenty of electric outlets in the room. Bathroom equipment was weared off a bit, but worked well. There was an hairdryer. All towels had been changed every day, even if we didn't drop it down. Buffet breakfast was very rich and taste. One major issue was one of waiter's behaviour. Once a morning he dropped off the napkin when serving tables. He quickly looked around, then putted the napkin up to the table, were thinking nobody saw him. Unfortunately we saw, and then reported the hotel in writing. We didn't see him anymore. Reception staff was always welcoming and friendly, and glad to help. So, this was a comfortable and quiet hotel, and we would like to recommend it to anyone who want to stay not far from the center of the city (5 stops by U-bahn to Alexanderplatz).", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moss, Norway", "Title": "\u201cNice and simple hotel close to the U-Bahn.\u201d", "Author": "TorsteinKarlsen", "ReviewID": "UR116961707", "Content": "The location is allright for a base in Berlin. Regardless of what you're gonna be doing, you're definitely gonna be using the S- and U-bahn alot. Hotel Arcadia is located in a plaza type of thing in a quiet neighorhood. If you want to party right outside your hotel, then this is not the one for you. It did however have a couple of great restauarants right next to it in the plaza. There's not alot of noises outside at night. I don't really see alot of the staff while I'm at a hotel, but they seemed nice enough. I arrived a few hours before the regular check-in time, but that was not a problem and I got a room right away. The cleaning ladies did a good job. Both the entry, lift and welcome area seems very nice and classy. The room however wasn't that nice looking. The walls are missing... anything really and it seems very white and sterile. It could be alot more cozy with some extra decorations. The bathroom was allright, good enough space and also a bathtub. Also a free to use hairdryer there. The bedroom had a small tv (probably 14\" i think), too bad all the channels where german. Although it's funny to see movies dubbed, since after all it is a part of the german culture, it would still be nice with 1-2 english channels or atleast a music channel. They did have some Sky Pay-Per-View channels, I didn't use them so don't know the prices or how they where. There is no minibar or fridge, which is a negative. No in-room safe, but the reception got a free safe available.

The hotel, at 77 euros per room per night, turned out to be a superb choice. The location is next to a busy street where you can get everything you need, is literally a two-minute walk to the U-bahn (subway), and yet is quiet and comfortable enough to grant a peaceful night's sleep. The room was impeccably clean, the way I have come to expect German hotels to be. We interacted with three different reception staff and they were all incredibly friendly. There is no room service but they have convenient vending machines with a good-enough variety of German goodies. Breakfast is an extra 14 euros, which seemed high to me, so we conveniently grabbed something on Frankfurter Allee on our way out. But it would be nicer for them to somewhat reduce the price of the breakfast for older people, like my in-laws, who wanted to enjoy a long breakfast in the hotel. Also, they charge for internet use, even in the lobby, which I always find ridiculous. Parking in the garage is 12 euros a day but there is enough on-street parking around the neighborhood that isn't even metered that I would recommend looking around before going straight to the garage. We parked our car about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and left it there the entire stay without problem.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cBerlin rocks!!!

The name is a bit misleading. The address is also misleading as the front of the hotel is in Voigt Strasse and when we arrived we ended going in the back through the plaza. The rooms are clean. We use Premier Travel Inn a lot in the UK and the rooms at the Tulip Inn are slightly small in comparison, but the standard is about the same. The shower was very feeble. We spoke to other guests staying on another floor who said they had the same problem. If a power shower is high on your list of priorities this is not the place for you. We were on the 6th floor. There are two glass lifts overlooking the plaza and this was difficult for me at first because I do not like heights. This might be another consideration. We found the staff helpful. When the fridge in one of our rooms broke down it was replaced within ten minutes of reporting. We spoke to other guests who had not been so foruntate so it seems to depend on who is on duty at the time. There is a handy Netto near the station for bottled water etc, which is open quite long hours (0700-2200 except Sundays). We did not try the breakfast as at 14 euros per person it seemed expensive. We used \"Cafe im Plaza\" where a light breakfast cost us 15 euro for four people. The staff there were very friendly and let us practise our German. Worst thing apart from the shower was the piped music which fortunately was only turned on on the last day of our stay!

Have to say the Tulip Inn is probably the best value for money hotel that I've stayed in. For 3 nights it cost me around 108 Euros (based on 3 of us sharing).

Very good air conditioning & huge windows too, very handy when it's very hot outside. Bathroom was spacious too with both a bath & an excellent shower. Breakfast was great too, hot / cold buffet & a good selection of cereals, pastries, bread rolls & fruit juices. Coffee was excellent too. Ideally everything you need to set you up for a day's trek around Berlin. Locationwise it's outwith the central (toursisty / shopping) area of Berlin, but there's a tube station 2 minutes walk from hotel (Frankfurter Tor) which is only 4 or 5 stops from Alexanderplatz, which we used on a daily basis. We also found Frankfurter Allee & the surrounding area pleasant & friendly enough, quite a few cafes / restaurants too if you don't want to wander too far. There's also an adjoining shopping precinct with some more cafes & restaurants (we ate at the Thai restaurant there late afternoon after we'd got checked in...delicious!).

The hotel is quite cheap and is located in the eastern part of the city which has a incredible nice athmosphere. Lots of cosy small streets with trendy shops and nice resaurants/cafees. The Simon Dach strasse which lies a 5 minutes walk from the hotel is in my opinion a real top spot. Every evening and night the Simon Dach strasse is packed with people making a incredible nice athmosphere - go there!
