I went along with two friends for the cardinals vs cubs game. It was the only place we could get a reservation at since we decided to go up so late and i would have rathered sleep in the car than in this place. Before we go there we called to ask for parking and they said yes comes with the room and we get there and I ask where we are supposed to park she said good luck go find a place. Luckily we found a garage a few blocks away off Addison thanks to another couple. The room was disgusting, right when you walk in it smells like stale cigarettes and mildew. The room consisted of 2 full sized beds one dresser with a old TV that you have to press a bunch of buttons on it to get it to turn on and a bathroom(hardly one) with a old toilet a leaky since and a shower/tub that i would not step foot in if you paid me not even with shoes. the water barely worked at all and it was one of those places you don't take you shoes off. After it rained there were pockets of water in the wales that you could pop and that were running down the walls. the window ac unit was held in by duck tape(ours luckily worked others were not so lucky). The beds were disgusting. the management there was the worst ever they tried to change the price on me which did not happen when i checked in and they screamed at us when 3 friends came to join us in the room because we couldn't have party...It was 6 kids! The only positives of this horrible place was its location. It was 2-3 blocks (5-10 minute walk) from Wrigley field and wrigleyville. We also discovered the rooftop which was wide open when you just walk up the stair well and it had an amazing view of the stadium and at night was amazing. there was however some evidence of homeless people up there but that didn't bother us were happy to be outside of that smelly place. i would not recommend this place unless it is life or death", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paducah, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cThere's no place like home, there's no place like home.\u201d", "Author": "radskier", "ReviewID": "UR72402892", "Content": "Scary.

We were really excited about the perfect location, walking distance of everything (including a cheap and amazing bakery for breakfast just north a block on the opposite side of the street ) and after a day of traveling we just wanted to drop off our stuff and start looking at the city. Staff: We arrived and the hotel staff wasn't exactly the most pleasant people but they quickly set us up and we got a one queen bedroom. When we got our key and paid (no refunds by the way) we went to our room and saw that there were NO sheets on the bed. gross. So after telling them they said they didn't have access to the laundry room or linen closet? Long story short we ended up spending the first night with no sheets. haha but we threw on a sweater a cuddled. We're troopers. The next morning after waking up at 6am basically begging and being overly polite we got blankets. A lot of blankets actually. They were clean just covered in some balls of lint. Better then I expected. Strange things: I saw there were pictures of people having fridges and microwaves in their rooms which I asked about. The older lady claimed that they never had those. Ugh. Whatever. Or that none of the rooms have a jacuzzi, which is pictured on the website. The place is a little more 'rustic' then what is pictured on their website. Cleanliness: The carpets were sticky, and there was some dried red stuff in the dresser drawers, and a cigarette burn in the mattress. But no bugs, mold (that I could see) or anything of that caliber. It was a little grimy but even the bathroom wasn't too bad. All very doable for a week. We only got cold water in the shower, but again, not the hugest deal to me. At the end of the day it was just another thing to sort of laugh at. Oh and someone stole the batteries from the tv remote.
