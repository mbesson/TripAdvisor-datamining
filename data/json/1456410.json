This time I was with a first time Las Vegas visitor, and I thought we might switch to a more traditional Strip Hotel. In the end I stuck with my favorite and after our stay my friend agreed it was perfect. From Matthew at the bell stand to JP and the entire staff at the spa to the pool team,the Mandarin was up to the 5 star rating. The Mozen Bistro staff took our breakfast order the first morning and the next day we simply said bring us the same breakfast and there it was, letter perfect. I recomend the Premiere room, as the best desigined non suite room in town. I have also stayed in the Strip View Suite and it too is wonderful. The Spa itself is worth the stay. even if you don't get a treatment just spending time there a must do. After a night on the town nothing will relax you more. Your Spa journey begins with the ladies at reception who bring tea and slippers then escort you to the spa itself which in my view is a little slice of heaven. Overall the Mandarin Oriental is a great Hotel and a great value compared to the other high end hotels on the Strip.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cExquisite hotel; never wanted to leave!\u201d", "Author": "kawp", "ReviewID": "UR126992571", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the MO Las Vegas for three nights over St. Patrick's Day weekend. Our check-in was seamless and the front desk staff are very friendly, polite, and helpful. ROOM/UPGRADE: We had booked a Cityscape room on the 14th floor (#1410), facing the south end of the Strip. Later in the evening, we realized our adjoining room (not a feature we liked) was having a party. We had chosen the MO because it's a non-gaming, low-key hotel - we weren't looking for a party! Upon calling both security and the front desk late in the evening, and very early in the morning (when the partiers had returned to their room, and wanted to keep it going!), the hotel offered my partner and I either a complimentary breakfast at MOzen bistro, or a room change/upgrade. Obviously we went for the room upgrade. In preparation for changing rooms, my partner and I packed up our belongings prior to having breakfast, so we could easily change rooms after. When we were at breakfast, the front desk called us saying our new room was ready and transferred our luggage there themselves, which was appreciated. We were upgraded to a Strip-view suite on the 17th floor (#1700). The room was almost double the size of our previous room, with spectacular views of the Strip, and best of all: quiet!! We really appreciated that the MO staff handled this problem quickly and apologetically. (I won't delve into the specifics of the room itself, as this has been widely covered in previous reviews of this hotel). DINING: While staying at the hotel, we had room service dinner twice, and ate at MOzen bistro twice for breakfast. Room service, as you'd expect, was delivered efficiently and politely. Our server even apologized for being 5 minutes early, which was completely unnecessary but appreciated, nonetheless. The prices on the In-Room Dining menus are almost identically priced to the restaurant menus, and there is the usual $5 delivery charge. At the MOzen bistro, I had an omelette for breakfast both mornings, which was delicious and certainly more than I could finish! It is a beautiful restaurant, filled with light, and with great views of the stunning Crystals at CityCenter. CAR SERVICE: We booked the car service provided by the hotel ($100 charge in a Mercedes SUV) to pick us up at the airport and drive is directly to the hotel. It saved a ton of time (no taxi line-up), and was such a calming way to start off our stay at the hotel. During the trip, we took advantage of being chauffeured in a Mercedes S-class vehicle anywhere on the Strip (Walter was our favourite driver, so friendly and helpful!). Basically, if you ask for a taxi at the valet, and their car/driver is available, they will take you anywhere on the Strip. That being said, because complimentary use of the car is limited to the Strip, the car is never more than 10 minutes from being back at the hotel. So, if you leave yourself some extra time and don't mind waiting, the car is almost always available. (Keep in mind, though, that the car can be booked for a fee, so it is not guaranteed to be available). We also booked the car service to return us to the airport on our last day, for a $95 fee. Obviously, these fees are much more expensive than taking a taxi, but if you want to take the worry and stress out of travelling, booking the car service is the way to go. LAUNDRY: After spending some time in a nearby hotel's casino, my partner's sweater smelled terribly of cigarette smoke. As this was the only sweater he packed, we needed it dry-cleaned ASAP. I have never utilized laundry services at a hotel before, as I think they are beyond costly, but this was a necessity on this trip! The prices are a bit much, but the service is quick, and the sweater came back smelling (and looking) practically new. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Las Vegas who is not looking for the typical, clich\u00e9 Vegas experience. If you want to stay somewhere peaceful, calm, and exquisitely appointed than I would recommend this for you!", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evanston, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cUnique and relaxing - almost perfect\u201d", "Author": "Coach606", "ReviewID": "UR126967709", "Content": "I've stayed in several hotels in Vegas over the last few years: Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Planet Hollywood, and South Point. Each has it's own niche, but all were essentially the same core concept of a hotel. The Mandarin Oriental is completely different. You enter the lobby to find - nothing really. No check in lines or concierge. Just a beautiful, Asian style lobby and some elevators. You have to go up to the 23rd floor \"sky lobby\" to check in. Unlike other hotels, the Mandarin Oriental is not trying to be an attraction. There is no casino. There are also no throngs of people or long hallways and shops to walk past. You can get in and out in minutes. Since we all know that sinking feeling of realizing you forgot something in your hotel room at the Bellagio and must now walk back to your room, a 10-15 minute journey, the ease of Mandarin Oriental is a huge plus. It's basically Las Vegas' idea of a boutique hotel. It has one coffee shop, a magnificient \"Tea Lounge/bar,\" a bistro restaurant, and one very, very high end restaurant. That's it. Oh, there's a spa and pool, but no shops, no casino, no 50 restaurants you're forced to walk past to get in and out. There is more. The rooms are fantastic. We had a suite and it was wonderful and plush. The staff is excellent. Soft Asian music pervades the elevator. It also seems modestly scented. I was less happy with the pool. More like a lap pool than anything else. Service is excellent but the drinks were insanely pricey and just not worth it. I'd had a gin and champagne drink at the Barrymore the night before and it was excellent. Just the right mixture of everything and huge. One drink had me stumbling out of the place. Well, I paid 20 bucks for one at the Mandarin Oriental pool and it was cloying, sweet, and really only a few sips of drink in a small glass filled with ice. If I'm going to pay 40 bucks for 2 drinks, they need to be spectacular. My wife visited the spa, and it seems to be a magnificent place. Pricey, but definitely worth it, according to her. Her massage and spa treatments were really top notch. Not just a rub down, but many amenities and steps along the way to truly relax you. We also visited \"TWIST\" for dinner, which was exceptional. I mean, seriously exceptional. We've had many high end meals, but this was a level higher than them all. The foie gras melts in your mouth, the caviar is like sea air and the wines... wow. The downside to the hotel is that it can be a bit stuffy. I found myself longing for some humor and some humanity. Everyone is so insanely calm and polite. Another downside is the nit picking fees. $26 Resort fee? It's more psychological than anything else. I mean, this buys you free coffee in the morning, a Wall Street Journal and internet access. But it bothered me to forced into all this. It's like the cable company making me buy 200 channels when all I wanted was HBO and Golf Channel. Also, the nightly parking fee is annoying. I suppose the Uber-rich will not care, but me, I hate to pay for parking in Vegas. I'm too used to the free valet to start paying for it now. So I forewent the $25 per night and parked in the ARIA. It really is a few minutes walk, just over a pedestrian bridge and your there. Super easy. But it was annoying none the less. You pay $450 a night for a suite, but then pay for parking? It's silly, but I couldn't get over it. Overall, it's a great hotel and we had a very relaxing stay. My wife especially enjoyed the hotel as she hates casinos and their throngs of people. For a few days, it's quite lovely. But beyond that, I wouldn't enjoy it. The dining options are very limited, the pool is actually a pretty bad experience on several levels, and some of the nit picking on charges are galling. I would stay here again only if it was a for a few days and only if relaxation was the prime goal. But there's a lot this place doesn't offer. And since I'm not a millionaire, i'm not used to the isolation and uber polite attitude. Made me long for some real human emotion at some point. Yes, I like good service. But the staff here are almost robotic in their politeness.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSerenity on the Strip\u201d", "Author": "Handle_11", "ReviewID": "UR126938360", "Content": "Shaltered from the hustle & bustle of the Strip, this hotel is truly an oasis.

If so, then the Mandarin Oriental is a fine choice. If you are familiar with Ritz Carlton Hotels this is somewhat similar, but with an oriental flair. The hotel is nestled in the heart of City Centre, within a 5 minute walk of the Aria, most of which is under cover. It is also very close to Crystals shopping center where there are some very good restaurants and plenty of over-priced shopping. Again, there is no casino here and only two restaurants. As for the hotel the configuration is a bit odd. To get to the lobby you have to go to the 24th floor (they call it the sky lobby). Off the lobby there is a very nice bar with great views of the strip and with some unique drinks, so look at the menu. They also have high tea in the lobby, a nice touch. The check-in process was painless and the staff was very professional. Now, another oddity, depending on where your room is you need to take two elevators to get to it from the ground floor. I was on the 19th floor, requiring me to transfer at either the 8th or 24th floors. A minor inconvenience. The room itself is spacious, but not necessarily by Vegas standards, but roomy enough. The rooms also have a bit of an odd configuration for the closet area. The touches in the room are very nice. Automated lighting and drapes, a large separate tub with bath salts, tv in mirror in the bathroom and a nice flat screen with lots of stations. The bed was very comfortable and overall the room was clean with nice amenities, but what is expected of a hotel of this class. There is a butler pantry where you can get your shoes shined for free and where they will drop off the paper of your choice. It is locked from the outside. There is also a large safe in the drawer. I did go to the spa and so should you. While again smaller than other Vegas spas the staff was very professional and they offer multiple types of rooms, beyond the typical sauna. Worthy of at least a few hours. The best part of the spa is that it was not teaming with people, which presents a great way to relax. I dislike the larger spas where there are throngs of people as it defeats part of the spa experience. As far as dining I only ate on the 8th floor where there is a sushi bar as well as a nice place to get breakfast. It is pricey, so be prepared, but the food is far better than average. Lastly, if you made it to the end of this review here is a hint, make your reservation with a platinum American Express. You will get various benefits including a $100 spa credit, better rates and very late check-out.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cFun night\u201d", "Author": "dobermandogmom1", "ReviewID": "UR126793882", "Content": "I made a last minute trip to Vegas with friends and stayed at the Mandarin on a Saturday night.

The bar itself was awesome and so were the drinks but the shared appetizers we ordered for a ridiculously high price would not have satisfied a bird let alone three humans. The live band was really good so we stayed a little longer (hungry) to listen to them before we walked down the street to get something else to eat. (BTW the woman who checked us into the hotel raved over and over again about the great food at the Sky Lobby Bar...interesting.)

Minuses: Compared with the Aria's well equipped 'Gym' the Mandarin's 'Fitness Centre' is sorely lacking Breakfast doesn't offer much choice and is not included The business centre will do NOTHING for you without charging a fee. For sending a package via FedEx, the Mandarin extracted a service fee on top of the FedEx fee. To make matters worse, the staff members didn't counsel me against using a PO Box for the delivery of a small box, so the package was delivered much later than it should have been. Asked for a small amount of olive oil or similar to be delivered to the room. Hotel insisted that they would charge for this as a 'food'. Having to take 2 sets of elevators/lifts to enter and exit is a pain. Staff took the liberty of throwing away my plastic spoon, and didn't provide any cutlery. Check-in wanted to charge an exorbitant amount to my debit card upon arrival for each day of stay. Other Vegas hotels charge a far more modest holding fee upon arrival. This required a negotiation I did NOT need to have. Pluses: No smoking policy throughout! No casino. Very close to the strip, but slightly recessed from the strip, so not as noisy as some other properties. Gym is included Free shoe shine and local calls are incl Twist restaurant, although pricey and dishes are unconventional with may not really working well (creativity at the expense of tastiness imho) is worth trying once.

The trip started out with one of the high points as you get to check in without having to wait in the long lines that come standard at the big casino resorts. But from there on I found a lot of things to be annoyed about with the Mandarin. Lets start with the most important - I was really unimpressed by the bedding and the temperature controls in the room. This isn't a problem I have often, and its not a Control 4 issue because I've stayed at Aria multiple times and know how to work Control 4, but I found myself frequently getting overheated during the night. After having housekeeping fiddle with the blankets I finally found a setup that worked for me on night number 4. It wasn't ideal. I was very surprised to find that the TripAdvisor reviewers who complained about noise levels in the room were spot on. Noise in the hallways was very easy to hear in the room, its quite shocking for a 2 year old Mandarin property. I found the elevator system, where you had to change at either the 23rd floor Sky Lobby or the 3rd floor, to be a real pain in the neck. The in-hotel services were not impressive to me. Very few services are complimentary - whereas you can get your suits pressed for free at the Skylofts (if you want to compare this place to the top hotels in Vegas), its a full $36 at Mandarin. MoZen Bistro was frankly poor when I had brunch there, I wouldn't have taken it over any quality Vegas 24-hour restaurant. I've eaten at Twist in the past and thats a world-class fine dining experience but there's no need to stay at the Mandarin to appreciate that restaurant. Finally, the Mandarin lacked the personal touch that a real service-oriented boutique hotel has. Its a bit of a silly complaint on the one hand, and it is to be expected in a hotel of this size, but frankly you pay a premium to get that and I didn't feel it. On the positive side I was quite impressed with the Mandarin Spa. The Concierge was quite good though there was often a wait as there were only 1 or 2 concierges for a 20 floor hotel. The room itself was generally nice and the view in our Strip View room was definitely impressive. Many of the reviews of Mandarin on this site are written by non-gamers. I was in town for a gambling trip with friends and Mandarin also fell short on that front. I thought that it would be fairly convenient to go to Aria to play but while the hotel is quite close as the crow flies, once you take two elevators, climb a tall staircase and then get in on the far side of the Aria and have to hike all the way across the casino floor to get to the good tables you realize its a lot less convenient than staying at Aria itself. I would not recommend this hotel for people coming to Vegas for a gambling trip, and I thought it was generally underwhelming across the board.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS\u201d", "Author": "izari", "ReviewID": "UR125567135", "Content": "This hotel is just amazing.

It is one of the few hotels in Vegas that is no smoking and does not have a casino, but located in the middle of the strip. The staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much for them. The hotel is quite new with a Spa (didn't use), swimming pool (water was a bit too cold), business centre, bar and restaurants. Our room was a Junior Suite (room 1200), on the front corner of the building with great views of the strip. The suite has floor to ceiling windows in every room, hence amazing views The room is large with separate sitting room which has a large tv, mini bar, desk and couch. Going through double doors into the bedroom, with a king size bed which so so comfortable, large tv, dresser, settee and CD sound system. The bathroom is also large, with a double vanity, full deep bath, separate large shower and separate toilet. There is a tv in the mirror of the bathroom which was lovely to have. The robe area is adjacent to the bathroom, with plenty of hanging space, drawers and safe hidden into one of the drawers. There are plenty of nice touches, eg: turn down service, hair straightner, shoe polish, jewellery box, electric curtains. Breakfast was included up to the value of $48.00 for 2 people per day where you selected from the menu and paid any additional cost. The menu was very good and the food excellent. We shopped around for prices and ended up booking directly with the hotel website and got a free night included in the deal. Compared to other hotels, it may be a bit more pricey, but worth it if it fits into your budget. Note, when looking at hotels in Vegas, keep in mind, where there is a casino, there is smoking. It is not like Australia, where we have no smoking, it is full on smoking and the larger casinos are worse. Do yourself a favour, don't just stay around the strip, go to the Hoover Dam, Atomic Museum, Grand Canyon and don't forget the shopping malls - excellent and cheap.

Vegas is all about excitement, shows, Elvis, Casinos etc etc and most of the other hotels are just that.

You feel like, whatever the request, the answer will be 'Certainly Sir/Madam'. Requests to print emails were met with 'absolutely sir, email it to me and I'll sort it' Two minutes later it was brought to our room. All other service requests were met with equal efficiency and speed.

By the way, reception is on 23rd floor with stunning views over the strip and distant mountains. We visited most of the other big hotels during our stay. Whilst I am sure they are all very good the reception areas were usually full of people with bags, most have literally thousands of rooms, we saw guests dragging bags through smoke filled casinos in some and I find it hard to imagine how they can provide the same level of service as the Mandarin with so many more people to cater for. It all depends on what you want. The Mandarin Oriental is a non gaming/non show hotel which allows you to enjoy all that Vegas has to offer within walking distance but also allows you to completely escape it.

Mandarin Oriental stands out above ALL properties in ALL aspects of hospitality. One bonus of the hotel is that it is NOT a casino, yet still close enough to all the action on the strip. The fact that it is not a casino is fantastic as both my boyfriend and I are non-smokers and we have heard much feedback that even the non-smoking rooms at some strip casino/hotels still have a distinct smell and tinge of cigarette aroma. In summary, the staff were EXCELLENT always offering to assist in any way possible, the beds were extremely comfortable and easy to sleep in, complimentary bottled water was also a nice to have. Unfortunately the WIFI was available for an additional fee (we thought this would have been perfect if a complimentary offering as the ARIA next door offers comp. WiFi). The pool area is also fabulous with a nice resort feel and waiters available on hand to assist where possible. It is distinctly different to other resorts where can become jam packed with people and party like. Check in was also seamless with 4-5 staff available to assist at any time on the reception desk (other major hotels on the strip we walked through/had dinner at, appeared to have 100s of people standing around waiting in Queues to be attended to). Parking is available at the ARIA free of charge, which we made use of (5 minute walk next door) Breakfast \u2013 opted not to do this at the hotel as we ventured out a bit. There is a great takeaway coffee / homemade pastry store in the hotel which is attached to the restaurant. ARIA also has a patisserie and cafe within its casino if you wish to try.

The service at the Mandarin was exceptional from beginning to end. One minor note was that we could hear late night party-ers out on the street, though they were muted...some parts of Vegas are unavoidable I suppose. I would definitely stay here again. We paid $400/night for our three night stay, and got a roll-away bed for the suite so that we could accommodate three people in the room.

We stayed one night there together and then moved to the MO where we spent six nights. We had a strip view suite with great views. Every last thing had been thought about to ensure that your every need was met within the room. I have some minor criticisms. When we arrived the desk lamp was not working and when we left six days later the desk lamp was still not working, surprised that the turn down service person did not have the initiative to report it. It was not a big deal to us and couldn't be bothered to waste our time reporting maintenance issues. Also when we arrived I picked up three used dried out disposable contact lenses from the toilet floor, a third had fused itself to the marble when we checked out it was still there. Not a big deal but maybe along with the dust on the side of the bedside cabinet it hints that the housekeeping is not quite as it should be. Most importantly the bed was really comfortable. Having said all that the staff at this hotel are absolutely wonderful - all of them. The room service is really good and the food that is delivered is tasty. Very large portions though as we discovered so the next time we ordered room service we had one meal to share, which was accordingly plated up on two plates with two settings at the table. Breakfast at the MO is really good, the yoghurt with granola was my favourite, but the smoked salmon bagel is good if you have a large appetite, though I noticed they are happy to box up what you can't manage if you might fancy it later. One moan here as well. We arrived for breakfast one morning and were told there would be a twenty minute wait, indeed people were waiting in the corridor - just stood there. We said that wasn't acceptable, the duty manager Patrick came, apologised for the situation and we agreed to have breakfast in our room for which we were not charged. This was not ideal as we were keen to get out and enjoy our day and it slowed us down but better than standing in a corridor like a queue for a soup kitchen. one more thing a big thank you to David who served us our breakfast most mornings. Overall this was a really good stay.

We had dined there in the past and had evening drinks in the bar numerous times but this was our first stay. We booked a suite and requested an early check in (10am) that was confirmed by the hotel but we were not checked in until 3pm. This would have been a real problem with most guests but we had a car rented and were gone until 1:30 so we only had to wait an hour and a half to check in. Had we had to wait 5 hours, I would have really been pissed off. Got to the room and my wife noticed that there were no bathroom items left. At this class of hotel, we fully expected there to be a bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner and the like left in a room at these prices but no. We had to ask the luggage guy to go get some for us when he brought up our bags. He did his best but had some items stuck in his back pockets as he couldn't carry everything he tried to grab. Is this really the top notch service I have heard so much about? Keep reading- When we tried to turn on the TV and relax a bit, we discovered that neither of our TV's worked well at all. Nor did any of the curtains or lights, all of which seemed to be on a minute or two delay after you pushed the button. But if you became inpatient and pushed it twice, then you were either closing the blinds when you were trying to open them and shutting off the TV when you were trying to get it to come on. We fought this stuff for the first two days and then the delay on all things got to be about 5-10 minutes to get anything to react and then we called and got engineering up there. He said they had trouble with this system all the time (same as at the Aria) and he had to climb under the TV's and re-boot the system on both TV's and then go down the hall and re-boot the system from down there as well. Some of the face plates kept falling off the walls while we tried to push the buttons so we just put them back as they fell off (forgot to tell him about that one). After about 20 minutes, he came back and we gave it all a shot again and had to wait a few more minutes. All of this going on as my wife lay on the bed under the covers trying to get some rest. The thing finally re-booted and it did work better for our last night. Believe it or not, we were actually able to rent a movie and watch it! (Unreal! I know!!) Everything still had problems but just not as bad as before. This re-booting of the system actually allowed us to get the curtains in the bathroom to function properly and maybe that was not such a great idea. As such, my wife was able to get the sheer blinds to stay down and the black outs to go up in the bathroom and what a surprise!!! Someone had squirted either lotion (my wifes vote) or had S-E-X in there (my vote) and squirted (you get it by now I'm sure) on the blinds and then proceeded to roll them up! And then we got to roll them down. (oh yea!) It was disgusting to say the least. That sheer blind needed to be removed to get it properly cleaned and possibly thrown away entirely. Even with the system re-booted or not, we could never get the two lamps in our sitting area to turn off no matter what we did. I finally had to lick my fingers and simply unscrew them at night and then screw them back in during the day. I am an architect and if I EVER see this technology that is used in this room come across my desk, my trash can is going to get a quick workout I can assure you. We used the glasses from our bar to make a couple of drinks in the room and then we took them down to the bar with us and left them there. When we went to get a glass to drink a coke, we found that the glasses had not been replaced. We had to drink a soda from our wine glasses the rest of the trip, they were never replaced. Lastly, the lightbulb that was in the shower was burned out for our entire 4 days. I notified the front desk of all these items (had them written down) and was told they would get them fixed before the next guest checked in. I just wish they had them fixed before we checked in. Thats was it, not a sorry, not a apology, not a word. I was just handed my bill and asked to verify that it was correct and asked if I would be going back up to the room as my key was going to be shut off and I would not be able to use the elevators. Needless to say, this was our first and last time at the MOLV. I just expected more from a MO hotel. Sorry to say, it was not delivered. I would expect service like this at the Rio or the Orleans but not a MO hotel.

Having read other reviews on this site, I'm not entirely sure that there is only one MOLV. In my opinion, the MOLV is nowhere near as good as other reviewers suggest, and in many ways, it was below average for a true 5 star hotel. There is no casino, and so there are no crowds, which is a big plus. During my stay, I saw very few other guests. Some people may like this, but I found it all a bit surreal. I was told that the hotel was absolutely full to capacity, which makes it even more strange. The entrance to the hotel is not that easy to walk up to, and so you don't really get anybody walking in off the street, which is a good thing. From the arrivals lobby, you take an elevator to the 23rd floor where the reception is. Views from the windows at night are quite extraordinary. Check-in was straightforwards, although I was annoyed to hear that they are now charging US$24+Tax 'Resort Fee'. I'd already paid US$320/night equivalent through British AIrways, and so to be charged this on top, is a disgrace. I decided that as they were giving me no choice in the matter, I'd spend my money in bars and restaurants elsewhere, and thats exactly what I did. From reception, you take an elevator down to your room. I stay in a lot of hotels on my travels, and I must say that the room itself was particularly comfortable. Everything inside the room was top notch, and the bed was excellent. I should point out that the room was spotlessly clean, dust free and well maintained. I'd arrived at around 8.00pm, so I had expected to see the bed turned down, but it wasn't, and there was no mineral water left in the room, bar bottles to purchase. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a valet cupboard, so no excuses on the hotel's part there. If my 'Privacy' sign was on, water could have been left in the valet cupboard. Service is okay, and what you'd expect, and nothing more than you'd expect of a five star hotel. My bed was not turned down until the third night of my stay, and at that stage, I finally got the free mineral water. The view from my room was okay, down to the swimming pool, which was a wreck- Dirty linen bags and furniture all over the place. Dirt in the pools etc...............I realise it's not the time of year for bathing, but come on, five star....? I've never been to a 5 star hotel before, where there's an outdoor pool, that is so obviously neglected for periods of time. It should be well-maintained at all times, and should not be the visual disgrace that it was. Check-out was straightforwards, as I only had three nights resort fee to pay, and departure straightforwards. I may stay again with family, but certainly not when travelling alone.

I love how high-tech everything was. I don't know what the most favorite aspect of the room was. I guess my fav was curtains opened and closed by a touch of a button on the wall and the remote control using the TV. I loved having the alarm set by opening the blinds--too cool. We ate appetizers at the bar on the 23rd floor-food was good---drinks were good. Nothing about this hotel is bad.

As well, as it's not priced as high as MO generally is in other places, due to the competition in Las Vegas, it's also an attractive value proposition. Having stayed with Mandarin Oriental in New York, Singapore, Las Vegas and Munich, I have to give high (highest) marks for the Las Vegas property, and I think it's certainly the best hotel in Las Vegas itself. Service standards are second to none, and the quality of food, and room are top notch. The attendants in the spa are on the ball and there to help you in any way possible, to the point of you wanting to help them back for being so helpful. Beds are super comfortable, drapes are controlled by switches on the walls, along with touch screen bedside units (which also control temperature and everything else you can imagine). Rooms are nicely appointed, if I were to criticize anything it's that the modern architecture results in some oddball dimensions in some of the rooms, but it's very minor. High definition TV sets have great fidelity, service is quick and careful, it's really the closest you can get to being in Asia with Asian standards for service without flying over the pacific. The spa is welcoming and beautiful as well. I even remember the last time I stayed here, some years ago, where I gave them some clothes for dry cleaning and they came back in 2 hours instead of the next day. And I wasn't even asking for expedited service. I can only highly recommend MO Las Vegas, they know how to run a hotel.

Definately my place to stay from now on after trying other premiums on the strip over the years. - You just have the best of everything at this hotel without all the queues and noise! - If you want that you can get it any time by walking next door to one of the casino's.

The hotel is located directly on The Strip......is there anywhere else in Vegas? and it has fantastic views up and down. Its part of the relatively new City Centre development with a shopping centre and other apartment blocks as part of the complex. The room we had was amazing, an enormous bed with big screen tv that doubles as the control centre for various things such as lights, curtains, music etc etc etc.....I would imagine that for some less tech savvy guests it could be a problem to use; I thought it was great though! Bathroom is enormous and has all the amenities you would expect of a hotel of this calibre. Rooms definitely 5/5. We didnt eat in the restaurant but we did go to the bar a couple of times. Fist time was not so great, had to wait a little too long for drinks and ask for the snacks which should be delivered before the drink! Also the waitress seemed rather cold and unwelcoming on the first visit....more style than substance i think.....she seemed to think she was rather special and the guests were there to look at her! The second visit was much better, a different waitress who was much friendlier and far more efficient.......redeemed! The best bit though is the terrace where the pool and spa is. My wife loved it up there and said the service was fantastic.... Overall a very good stay indeed and its one of the best features of this hotel that it DOESNT have a casino......you can escape from all the light and noise of the Strip to a bit of peace and tranquility in the MOLV!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBar none best hotel in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "RichardAZ", "ReviewID": "UR123992517", "Content": "We've stayed here four times now in various rooms and I can tell you it is the best hotel in Vegas.

At first he was upset that he moved from the Palazzo to the MO because his room was much larger in the Palazzo and the building was more centrally located on the strip. However, he soon came around to being much happier at the MO. We don't gamble so the oasis from the ubiquitous casinos was a relief. Our room was certainly not the biggest ever, but it was big enough..14th floor with a view of the strip, mountains and sunrise. The bed was softer than I prefer (we have a TempurPedic at home), but ended up being quite comfy. Pillows are too hard especially for stomach sleepers, but a quick call had them bringing me up two flatter and comfier pillows. Like others had mentioned, I would have liked a coffee maker in the room. My other only complaint would be that the lighting could have been brighter, especially in the closet/dressing area. Bathroom had many amenities, even a flat iron! First time I've had one offered in a hotel. One complaint is that we ran out of body lotion and I left the tube out of it's place, thinking the maid would pick it up and notice. She didn't. Put the empty container back in it's place without a replacement. But again, these are small issues. Black out curtains were great, but could still hear strip noise. Fortunately, it didn't go on all night long and wasn't an issue at all come sleep time. The food at the restaurants was amazing. So good, in fact, that we decided not to eat anywhere else since we were too tired at the end of the day to get a cab and go elsewhere. My husband said the food at MO was better than the other places he had eaten during the week over at Palazzo, although that food was pretty good. As others have noted, the tea service in the lounge can be slow, but everything is delicious. We didn't realize that you should make a reservation for a seating area and were a bit put off that they gave us a hard time about sitting down for a cup of tea/coffee in a \"reserved\" area (all spots were reserved but no one was there). After that, we made sure to \"reserve\" a time and seating area. Other than that, no complaints. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. Service in the restaurants was great. Being that they have no casino, it was wonderful that we had no trouble with dinner reservations, even changing the time several times. It was never packed.

I fell in love with that bed. The view of the strip was colorful and fun to watch at night and expansive enough to see the mountains during the day. The bathroom, of course, was the size of many Manhattan apartments. The bellmen and the door people were friendly, gracious, and helpful. So why not give it an \"excellent' rating? First of all, the clerk who checked us in was not particularly welcoming, just cool. When I raised a potential problem with a request I had made, she brushed it off. It actually turned out to be a serious problem, and while I did eventually get an apology from the manager, that apology took two days. I expected a lot more, in terms of service. Secondly, a hotel of this caliber should have rooms that are soundproof. We were on the 17th floor and could hear noise from Las Vegas Blvd when the drapes were open. There's probably nothing they can do now, but I hope that doesn't mean the construction is shoddy in other ways. And finally, as others have complained, there is no in-room coffee maker, even though there is a carafe to boil water and some tea bags. I don't buy the explanation that this is because of the Asian ambiance.

Due to the configuration of the building rooms can be strangely angled and to some, small. We stayed in the Strip View Suite and was not nearly as large as our previous stay at another Mandarin however, it was very comfortable and inviting. Electronic wall and bedside controls for everything from shears, blackout curtains, lights and TV. The suite NEEDS better closets and I had to position my suitcase in the bar area. Breakfast in MOzen Bistro was very good however, plan on a leisurely meal as ALL service in Las Vegas is slower than in NYC. Meals can take quite a long time to be served. We enjoyed cocktails in the bar on the 23rd floor and staff service again was ideal but prices extravagant. A quick stop in this bar before our show for five of us, we had two Jameson's on rocks, one martini, two glasses of wine and it came to 104.00. The hotel of this caliber should attempt to have additional cars available for its guests convenience as taxi's and the hired limos can cost widely varying and expensive rates. The Mandarin Concierge is extremely attentive and friendly, excellent service from them as well. Definitely, I would stay here again and ONLY at this hotel as the other hotels such as Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan etc are zoos.

I really couldn't think of anything I would have changed. First off...it was my first time staying at City Center. I usually stay at the Wynn or Palazzo/Venetian, but the Mandarin is just pure luxury. Either that or I'm just getting old. But if you want to see mad drunkenness or coeds screaming at each other or vomiting in a lobby....then this hotel is not for you. If you want more of that \"trashier\" \"no holes barred\" Vegas experience, then you should stay at another hotel. Best of all, there was no smoking in the hotel, but if you wanted the more Vegas element or a casino....the Aria is only a 5 minute walk. Shopping is of course out of this world....5 minutes from the Crystals Shopping Center. Architecturally significant shopping mall....all luxe European goods can be found there. Check out the Assouline bookstore for a very nice collection of books. The service is extremely discreet, and you are not in a MOB of customers. Even the entrance is extremely discreet. There are no 45 minute lines for taxi cabs which can be annoying. Valet parking is extremely efficient. The valets address you by name, ask if you are planning on leaving again for the evening, and it seems your car is ALWAYS there and ready to be driven, and you aren't waiting for a long time for your car to get picked up and brought to the front. Sky lobby is gorgeous....views of the strip, and the bar view is also out of this world! All things you would expect out of a Mandarin Oriental. The receptionist escorts you to the elevator. Lots of personal touches. The concierge helped us book restaurants, and helped us with changes when our party size grew bigger. I stayed in a standard room on a high floor with American Express Platinum Program; so room came with early check in; late check out; free breakfast, and also a spa certificate. Plenty of technology in the room. Everything from the lights to curtains to billing could be operated through the television. I guess the one thing I could say is that the lighting was a little more difficult to figure out...since there were many different ways to turn them on/off. Twice turn down service.....Flower petal left on bathtub. Real orchid in bathroom. Water at bedside at night. All reminiscent of the Mandarin Oriental hotels in Asia. The spa is also very beautiful....very relaxing also. Can't say enough about the hotel. Real 5 star service. Beautiful room. Zen Vegas experience.

Has anyone ever noticed that the air con systems in all Vegas hotels are hopeless? If you are like me, I like a cool/cold room to sleep in. That's just me. Unless the room is 65 or lower, I just can't sleep. So, the first night the aircon basically didn't cool below 72 and i had about 20 mins sleep.The room was so large that the temp in the bathroom was more like 85. I spoke to the duty manager the next day, quite distressed as you can imagine, and raised the issue. At the end of the day, this is the only true 5 star hotel in Vegas and the guest should be able to have the room at whatever temp they want, yes? Long story short, the hotel admitted that the system won't really cool below 70, and they then went out of their way to make me happy. Upgraded me to a suite and they had the techs do something funky to the system in this room to keep it at around 60. Keep in mind is Vegas and every other hotel would do nothing. I have had the same problem at both the Wynn and bellagio, so as mentioned this problem is not unique. Both of those places told me the issue was mine, and the systems are fine. The staff proved to me why mandarin oriental are a class act. They even sent me chocolate biscuits, a fruit platter and a 'sorry' card. Great service negates any other issues in my view. However, if you are like me and like to sleep in a cool/cold room, beware, the whole town has a problem as they all use small, inadequate systems.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMuch needed Oasis\u201d", "Author": "LadyBarballard", "ReviewID": "UR123163747", "Content": "I have been to Vegas on a number of occasions and I have to say that this was the first time I have stayed in the Mandarin Oriental and it was one of the highlights of my stay.

Again, my stay was over Christmas (now an annual event), this time for three nights which were on December 23, 24, and 25. I used the Zen City Getaway deal which is a pay for two nights get the third free, deal. This time I stayed in a CityScape Suite ($425/night for two nights with the third free). These Suites are located on the west side of the building in the corner closest to Aria. Again, I took advantage of the \u201cBreakfast-In-Bed\u201d option and pre-arranged Breakfast Christmas morning in my suite for $25 plus tax. Usually the cost is about $42, so this is a recommended amenity you can order when making your reservation. While there are some negatives that I have been reading lately, I have never experienced what I have been reading. No loud plumbing during my stays. In fact, just the opposite, it was nice quiet and restful. No rude staff, just the opposite. Every single encounter with staff, be it at the front desk, in the restaurant, MOzen, the cleaning people or the laundry delivery, or even at the Salon, would end with the staff saying \u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d This is not an exaggeration, it really is what they said, all of them. All highly skilled and well trained. Check-in of course is on the top floor of the hotel before it turns into condos, the 23rd floor. Above the 23rd floor are the condos. Check-in time is 3:00 just like every hotel in Vegas. Last time my room was ready at 11:30. This time my lodging was not ready until around 2:30. I had an appointment scheduled for 1:00 at the salon for a haircut and checked with the front desk before going to the salon. They were going to give me another Suite because mine was not yet ready just before 1:00. I insisted that they not go to any trouble and that we could stick with the Suite they had set aside for me. As I found out later, this was to my advantage. I had made my reservations back in June and the Suite I was scheduled to occupy was the highest floor for a CityScape Suite, the 19th floor. In fact, the Suite was 1935. Thus, I received the best view possible for the Suite I chose. I received a phone call when the suite was ready (about 2:30) and grabbed my luggage from my brother's room in the Monte Carlo and proceeded to a quick and painless check-in. The Suite is described as 1,040 sq ft. It has a separate living area from the bedroom (see pictures). I really enjoyed the extra space. The bed was ever so comfortable as it was in the Premier Room I had last year. The MO is a true family hotel with not only three channels (CN, DC & Nick) for children, but also HBO and Cinemax channels as well as many HD channels that the other standard hotels will not give you. As mentioned, I got a haircut at the salon. Cost was the highest I\u2019ve paid on the strip, $80. Usually costs are about $50 (Monte Carlo and Mirage). I\u2019ve stayed at the MO in Manila and Jakarta so I was expecting a little bit more than just a haircut, like perhaps trimming ear hairs, or maybe a little scalp message, but that did not happen. For men, I recommend getting your haircut at KimVo in the Mirage and saving $30. I make no comment about what women get at the solon because all that business is another language to me, LOL! I had a wonderful breakfast at MOzen. I recommend you get a side of waffle with your breakfast. It is delicious. I also enjoyed coffee at the little coffee take out area which is open until I think 10 AM or so. There is a water boiler in the room with tea provided. Hint: I bring some instant Starbucks coffee with my own sweetener and creamer to get me out of bed in the morning. If you are so inclined it can really help to get you out of bed so you can get down to breakfast. Here\u2019s another little hint to get you in and out of the hotel faster. You can take the elevator down to the 3rd floor and then you can go around the corner and continue in the lobby elevator to the entrance. You can do the reverse to avoid going out of your way to the 23rd floor lobby to get to your room. There were carols sung by a local school choir (or at least that\u2019s who I thought it was I did not ask I know, shame on me) in the lobby. It was a really nice touch and they were really good. Last year \u201cSanta\u201d put a stocking on my door Christmas Eve, but this year that did not happen. I missed that treat. Next Christmas, I will put the stocking I received last year on my door and we\u2019ll see what happens. I meant to bring it this year, but forgot it at home on my table when I headed out the door. Consider yourself warned MO! Yes, I\u2019m still a kid at heart. Now let\u2019s talk about something serious. While I was there, there was no Resort Fee, so I incurred an $18/day internet fee. The fee supports up to 4 devices. I use my laptop and my ipod. If I stay at a hotel that charges a resort fee, the internet is included. If I stay at a hotel that does not charge a resort fee, like any of the Caesar\u2019s properties, I get two internet charges for about $28. The MO internet fee is a bargain compared to any of Caesar\u2019s properties. With the above said, I noted during my stay that the MO website now says that they will start charging a Resort fee beginning January 1. Other than Caesar\u2019s properties, every Vegas hotel on the strip charges a Resort Fee including the Four Seasons. This Resort fee is being called a \u201cGolden Access Fee\u201d and the rate is $24. It will include Wired and Wireless Internet access, Fitness & Wellness Center access including scheduled yoga or Pilates classes, Morning coffee or tea from 6am\u20138am (I assume this will be in the lobby from a cart or from the coffee shop in front of MOzen), telephone calls, a paper, and overnight shoe shine services. Consider yourself warned! In my opinion, I\u2019d rather see this just be included in the room rate, but I\u2019ve already become accustomed to adding Resort Fees and internet fees to Room charges when comparing hotel costs.

Being from L.A., Vegas is like our backyard, so I've been many times and have stayed at many hotels but I am partial to the Wynn, which is my go-to place to stay but can be pricey particularly on the weekend, and usually splitting the cost with friends. This time I was on my own meeting a friend, who was on a family vacation from across the Pond, for an evening. At the last minute, a great deal for $250 appeared on Expedia for the Mandarin and I quickly booked. I have stayed at the Mandarian Oriental Kahala (now Kahala Hotel) in Oahu a few years ago, so I was familiar with the level of customer service and luxury amentities which did not disappoint. Marina, the front desk manager, was extremely pleasant and checked me in quickly: however, I was slightly disappointed with the view. When I got to my room, I had a view overlooking the pool (NICE) but also the parking lot for the Aria Resort (weird), and a partial view of the Monte Carlo pool (ugly): however, reading the reviews I was glad to be on this side of the resort rather than the Strip because it was quiet. I think the issue is that this is one huge complex with 3 major hotels in one small area, However, for me, this is rather minor when there is a fantastic room and pool. Unless one has the pleasure of staying in a high roller suite, the rooms at the Mandarian Oriental are just flawless and luxurious, even for Vegas standards. The rooms are large, the quality is that of the Peninsula chain. There is a large sitting area with a love seat and desk, floor to ceiling windows, a very comfortable bed, and the bathroom is second to none. At the end of the night, I used the deep soaking tub with the free bath salts, nice. TV was very easy to figure out and MP3 player with great sound. I did not want to leave my room. My friend came to hang, so we just relaxed by the pool for most of the afternoon. There are 3 pool areas, decent size but not the huge Vegas type resort pools, just classy and rather serene. We didn't hit the pool until about 1PM and there were plenty of lounge chairs, wait staff was plentiful, they even came around and handed out free jrefreshing slushes, juices and water. The pool menu could use some improvement, it's a bit too healthy (spa-like) and a bit too Asian-centric, I'd like a plate of nachos or something. We ordered some bruschetta and cocktails. When I wanted just a plate of french fries (not on the menu), the kitchen whipped it up for us, free of charge. What is not free of charge is parking, and that is one reason why I took off a star. For me, parking is huge and most Vegas hotels to do charge for parking, this is the first time I've come across this. In addition, I don't know if it's because of the hotel location, but there's not alot of stuff going on at Aria or Cosmopolitan, so there are not a lot of cabs. When we tried to get a cab to go out for dinner, the valets just sort of stood there, and there was no define area on where to wait for a cab until someone came up to us - it took about 10 minutes to get a cab and we were not waiting in a line either. So, the hotel needs to work on this as everyone takes cabs in Vegas. Overall, a pleasant and quiet stay.

At that time, it was Tripadvisor's top rated hotel in Las Vegas and as far as I can tell - the most expensive hotel in Las Vegas as well. For that reason, I'm going to be extra-picky in my review. There's no casino at this hotel, so it's very quiet, almost too quiet in the public spaces. There's only 2 restaurants in the hotel - the fine-dining restaurant for dinner and the more casual place for breakfast/lunch/dinner. That's in contrast to the other big hotels in town with ~10 restaurants. The bell-hops are very friendly and were good at answering my questions. A downside is that there is no self-parking at this hotel, only at the adjacent Aria hotel. Another negative is that that the only car entrances are on the strip so you'll be stuck in traffic for at least a couple of blocks. There are no car entrances on the side streets. The ground level entrance only has a small sitting area and the elevators to the main lobby on the 23rd floor. When you get out of the elevator, you face a dramatic ground to ceiling geometric wall installation. The main lobby on the 23rd floor has a nice view of the strip, but its also not large. There are a few sitting areas between the check-in area and their cocktail lounge. They serve you a cup of special tea during check-in. The tea was tasty but I felt the service wasn't particularly engaging. The guest rooms are actually below the lobby so you take another elevator down to your room. That's one negative - to get outside you need to take 2 elevators - one up to the lobby & then another down to ground level. I got a standard room with a view of the strip.The view was so-so, it was definitely of the strip - looking at the Crystals mall, Paris Hotel & Planet Hollywood hotel. But it wasn't facing the more interesting spectacles like Bellagio or Treasure Island. As expected, it's a very nice room with high-tech controls for the lights, drapery, weather information, room bills, etc. - on the touch-screen pad next to the bed and the flat-panel TV. The decor is in dark wood, creme colored wallpaper and cocoa-colored fabrics. The headboard of the bed was this curtain made of jade-like pieces. Neat. The bed was very comfortable. There are nice robes & slippers, as expected of an Asian-influenced hotel. The flat-panel TV had a lot of HD channels which is good. Below the TV is both a stocked mini-bar as well as a stocked mini-fridge. Two sides of booze. The bathroom was even better done with beige striped marble used through-out. A large soaking tub in the middle, dual vanity sinks, the shower & toliet behind their own glass doors. There's the obligatory small TV in the mirror. One trend that I wish would go away are the peek-a-boo windows which allow somebody in the bedroom to look into the bathroom. The bathroom was of good size, while the bedroom size was just average, which is to say smaller than I expected for the price. Again, this is the most expensive hotel in Las Vegas, so I expected more. By the front of the door are the closets and an alcove for you to open your luggage. A very fancy gimmick is that the extra pillows are in beautiful Japanese-style boxes. There's large safe in one of the drawers here. The neatest thing in the room was what they called the \"valet closet\". This was a small closet in which the room service person could place items into your room from OUTSIDE in the hallway through a separate locked valet door. Through this valet door they could place new towels or your dry-cleaning without entering your room. Super cool, I hate having to wait for somebody to come to the room! Another cool thing is that when I opened the front door for the first time, the window drapes opened automatically to show me the view of the strip. Unfortunately I didn't check if that could be programmed to happen every time I walked into the room. But there were slight disappointments as well: * bedroom smaller than I expected * the view was only OK * the front desk service was nothing special * no self-parking Competent 5-star hotel, but it didn't blow my socks off...", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cChoose the Four Seasons Instead\u201d", "Author": "wired4travel", "ReviewID": "UR122850571", "Content": "My wife and I have stayed at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas on our last four trips, but decided to try the Mandarin for a three-night stay based on the positive feedback we read on Trip Advisor. We booked a Mandarin Premier Room which was advertised as having a \"commanding view of the famed Strip\". Upon arrival, we were told our room was being upgraded to a junior suite and were given the keys to a 6th floor room that had a view of the driveway for Aria and the bottom of every building in the City Center complex. We immediately called the front desk and were moved to a suite on the 12th floor with a view East to the Polo Towers and the mountains beyond. The view of the Strip was of below average quality and a far cry from the \"commanding view\" advertised on the Mandarin website. The main view which was East included the Hawaiian Marketplace, the Polo Towers, the Travel Lodge and a McDonalds. The room was of average quality for a 5-Star hotel. The drywall was cracked above the shower and the wood floors were scratched and stained. I wish we had read the review of December 28th 2011 before heading to Las Vegas because it was right on. The construction quality is average and the walls are paper-thin. The worst part of our stay was Sunday night when the Hawaiian Marketplace across the street blasted music into the Strip which reverberated through the concrete and steel of the City Center between midnight and 3am. Although we had earplugs in, we could still hear the heavy drums and singing. At 1:30am, we had had enough and called the front desk. At 2:30am we were given a second \"sleeping room\" on the opposite side of the building so that we could have some peace an quiet for an early morning flight. Needless to say, it was an awful nights sleep for what has been described on Trip Advisor as an \"oasis of calm\" from the madness of Las Vegas. Not true. Upon checkout, we spoke with the front desk manager Marina who upon learning about our situation was gracious and removed our room charge for Sunday night. She was empathetic and was a bright spot in our stay. Overall, The Mandarin is at best a glorifed \"The Hotel\". It is not a 5-star hotel and is not in the same league as the Four Seasons.

Our original booking was for 4 nights in a Strip View Suite but we extended to a further 7 nights once we realised how great a hotel this was, we wanted to treat ourselves and relax whilst also being able to enjoy what Vegas can offer and the MO was perfect for this. The service there is second to none, you get treated fantastically. The MO is so close to the strip yet you could be a million miles away when you are in the hotel as it is so serene and relaxed. It was a great place to chill and get away from it all but with the added bonus of being a 1 minute walk from the strip if we wanted to get out and about. The Strip View Suite was fantastic and comprised of a lounge area, bedroom, bathroom and small walk in wardrobe area. All of this is arranged in a corner suite so we also had fantastic views of the north and south of the strip. After 4 nights in the suite we moved to a Premier room for 7 nights as there was no availability in the Strip View Suite for our extended booking dates. The premier room is a more conventional hotel room in terms of shape (rectangular) but as with the suite the decor, bed and finish to the room and bathroom was impeccable. As we were relaxing we used the in room dining option for breakfast and dinner on many occasions - the food was fantastic and it was certainly the best room service food we had ever had by a country mile. The menu had a great selection of Thai, Indian and American food and it was all to a very high standard. We also had a few drinks in the Mandarin bar which has huge floor to ceiling windows and great views of the Strip from the 23rd floor, the cocktails were fantastic and the best we had in Vegas. On NYE we had dinner in Mozen bistro - again the food was great. We then went to the 23rd floor where the lobby had been transformed into a bar where you could get a glass of champagne and watch the crowds below on the strip and the fireworks at midnight through the huge windows. A great experience. All the staff at the MO were happy and personable and every single one provided a very high level of service which was better than any other we have experienced at other 5 star establishments in different parts of the world. We also enjoyed a 3 hour massage and treatment session in a private Spa Suite which was amazing and very relaxing after a long old year. This cost a bit but it was a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to anyone. The general spa area was also very good.

I normally write longer reviews, but there is really nothing to fault on this one. Without a doubt, the best city hotel, and room, I have ever stayed at/in. At $400/500ish a night, it is not cheap for Las Vegas standards (where you can get lavish rooms in some of the gaming resorts for much, much less). In fact, it probably is one of the most expensive options in town, if not the most expensive. However, considering that it is a non-gaming hotel (and therefore cannot use the gaming revenues to subsidise room rates) and the fact that if it were located in any other major US/European city, you\u2019d probably have to pay double for comparable quality, the Mandarin Las Vegas is an absolute steal.

Even before we stepped one foot on this City Center property, the staff went out of its way to get to know our needs and preferences. Then, during our entire stay, we were greeted warmly and by name. The room was spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and equipped wth the latest technology. Everthing was operated by remote control, including the lights, curtains, thermostat and televisions. We loved awakening to the alarm that slowly opened the curtains, raised the lights, and turned the television to a sunrise beach scene. Housekeeping serviced the room twice a day, including turn-down service complete with flower petals. I regret not making it to the spa, but the pool area was very nice and not crowded. The poolside menu also was excellent, though a little pricey. However, the friendly staff circulated quite often with complimentary smoothies and frozen fruit.

However, the great thing about this site is (usually) the reviews help avoid making too many Xs on the wrong side of the page. (Bored already?? Scroll to the bottom that pretty well says it all!) With this in mind I booked a week at the \"Top Rated\" Mandarin for my 30th, let\u2019s start with the fact my GPS was stolen from baggage check at the front desk (this was after we left our luggage with the desk because the room wasn't ready). When we finally got into the room we were greeted with a urine stained toilet seat, suspiciously spotted glass, and gunky counter and fixture surfaces. The 'zen' view included parking structures, commercial rooftops, the back of a few casinos, and of course a rollercoaster just far enough away to make more annoying than interesting. We asked for a clean room and were 'upgraded' to the strip view room, this little beauty included torn bed sheets, holes in the pillowcases, perpetual cooking smell, and a dirty streaked view of the strip mall across the boulevard. True you can make out the strip if you kink your neck sideways and smoosh your face into the aforementioned glass but unless you were looking for petri dish samples I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. We didn't spot any dried fluids this time so between the jet lag and dwindling dinner reservations decided to settle. After a few days of note passing with the maids we got a reasonably clean room and the sheets and cases were replaced. The interesting thing was how the staff handled the initial complaint, over the next two days they twice referred to our issue as having a 'problem with the view' I wasn't in Vegas to fight so figured lesson learned next time I stay at the Wynn. Now the fun stuff, as for the missing GPS I assumed (despite stacking it with my battery charger, phone charger, ipod charger, and other electronic odds and ends in my carry on) I left it behind at home when I went looking for it and couldn't locate it at the hotel. When I got home and retraced my steps I realized the GPS was in the bag which only left my side during the time it was checked..... I contacted the hotel and made it clear that theft was the tipping point and provided a summary of the points above. In a word their response was underwhelming...first type of complaint...cleanliness below usual standard....hotel engineer says 'cooking smells' not possible....theft under investigation.....and the icing? Offer for a complimentary one night stay in a 'strip view' room so I can enjoy the 'true Mandarin experience' HAHAHA This was direct from the GM after taking a week to respond and then explaining neither of my email addresses worked (despite having received a response from two other members of his staff) I figured he could have taken the three minutes to check before sticking his foot in his mouth. Axe to grind? Only with over priced sub standard accommodation that would have trouble passing itself off as a 'world class five star spa' in the outskirts of Mogadishu. The only thing worse than knowing I could have stayed at the Four Seasons or Wynn for the same price is knowing I spent the equivalent of a weeks stay on cocktails at the hotel bar and could have walked out and got a cleaner room at Circus Circus instead.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable and then even better yet\u201d", "Author": "yanasim", "ReviewID": "UR122454287", "Content": "Probably the best hotel we've ever stayed at!

Vegas is obviously a favorite on this site... it's the #1 Vegas Hotel on TripAdvisor. Due in part to this, we decided to stay here instead of the Wynn Encore for a Vegas trip this holiday season. I was curious about it... not anymore. I loved the Mandarin in Honolulu (the late Kahala M.O.) and really like the Mandarins in NY and Miami. This Mandarin falls short. The hotel, located on the edge of the City Center project (a disappointment in itself) is really rather stunning inside -- the lobby and lobby bar on the 23rd floor are especially beautiful. Most of the service (with the exception of the greeters... who usually just ignored us when we came out) was great... really great. The Female Front Desk Clerk (from Sherman Oaks!) was the best. The elevator greeter/security guy was extremely nice, as was the bellhop who brought up our bags. (Note: They actively try to discourage you from bringing up your bags yourself by telling you your room's not quite ready... that way they can hold your bag for you, which means they tag it and have it delivered). The bag thing was annoying, but here are the bigger problems... most of which stem from the fact this luxury tower was poorly constructed (remember, the 30 story Harmon \"Hotel\" in the same complex is uninhabitable due to mistakes in building and will probably be torn down). Issue #1. The plumbing is Motel 6 loud. The impressively huge two-person soaking tubs (which people like to use late at night) have speedy tub fillers that are EXTREMELY loud. So loud they WILL wake you up. And up. And up... because the bathers upstairs will keep refilling it. Issue #2. The walls are THIN. Very thin. I could hear the TV next door pretty well. Traffic noise from the Strip is also noticeable, as this hotel's top floor is the 23rd (Condos are on top of the tower). Issue #3. The A/C didn't work properly. Either too hot (70) or too cold (65). It would not hold any temps in between. We didn't bother calling the front desk about any of these things... it was 2 AM and at that point, the ship had sailed. A good night's sleep was not in the cards. As for the room itself, our first impression was GREAT. Really generously sized. Extremely elegant (except for several semi-nudes of Asian women either framed as wall art or used as screens... all the decor skewed a little too Asian... yes, I know this is an Asian chain... but it felt like the room had Vegas theme which was \"China 2012!\"). Very good bed. Unfortunately, lots of computerized lighting and temperature switches and control panels... which were cool but extremely hard (but not impossible) to figure out. All fluorescent lighting means no dimmers. Room and bathroom was either BRIGHT or not. I did, however, love the large dressing area/closet/suitcase area by the front. The views are not great. I shudder to think what the least expensive category rooms look at... (the parking garage?). We were given an upgrade... which was nice (it has the same view as the formal restaurant)... but what you look at is the Hawaiian Marketplace and the Travelodge across the street, rather than the Strip itself. Kind of sad to face. Avoid the room service at all (high) costs. Extremely friendly on the phone and in person, but the food was seriously subpar and (predictable) expensive. The food quality seems to be a problem at every M.O. I've stayed at. Glad we packed a big container of Tums. There is no gift shop. Some other potential issues. The pool is closed for the winter. The whole WINTER? Really? How can this be at a 5 star hotel? Also, self-parking doesn't exist. You have to park at the Aria self parking garage and drag your bags about a mile unless you want to valet park. Another thing. You can't check out on the TV. So you have to wait on the phone (a long time) to leave. Overall, I was really hoping to love this place and leave feeling like I had a great Vegas vacation. We left feeling like we'd just spent the weekend at Guangzhou's (second) best hotel. With our problems, our poor night's sleep and their come hither Asian nudes, I can't recommend staying here on its own merits. Do stop by for a drink at night in the bar and enjoy some of the design details. You'll experience the best of the hotel that way. I personally missed the Wynn Encore's sense of cutting-edge Vegas elegance and glamour. Starting with Bellagio, Steve Wynn made high-end Vegas what it is today.

There are so many positives that you have to get past the few seconds it takes to switch elevators to get in & out of the hotel...once you walk out the door (nicely tucked away & was very peaceful), you are approximately 25 yards from The Strip, (and less than 1 minute away from CVS 24-hour Pharmacy, which came in really handy considering we had 2 boys). Gambling wasn't a priority (luxury and peace was), but I did manage to visit Aria's casino, which is right next door. We have stayed at Palazzo, Encore and Bellagio before (they were all excellent), but Mandarin exceeded our expectations. Wife really enjoyed the spa. We rarely had to wait more than 5 seconds for an elevator, and getting our car from valet was never an issue as the car was always there, whether we called ahead when leaving our room or having valet offer to leave the car in front when we were back to the hotel for an hour or less (just to change clothes or whatever). All staff was excellent - felt like they were truly glad to have us as guests. We stayed in a Strip-View Room for a night, then moved to a Strip-View Suite for the next night (yes, it was a pre-planned \"treat\")...both could not have been better - I did not notice anything negative, as far as cleanliness goes.

It was only the next morning that Mandarin confirmed again that we can use Aria's pool. The matrass is very soft - we assumed that Mandarin Oriental will follow the Asian practice and have firm matrass, which (again) is needed for my back. They could not change it to any firmer options for us, which meant back pains and a poor sleep at night. They don't have a buffet breakfast, it is only available during weekends.

The idea of staying somewhere smokefree was appealing. I booked on my Amex Platinum Luxury Hotels and Resorts website. I enjoyed the location. I enjoyed breakfast and ate no other meals there.

I was really too tired to address it that night but was nauseated by the smells all night. I spoke with someone at the front desk and the problem was fixed by redirecting a vent. The person preparing my room was leaving when I first arrived. The smell was very obvious but initally I thought it was something correctible by just turning up the air. I suspect they must know they have this problem already because they fixed it so easily and others must have smelled it. It should have been already addressed by them in my opinion.

I called about 7 am and security found that someone was working on the pipes in the room near me. The problem was corrected but by that time a second night's sleep was disrupted.

Indeed, truth be told as reviewed by other travelers, it is the best hotel In Las Vegas. It is tranquil, an oasis away from the mass, the smoke, desperation and cheap thrills. It is an elegant hotel, not diluted by casinos, eateries, gift shops or meandering crowds. First impression is the swaying bamboo that greets you at the front door. Next are the friendly doorman and efficient bell captain; they were the only people that greeted me by name throughout my stay. Impressive is the doorman, Glenn; he is an utmost professional, with an incredibly keen memory and always pleasant. The rooms are well laid out with very comfortable bedding. All things are electronically controlled and views of the strip are superb. Aroma therapy toiletries are generous in size and the soaking tub unforgettable. Lacking is the little greeting notes I have come to expect from the general manager. Also, no fruit platter or fresh cut flowers. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the sister hotels in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Other pluses of this hotel is the housekeeping; extremely efficient and always kept the chambers spotless. Complimentary shoe shines are done within the hour. I was surprised to find my mind shirts and pants neatly folded on my return. Very impressive. Downside is the reception; they are eye candies, but the presentation lacking. I am left with an overall feeling that they are bunch of young kids playing house. After a few interactions, I can't help but feel that the individuals holding court are amateurs. They hesitate on questions, uncertain of answers and mutters when asked to rectify erroneous charges. Other downside is that the hotel pool will not be opened until March, 2012. I was told that we can use the adjoining property's pool about half a mile away. We left the hotel rested; the rooms were superb, comfortable and beautiful. It is indeed one of the best hotel in North America. Overall, the staff is eager to please and requests quickly met. However, it is not up to the Mandarin Oriental standards I have experienced in Asia. In Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, the receptionist and staff manager walked us to the car and waved until we turned the corner. My last impression here is the receptionist muttering in low groan when asked to removed an erroneous charge; limited eye contact as he handed over my receipt. Housekeeping is superb as well as the doorman, Glenn; he was superior than the cohorts at MO sister hotels. I highly recommend this hotel for relaxation and family time in Las Vegas.

Keep in mind that there is no casino or club at this hotel, so if you are looking for that scene this won't be the place for you. The crowd is also slightly more \"mature.\" The hotel is right in City Center so Aria is next door, Crystals mall in next door, and the Cosmopolitan is a short walk away. That means you can easily get to a casino or a popular dance club very easily but you can escape it if you want by just heading back to the Mandarin. What you do get when you stay there is no crowds or lines to wait in- either at check in or breakfast or the bar. You get personalized service with attention to detail from the warm towel to freshen up when they greet you to the personal escort to the elevator. The hotel is relatively new and there is no smoking and it is kept very clean. This means the wife is happy! We had a strip view room with a king bed. The view was nice, the room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. They have full automation of the lights, room temperature, curtains, music, and tv from the tv controller and a small touchpad near the bed. This was very convenient and included features like sleep timers and wake up call modes. We ate at the Mozen Restaurant twice for breakfast and it was very yummy. Even when things are not perfect they take care of you. My friend ordered the steak and eggs and the steak came out undercooked for him. The waiter apologized and took the steak to have it corrected. They offered him some fresh fruit and bread to hold him over while he waited. Then the manager came out to apologize for the error and said that he informed the chef and that it will be corrected. When the steak came back it was a new one, not just the same one cooked more and was done perfectly. In the end they did not charge him for it either. We dad drinks at the view bar which featured live Jazz the nights we were there. Went to the spa which was one if not the nicest spas I have ever been to with great personalized service.

Standard was top. Very happy. The pool cafe was also great. Kobi beef sandwich easily large enough for two and the Muesli in the morning a great way to start the day. The gym and swimming pool are great. Loved getting over my jet lag in the gym watching the sun come up. The swimming pool area is very nice. Great place to escape Vegas and chill out. All my freinds kept coming to visit once the saw how nice it was. The place is very modern with dark stylish interior. I loved the design. Some great touches. If there was one point of feedback, some of the halls and spaces are quite dark. Could do with the lights being turned up a little. Defiantly recommend if you want to treat the other half or yourself.

The atmosphere is totally zen, and the spa is fabulous. The room we stayed in faced Monte Carlo/Mandalay Bay / the airport, and the room was bright, open, and a pretty good size. As a prior reviewer said, the lighting panel can be slightly confusing, but it's not really a huge deal. One thing to note though - the bathroom isn't walled off; it's pretty much all glass, meaning that someone sitting in the bedroom can see into the bathroom from certain angles. I'm not sure if that's the case in all rooms though. In all, I really enjoyed the room. The best part of the Mandarin Oriental has to be the service. All the employees are friendly, professional, and always happy to help. That said, the service at the Mandarin is truly amazing. My husband and I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Macau, and the service here is just as good. It goes without saying that a stay here isn't cheap. However, any casino/hotel of a similar quality in Las Vegas is going to cost just as much if not more, so it's a great deal. Additionally, they are very accommodating (which goes back to great service). We arrived at the hotel at about 9am but were checked in on the spot without any questions. I'm guessing that this probably wouldn't happen during peak season, but then again, I'm not sure we would've gotten that if we stayed anywhere else. In summary, the hotel is new and luxurious, is centrally located on the strip, and the service is excellent. The casual restaurant is also pretty good.

The first surprise was the Sky Lobby on the 23rd floor. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful and the staff were attentive and friendly. A member of staff shows you to you room. Do take some time to read the technology guide in the room as the curtains open electronically and the lighting system is a little complex. At all times the staff were extremely courteous and polite. The hotel feels secluded, has easy access to the strip - turn right as you leave the lower lobby and you will find a CVS pharmacy, with Walgreens just across the road. Turn right as you leave the lower lobby and you wiill find stairs leading to Aria and The Crystals. We stayed in a premier room with kingsize bed, desk, small sitting area and hanging space with drawers. The room tea making facilities, but no coffee, not even instant. Coffee had to be ordered through room service or there is a Starbucks in the Monte Carlo casino next door. There was a large bathroom with separate bath and shower. We don't care for the modern trend of having bathrooms with glass walls that seems to be popular now. The pool was outdoors and unheated which means opportunities foe swimming are limited. The poolside area is very nice and the is a an outside hot tub. The corridor to the pool and spa is completely black with little lighting and it is very difficult to see when entering from the bright sun. I found this rather disorientating. There is a large range of facilities in the Spa. I had a massage which was very enjoyable, but I felt the masseuse's training was fairly elementary. The price was steep at US$220. Breakfast is available at MOzen on the third floor - buffet is US$24 + gratuity, eggs are extra, or you can walk to the much more inexpensive buffet at Aria. A la carte menu also available at MOzen. Do have afternoon tea in the Sky Lobby with a view of the sun setting over the strip. Overall we enjoyed our stay, the room was very quiet at night except for the sirens from the strip in the early morning hours but I think that is unavoidable in Vegas. We did find the electronic controls for the lighting and TV annoying, especially when the turn down service left the tv on the Mnadarin channel. There was no guide to the TV channels in the room.

It was our first stay at both hotels. The rates at the Mandarin (MO) are on the pricey side for Vegas, but the quality of the experience is well worth it, and is a relative bargain compared to rates at other MO properties. The non-gaming MO is an oasis of serenity and civility, seemingly far from the madding crowd. It would fit nicely in any major city, and is a good representation of the MO brand, with the Asian inspired decor that is a hallmark of MO in evidence throughout the hotel. Indeed, if all the window views were blocked, you could comfortably be in another sophisticated urban environment. ARRIVAL. The hotel sends a pre-arrival e-mail should you wish to contact them about anything beforehand, such as spa reservations. The MO is part of the vast CityCenter complex that includes the Aria and Vdara hotels, the Veer residence towers, plus the high-end Crystals shopping mall. There is also the exoskeleton of what was to be the Harmon Hotel, which apparently is having both structural and economic difficulties. The MO tower also has residences above the hotel. The MO has no self-parking; overnight valet parking is $30. One can self-park at the adjacent Aria. The MO has an elegant ground level lobby where the doormen, valets and bell services stand, but one checks in at the 23rd floor Sky Lobby. This is the highest level of the hotel--one uses separate secure elevators to access one's room on lower floors. Floor 23 also houses the Twist Restaurant, Tea Lounge, and Mandarin Bar. This is as far as the looky-loos can go, and you will see some, usually checking out the views from the Tea Lounge. Our check-in experience was professional and smooth. The room was not quite ready, but was within an hour. The receptionist will escort you to the elevator and have your luggage sent up. ROOM. We booked a Junior Suite, about 850 square feet, located at the end of the hall. The Jr. Suites are on lower levels, higher up they are called Strip View Suites. As soon as we exited the elevator, a familiar scent greeted us--it seemed identical to that used at the MO Hong Kong which we visited in Jan. The ends of the hotel are very angular, with lots of acute and obtuse angles. Upon entering the suite, the drapes opened, and the TV screen was on, as one can control all the room features from the remote--lighting, drapes, temperature, etc. The entry has a valet door (as do all rooms). The living room had a sitting area with a fresh fruit platter, plus the huge HD TV (with a concealed DVD/CD player) sitting on a large console that housed the minibar and fridge, plus a hot water kettle. The bedroom was beyond double doors, and had another TV/DVD player. The desk had a technology kit filled with cables and what not. The touch screen alarm clock by the bed also controls room functions--one's \"alarm\" can be set to be certain lights turning on, drapes to open, selected TV station on. The TV also had music and nature sight and sound selections. The dressing/closet area was a bit tight but had all the amenities--iron and board, slippers, umbrella, blanket, safe, robes, etc. The bathroom was huge, with 2 sinks on opposite sides of a free standing tub, upon which rose petals were placed nightly. The sinks interestingly were not porcelain, but enameled metal. There were lots of cleverly boxed amenities, mostly contained within a jewelry box-like vessel. The large marble shower stall could have used a bench. The extra roll of toilet paper in the WC was hidden in an embroidered tasseled bag. SPA/POOL/FITNESS. The spa is lovely and fairly large, covering 2 levels. Rates are higher on weekends. There is a fee for access if you don't have a treatment booked. There are a variety of heat, water, and relaxation experiences: a relaxation lounge (with bed-like chaises from which your therapist will call you), steam room, Laconium (a room with a warm tile bench, less intense than steam), Vitality pool (a large jacuzzi with slatted metal chaises--the attendant will place a towel pillow under your head) and warm and cool experience showers (a shower where you select your experience from a touch screen, which directs varying types of water flow, mist, music and lighting--very Vegasy). Men have a dry sauna, women have a Rhassoul, which involves mud application. There is also a coed Hammam room--a tiled marble table for exfoliation, plus benches. I enjoyed a 2 hour \"Stress Buster\" treatment, which included a body scrub, hot stone massage and facial massage. The pool area also is fairly large considering the size of the hotel, with 2 long lap pools, a couple of jacuzzis, a cafe and a variety of lounging areas including cabanas. It is on the southwest side of the hotel for afternoon sun. The fitness center is also fairly large, with a studio for yoga and other classes. DINING/BAR. We only tried the Mandarin Bar and the MOzen Bistro for breakfasts (included in our package). The Bar probably has the best public views from the hotel, situated as it is on the highest hotel floor and closest to the strip, with north, east and south views. Be aware that all north views will be dominated by the CityCenter complex. The drinks were tasty, the sliders good but not warm enough. MOzen, situated on the 3rd floor along with the meeting rooms and business center, is a busy place at breakfast--foreign guests and a lot of business folks (there was another large convention at the LV Convention Center). The food was decent, but one time took about 45 minutes to arrive. The continental buffet was elegant but far from ample. For dinner, the Bistro offers pan-Asian menu. ODDS & ENDS. Our biggest ding for the MO was no free Wifi! In the Business Center, internet access is free for 5 minutes, but your time is constantly interrupted by pop-ups asking if you want to extend your time for $10.95 for 15 minutes. The hotel has a complimentary house car on a first-come, first-served basis. It was never available for us, so we had to take a taxi to our convention. Although the MO is non-gaming, Aria and Monte Carlo are short walks away, with the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio a bit further. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. This is one of the more elegant and quiet hotels on the Strip, similar in vibe to the Four Seasons at Mandalay, but a bit further removed from the madding crowd. Service was of high quality throughout, and the hotel's smaller size makes for a more personal stay. This is not the place for you if you want to be in the middle of the action, but you really only have to take a few steps outside for that.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding and Absolutely Unbelievable\u201d", "Author": "Stephen M", "ReviewID": "UR119608762", "Content": "We chose this hotel as it is does not have gambling anywhere.

The electric curtains opened up as we walked in and provided a great view of 'The strip' The suite was well furnished and had a number of extras not usually seen in 5 star hotels. From the usual bathrobes (very good quality) to a host of technical gadgets & electrical adaptors. My wife thought the ornate drawer box in the bathroom was a nice touch, This contained everything from sewing kit, manicure set and even toothbrush/paste and razor / creme. Many hotels have these but you allways have to request them. The bathroom contained a massive shower and huge marbled bath tub with rose petals at the side, bath salts and various other bits and pieces. We ordered room service as we had just had a 6 hr flight in from New York. Very good quality delivered in 20 minutes. The additioonal fee of $6 + tax + tip is very reasonable for Vegas. Breakfast was also excellent (both in the room and in MoZen restaurant) Huge variety of both American and oriental cuisine. During our second night the Air con in the bedroom failed. The staff could not have been more helpful and instantly upograded us up to a Dynasty suite. This was totally unbelieveable and has to be seen. Go to their website to see these suites. The outdoor pool complex is situated on the 8th floor. It has 2 pools, jacuzzi + childrens pools. Plenty of very helpful and keen staff. Plenty of loungers, and occational furniture. The staff move the parasols to where you require without you needing to ask. Luxury Cabanas at an extra fee, these have TVs, fans, mist sprays and sofa / furniture as well. The food around the pool is quite exceptional. The Spa is without doubt the best we have ever visited. The treatments are very expensive at around $250/300 each, but worth the experience. The hotel was so good that we extended our stay at The Mandarin Oriental. The staff are quite exceptional. Very polite, helpful and knowledgable. They are also discreet and don't hover around you hankering for a tip. In conclusion, the best hotel we have ever stayed in, better than the best London can offer, such as The MO in London, Claridges, Savoy, Ritz, Hempel, Blakes etc etc. Only 1 hotel has ever come close and that is The Landmark. We had been told that you can wait for 10 minutes for cabs at this hotel We never waited more than a minute. The hotel is very select, does not allow visitors or browsers in. Visitors are only allowed in if they have booked one of the restaurants or a spa treatment. This keeps the hotel exclusive and secure. The location between The new City Center complex and Monte Carlo is very good, (Midway between Bellagio and New York New York) and right next door to Crystals, which has the most exclusive designer shops in LV.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterlooville", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "SallyJonesCowplain", "ReviewID": "UR119551800", "Content": "Have just spent an amazing week at the Madarin Oriental in Las Vegas.

The Service, this is impeccable! Probably the best service we have ever gotten in a hotel, by far. 2. The Cleanliness and overall feel of the hotel, very quite, clean and room was fairly spacious. The Cons (a longer list): 1. The water pressure and shower, this is THE worst shower I have ever taken, at a hotel or at home! THE water literally dripped from the shower head! This was such an issue that we had to call the front desk (we honestly NEVER do this), to which they sent up an engineer and he said that this seems like a normal shower. After which the front desk rep said that she would try to locate a room for us with better water pressure, an hour late we received a phone call that all the rooms and suites had the same water pressure. Again, the service was beyond belief, and I appreciate their efforts. Never the less we were stuck taking these horrible showers for 3 nights. 2. The Spa, I have no idea what spas people go to, that they rank this spa in their top spas??? I mean there was nothing special, and the size is fairly small. previously I have been to the spas in Encore, Pallazo, Venitian and Aria, and all of those rank above the Mandarin spa. The BEST being the spa at Encore. Mandarin spa does not rank anywhere close to it. Not to mention we were charged $60 per person for just the use of the spa facilities. 3. The Pool, it was just way too small. There were two pools on the deck, and one of them was so narrow that only one person could swim laps there at one time. It was a very relaxing area, which you would expect from Mandarin, and the music was melancholy. It the kind of place where you would take a nap instead of having the fun Vegas pool experience. 4. The Food, while the food was by no means bad, it was terribly overpriced and only mediocre (again, by Vegas standards). The Bottom Line: at the end of our trip I always reflect on why i liked or didn't like something, and here is what I came up with for Mandarin. If this hotel was in any other city, say New York, Chicago, Los Angeles even, I probably would have LOVED it. Yet, having stayed at other Vegas hotels, again: Encore, Wynn, Pallazo, Venitian, Mirage, they all are better than MO. You just don't get the luxury and and the beauty that you get at those other places, not to mention the pools, the INCREDIBLE food, and the spas. We found ourselves going to that side of the strip every day.

We arrived very late on Friday night (11:30pm). An employee of the hotel met us immediately after we got our bags out of the car and whisked us directly to our room. No Check in necessary and we signed our credit card authorization once in the room. Nice gesture and great since we already had a long day. Room: They upgraded us to a StripView Suite and when we walked in we were a little perplexed. The living room is on a very weird angle so you feel likes its very small. When he opened the blinds we were facing the \"ugly side of the strip\" meaning gift shops, convenient stores, etc. The bellman came up with our bags and the closet was very small, especially for a suite. We only had 6 hangers and hardly any space to put our shoes and other items as well. Our Bedroom was comfortable and the view was great from that room (very small window). I was not thoroughly impressed although the quality of the doors, bed, and lighting was top notch. I guess they put 500 sq. feet of the 800 in the bathroom. Bathroom was giagantic with a two person soaking tub, massive shower, seperate toilet area, and two sinks. So, it was nice overall and my suggestion is save some money and get a normal room if you can. Spa: Including all the Vegas hotel spas mentioned above I've probably been to 40+ spas around the country. This is in my top 2. The facilities were spectacular, clean, and service level amazing. I got there an hour early and the attendant showed me around (Sauna, Steam, Laconium (which is in between heat levels of suana and steam), 2 rain shower experiences (not one for a bar of soap, just for standing in and hitting the digital screen for various body sprays), a hot tub (had 4 loungers built in that had individual bubblers, so if anyone was in there with you it would be like lounging at the beach next to someone not staring at each other). Also, they had many heated relaxation loungers in there as well. I was there on a Saturday at 10am and only saw one person for 10 minutes. Later I found out they try to schedule things this way for the ultimate privacy and relaxation. The attendarnt literally followed me around and would pop up with clean towels and cold towels when I stepped out of each room. Seriously Jonathan needs to get a raise or a promotion. For me to remember his name is saying enough. This was our trip without our baby (first one) and I booked a time capsule 2 hours in a spa suite. The spa suite is worth every penny. It has an amazing shower, hot jacuzzi for 2, loungers, massage tables, and more. Pool: We did rent a cabana for the day and we had a lot of fun. However, for a new hotel I did not find it that nice. Yes, its Mandarin Oriental and its clean. However, staying at the Cosmopolitan and seeing there pool scene and cabanas (with clear hot tubs) this seemed a little dated. Again nothing wrong with it, but it was just OK. Service at the pool was again OK and I'm not sure I would be dying to run back there. After the spa day I expected a more \"sanctuary\" like pool area. Food/Restaurants: We had breakfast at Mozen Bistro and it was mediocre. I got the menu and it coffee stains on every page. I looked over and the whole window sill and crumbs and dirt all over the floor. We got an omelet and I got the ham and egg sandwich (well it had no top so I guess it should be called open faced). I could have a better breakfast food anywhere on the strip. Also, since this place has no casino its charging breakfast like any high end resort. 20+ dollars an entree, so it better be damn good. We never ate again at the hotel and its very boring there. Obviously I went to have a place to relax and have fun on the strip. However, they never make it that inviting to want to stay at the hotel and have fun one night. Overall I absolutely loved the hotel and the vibe for wanting to have a relaxing time in Vegas when you want to get away from it all. However the room and food would maybe have me think twice if its not a romantic getaway.

It is wonderful to have both the sheer curtains and the black-out curtains able to be opned or closed from the wall buttons. Lighting and tv also are done by wall button. Large extra firm pillows are on the bed and great for sitting up to read or watch tv. Call housekeeping if you prefer smaller soft down pillows for sleeping. Good closet space for a short stay. Bathroom is also big in size. Tub was okay for one person but not that comfortable. Shower is large, and the water pressure is okay. Great assortment of amenities. Soap smells really good. Double sinks. Towels were disappointingly thin. Toilet is in a frosted glass enclosure - fine if only one person is in the room - odd if two were in the bathroom. Toilet paper roll in an odd postion. Service throughout the hotel is outstanding, from the valet to the concierge, to the housekeepers. Breakfast is excellent on the third floor. Room service food was good, and brought on time. Twist Restaurant on the 23rd floor is very romantic for dinner, with a great view. Soundproofing in the hotel is excellent, and it is refreshing to have a quiet relatively uncrowded spot in Las Vegas. It would be my hotel of choice in the City, partially because it is new and has all the amenities you want in a luxury hotel, and also because it is smoke free, which is wonderful. Cirque du Soleil water show at the Bellagio was outstanding. Try to watch the fountain show at night in the front of the hotel, as well. Informal yet expensive Wolfgang Puck's 'Cut' Restaurant had superb kobe beef steaks and a delicious banana cream pie for dessert.

Rooms and suites are very nicely appointed. 2.) Pool area was never crowded and the service was immediate and genuinely friendly. 3.) The staff - WOW - what a quality group of individuals. The staff we met during our month were genuinely friendly and service oriented. Many of them were serious professional hoteliers and not just there for a paycheck. You could tell they enjoyed their jobs and took pride in providing a high level of service. Not one time did we meet an obvious \"tip monger\". If you're a regular traveller to Las Vegas you know what a \"tip monger\" is without need for further explanation! 4.) The excellent center strip location. Close to everything. 5.) Quiet discrete low-key luxury. Not walking through a casino to reach our room was a very pleasant luxury. You can't go wrong with this hotel. Why choose it over the Four Seasons?

We stayed for three nights - in a room on the 20th floor, located under the sky lobby, with phenomenal Strip views. The view has to be the best thing of all about the room. I could have sat for hours just taking it all in. The room was very high-tech, with the curtains, lights, TV, alarm call etc. all controlled electronically, either via switches at strategic points, via the TV or via a console by the bed. There was even a TV in the bathroom. The bathroom was exceptionally luxurious with a deep standalone tub, a large walk-in shower and two basins. The bed was very comfortable and very large. There was a well-stocked mini bar, and free water bottles. The room was totally dark with the curtains closed and very quiet at night - perfect for light sleepers. If there was a downside it was in the design of the room. The bathroom in our room had partially glazed walls - one of these could be covered by a sliding wooden screen, one couldn't. The toilet was set in a recess with a frosted glazed door. It would make things difficult if travelling with a non-intimate friend. Unfortunately, wi-fi wasn't included in our room rate (that was 18 dollars a day). I cannot understand why the large hotel chains persist in charging for internet access. For many people these days this is a utility like water or electricity - i.e. an essential. The staff have been very well trained, but sometimes it's a bit OTT. While at breakfast one morning we had to chat with the maitre'd, then the waiter who brought the juice and then the waiter who took our order. It was a bit too early in the morning for all that. You could have asked for anything and the staff would have brought it for you. We went to have a look at the pool area one day. To do this we passed the lobby where the staff asked if they could help, we then passed the spa, where the staff asked if we needed any help and when we actually got to the pool the staff made an immediate bee-line for us and asked us if we wanted any help. Lovely but too much. I know I can't complain about this - I'm certainly not going to mark the hotel down for it. You could have asked for anything and they would have brought it for you. While at the hotel I didn't use the spa or the pool. The lobby is very impressive - verging on awesome. The hotel has a dress code according to in-room literature. We certainly didn't always conform to this and nobody pulled us up on it. It did make me feel a little awkward though... I would definitely return.

Our room was stunning, with a great view of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and the Eiffel Tower (Paris resort). We thought the window was strange as it had a mirrored panel, whereas just glass would've been better for photos of the room/ view. The bed was big and comfortable. The bathroom was also nice, with two sinks, a TV screen, a big bath and lovely bath salts. The hotel welcomed us with a small cake wishing us a Happy Anniversary, which we felt was a lovely touch. :) We decided to go to the pool for breakfast every day, as we wanted to sit outside and make our choices from the menu (instead of a buffet). The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We loved eating by the pool as it wasn't too busy and it was a relaxed atmosphere. The menu was excellent - we particularly enjoyed the muesli and granola. The bagels and yogurts were also good and the coffee was perfect. :) We were able to head over to the pool area as soon as we'd finished breakfast. The pool area is very trendy, lots of cabanas that you can rent with big screen TVs inside and ceiling fans. We were happy enough with the sunloungers and parasols. Staff occasionally brought round complimentary iced smoothie drinks and melon balls to each guest, and there were bottles of iced water available. The pool is a fine size and perfect for cooling off after sunbathing. There are also spa pools round the corner, but we didn't use them. The poolside lunch menu was excellent, especially the chicken tenders and fries. On our last day, the hotel had a Labor Day BBQ - the food was amazing, especially the mini desserts. We spent some time in the Mandarin bar one evening, enjoying the views, fancy cocktails and a jazz band. The location of the hotel is excellent - there are walkways across the strip and heading up to the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We managed to walk around easily enough (even though it was boiling hot) to various restaurants and casinos for sightseeing. We took a few taxis when going further up the strip (to Stratosphere Tower).

It was the biggest and most expensive hotel that we stayed in for the entire trip, and as we had lashed out a bit, we were really looking forward to our stay. We arrived on the first day at 3pm to be told that our room wasn't ready yet, it was just awaiting a 'final inspection'. That was no problem as we were starving anyway so we left and got a late lunch. When we came back, our room still wasn't ready. We were told 'it is getting there, it just needs a final inspection' - the same as they told us an hour before. We were given complimentary tea while we waited. After asking again, eventually the room was ready just before 5pm. When we finally got to our room, it was beautiful. It is well designed and spacious and we had a strip view room with a great view of the strip. As it was the final leg of our trip, we were being careful with our budget, so we checked our credit card before we went out that evening. There was a $1200 charge on there that we hadn't made. We called reception to check if they had charged our card when we swiped it on check in and were told no. We then spent 30 mins on the phone to Australia trying to find out what the charge was only to find out that the hotel HAD charged our remaining balance to our card plus $170 a night for incidentals, without telling us. Unfortunately for us, this pretty much used up our remaining money for our trip. We received a note and some macaroons that evening for the stuff around with our check in, however unfortunately with the credit card incident as well, we were already very disappointed. Additionally, for the first two nights we were there, we didn't receive the newpaper, even though they asked for our newspaper preference on check in. We had to go to reception and get this fixed. Finally, this was the only hotel we stayed in on our trip that didn't offer free wifi. These are small issues, but as a hotel that makes a point of offering great service, we were disappointed. The hotel itself and the decor are beautiful and cannot be faulted - there was even a TV in the mirror in our bathroom! It's also in a great location on the strip. Unfortunately though, the service did not match the surroundings. Final tip: If you are coming back late at night (which you probably are in Vegas), you can't get back to your room via the third floor as you can during the day. Because of the strange lift/lobby set up you need to go up to the sky lobby, then change lifts and go back down to your room.

When you arrive at MO you are greeted by very professional and helpful Bellman. If it is your first visit to MO they will escort you to the 23rd floor lobby where the Front Desk is located.

The 23rd floor lobby is nothing short of amazing and must be experienced. There is a sitting area next to the front desk with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip. Just next to that is the Mandarin Bar with even more spectacular views of the Strip. The rooms are very spacious and contain beds that are more comfortable than I have ever found in all of my travels. An interesting feature in the room is the Butler\u2019s Closet. It is located next to the door and can be used for deliveries to the room (ice, shoe shines and so on) without disturbing you. (see attached photo) The bathroom is nice with a great shower. The water pressure is strong and gets very hot if you like that. The giant tub sits in the middle of the room with views of City Center. I will say that the sinks are not in the best spots for men who want to shave. They are in the corner and tough to work without spilling water all over the counter. Housekeeping has been phenomenal. I left the room on my last night in town to visit the Mandarin Bar. On my way out I saw that the privacy light was still on so I turned it off. When I returned to the room about an hour later Housekeeping had been there to do the turn down service. I was surprised by this because of the hour and figured it was too late.

The pool area was very relaxing with a great choice of breakfast & lunch, which is reasonable priced - the portions can be big (egg sandwich $16/granola $15 etc) so get them to split between 2, which they will gladly do. One moan is a cup of tea (tea bag & hot water) is $9 - a tad overpriced, considering what you get on the plate when ordering an egg sandwich at less than double. The drinks & cocktails are fairly expensive ($16 approx), but this is the same as most of Las Vegas, for a similar standard of hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel & hope you have as much as a relaxing time as we did.

As a customer this shows and I will be back for more please. There are too many instances to mention about how courteous and helpful the satff were on my families four day visit in Ausgust 2011. Our City Suite Suite was comfortably large with a sepearte sitting room with television. Large modern bathroom and spacious Bedroom area. The 16th Floor corner room afforded a warp around view of City Centre and a glimpse of the strip. The decor was modern, clean and functional. The air conditioning did require adjsutment from the Hotels engineer because we found that given the loaction of the vent in the bathroom hallway thare was a lack of circulation to the bedroom area. This was rectfied by having the register bypassed and the room cooled sufficently. That said it was one of the hottest weeks on record. Given the building is relatively new, part of the City Centre precinct, the Hotel has been outfitted in a modern style comapred to more traditional Mandarin Orientals like the one in Hong Kong. It does take some tinkering to work out how to operate the lights and curtians,but by the time you are about to leave you will have worked them out! My only dissapointment with our stay that was on ocasion there was some booming bass packed music from a nearby establishement which emenated the room,to the point where if you placed your hand on the expansive glass windws you could feel them vibrate.Particuraly frustrating was that it kept getting louder till 3am. I did contact the front desk the next day and they were more than happy to move us,though we were quite settled and stayed put. Fortunately though it did not hapen again untill the afternoon of the day we were departing. The pool area is quiet compared to other Hotels like the Belagio but thats a good thing if you like being away from the maddening crowds. Service is attenatvive and there are a great selection of poolside meals with a backdrop of relaxing tunes. The highlight of my experience was the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas Spa.

I'm not generally picky, I'm very accomodating when going around in motels or so, but the more the rate and the more the hotel is a luxury one the more I'm picky. MO is totally service oriented. Never been there, so during my long Vegas vacation I took advantage of the suite temptation offer and stayed there 3 nigths. I have to say that, staff and general spaces regarding, everything is absolutely perfect. Everyone smiles, everyone greets you and wants to please you. When giving you anything (your credit card, or your check) any employee uses both hand to give it to you and move head and back slightly forward as in a small bow. I suppose it's something in oriental culture, anyway nice touch. The hotel is really beautiful, lobby and other spaces are perfectly appointed. I didn't like too much the two sets of elevators, forcing you to switch in the sky lobby when directed to your room, but I think small couch in every elevators are a very nice touch, although not really useful. Breakfast at Mozen bistro was nice and in a great setting, but I found a bit excessive 35$ including taxes and a 20% tip (it was included in my rate, but the price is that) for the continental breakfast including a coffee, a cup of fruit and some mini croissants As I said, service is the best I've ever experienced. Some other touches I've especially enjoyed: 1) doorman asks your name when checking in, advice lobby with a microphone and when you get there they're waiting for you and greet using your name 2) when you arrive in the room, your bags are already there. Wonderful! Strip hotels don't deliver if you're not in your room, and I generally keep my luggage with me to avoid being forced to stay 30 minutes in my room waiting for them. 3) A/C in my room was set in celsius degree and not fahreneith 4) a full set of electronic devices were in my room, comprehensive of an adaptor for european plugs Problems start when considering my room (a cityview suite). It's large, well appointed, the same electronic controls used at Aria. But: 1) no fridge for personal use was provided. In a 1000 sq. feet suite, I think they should 2) The safe was in a drawer, so it has to be opened from above. The fact is the drawer opening didn't allow to open the safe, so you had to keep it opened and slide everything in with a small space. A classic one would have been more easy to use 3) A/C didn't work well. The fact is that bedroom a/c opening was close to the living room door, and pointed in that direction, far from the bed. Refreshing the bed area this way was almost impossible 4) I accept a charge for wireless internet. But when, scrolling down the channel list I found a single italian channel, tryed to see it and being asked for a 20$ or so credit card payment, I thinked that was really a nonsense 5) Bathroom was huge, and visually amazing, but poorly designed in some areas. Sinks were small and circular (your elbow couldn't fit in, and I'm small size), and positioned just in a corner. You felt like being in a sort of punishment there. Not easy to have a shave, also because the tap was high and lowering exactly in the middle of the sink 6) From the (floor to ceiling) bathroom windows I could see faces of people laying around the pool, no more than 20 feet away from me (I was in a low floor). I felt somewhat unconfortable thinking they could have seen me, too, but I thinked windows would have surely looked like mirror from outside. Then, from the Crystals mall bridge, I shockingly realized that I could easily see inside the windows. And so could have done pool people. So, my 4 is an average value for 5 (plus) service and 3 accomodation.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFour Seasons or MO?

We had stayed at FS twice before and always enjoyed the quiet oasis. Decided to try out the MO. The MO is located inside City Centre at the centre of the strip so it's within walking distance to Bellagio, Caesars, Paris and MGM etc. As opposed to the FS, the MO is really a standalone building as you have to walk outside even to get to Crystals or Aria next door. Both hotels give out different vibes. MO is modern and trendy, FS is classic and stylish. I thought FS was more calm and relaxing than MO. MO's decor is very dark. When you enter the MO you are at the sparse valet lobby and you have to take the lift to 23rd floor to the sky lobby. Then you take another lift to go down to your room. It feels a bit like Park Hyatt Tokyo, and the disadvantage is you don't get to walk into a grand lobby as you arrive. I found the service at MO was much more warm than FS. The FS service was always at arms reach but at the MO it was more personal. Rooms at MO are fantastic. Everything controlled electronically. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Spa was excellent though expensive. I was the only one there but the peace was disrupted by noisy spa hostesses either showing the spa to guests or talking to each other. Mozen features a wide variety of food and the decor is bright and modern - totally different from the rest of the hotels dark decor. Best thing is breakfast was not as busy as FS where you sometimes had to wait and it's always full. Food was great at Mozen. I think if I had to pick a problem it would be the rooms are noisy. Seems the walls are quite thin. From my room I could hear footsteps but I could not figure out if they came from the room next door or upstairs. There were also some noises I could not determine it's origin. Sounded like scraping metal doors. These are noises you don't often hear in well built soundproof 5 star hotel rooms. I didn't think the rooms were as spotless as they could have been. Ice bucket was wet inside, bathroom glass wall was spotty, shampoo bottles looked used, napkins in mini bar looked like they'd been wet and dried ... I visited the public toilet on the 23rd floor near the bar one night and it was in a horrible state. Not too big a deal but not what I'd expect from MO.

We decided to spend the first night downtown at the Golden Nugget to experience \u2018Old Vegas,\u2019 then move to the Strip and Mandarin Oriental to avoid the weekend crowds, and finally end our visit with four nights at Wynn to experience a full service casino resort. At the end of our trip we definitely wished we had just spent all nine nights at Mandarin Oriental, it was that terrific! After a short taxi ride from downtown we arrived at the hotel\u2019s very discreet entrance and were greeted by a veritable SWAT team of uniformed attendants. Within seconds we were being greeted and welcomed, our luggage was whisked away and we were escorted to the elevators that would take us to the Sky Lobby to check in. The Sky Lobby delivers a knock-out first impression: sumptuous furnishings, dramatic lighting and stunning views along the Las Vegas Strip. There was no line up at the front desk. We remarked to each other how elegant the staff uniforms were as we were greeted and checked-in, and within a few minutes we were off to our \u201cCity View\u201d room on the tenth floor. We are fortunate enough to have stayed in some remarkable rooms with dramatic views at luxury hotels around the world, and our room at Mandarin Oriental ranks among the best. The room was elegantly outfitted with top quality finishes. It was immaculately clean, and everything was in pristine condition. Although it was not very large, the d\u00e9cor, artwork and accessories were definitely a cut above most hotels. The automatic blinds opened and we were greeted with an awesome view of CityCentre, Crystals Mall and The Strip. Our room was located at the end of a hallway, so there was one entire wall of windows that ran from the bedroom right into the bathroom (including the water closet), which made for brilliant natural light during the day and exciting views at night. We loved the plush bed with its premium linens and feather pillows and duvet\u2014it was difficult to leave the bed each morning. There was also a comfortable divan and a good-sized desk with comfortable chair. The lights, blinds, clock and television could all be controlled with the television remote, which was very convenient. We enjoyed the specialty music and \u2018ambience\u2019 channels and often had them on when getting ready to go out at night. The only shortcoming with respect to the room was the storage. We tend to be heavy packers, so we had trouble finding space for all of our folded and hanging items, and we were not able to store our suitcases out of sight. Although the bedroom was a little lacking in storage the bathroom more than made up for it \u2013 it was huge! There was lots of counter space, two sinks and four drawers in which to store toiletries to keep them out of sight. The bathroom really did offer a spa-like experience with its abundant light, generous use of stone and marble, free-standing soaking tub and rainfall showerhead. There was even a potted live orchid next to the tub\u2014great attention to detail. The bathroom is not quite as private as we would have liked (all glass walls and doors), but a privacy blind could be lowered outside the shower wall to make bathing/showering a more modest experience. We loved the Aromatherapy Associates toiletries and the \u2018jewellery box\u2019 of grooming products by Gilchrist & Soames. There was also a good quality hair dryer and ceramic straightener for ladies who don\u2019t want to have to pack their own. Daily housekeeping was always thorough and very discreet. Not once during our stay did we see a maid\u2019s cart in the hallway. Turndown service was also performed every night while we were out at dinner or shows. The maid would replace towels, close blinds, turn on mood lighting and one of the mood channels on the television, and place bottled water and glasses on the nightstands. I thought turndown service could have been a little more special: Orient Express Hotels do all of the above plus they leave chocolates or cookies, place mats/slippers by the bed, and light a scented candle. Wynn also offers chocolates and leaves a different bookmark each day. This is just a minor quibble with what was otherwise exemplary service. We would begin each day with a workout in the fitness centre, where there were cardio machines with city views, a variety of weight machines, free weights and stability balls. Fresh fruit, bottled water and cold or dry towels were always available. Group or private classes could also be booked for a fee. We just wish all the guests had been respectful of the proper dress code. On two occasions one large, older man decided to workout shirtless, in a bathing suit and flip-flops. One of the spa staff should have politely asked him to return to his room and change. Otherwise, most of the guests working out looked like they were probably gym-regulars back at home. Most afternoons we spent a few hours by the pools. Perhaps the staff here was the best in the entire hotel: very welcoming, always smiling, often inquiring if there was anything they could do for you. Occasionally, staff would circulate with complimentary frozen berries, sorbet or smoothies\u2014a very nice touch. We never had a problem getting two lounge chairs together with an umbrella; there\u2019s no need to make a mad dash for the pool when it opens like at the mega resorts. The pools definitely are small and narrow, but there was always room to do some actual swimming, as opposed to just standing with a cocktail amidst a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd as we witnessed at other hotels. It was a very quiet, zen-like atmosphere made all the more pleasant by the ambient music piped in. Surprisingly there were a few families in residence (this really is not the right hotel for children), but they were mostly well-behaved. The majority of the guests were looking for some quiet relaxation and pampering; a party pool it is not! At the pool we enjoyed freshly squeezed juices and delicious snacks and sandwiches (the TLT is a memorable one). Cocktails in the Mandarin Bar, with its spectacular views over the strip, provided an inspiring start or end to an evening out. The drinks are a little pricey, but they are innovative and delicious; you can taste each individual ingredient! I recommend the cucumber and cilantro margarita. One night we had a memorable dinner at MOzen, where we each ordered the Bento experience (6 small dishes each from the menu, presented in a Bento box inspired manner). The food was fresh and delicious and the service was warm and professional. It ended up being our most expensive dinner of the trip (thanks to several cocktails), but we felt it was well worth it. Twist was closed the week we were there so we were unable to experience it this time. We did not like the look of the MOzen breakfast menu as much as we did the dinner menu, so most mornings we walked over to Jean Philipe at Aria for terrific French pastries and coffee. We were sad when it came time to check out and we wished we had not decided to split up our stay; however, using the house driver/Mercedes to take us to the Wynn eased the pain a little. It was a very comfortable ride with a very personable driver and further reinforced our desire to return. Our stay at Mandarin Oriental was one of the highlights of our entire vacation. If you are similar to us, and like your exposure to the \u2018Vegas experience\u2019 in measured doses, then there is no better refuge from the madness of the city. We felt cared for, pampered and secure. We have become huge FANS of Mandarin Oriental.

It\u2019s the type of quality hotel you\u2019d find in any top location throughout the world. You leave the hurley burley of The Strip behind the minute you enter and experience its soothing background music and dark, mysterious decor. Its mid-Strip location, just a few steps away from the Crystals mall is superb. The rooms, which are spacious and very nicely decorated, are a gadget lover's dream as everything from the TV to the curtains is controlled from one central place. There's even a TV located on the mirror in the gigantic bathroom. Yet everything is tasteful and stylish rather than brash. Breakfast at Mozen is a delightful and peaceful dining experience, and the food superb. You'd never guess you were minutes from The Strip sitting in the elegance here. However, I\u2019m rating this review as four rather than five for the following reasons: - To say how spacious the rooms are, the wardrobe and drawer space is limited and there wasn't nearly enough room to put our clothes. - Housekeeping was disappointing at times - on a couple of occasions the room hadn't been serviced by late afternoon and one day the daily service and turn down service merged into one as the room was so late being cleaned. On one occasion, there was no spare toilet tissue. And one day, both a towel and a bedsheet were threadbare. - One of the bedside lights was broken and despite the bell boy telling us, on arrival, that he'd have it fixed for us by the time we got back that evening, it remained broken throughout our stay. - The fact that all the staff, even those on reception, are wearing microphones is somewhat off-putting, making them appear distant at times. - There was a slight coldness about some of the staff, and some of the very young staff by the pool didn't seem particularly that well trained and we didn't feel that comfortable up there.

After a weekend stay, the Mandarin Oriental is our new favorite. This is the first hotel we've stayed at in Las Vegas that could easily measure up favorably against comparable hotels in another big city. Our strip view suite was thoughtfully designed, well maintained and comfortable. We've found a number of the other hotels in Las Vegas to be too high style and not well thought out and their lobbies and public spaces too crazy. The hotel is also within easy walking of the City Center complex as well -- the Aria's gaming areas are excellent. The Mandarin Oriental's service was polite and efficient. As an example, several days prior to arrival the concierge phoned to ask whether she would assist -- I asked her to arrange dinner at Sage in the City Center for 8 pm on Saturday night (something I couldn't get myself by calling them the day before) and a few hours later I received an e mail confirming the reservation. When the next day I contacted her to move up the reservation by a half hour another concierge gladly took charge of my request (my initial contact was not then at work) and she successfully changed the booking. Many times these sorts of changes can fall through the cracks -- I was impressed by how smoothly the details were arranged. The only things I might take issue with are very small -- the seating in the living room is cramped and frankly as uncomfortable as a church pew. Service in the pool area for a quick lunch as well as breakfast was slow, largely the result of what is coming from the hotel's expectations for the servers. A request for morning coffee requires the server to lay out an elaborate array of mugs, a thermos, sugar bowls and a creamer. Multiply that with a busy rush and we ended up waiting nearly ten minutes for coffee. Breakfast does not need to be a three-star production. Lastly, our first night there, as we waited for the bellman to get us a taxi, we noticed another couple get into the hotel's car. The bellman volunteered that the car was available for complimentary use and so on our last morning I asked him whether we might use the car to transfer us to the airport later that day. Not a problem, he said, and right on the dot a few hours later at check out a brand new Hybrid Mercedes took us to LAS.

Ideally located near the Aria for your gambling desires, but away from the gambling scene (no casino in the hotel) for some zen and rest. This hotel is very close to NYNY, MGM and Hard Rock. M&M and Coca-Cola stores are also down the road, and a CVS pharmacy directly next to the hotel or any emergency needs. Though nothing beats the convenience of the Bellagio or the Venetian, MO certainly has its perks being part of the MGM group, with their own free train and sightseeing convenience on that end of the strip. Hotel staff are excellent and helpful. The concierge helped us to arrange an affordable tour to the Grand Canyon the day before and wake up calls were punctual. Great huge TV with tons of channels both inside the bedroom and out in the living room, as well as in the bathroom! Access for up to 4 computers/devices on very fast reliable wifi in the room was value for money. Service was impeccable. Extra hangers and international conversion plugs at request as well as extra bathrobes and towels. Good quality bedroom slippers are provided. The bed comforters and pillows are very soft and comfortable though one side of the double bed had a sag from whoever slept in it before (I slept on the other side). Air conditioners were also a bit cold but you could turn them off whenever you wanted. Controls in the room for lights were a little confusing, but the ability to access from the TV and the controller beside the bed, as well as manually on the walls made it very convenient. Automated black-out curtains and sheers in bathroom, bedroom and living room were really cool. And the view we got from the 10th floor was great - I could see the first drop of the rollercoaster in NYNY and got a great view of the pool, as well as view the shopping centre beside us. The hotel pool is small but great to get a nice suntan. Don't expect to do much swimming - this is very much a poser's pool. Sunbeds are also quite close together so it's not suggested for the self-conscious. I love how all MO hotels are scented the same in the lobby and lift areas. There is pretty good security in this hotel as the lift to access the hotel rooms is different from the lift to access the lobby and restaurants. A bench provided in the lift to rest while travelling up and down was a novelty! Only downsides were: 1) Shower arm had very weak water pressue so we ended up using the shower head the whole time. 2) Sink was tiny - I couldn't even fit the kettle under the tap head so I ended up using a cup to fill it. 3) Breakfast was nothing fantastic. Wake up at noon and head to one of the amazing restaurants for lunch instead. That being said the breakfast staff were very polite and accomodating. Basically you really get what you're paying for.

So much so, that we had a hard time figuring the console out, which controlled everything in the room. The bathroom was lovely, with a modern large soaking tub.

The feel of the hotel was very calming but the spa was no comparison to arguably the best spa I have ever enjoyed in a hotel...at the Bellagio.

The room is very spacious, the layout very well thought through and practical, the colour scheme soothing and there are classy little details everywhere to go ooh and aah over!

Service: Flawless and extrememly pleasant!!! Everything runs smoothly and on time! Staff: They are extrememly nice and always ready to help with whatever your needs are. Truly world class!!!!! Renee and Stephanie (Ladies at the concierge desk) were of great help throughout our stay! Food/beverage: Wonderful and not too expensive at all. Everything is also presented in the most appetizing manner. Their skybar is gorgeous with nice views of the strip and their cocktails are to die for! MOzen was a wonderful experience for lunch. Fresh and light Twist is highly recommendable!!! Internet: Fast, stable and easy to connect to. Not free (no hotels seem to do free internet in Vegas anyways), but not expensive at all.

I had not been in Las Vegas since 2004 and originally had booked the Bellagio (where I stayed in 2004) but then read bad reviews on this website. The rate at the Bellagio through American Express Fine Hotel and Resorts program was $250. When I called Amex back to book the Mandarin Oriental, the rate was the same including one night at $205. Check in was flawless, everywhere I went within the hotel people would call me by my last name (not that I care, but it shows the level of details). Room was on the 18th floor, looking at Aria and the mountains. Very quiet room. Well appointment, definitely 5 stars. Technology-wise the hotel is amazing. Perfect wifi everywhere, though it wasn't free, the speeds were crazy for hotel wifi, 18mpbs down and almost the same in upload speeds. Very comfortable bed. Upon checking in I asked for a foam pillow and a humidifier and got it within 5 minutes of being in the room. Great pool area, nice music but at a normal level, awesome pool staff, great menu, some cocktails were not so great but we did have great pina colada.We used a cabana one day and the rates are pretty reasonable. $210 weekdays or $310 weekends. Flatscreen tv, PS3, you can plug your ipod or ipad directly to the tv, fruits, sodas, etc. during the day. We had breakfast daily at MOzen and lunch the last day. Again, stellar service and terrific food (loved the Chicken Tika Wrap for lunch, at $14 with perfect fries and a sald it's a steal). Housekeeping was also great, room always perfectly cleaned and turned down. The spa is 27,000 sq/ft but I believe you need a treatment to use it or get a day pass. Regardless, it was an amazing experience. To give you a little background, I studied hospitality management in one of the best school in the world in Switzerland and worked as a concierge for a 5 star NY Hotel for 3 years.

Everywhere we walked in the hotel, we were greeted. At the MOzen restaurant, not only did the manager ask how our dinner was, he also asked if he could do anything to make our stay more comfortable. The pools are designed more for adults, they are lap pools. The pool area, spa, and fitness area are exceptional. We only experience one small issue. We were offered a choice of two out of three newspapers each day. On the first morning they delivered the one we didn't ask for. How did they fix it? They brought the correct two to our room right away and delivered all three the rest of the stay. Breakfast at MOzen was superb. Great service.

Firstly, the hotel itself, located in the middle of the strip, is gorgeous. You enter the hotel via a beautiful downstairs entry lobby and are whisked up to reception on the 23rd floor, which is a haven of peace and calm from the chaos that is Las Vegas. There were no check in lines when we were there, ever, and we were very quickly shown to our fabulous, spacious premier room. Travelling as a family with 2 children we found that the premier room was easily large enough for the four of us, and the views from our 21st floor room were sensational. The room itself was also decorated to an extremely high level, and I loved the touchpad operated curtains/ air conditioning etc. I am very, very picky when it comes to hotel cleanliness, and this hotel is amazingly clean. Everything looks perfect and new, as if you are the first guest ever to stay there. Also the bed linen is of the highest quality and the beds are incredibly comfortable. One small problem that we did encounter was that there was excessive noise from an open air karaoke bar on the strip that kept us awake a good part of the first night. Had we been travelling as a couple and in Vegas to party, coming home late, this wouldn't have been an issue, but as a family with children who needed to sleep this was more of a problem. It was only a problem until the moment that we mentioned it to the hotel staff however, who quickly found us a new dramatically quieter room (and an upgraded one too.) They really couldn't have been more helpful or lovely about it. Apparently they are also taking legal action against the bar so this issue should soon be resolved anyway. The pool area is beautifully kept, and the cabanas look fabulous although we didn't have time to book one during our stay. Unfortunately it was very windy when we stayed so we didn't have the chance to use the pool as much as we might have liked. Nonetheless it is quiet and serene and beautiful, unlike most of the other Vegas pools I have ever experienced. The staff there, as with everywhere in this amazing hotel were wonderful and helpful. Whilst we were there we had something of a medical emergency when my husband was accidentally headbutted by my seven year old when he bent to kiss her goodnight in the dark, as we were putting her to bed. This wasn't a minor blow, in fact the bathroom of our hotel room looked like a murder scene after this incident, such was the amount of blood. The response of the hotel was phenomenal though. Within literally a couple of minutes of my panicked call they sent a medically trained security guard who helped my very dazed husband try to stop the bleeding so that I could look after my daughter who was distraught by the idea that she had hurt her father as well as suffering from a bang on the head herself. The manager himself also came to our room and seeing the amount of blood immediately called an ambulance for us, although by the time the paramedics arrived the bleeding had lessened and we didn't end up needing it. Throughout this incident everybody from the hotel was so kind, helpful and reassuring to us, I really cannot thank them enough. Not only that but within about 15 minutes of the paramedics leaving, a cleaner with a biohazard kit arrived at our room and made it look perfect again, (no mean feat given how much my husband had been bleeding) something that really helped me to settle my upset children down for the night. I think the position of this hotel on the strip is perfect, next to Aria, and right in the middle of the strip, a quick walk to the Bellagio etc. It was such a wonderful experience to be able to walk out of the door of the hotel and be in the middle of everything, and then come back in and be able to forget completely about all of the craziness outside the hotel. We visited lots of the other hotels such as the Wynn etc and the quality of the Mandarin Oriental is on a different scale to those places. I really cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Not only is it breathtakingly beautiful, the service is out of this world. Usually there are one or two service niggles even when staying at great hotels, and there simply weren't here.

Staying at the Mandarin in Vegas is a different experience, since the hotel does not have a casino. Instead of standing in a long check-in line and traipsing through a casino with our luggage in search of the elevator, we had the new pleasure of riding straight up to the 23rd-floor reservation desk, where all the wonderful service began. We had booked our trip through SW Vacations and had chosen a \u201cpremium\u201d room. Five days before departure, SW informed us they were downgrading us to a lesser room with little compensation. We were very angry with them. When we arrived at the desk at the Mandarin, I respectfully asked for the room we had paid for. This was apparently their second such request that day. After a call to a higher authority, the lovely desk clerk told us we got the last premium room. That made our day and our trip. The bait and switch trick that SW Vacations tried to pull was averted. From then on, everyone we dealt with at the Mandarin was equally as helpful and sincerely concerned about our welfare \u2013 from the spa to the bistro to the bar. Our room was exquisite, the best we have ever had. Our Hammam treatment at the spa was a delight. We also enjoyed the hotel\u2019s pool area. There was only one hiccup with the Mandarin. It was difficult to get a cab from there. Saturday night we stood in a long line, while the bellmen did all they could, but cabs simply do not pull into the Mandarin very regularly, and their flashing blue curb-side light was obviously being ignored by the cabbies. They seemed at a loss on how to get a cab other than by accidental drop-off. Admittedly, the strip was extremely busy, but their impotence on this front was surprising. On the other hand, it was very convenient to stroll over to the adjacent Crystals Mall and on to the casino at the Aria or the Cosmopolitan \u2013 two very nice casinos \u2013 and to take advantage of the many restaurants and shop in those two complexes.

Check-in was effortless; check-out was speedy but no valet service was offered or in evidence; this was somewhat disappointing.

They make a stay not just good, but great. I travel 100 nights a year for business, I don\u2019t need my hand holding and perfect service all the time, but coming the Vegas I do like the push the boat out and stay at the very best. When it came to plan this trip, we selected the Mandarin, given the brands reputation, we were excited to be trying it out for the first time and to see how this would compare. While there was several aspects of our stay that met our high expectations, there were others that were sadly lacking and not what we would expect given the reputation of the Brand I do not want to just focus on the Negative and would like to give credit to the following, who \u201cget it\u201d in terms what the Mandarin is all about. Pool - Given the direction many places are taking these days, this was a complete Oasis of peace and relaxation, the best we have ever been to in terms of atmosphere, Staff and service. If you DON\u2019T want the \u201cParty/Loud Music\u201d, that is prevalent in almost any other Vegas Pool these days, then this is hands down the best place to be.. Ground Floor Lobby - All of the Door and Bell staff were attentive and anticipated our needs, as the \u201cFront Line\u201d so to speak of the Hotel they did a great job. Mozen Bistro \u2013 we dined there everyday for Breakfast and once for lunch, each time the service and food were exemplary, Room \u2013 I was in an Stripview Suite, I was very pleased, I requested a high floor and got it, the view was fantastic - one of the best I have ever had - and the Bathroom/Bedroom were wonderful \u2013 the bath was HUGE! Combined with the Technology in the room, although it may not be the biggest, again it is one of the best. Staff that recognize what you want and adjust how they deliver their service and interaction appropriately are what makes things special and what makes the difference between a Hotel that is good and one that is great. The following is what did not make our Mandarin Stay great. The much vaunted \u201cValet Closet\u201d appears to be useless. It is was my understanding that I was to place items in the Closet, press the Valet button and they would be promptly attended to. Also that items could/would be placed there on delivery for my collection, should I have the privacy light lit, or not be in my room. This was my experience \u2013 I needed two items for pressing, I placed them in the closet, they were promptly retrieved. Several hours later they were not returned, I called, and within 5 mins they arrived, however instead of the closet being used, I was called, informed they could not deliver because the privacy light was on, but someone was waiting at the door. I will admit I did not ask why they could not use the closet, I do wonder that the real reason was they would not receive a tip. More than once during stay, I put the Ice Bucket in the closet and pressed the Valet Button, we would leave the room for several hours, returning the find the light still lit and no ice. I spoke with Management twice mainly to clarify that I did not misunderstand how the valet closet worked. They apologized, said they would test the button and speak with Housekeeping, on each occasion they did follow up with a letter/Fruit Basket/chocolates saying that everything was working. While apologies are appreciated, I just wanted the service, I know things can go wrong, but the valet closet never worked as I was advised it would. On our final day it took two phone calls and 30 mins to get ice. At no other hotel in the world, have I ever had this much difficulty, or at the least I have the option of a self-service Ice machine in the hall. More than once our room did not receive turndown and once it was late afternoon before Housekeeping made up our room, just as we were coming back from the pool, and there was a sign on the door, all we could do was wait in the Elevator Lobby until they were done. The Front Desk staff, although friendly, is not what I would call \u201c5 Star\u201d perfect. To give some examples - When we checked in, I was greeted by name, but that was where the 5 star experience ended. Having checked us in, we were given directions to our room, with an apology that there was no-one available to cover the front desk, otherwise she would have walked us, I found this a little hard to believe having seen several people present that no one else was available to \u2018hold the fort\u201d so to speak. Of course we found our room no problem, but when we opened the door, the curtains were drawn, so it was pitch black and it took several minutes to find switches for the drapes/lights. Upon check out, I was planning to give some feedback, but since the no-one asked how my stay was, something I am asked 99% of the time even when I checkout in a basic hotel, I assumed they did not want to hear how things were, or the assumption was that everything just went so well. None of the above is what I would call showstoppers, indeed they could be seen as Nitpicking but it is examples difference between a good stay and a great one. There were many positives, that means I will consider the Mandarin in the future, The Property is fantastic, but it is my hope that my concerns will be properly addressed so that my next stay is a great one and not merely good.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect in every way\u201d", "Author": "RBH-Perth", "ReviewID": "UR113579797", "Content": "The Mandarin is in a good location on the strip.

Turndown service provided each night comes in handy as they provide useful items like ice so you can chill your wine/champagne or whatever you like.

It was very elegant and classy, as expected, and we spent a good deal at the hotel so it was a great trip. We had an amazing view of the strip, and the location was in the heart of all the Vegas action! However, there were a few things we were disappointed with. The hand held remote to control the TV and lights didn't work, even after we had someone come look at it. The TV hidden behind the mirror was very fancy! However, it was very hard to operate and work. On Valentine's night, we wanted to take a bath in the elegant tub in the very open glass enclosed bathroom, but the stopper did not work, so there went our romantic bath. We couldn't use the pool since it was being cleaned. Since the hotel is only a year old, I think they have a few kinks to work out. But the overall experience made up for it!

This is a GREAT Hotel, with GREAT service and none of the headaches or \"hangover wannabes\" that flood some of the nearby resorts.

If you come for business, relaxation or a retreat with your mate this is a great place to escape from the mayhem all around.

I told her that she should look for another suite that was ready because it's un-acceptable that I should be kept waiting. Ten minutes later she came back with an upgraded suite on the 16th floor. The suite was amazing! When we opened the door the curtains opened and the lights turned on. The room was very large, had beautiful views and was full of high tech gadgets. The service in the hotel was very good almost all of the time but there were a few details that kept me from giving the hotel a rating of 5. The room service seemed to be a little off.

The restaurant actually sent their junior chef up to our room and explain the ingredients and sauces. What I would have expected more are the overall decoration and interiors of the property. Having been in the commercial design business for years, I am quite disappointed by their workmanship and quality of the interiors. The other Mandarin Oriental seems to do a much better job.

Like others on the board we had problems with housekeeping and pool staff. We left our room before 9 one morning requesting housekeeping as we left and returned over 6 hours later to an unmade room. I am not sure why this happened as when my husband phoned to ask for housekeeping to come up at a different point, they were there in minutes. Also, at the pool area we asked three different attendants for drink menus and were told no problem all three times yet no one ever returned with the menus.

I didn't use the bath but my partner did and noted it was very uncomfortable - definitely 'form over function' which sets the theme overall for this hotel. It did look nice though. Great hair dryer in the room with a thin styling nozzle (women understand) and a hot straighting iron were a very nice touch. The hotel pool area was lovely. The issues ... Its the only hotel other than the Four Seasons to charge for parking in the whole of Vegas ($30 a night). If you want to park and want to save the fee then park at the Aria next door and walk across. We returned our hire car on arrival so wasn't an issue. It wasn't easy to find the place though on foot. If arriving on foot the access to this place isn't great and not well sign posted. No coffee in the room or offered elsewhere in the morning without a room service charge. No internet access either unless you pay extra ($18 a day). They seem to have taken what should be a really classy hotel and made it feel like a budget airline experience where they charge for all the basic extras. At $350 per night this seems a little excessive and unnecessary to me? Internet and coffee in the morning would have made us happy (just simple things). They have tried hard to impress with their electronic system in the room. Everything is electronic. The curtains are open/closed at the touch of a button (sheers and blackout separately), all of the lights, tv etc. with an iPod style touch screen. This didn't work great and we are more than familiar with technology (we work in IT). The lifts were another issue and very confusing. Similar comments from other guests too who were struggling to find their way in the lift system. One lift to take you to the reception (23rd floor) or the 3rd floor cafe/meeting place and another to take you to the guest room floors. After 11pm the operation changes and some of the lift functions don't work but there are no details explaining this in the lift so you end up so frustrated unsure why its not working.

The security is apparently monitored as the hotel reception is on 23rd floor with a separate lift for guests although visitors may still be able to get to the spa and pool. Certainly a different experience on the strip. The strip is only a very short walk away with CVS pharmacy shop and Monte Carlo Hotel next door . We didn't miss having a casino in the hotel.

I liked that everything you would need could be found in various compartments throughout the room - extra pillows and blankets in a beautiful box, etc. Despite the beauty, our first day at the pool had a major impact on our entire experience.

Yes, it took an hour and a half to receive a $75 lunch that would take about 15 minutes to prepare. We were offered nothing as an apology. We heard all of the visitors around us having similar experiences. We decided to purchase nothing else at the hotel throughout the rest of our stay. On another note, there were several visitors on both days that did not appear to be hotel guests. The hotel needs to do a better job of ensuring all pool guests are hotel guests - we never had to verify proof of our stay or a room key.

We'd wandered into the Mandarin during a prior visit to Las Vegas and had been awed by the tranquility of its non-casino oasis and had greatly anticipated our stay here. The amenities, room and especially the spa all lived up to our expectations. If we hadn't had reservations for dinner and a show, I would have gladly moved into the spa and not ever left. I enjoyed an amazing Oriental massage and signature foot treatment and then soaked for what felt like hours while overlooking the Strip. My husband (usually not a Spa visitor) is still raving about the spa four months later and can't wait to go back. My only real concern regarded the spotty service we received throughout our stay. The property obviously prides itself on excellent service - the Spa employees, doormen, room service, housekeeping, all lived up to this and perhaps even exceeded expectations. The bar, however, was abysmal. It was not a busy evening and after being shown to a table, our friends and I were completely ignored. After we hailed a waitress, our order was taken and 20 minutes later no drinks arrived. We tracked down a manager who apologized, but then still no drinks for over 10 minutes and then no apology when they finally arrived. The waitress then had the nerve to confront us about the small tip we left stating that it wasn't her fault... Maybe just an isolated experience or bad night for that particular server, but from this level of property, I expect more. We then had a similar off-putting experience when checking out which admittedly marred our Zen experience. On arrival we had been upgraded to a suite as the property was clearly not overly full. On checkout, however, we were charged not only for the upgrade but at the level of the suite accommodate above the one in which we'd stayed! It took a request to see the manager and then extensive explaining including production of our email confirmation for the original booking for this to be rectified. Our bill was finally settled to the initially agreed upon amount, however, it was disappointing to have to haggle upon departure.

The service is top notch and you can tell everyone works as a team, as all employees seem genuinely friendly and happy to be working there. There are a few suggestions, and comments that I would like to convey and why I didn't rate it excellent vs very good overall. 1. Upon arrival- at approx 2pm- we went to the pool area only to be told incessantly that the pool would be closing at 3pm for a private event. It was quite annoying and I think a major inconvenience for guests as it was packed. I totally understand and appreciate that the hotel needs to make revenue but they should consider clearing out an entire area to set up for a dinner that looked like only for 60 guests from what I could see may not be worth it. Also we left the area at 3pm and went to our rooms and the other guests did not leave until 4pm for after. As I said major inconvenience and maybe can be handled in a different manner like sectioning off an area until the last possilbe moment?? Also the last day the pool was shut down to high winds so we really got penalized coming and going. 2. A female employee at the pool did not get her namel-was the same employee that told us the pool was closing did not seem like she knew the hotel facilties. We came down around 10am one day and asked if there was breakfast just where we could grab a coffee and pastry. She said no, that the hotel pool area restaurant opened at 11am. Of course we found out the next day there was a service on the 3rd floor, as I knew that sounded odd. She did not seem informed. I also feel that her and her colleague could have helped people more at the poolside. At the Four Seasons in L.A. they put the towel through a chair holder for you and provided complimentary \"jet lag\" smoothies. Thought it was a nice touch. The two female employees seemed like they just wanted to get through the day. Also one day we came early to eat our breakfast on departure day (7am) and the pool was closed and a male employee let us eat there. Seems late (8am) to open a pool - what if someone wanted to catch an early swim? 3. A coupon was presented at check in for a complimentary appetizer, a $25 rebate for a spa treatment and one other service I can't recall. We used it in the bar and received the comp appetizer. I thought it was tacky just being able to choose one option, as the waitress took the coupon. Given that the rooms are pricy, what does it really cost the hotel to extend the other options to guests.... 4. Turndown service could use a variety.....seemed the same every night. Given there is so much competition - the more little personal touches you can give guests, the better this hotel can become. 5. The Spa -was outstanding and top notch. A note - the manicurist should put the color of nailpolish in the computer on the way out so I could have bought the color as I forgot the name. The guy behind the counter had to run all the way down to fiind her to ask and then they did not have the color. Mellissa was a great masseuse- the best!

While certainly not the Park Hyatt Tokyo by comparison in sky lobbies, it does impress and makes for a beautiful entrance. -The Restaurants are exceptional and service is fantastic at both. I found Twist to be in the top three of restaurants in Las Vegas and a strong contender as best in a quality to price value. The three-course dinner is an exceptional value at $105.00 per person. As well, Mozen is a fun little bistro with a pan-asian-we-do-it -all here kind of menu. Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, it is all represented. I tried a number of things but personally my suggestion would be to stick with the Japanese, Mr. Kats at the Sushi bar is exceptional, very personable, and while limited in what he offers as far as the fish, is creative with what he has. -The rooms are beautifully designed, comfortable and sleek, with exceptional amenities in-room, a bottle service mini-bar, and an amazing suite of technology enabled lighting and room controls. There is little if anything that has been missed here. And, What\u2019s Not. -A rather deceptive measuring of the suites is my biggest issue. The Strip view suite, for which I booked, was listed on the website as being 850 sq. feet. That is fairly expansive for an entry-level suite category so I decided to splurge and book this as it seemed a good value. I arrived for business two days before my wife so I did not really notice that the room we were give, 1201, was nowhere near 850 sq. feet. I suppose I also forgot the size since making my booking. After my wife arrived she commented in a passing way that the suite is well laid out and beautiful but still a bit tight as a suite for two people. That is when I glanced quickly at the website and realized that Mandarin is either completely off on their measurements or there is a smaller version of the Strip View Suite that they try and pass off. This room is more like 600-650 sq. feet and is at a weird corner angle so that a good 10%-15% of the room is unusable. I would rate it more in a Junior suite category. Since I realized this half way through our 5 night stay I decided not to take issue and request an explanation or room change. I post this now though so that others are aware and so that Mandarin might correct this so as not to mislead in how it presents the suites at the booking point. -On a sunny and beautiful Saturday of 85 degree weather my wife and I decided to sit by the pool in the afternoon. It was a perfect pool day. There was a gusty breeze, as is typical in Vegas, but it actually made it very pleasant and comfortable in comparison to the heat one sometimes has there. After about a half hour there (around 2:00PM) the pool manager addressed each guest (about 30-40 of them) to announce that the pool area was being closed because high winds were making the area unsafe. Huh? O.K., I am not kidding here. While I could see limiting food service and securing umbrellas in a breezy situation like this closing it was very bizarre. I, and everyone at the pool, was completely taken aback at the announcement. I thought two European guys summed it up best as they stormed out, \u201cOnly in America.\u201d My wife and I, pasty from a long eastern winter, were pretty adamant that we were not leaving our comfy chairs because of a gusty breeze without the manager on duty coming to tell me face-to-face how this would constitute a decision to close and remove 30-40 guests. The pool manager mumbled something about the dangers of a flying cushion (again, I kid you not) and left - I assumed to get the manager. After about an hour and a half, no one ever came to remove us. We left the area to meet some friends and noticed a few others as well that had refused to leave. Good for them. Again, if you are not a pool person you might not care, but many come to Vegas to also enjoy the sun and desert climate, European\u2019s especially, so if this is a priority you might want to book at one of the more pool oriented properties like the Wynn. -Breakfast room service can be rather slow. Plan accordingly, though one should not have to at a luxury property. One morning a bagel and pot of coffee took nearly 50-minutes. No offer at all to even make the coffee on the house, just a cheerful explanation that they were very full in the hotel and room service was running behind. I hope this is helpful and keeps you informed\u2026as well that it will enable Mandarin to recognize some flaws and to make what is a beautiful hotel one of the best urban resorts in North America as it has that potential.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "epsom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location fantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "davemullins2010", "ReviewID": "UR102323942", "Content": "Excellent location- our first trip to the strip!

Since I'm not a gambler, I really liked how there was no casino (and the smoke and crowds that go with it) in the hotel. No complaints about the room (king with strip view) itself. The lighting was a little tricky to figure out for the 1st few hours, but then I easily got a hang of how to use. The tv was nice, the bed and pillow comfy, and the climate control worked well. (The mini bar also had enough space for me to put in a few drinks that I bought myself at CVS.) I even requested an extra one of their softer pillows at midnight and they came to my room in a few minutes, no problems. All staff was very nice, whether it was the front desk, bellhop, or room service. Although the hotel was mostly quiet, I unfortunately did get woken up 2 mornings by people in the next room over. They didn't seem to be talking super loud or anything, so I suppose it was just bad sound proofing between rooms. I could also hear a little bit of noise from the strip (was on floor 11), but it wasn't constant or enough to keep me up. I bought Internet on one day and it worked very well, no hiccups in service. The price however was pretty steep at $18 for 24 hours worth- there were no alternatives for free, I searched for other open networks, but there were none. The location of the hotel is pretty good. The rating on this depends on where you spend your time, which for us was mostly on the northern part of the strip, where as the hotel is in the middle area. It's right across from the Crystals mall in the City Center, which I didn't have interest shopping in given that all the stores are very $$$ brands; but we did enjoy the Wolfgang Puck restaurant for a lunch and dinner meal. We didn't eat at any of the hotel's restaurants, so can't comment on those. In the final email I got from the hotel, I took a survey to rank my experience. Along with my positive comments, I expressed disappointment in getting woken up, the pricey internet charge, and no \"green\" option to not get the towels replaced. I also checked that I'd like to be commented about the comments I left, just to see what happened. A hotel manager called me and left a voicemail2 days after I completed the survey and also emailed me later that day. He apologized for the things I was disappointed in and genuinely showed concern for my feedback. It was really nice to see that the hotel cares about what their customers think and I was pleasantly surprised by his responses. Overall I recommend this hotel, but I was really bummed about being woken up by other guests. If it hadn't been for that, I'd give it 5 stars, but because of that and the few other things I mentioned above, I give it a 4-4.5 stars instead.

Great suite on the 16th floor. Entrance to lounge area with desk and sofa and huge tv, double doors through to bedroom on the corner of the hotel - another large TV, strip views through all (floor to ceiling) windows, round the corner to the large bathroom. Big bath tub, oversized separate shower, twin sink, toilet in adjoining separate room. Lots of soaps, shampoos, shower gels, towels etc... Everything in the room can be centrally controlled via the TV screen and remote control or using the electronic pad next to the bed. Easy to use, but usual air con and light switches on the wall are also there. Lots of wardrobe and drawer and cupboard space. Bed was amazingly comfortable - best I've ever slept in. Service was consistently excellent. Very friendly, but at all times professional. Staff really couldn't do enough to help. If being really picky, breakfast service was a little bit slow on a couple of the mornings, but we weren't in rush, so not a big deal for us. Continental breakfast in MOzen was great - bowl of fresh, mixed fruit, bowl of pastries - croissant, three danish pastries and a muffin, very nice coffee and lots of refils - took one to take away each morning as well. Had dinner in MOzen one evening - so peacful in comparison to the noise and music in most of the casino restaurants. Great food - cod for me, perfectly cooked, lamb shank curry for my other half - excellent (who said you couldn't get a decent curry in the US!!!). Weather hadn't been great for most of our stay, but it got warm enough for an afternoon by the pool. Again, quiet and serene with excellent drinks service. Sun loungers were very comfortable with very thick matresses. Even though you're right by the strip it was very relaxing and peaceful - bar the helicopters passing over! Cocktails in the bar on the 23rd floor were excellent - expensive even by top-end Vegas standards. Lunch at MOzen was also good. Used our $100 spa credit by just using the spa (no treatments) $50 each normally, so expensive, but as we had the credit.... Very relaxing and a perfect way to prepare for our 10 hour haul back home. Very easy to get into the middle of all the madness of Vegas (particularly Aria and The Cosmopolitan) from the MO, but amazingly peaceful and relaxing as soon as you walk back in.

While waiting, we were on the 23rd floor overlooking the action of Vegas. We were directed to our room after about 20 minutes. When we arrived, I just could not believe how cool it was. As we walked in the drapes automatically opened to reveal a full 270 degree view of the strip and the mountains beyond. What could we say but wow! This is the Strip View Suite. Definitely worth every penny of the upgrade. We spent so much time just drinking in the views and the serenity of our room during our four day visit. Each day after roust-abouting on the strip we would return to this smoke free and casino free temple of serenity. Baths in the wonderful huge tub were memorable (room for two 6 foot guys!) Each staff member treated us as if we were royalty and always greeted us by name. I have stayed all around the world (47 countries and all 50 states) and nothing, I mean nothing, compares. The pool and hot tub area are ravishing. If only they would tear down the Polo Towers across the way and build a beautiful thing. One can hardly blame the Mandarin for this! The location is perfect, next door to the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio. I understand the spa is one of the best in the country. Unfortunately, we did not have the scratch to buy into the rather high priced treatments (guess I will have to work harder!) Breakfast in the room was expensive, but worth every penny. Breakfast in the MoZen bistro was even better. You will not find a better blueberry pancake in all the world. I could lie down in the hallway and stare at the beautiful appointments for hours.

It was nice to be able to hook up my ipod/computer to the in-room sound system to be able to stream music. I also like the fact that there is a valet delivery system in place.

Super cool. Also, never once did we see cleaning staff. Yet, the rooms were always cleaned and turned down in the evening. They've got ninja cleaning staff. The food at the restaurant was good. We ate there for breakfast. The wait staff was attentive. My girlfriend went to the spa and she said it was amazing and felt relaxed afterwards. The rooms were quiet and rarely heard any neighbors.

She did NOT give us the signature welcome tea and towel service known at MO, which others received who were checking in around us. In room safe and television built-inside mirror were inoperative. Elevators on guest floors should have a friendly sign reminding guests to go UP to lobby to avoid countless erroneous elevator trips. Henry at breakfast room was exceptional at remembering our difficult coffee preferences, but overall dining service at buffet was inconsistent for us and tables around us; too many people had to wait for a breakfast table when 13 tables in adjacent room were \"closed off\" inexplicably. Getting taxis here is always a wait since there is no queue and the hotel is on the strip but off of the beaten path.

This means you get a much more personal serivce experience than you would standing in the lobby of a gigantic casino hotel. The whole atmosphere is also one of calm. It feels almost like walking around a spa. This is a great breath of fresh air walking in off the realtive craziness of the strip.

The Wynn / Encore at the top of the strip is maybe a 30 min walk and the Mandaly Bay at the bottom is probably about 15 mins. Price wise - its pretty expensive for Vegas, over $200 a night.

From the arrival greeting, luggage assistance, early check-in, and visit by a friendly gentleman named JoJo - who dropped off some complimentary fruit and asked if we needed anything - the MO LV created a first-rate welcome. It was not until later in the week strolling through other casinos that I realized guests normally wait in long, chaotic lines to check-in to hotels on the strip. The MO was a welcome respite to return to each day, especially with the relaxing music piped into the rooms and elevators. This is one hotel that seems to have truly thought of everything you might need in the rooms. Some highlights from the Premier Room that we enjoyed: - An in-room safe that is large enough to accommodate a laptop and includes a power port so electronics may charge while enclosed - A flat screen television within the bathroom mirror - Valet door next to your room door where you can drop items off (i.e. shoes for shining) and pick up items (i.e. newspaper) - Handheld touch screen master remote that controls everything in the room: temperature, lights (which are all able to be dimmed), curtains, television, satellite music, room service, etc. - Spacious bathroom with two sinks, vanity area, large soaking tub, shower, and a separate water closet with a third sink - Fully stocked bar and snack area, and I mean fully stocked (best part: Fever Tree products) MO Housekeeping: Housekeeping during our stay was excellent. I am admittedly a perfectionist and everything was immaculately clean and continued to be cleaned throughout our stay. At times morning service was considerably late in the day (closer to turndown), which was only noticeable on the days I had to get some work done in the room. In regards to turndown, it was pleasant to come back to a room with all the toiletries lined up, hairdryer cords wrapped, etc. Not since a Rosewood property visit in 2004 have we had such meticulous housekeeping service. MO Breakfast: After all the eating this week, I was craving something lighter and wrote in an option on the breakfast card, if possible. I asked for yogurt, a bowl of berries, and their homemade granola. Each day they accommodated this request with creative flair (changing up the presentation) and it was delicious. Their yogurt may be homemade since it was not the average sweetened goo served at other establishments for breakfast. My husband enjoyed his warm breakfast (depending on the day, it included eggs, waffles, home fries, and/or vegetables) and found it to be way ahead of the Four Seasons offering he had in San Francisco earlier in the week. MO Staff: I could go on and on about the service and hospitality present in all the staff members we encountered at the MO. A few who stood out: the gentleman who checked us in (unfortunately I cannot remember his name), JoJo who delivered the fruit on the first day, Glenn who was downstairs at the door and transportation, and Daniel, who drove the courtesy car. MO Transportation: Speaking of the courtesy car, this is an unpublished amenity at the hotel that only operates during limited times of the day. In a Four Seasons vs. Mandarin Oriental thread online, I read, \u201cHouse car at both properties offered proactively to clients if available.\u201d But I never had anyone mention the car to me during our stay. I have read reviews of people using it for airport services, but I am assuming they worked something out with the concierge privately or had special privileges based on their suite. I took taxis most of the week. One early evening when I needed to attend a meeting at the other end of the strip while traveling solo, so I asked Glenn if it was an option. Within minutes Daniel appeared and I thoroughly enjoyed talking with him during the drive as he shared about the area and the Mandarin Oriental. Like everyone we encountered at MO, his demeanor and hospitable attitude left a positive impression. MO Minor Items: - The sheet situation is interesting as there is no flat sheet. The duvet is encased within a cover made of sheet material, but there is no separate flat sheet. At first we thought this was a housekeeping mistake and called to get a flat sheet when they turned down the room. An amiable woman stopped by our room with another set sheets, but explained that it was how they dress the bed. She said she came to the MO from the Four Seasons, so it was new to her too! She was willing to add a sheet, but we decided to go with it as is. It didn\u2019t affect our sleep but was an interesting change to regular and/or triple sheeting. - One of the things that I admired about the MO prior to our stay was their use of Fever Tree products for cocktails, especially the tonic water. I try to avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup, and the Fever Tree products (made instead with cane sugar) add a clean taste to mixed drinks. Unfortunately it seems that the MO may be transitioning out of these items. The bartender said they are now using regular (aka HFCS) tonic and ginger ale, but he offered to go in the back and find some old Fever Tree products for me. They were in our room, so we were fine, but I hope they revisit this change in their main bar area. In a city full of stocked bars, it added a positive distinction to their offerings. - The printed in-room information books, hotel website, and spa brochure all have conflicting price information for spa services. They need to modify their marketing materials to reflect the same pricing information. - The elevators take a little getting used to, since you have to switch and ride two separate ones to get from the transportation lobby entrance to your room. I ended up bypassing the main lobby (23rd floor) elevators over time and instead went from the transportation entrance to the Mozen floor. The elevators there share a wall, so you just walk off, turn the corner and get on the other set of elevators to go up to your room. - I had difficulty getting through to the spa over the in-room phone, and ended up just going down to the spa to schedule an appointment for the next day. - View/City Center: Our view was not a standard strip view, but was mostly of City Center and Planet Hollywood. There was some noise during the day from a concert/stereo playing outside, but otherwise the room was quiet. Previous posts of City Center being a concrete maze of sorts are correct. It is much easier to stroll other sections of the strip, as the City Center walkways make you go up, down, and all around (or through the mall) depending on where you are headed. - Ambient/electrical lights: If you prefer to sleep in the dark, you will need to be armed with extra t-shirts and socks to cover the plethora of lights that beam from all the electrical equipment even when the lights are out. The best bet to cover the large light switch pad in the entry is to set the ironing board vertically against the wall. - While we enjoyed the comfort and technology in the room, the interior design/decor was nothing memorable or impressive. - The shower water pressure was not particularly strong, I read somewhere that this is connected to their \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives. Such green efforts seem a bit out of place considering the amount of water running in the spa - two sinks ran for almost an hour during a Hammam treatment, even when not in use (they were kept on as relaxing background noise, I assume). MO Lunch at Mozen Bistro: This was my favorite lunch in Vegas. If I could do the trip over again, I would eat there for lunch every day since dining elsewhere involved excursions and mediocre food. Service was very good and the curry dish I ordered with basmati rice (Murgh Mukhani) was flavorful. It was expensive for lunch, but this is also Vegas. Only possible downside is a lack of a nice view outside or activity going on around you while you eat, if you are looking for that on the strip. Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas - Spa: I scheduled spa services first thing in the morning, which meant that prior to my treatments I saw only one person while using the common areas and it was quiet and relaxing. After the treatments, there were more people and specifically a boisterous small group of women; you could no longer hear the music and the calm atmosphere was noticeably changed. In addition, tours of the area for new guests were plentiful. Short of limiting when people check-in for services, I do not believe this is something within the control of the spa but something to be mindful of when scheduling your appointments. The lockers, showers, and vanity areas were well stocked and guests are given a make-up bag with additional toiletries at check-in. The only downside is that refreshments are limited to water, tea, and a few apples and bananas are on the counter. I asked if anything else was available, and was told no. This meant that I concluded my visit earlier than I would have liked since I was getting hungry for lunch. I would have welcomed the option of a quick, healthy lunch while at the spa. One of the things I was most impressed with during my use of the spa was the cleanliness. I never encountered even a stray hair. I am not sure how they keep everything so pristine in between guests, but housekeeping was certainly top notch during my visit. Overall impression: The Mandarin Oriental exceeded all our expectations and will be our hotel of choice when attending an annual conference in the area.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "U.S.", "Title": "\u201cStrip View Suite Pleases\u201d", "Author": "traveler2099", "ReviewID": "UR97210712", "Content": "This hotel lives up to the positive reviews.

The next highest category after Strip View Suites are the Apex Suites. Those start at the low-end of the tipping point when you get into the $1,000+ per night suites.

We have stayed in hotels all over Las Vegas including, but not limited to, Rio, Mandalay Bay, Paris, Caesars, Bellagio, Venetian, Four Seasons, Wynn and Encore. Mandarin Oriental was the most luxurious, attentive property we have visited. The first floor entrance was well staffed. People grabbed our bags and had them outside of our tenth floor room in a jiffy. We went to the lobby on the 23rd floor where we were greeted by people who seemed genuinely happy to see us check in. Everything about the place was first class. The lobby and bar area on the 23rd floor has beautiful views of The Strip to the north and the south. The waitresses/hostesses/bartenders were hospitable without being intrusive. The room was just beautiful. Little touches were everywhere. Open up the safe drawer and inside the safe, you will find two outlets to charge your cell phones. A universal remote/digital display on a bedside table allows you to control the television, the lights, the temperature, the music and provides indoor and outdoor temperature readings.

We love views from our room and the wife was able to simultaneously soak in the bath and see the palm trees outside of our room. Did I mention the staff was attentive? The bellman insisted on filling up our ice bucket when he saw our champagne bottle from the limousine ride to the hotel. On our last day, they picked up our bags, after our late checkout (1 p.m.) and when we returned from a long walk the doorman called for our bags and offered us cold bottled water while calling the cab from across the hotel entrance. This is a nongaming, nonsmoking hotel, which we really liked. A nice respite from the crowds and foul air of most of the other Strip hotels. However, it was a short walk (although you do have to go outdoors in the weather) to both Aria\u2019s casino or the new Cosmopolitan if you would like to gamble.

He immediately arranged for my luggage to be brought up and showed me to the registration desk. There, I was provided with tea and a warm towel while completing check-in.

I'm not much of a Vegas person, so when I found a hotel that promised to be an \"oasis of calm\" on the Strip, I jumped at the opportunity to stay here. It is as advertised, quiet even among the bustle of the casino hotels surrounding it. The service was good. The front-desk and concierge were extremely quick and helpful, I was able to find answers to most of my questions. Despite their helpfulness, I encountered small problems in my one week stay with housekeeping. I asked for two small hotel amenities -one of them showed up an hour late even after a few calls to the front desk (due to a room number mix-up on their part), while the other item never showed up. In addition, some nights turn-down service was forgotten ... even when specifically requested. (I suspect that miscommunication and disorganization has plagued them in the past.) The rooms were great. Very comfortable, great use of space, very tech-friendly. I was on one of the higher floors, and the view was great. The washroom was very large, and the bathtub was very inviting. I loved having LCD screen in the washroom as well, it was just a lovely extra feature on top of the automatic blinds that you controlled at your nightstand. The bed was heavenly, the pillows could have been less firm, but if you sleep on your side, it will not be an issue. On another note, my room was close to the elevators, and if your television wasn't on, you could hear it go up and down all day long. Being a deep sleeper, and finding it too inconvenient to move to another room, I did not request to be switched. However, if you are a light sleeper or bringing children, make sure to ask for a quieter room. The Restaurant/Exercise Facilities/Pool/Spa, I can't comment on, as I didn't get a chance to try them out. Location was great, in the middle of everything. Easy walk to Cosmopolitan, Aria, Monte Carlo, Planet Hollywood, and all the surrounding shops. Like everywhere else on the strip, it is a good idea to bus or cab, if you don't drive or don't like to walk. Style, it was a beautiful hotel. Almost too stylish. It was simply too dark. At 9 AM in the morning, you feel like you've stepped into a dark cave. However, the lobby in particular was stunning at night. Value was great. I had found a deal, it was absolutely worth it for the price I found it at, but would I stay here if I was paying the normal rate? Probably not. For that price I expect either much bigger rooms, or much more professional housekeeping service. Mandarin Oriental Vegas is indeed five-star in Vegas, but world-wide, I wouldn't put them there yet.

But I do know a thing or two about great hotels and the MO is nothing short of spectacular in every way. It's located in the giant new City Center but is an oasis of calm and taste in a city not really known for either. Our Junior Suite was beautiful, big rooms, floor-to-ceiling windows and really sophisticated design. It does have a fairly modern/masculine feel to it. Those who are familiar with the MO in Hong Kong will recognize many of the design notes. Great bed. My only negative comment would be the wall of buttons that control pretty much everything. At night, they are back lit and you can't read what they control. The technology overload can create a pretty comic effect if you are trying to turn on a light to go to the bathroom and suddenly curtains are moving one way, sheers the other, things are beeping and chaos ensues. Yeah, that happened more than once. The bathroom was bigger than a lot of studio apartments in NYC. In the middle was a spectacular slipper tub, easily big enough for two to enjoy together. One quirk is that the sinks (there were two) are shoe-horned into the corners and feels way too small and camped considering the amount of space. To shave or wash your face, you seriously risk throwing your back out. This service is as refined as the design. Everyone is friendly yet correct: Really, the service couldn't be better. We did get a couple of bad restaurant recommendations from the concierge but were warned both times that the concierge had not eaten there but had heard good things. When we came back and told them we had a different experience they welcomed the additional information. Vegas can be overwhelming. If you want to stay someplace very close to the heart of things, but completely separated from it, the MO is it. The rooms, service, really everything was flawless and actually quite reasonable for what your getting. One final note, just for the record, I hate sky lobbies.

By far, the nicest place I stayed at. I stayed at the MO in Manila and in Jakarta, so this brand in not unfamiliar to me. All I can say is if you have a chance to stay here, do. I took a break from many things and really had a great chance to recharge my batteries. Here's what I loved about this hotel: Everyone used my name when they spoke to me. It was a very personal stay. Everything worked. Often I get to a Vegas hotel only to have to call down for this or that to be fixed. Not this stay. Ordered \"breakfast in bed\" option for Christmas morning when making my reservation. The food was delivered at the time requested, hot and the server did a great job. Above all, it really tasted great. I did love the waffles! (Opted for eating by the window) I always felt welcome and wanted. An example, while exploring the exercise room and the pools, I was met by the person in charge who really wanted to set up a workout for me. (I was only interested in exploring) She answered all of my questions and showed real concern for me. Most times when I go to the exercise room, I am ignored and have to find my own way around (self service). This hotel is truly full service. They have a Technology box with most of the cables that you need to connect to either the internet or the television. Television. Since it is not their goal to get or keep you in a casino, they give you all the Cable channels. You'll get all the science, learning, network, major cable channels as well as Disney, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. It is the widest available channel line up I have seen in Vegas. Views. Really nice views from my room and from the lounge. Christmas morning stocking left on my door. Although I like the fact that there is no Casino, if you really need a fix, you are only steps away from the Aria or Monte Carlo. Yes, you will have to walk outside, but perhaps some people need that bit of reality. They have more than one book to read if you want to. And they are interesting! Usually something with an Asian slant. They deliver a newspaper. They have water boilers for fresh tea. Feel free to bring your own instant coffee if you do not want to order it from room service. I stayed in a Mandarin Premiere room which was a little bit larger 650 sq ft vs a regular 500 sq ft room. The extra room while nice is not really necessary. It's mostly bathroom space. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will stay in a regular room, perhaps a Cityscape room. The Valet closet is a nice feature since I usually have laundry to be picked up in the morning, OK, I had so many good things to say about the Mandarin, surely I must have some criticism. I only have one. They have some great tempting offers. The greatest is the stay three nights get one free. If you can get this offer, you can get a strip view room for three nights at a cost of about $203/night net. Unfortunately for me, they do not carry them out to the future very far, usually just a few months. I plan my travel sometimes 6 months or more in advance. Once plans are finalized, I do not like to change them, so I can't seem to take advantage of that great price. My second criticism is that the internet costs a whopping $ 18 a day. On the plus side, it is good for everywhere in the CityCenter complex.

I didn't use the spa - a bit pricey for me - but I can only imagine the pampering those who do take advantage it must experience. The workout room was state of the art and classes were offered. The pool was beautiful but sadly it rained for my three day stay. Still, I couldn\u2019t think of a better place to be in Las Vegas \u2013 rain or shine.

It does NOT have a casino in the hotel. You have to take a 4 minute walk to Aria. Location: The hotel is located in the heart of the strip. It is a part of City Center. The entrance to the hotel is little opening in front of CVS. You are in the middle of the action here, but its still difficult to get around due to the size of everything. Service: The service is unbelievable. If you want anything done just ask. The answer is always yes Mr or Mrs so and so. This hotel has a ton of staff. There are plenty of doorman and porters, two concierges, gym trainers, attendants etc. Turn down service is nice and they provide free bottles of water. Service is impeccable even at Mozen. Plates are cleared properly and everything is served the same way. Training is amazing. Room: The room is a modern and roomy 550 sq feet. The beds are amazing. Foam pillows available upon request. The lights, shades, radio, tv are all controlled from a remote by the bed. The shower is great as is the bath tub. The bathroom has great products, plenty of room, blow-dryer, hair iron, shaving kit and sea salt for baths. I slept so well in these beds. There is ample closet space. There is also a valet where they put newspapers and service so they do not disturb you. Room is always cleaned promptly. Fitness Center: Its has all techno gym equipment. Plenty of modern treadmills, ellipticals and bikes with tvs in them. There are dumb bells up to 50lbs. Try the fitness wall, its an incredible workout. The regular machines count your reps, measure range of motion and judge speed. There are headphones for tv, cold towels, fruit and bottle of water. Spa: Hotel has an amazing spa with expensive services. There is a steam room, sauna, pool and hot tub as well. Outside pool is heated. Parking: Parking at the Mandarin is $30 a day, which is insane for Las Vegas. Park at the main Aria parking lot for free and walk 2 minutes. Or valet it at Mandarin and move it by 1am. Thats when they count overnight cars. Restaurants: Twist is incredibly expensive and did not eat there. Mozen is great. Had breakfast there everyday. It is expensive but delicious. Brunch on Sunday is great. Sushi is awesome. Value: Cheapest MO around because its in Las Vegas. Far better than the Four Seasons. Book through American Express Fine Hotels to get a great deal.

To be honest, the rates they offered (USD215 for 2 nights + 1 complimentary night = USD430 for 3 nights) was the least expensive of the hotels on our wish list. For those of us who are used to the \"treat you like king\" service in Asia, it's sometimes a big culture shock when you stay at the top hotels in the US. For example, in Asia, you get complimentary slippers, complimentary bath/shower amenities, complimentary tea/coffee galore in your room. If you need more amenities you will get more. In Asia you never have to worry about tipping for every little request. It's a different story in the US, you tip, you tip, you tip. That's why we were prepared to \"tip\" for every request we had. The Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas exceeded our expectations. Everytime we had a request, ie., an extra box of tissues, more amenities, etc. they brought it to our room within 5 minutes. Each time we were greeted with a \"is there anything else we can do for you?\" Coming from Asia and having stayed at 5 other Mandarin Oriental hotels in the world including Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, this was the top one on my list. I liked how the hotel was located on the Strip and it didn't have a casino. It is quieter but it made a difference because we didn't have to wait in line for check in, check out or a taxi. The touch screen remote control was easy to operate and I liked how the light switches had a small indicator light so you could find the switch when the lights were out. I liked how they gave complimentary slippers (rare in the US). I also liked how it was located in the City Center and you could walk to the Miracle Miles shops, the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, etc. We even walked across the street to Smith & Wollensky's for lunch one day.

I have previously stayed in the Monte Carlo, and the Venetian. I recently stayed for 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental - a relatively new property. From walking through the door, to checking out, the entire experience was amazing. The staff are very friendly, and willing to help in any way they can. Most importantly, they seem to want to do so, and didn't seem like they were doing so purely because it was their job. We stayed in a Strip View suite. The room was large, and the floor plan is very clever. The living area has an \"L\" shaped couch, huge LCD TV (with DVD/CD player, and many, many TV channels), a desk and large bar. The TV has a connectivity panel, so that one can charge iPods etc, and view video/photos and more through the TV. The view was great, and we could see Mandalay bay from one side, and Paris/PH the other. The bedroom has a huge kind sized bed, which was very comfortable. There is also another TV in the bedroom, equal in size to that in the lounge. There is a small touch screen control on one side table for the blinds (both sheer and blackout), temperature, wake up alarm settings (awesome!), and lights. The bedroom is large, and decor under-stated but amazing. The bathroom is also large. The soaking tub could fit 4 people (if you are so inclined - hey, it's Vegas!), and the shower more. There are 2 sinks, a large mirror, and a TV behind the mirror. The amenities are great. There was even a hair straightener. There is also a small corridor between the entry hall/lounge area and the bathroom which houses a large closet, and room to hang up numerous items of clothing. The little touches made the experience even better. There are numerous books in the room, a connectivity kit (iPod/phone charger, CAT5 cable, universal power adapter etc) and many other things you'd never think of. Each night, a bottle of water for each guest was placed on the side tables in the bedroom, and fresh towels with rose petals on them on the side of the bath. Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel enough. I have stayed in quite a few nice hotels, but when it comes to the whole package (room, service and comfort etc), nothing beats the MO.

I had anticipated a \"flashy\" hotel that would rival the glitz and glamor of other hotels on the strip. Instead, the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas was quiet, sophisticated, and \"low key\". We had a \"pool view\" room on the 14th floor. The room was amazing. It was very comfortable with current decor.

It's hard to grade this hotel, there's a lot of it to like, but then the little things really drag it down in my eyes. I liked the check in process, by the time you're at the lobby everything is ready for you to sign, but then by the time my bag got to my room, 20 minutes, it was too late to get out in the sun for an hour. The room is generally excellent, good bed, lovely bathroom and shower, vanity area for clothes, nice oriental decor and the remote controlled two layer blinds made sleep superb. But the problems started with the tv not working properly, very poor reception on ESPN, very crackly and breaking up, then the navigation screen froze, and the tv went a bit loopy. They sent someone to reset it, but it went wrong again 10 minutes later, so I asked to move rooms. No problem there, but 10 minutes later its breaking up again. So I head down to reception on my way out, and they tell me that the Cox network they use is having issues, not them. The girl was cold as ice and sounded like I was stupid for bringing it up and complaining. So I had a repair man and moved room for no reason, very relaxing. In the second room as I was coming out of the shower, I noticed that the bath had a great many dirty black smears all along the base, as if it had scraped against black rubber while being installed, destroying the aesthetic. The control panel for the lighting and shades froze one night, so I had to get up and use the wall controls, and for some reason when you turn all lights off it turns the tv off too, very annoying. I didn't like having to phone room service to bring me ice, as its locked away in the housekeeping room, though they can put it in a service hatch in the vanity area so you dont have to deal with people, but on the third night after they'd delivered the ice I discovered they hadn't replaced the whisky tumbler, so had to phone again, and instead of leaving it in the hatch they rang the doorbell, and the guy who brought it then stood there expectantly as if I should tip him for them not servicing the room properly. The mini bar is insanely expensive, nearly double the cost of a Four Seasons minibar, 9$ for a diet coke, ludicrous. The room service food is fabulous, the best I've had, I tried three different meals and they were all excellent, and as with most hotels these days, the service is included, however only once was that mentioned by the deliverer, unlike the Four Seasons who made a great point of pointing it out, and the area for gratuity is left open, which is a real con job. On one day the bin wasn't emptied, not good enough for a hotel thats trying to be 5 diamond in every way. The pool area was closed, you could still use it but there was no service, and nobody came to clear away the towels that had been used, so I went back and used the Four Seasons pool. I was driven down there in the hotels town car, which was very nice, and the drivers were great, much rather tip them than pay for a cab. Had some drinks in the bar at the top, and the cocktails and music were good, but it was really dead, there's really not much point to going there if you're not at the hotel grabbing a nightcap, and the food was ridiculous, ordered a prosciutto appetizer and it had one slice on a big piece of bread, the waitress did get me some more when I complained. I generally found the staff attentive, but in a rather forced fashion. I felt like I was being forced to fit in with Mandarin Oriental way, whereas the Four Seasons adapts itself to make you feel comfortable.

I have stayed at nearly all of the properties in Las Vegas and this was a property I hadn\u2019t tried due to its recent opening. I try to stay some place different each time I visit Vegas because there is so much to see, and with the new hotels in City Center, the MO seemed perfect. Also, Mandarin Oriental has a stellar reputation for their hotels, or at least I had been told. Having not stayed at a MO property yet, this one seemed like that best pick. The final deciding factor was that MO offered the most competitive rates for a 5 star hotel for the week of our stay, making this the very best choice. Arrival: From the moment we stepped out of the cab for check-in, it was like being transported into a magical place. (Think Disney World for adults.) Efficient bellmen lined up and took our luggage away. The ground entrance to MO is private, tranquil and serene. I immediately felt calmed. The bellman asked us our names and we entered the elevator to the 23rd floor where their check in is located. When you step off the elevator, you will be stunned with the magnificent view of the strip, especially if you check in at night. There was no line for registration (a Las Vegas first for me) and the woman who checked us in knew our names before we made it to the desk. (The bellman mics to the desk worker that we are coming up the elevator for check in, so before you get there, they have all of your paper work pulled and ready for you.) This was a very impressive, efficient nice touch. We were greeted with an upgrade to a strip view room, much to our delight. Also, the front desk handed us warm towels for our hands and offered us hot tea. We were so impressed with the service. Also, I needed a doctor to look at my tonsils, as I travel a lot and had a sore throat / white patches. The check in woman had the concierge dispatch the hotel Doctor to my room and he was there with medicine for my tonsillitis within 40 minutes. This saved my trip to Vegas and prevented me from getting worse. This also meant that I didn\u2019t have to sit in a Vegas ER (Can you imagine?) or take \u00bd a day from my vacation to be seen by a private practice Doctor. I started my meds immediately that night after check in and felt better in the morning. (Thank you MO!) Rooms: The rooms are decorated in understated dark tones. This is very \u201cun-Vegas\u201d until you get inside and experience the carefully planned opulence and amenities the room has to offer. There is a small trap door for servers / housekeeping to put items through, as to not bother guests. I really liked that feature. You have a doorbell on your room as well, which eliminates that loud, obnoxious pounding that no one wants to hear on vacation. The room comes with the following: - An extra blanket, perfectly boxed and stored for your use - Easy to use safe - Beautiful closet, with inner lighting - Plenty of drawers for your belongings - Automatic button for valet or housekeeping built into the wall - Amazing smelling bath salts for the bath, namely eucalyptus - Rose petals left at night on the towels over the tub - Large, oversized jewelry box for your jewels so you don\u2019t leave them laying around the room / lose them during your stay - Hot iron that works better than mine does at home; I am going to go out and buy the exact same one that they provided because it was so great - Tea pot with an automatic timer for in room tea service - Automatic window curtains with remote - A mini \u201cipad-like\u201d remote that controls the entire room. This was very impressive and state-of-the-art. Also, it was VERY easy to use; a child could figure it out without issue. - The most comfortable bed you will ever have the pleasure of sleeping in. Both of us smiled with delight as we sank into the bed, when we felt the extraordinary comfort. Room Service: We did order room service when we arrived. We ordered 2 pots of hot tea to our room, $36 or so. Service was fast, friendly, efficient, and beautiful. We requested more tea bags, and those were hustled up immediately. At the time we ordered, we didn\u2019t realize that there was a chrome electronic tea maker in our room that was easy to use. We used that the rest of the trip and it worked amazing. I would consider buying one for myself for my home. Service: If you are a person that loves top service, welcome to your place! This is THE place for a service destination to the highly discriminating connoisseur in hotel staff. I stay at a lot of top hotels, but this service was unparalleled. You will notice how incredibly well trained the staff is on every level. Many hotels can accomplish having well trained front desk staff, but you will find from the front desk, to the bellmen, to the house driver, to the trainers at the gym, from the concierge to MoZen restaurant servers are all impeccably trained. Even the hostesses at both the Tea Lounge and MoZen were warm, kind and connective. I would also like to compliment the HR department of Mandarin Oriental Corporate on their ability to hire the right people and then to train and develop them further into magnificent service personnel. Well done. This is not an easy task to accomplish, but Mandarin Oriental has set the standard for the rest of the industry to follow. Gym: If you spend an appreciable amount of time in the gym, like I do, stop right here and just book now. This gym IS the attraction at this property. You could make this into a Vegas show itself. You will be greeted with 2 trainers that are free at your disposal to ask any question you desire. The female trainer showed me how to get the best stretch for runners, which I will likely use the rest of my life. They offer you chilled towels, fruit, and water, all complementary. Heaven forbid, you stretch yourself out; at this gym, they have automatic stretchers that stretch you out and the trainers will show you how to use the machines. The REAL luxury experience occurs once you get onto the treadmill. My jaw absolutely dropped to the ground. The background of your treadmill screen is a large TV that you can watch 40+ shows of your choice. (Personally, I watched the Kardashians during my run.) The treadmills overlook the strip. During my running, I got to watch airplanes take off from LAS and disappear into the beautiful Vegas blue sky. It was mesmerizing. If you get bored of that, the treadmills even have games built in. I played Connect 4 for a bit. I just couldn\u2019t believe the high luxury of this gym. If you decide to stay here, at least go walk around and see it before you leave; it is truly remarkable. Pool: I was sad that it wasn\u2019t until after my last workout, walking out of the gym that I noticed the pool. I walked out there, covered in sweat just to see what it looked like. Stunning. Gorgeous. Luxury. The cabanas looked exactly right out of a movie and the d\u00e9cor of the pool area itself was trendy and modern. Overall, it looked like art. I wish I would have thought to lay out there sooner in the trip and not 1 hour before I was leaving for the airport. When I stay at this hotel again, I will be sure to take a seat in the sunshine, enjoy my IPod and the beauty of the pool; don\u2019t miss out. MoZen Restaurant: This might be one of the most pricy breakfasts you will have in awhile, but it is a nice experience. The food is pretty light, and isn\u2019t over weighted in oils / fats. Therefore, it isn\u2019t overly bursting with taste, but I believe you are getting less calories. The Mandarin Breakfast is very good. The service here is amazing, just like the service is at every aspect of this hotel. Careful though: a green tea alone is $9, and a breakfast is $28 or so. It is a different experience, however, and even your fruit bowl comes with star fish and dragon fruit from Taiwan. The view overlooks City Center and in the morning, you can catch runners running by. I also liked Silk Road at Vdara and also the breakfast place at Aria where I ate next to Larry King. Tea Lounge: One of my Vegas local friends and I caught up over a glass pot of oolong tea at the 23rd floor tea lounge (at check in.) This overlooks the strip and we enjoyed our hot tea and conversation. I very much enjoyed this and would go out of my way again once back in Vegas to enjoy the tea lounge. $12 a pot, but the view, service and atmosphere make it worth it. If we had more time, I would have stayed for 2 or 3 pots of tea; it was breathtaking and tranquil. Unexpected Perks: The use of the black Mercedes house car twice, twice a day maid service who actually reservice the room at night, the hot iron straightener, bath salts, tea maker, free gym trainers (when available) and endless, high level service. Tips for Staying at this Property: Bring your favorite teas from home so you can enjoy them in your room with your private tea maker. DO spend the money and ensure yourself a STRIP view room (not a city view room which can overlook CVS or McDonalds.) Leave your hot iron and blow dryers at home; theirs are awesome. Request extra hangers when you check in; they didn\u2019t have enough in the rooms. Downfalls: The newer hotels I have been staying in have been providing free makeup wipes; housekeeping doesn\u2019t provide those as a room standard. The elevators are a pain because you have to \u201cmake a connection\u201d and switch elevators on the 3rd or 23rd floor. This was kind of annoying by the end of our stay. The prices are high, as I indicated before. Internet is $18 or so a day, with the first 5 minutes free to check your email from the hotel computers. This seemed high; every place I go, it has been free or included when I sign up to be a hotel member. Agreed / Disagreed with Other Reviewers: I agreed with the reviewers that complained that the elevators, although beautiful with a couch, are a pain because you can\u2019t take a direct line from the ground floor to your room. I disagreed with people that complained that the room technology was complicated. As I indicated, a child could operate the room remote and everything that is encompassed therein. I loved the room remote and found it very easy to use and a enlightening / exciting experience. I disagreed with writers saying that the atmosphere at MO was stuffy / snotty. I loved that it was more quiet and elegant; this atmosphere was very refreshing to what I am typically used to in Vegas, making it an attractive future option. Stay at this hotel if you: Like beauty, serenity, tranquillness, calmness, service, understated elegance, state-of-the-art technology, quiet, serene, high brow gym and pool. Best for romantic getaways, business travelers, solo travelers, & girl\u2019s weekends. Avoid this hotel if you: Desire Vegas glitz and glamour, loud casinos, smoke, large families, children, economic pricing. Overall: Before, hands down, the Venetian / Palazzo property was my favorite. Now, this is by FAR my favorite property. The service blew my mind, the quiet, smoke free environment was almost tranquil in a city full of noise, the rooms were amazingly equipped, and the gym would give any gym on this planet a run for their money. There were few families and mostly quiet couples or business travelers. If you can afford to stay here, do it.

This is the place of elegance and privacy: for those who does not into drunk and sleazy scene, Mandarin is well designed and situated in the new City Center, the design of the hotel is to use different elevators and entrance to block the people who are not the hotel guest.

The other review is correct, this is not for your typical Vegas style where is all facade and everything is unlimited.

We have previously stayed at Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur so knew that we were in for a treat. As the hotel only opened in December 2009 were we lucky enough to get 2 nights for the price of 1. On arrival to the hotel we were directed to the lift which took us up to the lobby several floors up. It doesn't take much to amaze me so I was rather impressed that the lift had a seat in it :) Once we arrived at the lobby we were welcomed with a hot towel and a cup of traditional tea. The lobby is beautifully and tastefully decorated and looks very modern. We had arrived rather early so we left our luggage and went for a meal in the Hard Rock Cafe, the hotel called us as soon as our room was ready and we went back to the hotel. Once we collected our key we were shown to the lift to take us to our room, the room key is needed to operate the lift, there were a few teething problems with our key but luckily the manager of the hotel was in the lift with us so he sorted it out. We arrived at our room and our bags were going to be delivered to us later. We opened the door to our room as we were amazed that the curtains automatically opened and the TV and music came on in the bedroom and bathroom (mirror). The room was lovely but the bathroom was amazing, the toiletries were amazing, bath salts and aromatherapy shampoo, shower gel etc. The bath was really deep and filled up in no time at all, there was a separate shower and a double sink, I could have spent all day in there :) Our luggage got delivered into a secret compartment so that we were not disturbed - genius! The remote control was my husbands favourite part, he got to control everything in the room, you could set the atmosphere and rather than setting an alarm you could set a time for the curtains to open, lights to swtich on and music/tv to come on, I want one at home! As it was our honeymoon we got a basket of fruit and a bottle of champagne delivered to our room, which was a nice touch. I loved the tea making facilities in the room, we stayed in several hotels during our 2 weeks and rarely found tea making facilities, it was either coffee or nothing. The staff in the lobby were more than accomodating when our flight back to the UK got cancelled (due to snow) and I had to spend several hours on hold on the front desk phone!!!

The check-in lobby is not on the main floor, and the view from the lobby towards the skyline of Las Vegas Strip is nice, but this is common in Vegas. What impressed me was the usual Mandarin's attention to details. They referred me by my first name when I arrived, checked me in within 5 minutes, gave me a complimentary voucher to use for my stay, offered me a complimentary use of their Mercedes S-Class Hybrid Limousine for all my meetings, and largely left me alone without being too \"in your face\", as one would typically like when they travel for work. There's good level of privacy in this hotel as room lifts are separated from the lobby lifts, which could be annoying as one has to switch each time you go up or come down, but the glass is half full for me on this one. And best of all, there are no casinos attached to this hotel, and the nearest one is Aria (about 5 minutes walk). Conclusion, its peaceful and quiet, how unlike any Las Vegas property!

We were guided up to the 23 floor \"sky lobby,\" where our check-in was smooth and seamless and utterly without casino noise or smoke. We were escorted to the elevators and made our way down to the rooms. In order to get from the strip to your room, you must always take two elevators, as the ones on the ground level go only to the 3rd and 23rd floors. When had booked a premier room, but when we got there we found we'd been upgraded to an executive suite. Our room was uniquely shaped, as it sat in one of the triangular corners of the building. We had a lovely sitting room as well as an gorgeous bathroom, and my immediate reaction was that I wanted to spend the entire weekend in the room. We were hungry, though, and wanted to walk a bit after being in the car, so we went out to City Center for a bite and then a drink at the bar on the 23rd floor. The service at the bar was not quite there, as the waitress forgot part of our order. The sleeping could have been better that night. These glass-walled hotels really do not keep the sound out, and so I woke up a number of times to hear a pounding disco beat or sirens going up and down the strip. Also, the clock/room controller at the side of the bed was incredibly bright, and I couldn't figure out how to dim it. In the morning, I called reception, and asked how to dim it, and they informed me that this was not possible. In addition, often when you tried to control the room using this controller, it didn't work. Ditto with some of the other switches, though anything you tried to control through the TV obeyed. Room service breakfast was delivered promptly and was well prepared. We spent time by the pool, though when we asked to sit in a shaded area, instead of setting up an umbrella for us, they guided us to the bunker-like \"quiet area.\" Attendants bring around complimentary tidbits frequently, and the pool area is much more peaceful and civilized than some of the other ones I've been to in LA. Things started to fall apart a little bit the next day. We ordered room service coffee with whole milk, and the coffee was not particularly hot when it arrived, and it came with skim milk, not quite a value at $20. And the coffee wasn't great, either. We went to the pool again Sunday morning, and this time we knew not to ask for shade. We ate a nice breakfast pool-side, read and swam for a bit, and then checked out. One surprise was that with all the technology, you can't check out on the TV. There was no line so it didn't matter much. Also, they brought the wrong car and we had a fairly substantial wait as we were trying to leave. It's a hard call whether I would stay there again. I'm pretty sure I would ask for a room facing away from the strip.

Check In We arrived late on a Sunday night; our taxi had no problem finding the hotel entrance. Our bags were taken on the ground floor and we were directed to the sky lobby on level 23 by a bellman. Check in process was smooth and very quick, without feeling rushed. The agent was friendly and efficient and if we didn\u2019t ask any questions, the whole process would have been done in under a minute\u2026.very nice! When we got to our room, the luggage attendant was already outside the room waiting for us with our luggage Room The executive suite was incredible!! There was a living room with chairs couches, 2 TV\u2019s with TONS of channels, including premium channels (HBO) and cold champagne waiting for us there. One should note that the executive suites come in 3 different sizes, we were in the largest one (rooms ending in 35). All the lights, curtains and temperature could be adjusted on either of the TVs or a small little control unit. The controls are a little laggy, but if you\u2019re patient with them, they work. The bathroom was quite large and split in to two opposite sides with 2 separate sinks and mirrors. There is a TV in the mirror on one of the sides, but you are able to watch it from the other side through the mirror; the sound is played through speakers in the ceiling. The Bathroom was stocked with tons of amenities, everything and anything you would need. Shampoo and lotions were Bvlagari; however, the restocking of them was inconsistent. The shower was very nice with excellent water pressure, didn\u2019t get a chance to use the tub which was right by the window with a nice view at night. The bed was really comfortable and the views surrounding the entire room reminded you of being right in the core of the vegas strip. Pool Area A nice pool area with 2 small lap pools, but not long enough to actually swim laps in. The pool was never busy and always had tons of loungers, even late in to the morning and early afternoon. The service was excellent some days and non existent on others. We found there to be more families at the pool than other hotels, but the kids were generally well behaved and quiet. Frozen fruit and popsicles were served every few hours by the pool attendants. The poolside restaurant was good for quick lunches, just make sure not to get a coke (8$ for a 250ml bottle\u2026.. that\u2019s half of a can!)The cabanas were almost always empty, only 1 or 2 used per day, although they looked very nice. Service The service we found was definitely acceptable, however it didn\u2019t seem seamlessly perfect as one would expect from a mandarin property, it did seem a little forced sometimes, but it definitely didn\u2019t leave us with a negative impression. Generally, it does feel more personal than other hotels as they refer to you by name (most of the time) and remember little details about you (where you\u2019re visiting from, reason for visiting). These details seem to be passed around to all the staff so when you encounter them throughout the hotel (restaurants, spa) they do know a little about you. Spa Definitely the most expensive on the strip, but not by that much (relatively). Massages were around $220 for 80 minutes and Hamam was $100. We made reservations about 3 weeks in advance through e-mail, as per recommendations; however the spa didn\u2019t seem that busy. Overall the spa is beautiful and service is very friendly as you would expect. Upon entering you\u2019re asked to fill out a form and given tea and a towel while your shoes are taken away and replaced with slippers. You\u2019re then escorted down a set of stairs (yes no elevator) to the locker rooms and facilities. Locker rooms are very nice and facilities are great as well. Saunas, Steam Rooms, bubbled pools with large windows (however view is not that great) and cool showers that play sound effects with mood lighting with different streams of water. The Hamam treatment was perfect to have done before spending a lot of time under the sun as it involved a full body exfoliation. You\u2019re taken in to a cool looking room with led lights on the ceiling and lots of humidity and asked to lie on a heated marble slab. You\u2019re then rinsed with water and scrubbed down with a loofah and goats milk, which was a little painful at times. Finally you get covered in bubbles, and then massaged with oil. It was new to us and it was definitely an interesting experience \u2013 our skin felt so soft after. For the massage you\u2019re escorted back up the flight of stairs and in to the treatment room. The rooms are very nice and dark, one thing which was odd was there was no board under your head to rest your arms. The massage was very good and overall the service was really professional and attentive. Mozen & Room Service Our package included a daily breakfast, either in the Mozen bistro or for room service. I must say the room service was the best we\u2019ve had anywhere, but the exact same dishes were ordered at the Mozen bistro for breakfast and they were much better there, aka bigger portions, nicer presentation, fruit was riper etc. For breakfasts, there was never any wait for a table, service was very good and food was delicious. For dinner, we made reservations ahead of time for a 7PM seating which were definitely not needed as we were the only ones in the restaurant. The food was good, had different plates of sushi but we found it a little difficult to read through the menu. The menu seemed convoluted with tons of options from chinese, to indian to sushi\u2026 a more streamlined menu would have been preferred . General The mandarin offers a complimentary house car (Mercedes S) which is very nice (when available). The chauffeur was friendly; however it was only available once during our stay. Bottled water is complimentary; it\u2019s left in the room for turndown service and also available at the pool. The lobby on the first floor is very nice but small. The lobby on the 23rd floor is beautiful with a very nice view. It\u2019s about a 7 minute walk to get to Aria, you do need to cross the whole mandarin Porte-coch\u00e8re about four lanes, as there is no path (as people mentioned) , however there\u2019s barely any cars so it\u2019s not a big deal. Once you cross that, it\u2019s up an escalator and a small walk towards aria. We did take a taxi one night from Aria to MO, as we were very tired, and it cost about 7$ with tip. Final Thoughts Overall the experience we had at the Mandarin Las Vegas was a pleasure, it was very peaceful (probably due to lack of casino) and you really felt like you were one of very few guests staying here. We would recommend it to people looking for a quiet place to stay and specifically families. As people said, it definitely doesn\u2019t feel like Vegas, so if that\u2019s what you are looking for \u2013 it\u2019s\u2019 an excellent hotel that just needs a little additional fine tuning and experience. We continued our vacation at the Encore Tower Suites after, which while also is rather quiet, as soon as you step outside into the Encore you\u2019re right back in Vegas. Ultimately it depends what you\u2019re looking for, for us the MO was a nice start to our Vegas vacation, but we wouldn\u2019t have stayed there for the entire vacation. We would have missed the Encore Casino and the vast selection of Wynncore Restaurants being right outside our door.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cTrue Luxury Hotel\u201d", "Author": "HabsFan33", "ReviewID": "UR78286146", "Content": "Really awesome expereince at MO Las Vegas.

Yes, you do need to take one elevator to the lobby and another elevator to your room. I really did not mind it, especially considering that you never had to wait more than a few seconds for either elevator. Most hotels in vegas you spend a lot of time waiting for an overcrowded elevator. Room was outstanding with touch screen controls for everything. Bathroom nice size with beautiful separate bathtub . We had a great view of the strip. Bed was super comfortable and had no problem sleeping late into the day as the curtains were great and noise was minimal on our floor. Had afternoon tea which was actually a decent bargain considering how overpriced all the other food and drinks were at the hotel. Pool area wasn't huge like most resorts in vegas but that was a plus for me. 2 pools and hot tub. Pool staff greeted you at the door and set up your lounge chairs and towels. Also brought you complimentary water bottles whenever you needed it. Actually all staff around the hotel provided water whenever you wanted it. A really nice perk when visitng Vegas in the summer. Location of the hotel is good too since its relatively in the middle of the strip. Another nice perk is that hotel has car to take you to places within 2 miles of hotel.

The executive suite was well appointed, a nice size living room, full bar area, spacious bedroom, bath and closet. The living room and bedroom had floor to ceiling windows facing the Vegas Strip (looking down towards Paris). All was controlled through the TV, and they also included a technology kit with any extra cables that you may need. We really enjoyed being in a quieter more traquil hotel. It did not bother me one bit that we needed to go to the 23rd floor lobby in order to get into another elevator to get to our room floor. In most Vegas hotels you have to walk a mile, through the casino, to get to the elevator.. so one extra stop didn't bother me. Plus the staff greeted us every time we came through. Our room rate included continental breakfast and $100 at the spa. I did not use the spa credit as we just didn't have time, but we did take advantage of the continental breakfast via room service. It was just wonderful. We had no problems with the valet or doormen as one reviewer had previously posted. It does cost $30 a night to valet, self parking is available for free at Aria. We decided to valet, and our car was always waiting for us by the time we made it downstairs... cooled off, and with two bottles a chilled water. A nice touch on teh 107 degree days that we were there. The one slight complaint I have is that housekeeping is a bit inconsistent.

We were on a higher floor so we had a great view of the strip. The positives: 1. The interior of the hotel is very beautiful, elegant and quiet. It did not have the feel of a typical Vegas hotel, probably because there isn't a casino on-property. 2. The fitness center was good, though on the smaller side. The equipment was well-maintained and staff was there to help. 3. MOzen Bistro served delicious breakfasts --- the french toast was especially good. 4. The room was clean and the decor was modern and beautiful. The bathroom was a good size and the separate dressing area (with ample closet space) was nice. The technology kit, which included an ethernet cable, iPod charger, etc., was nice. 5. Bell staff was very good. 6. Location was good. It was an easy walk to Aria, where you can take a tram to the Monte Carlo and Bellagio hotels. The negatives: 1. Having to take two elevators to get to your room. From the lower lobby, you have to take an elevator to either the sky lobby on the 23rd floor or the 3rd floor and change elevators to get to the room floors (room cards are needed to access these floors). While the extra security is nice, it became tedious over time. 2. Housekeeping service was spotty. One day, the room hadn't been cleaned when we returned at 4 pm. On another day, the room appeared to be only partially cleaned, as there were used cups and trash still in the room. Turndown service did not occur on one night --- instead, they came at 10:30 pm to ask if we wanted turndown service. 3. Upon check-in, it would have been nice if they had confirmed our room/floor at the desk to ensure it was the room/floor that we preferred. She told us our floor number as she began to escort us to the elevator, but I preferred a higher floor, so we had to go back to the desk so she could check on availability. 4.

We stayed at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas (see separate review) on the way to our destination and at the Mandarin Oriental on our way home. We generally stay at Four Seasons hotels, but were very excited to try the Mandarin Oriental. We mostly liked the room, but overall were not crazy about the hotel and were definitely not impressed with the service. When we arrived at the hotel, there was one guy standing downstairs who seemed to have no idea what to do with our vehicle or our luggage. Another guy showed up after about 8 minutes to take care of the car. There was no 'welcome to the Mandarin Oriental' or anything of that nature. The ONLY way we knew to go to the 23rd floor was from reading it on here. The guy who checked us in tried very hard to act the part, but just wasn't polished. It felt like he was trying to hard. He was the most professional of anyone who helped us during our stay. The bellman who took our bags back to our car was pretty rough. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. We loved the big bathtub. The water pressure in the shower was inadequate and the toilet was just weird. We did not enjoy controlling the curtains and everything else in the room by remote control. I'm sure plenty of other people would love it though. When we first saw the room, we really loved it and thought it was the greatest hotel ever. However, the feeling just didn't last after dealing with the staff. It felt amateurish. Also, the hallways in the hotel are very dark and slightly smelly. The pool and fitness center were both nice.

It's like it dropped into the Strip from some civilized place where they know what good service is all about. I've stayed in hotels all over the world and have never received such consistently outstanding and sincere service. The staff is ultra-courteous without being patronizing - a rare skill indeed. They call you by your name, make eye contact and are amazingly service-oriented without being the least bit intrusive. It's a service formula that is usually only dreamed about. Ammenties are equally astonishing. Rooms are wonderfully appointed with extra large and spacious bathrooms with unique arrangements. It's difficult to accurately convey how creative and comforting these bathrooms can be. The beds are so comfortable, you may want to change your plans and stay in the room. Food is terrific, if not a little pricey; there is a great selection at the bar, and the view is one of the best on the strip. The spa was probably the highlight of my stay - the range of services available is unparalled, even at places I've stayed in Asia. And the staff at the spa are so pampering you start to believe that you are their favorite guest of all time. The only constructive criticism is that the place is a little dark and sterile, especially downstairs, and it's just a little sparse, and the building itself doesn't give as much of a comforting feeling as the staff does. Also the technology still has a few bugs in it; room phones frequently didn't work and it was difficult to take a bath in the luxurious bathtub because the plug didn't stay down. Elevators and rooms were challenging to open with the sesored room key, as you needed to swipe it in a particular way, and that was sometimes a hassle. Room service was efficient and timely to the minute.

I am not dazzled by a town that specifically caters to impulsive behaviors in things that should not be done on impulse- namely gambling, high-end shopping, and marriages. Many conferences over the years have placed me in Vegas within the confines of smoke-filled, crowded casino hotels. After my conference in July placed me at the Mandarin Oriental, I must confess that I now want to return to Vegas as often as possible. The Mandarin Oriental is unlike any other hotel on the strip in so many wonderful ways. From the moment you are greeted by the attentive doorman and step into the inviting elevator complete with soothing music and comfy bench, you know your stay is going to be relaxing and memorable. The spacious lobby is on the 23rd floor and features the check-in desk, a tea lounge, and a cocktail lounge. The Asian d\u00e9cor and breath-taking views were stunning. The check-in process was a breeze with the skillful staff easily deciphering the details of my reservation- half covered by the conference I was attending with additional days covered by myself with my sister joining me. You are given a key card which you need to activate the second set of elevators which take you to your room. This was actually a great security measure for keeping unwanted traffic out of the guest areas. There are plenty of elevators and I never had to wait to catch one. I stayed in a Mandarin Room (1833) overlooking Planet Hollywood and the strip. When you first enter your room, your senses are delighted as the window shades automatically begin to raise up and the lights gradually glow on. Soft music warms your ears as your eyes feast on the beauty of this magnificent room. Windows cover every outer wall and wrap around to your bathroom. The bathtub is huge and inviting- resembling a work of art perched inside the glass walls. A shade can be lowered for privacy while you are soaking. There is a canister of scented bath salts for your indulgence. There is also an overhead rainforest shower as well as two hand held sprayers. The vanity area has double sinks with lots of essentials. I appreciated the full size hair dryer with all of the attachments. My sister and I enjoyed room service for breakfast every day. The home-made berry yogurts, the sinfully delicious pastries and waffles, and the perfectly crispy bacon always arrived quickly and with a smile. The room service table has a heated compartment that ensures that your hot entrees arrive hot. Best of all, the coffee was always piping hot and plentiful. We enjoyed dinner one evening at MOzen restaurant. Their Indian cuisine is not to be missed. The wait staff is helpful and very knowledgeable about all menu items and specialty drinks. We never did get a chance to try the other restaurant, Twist. Of course, we had to check out the spa, and I am so glad that we did. The hammam was such a lavish delight and I highly recommend it. We explore all of the amenities of the spa and were thoroughly pampered and relaxed when we left. The staff at the spa are the best. The pool area is very nice and quiet. The staff makes certain that you have everything you need. The pool does close at sunset, so don\u2019t wait too late to go enjoy it. I tried to think of any negatives, and they are so few and minor. My room did not have many drawers for unpacking my clothes. I also would have like a full length mirror. The vanity mirror was about \u00be tall and I couldn\u2019t see how my shoes looked with my outfit. And coming from the east coast, I was ready for coffee very early in the morning. I would have appreciated a coffee pot in the room or in the main lobby for an easy caffeine fix prior to breakfast. Since the positives of this hotel are so numerous, it seems absurd to even mention these slight inconveniences. I suppose it comes down to what you are looking for when you go to Vegas. If you want to be right in the middle of the noise and action, then this is not the place for you. If you desire an oasis of tranquility to retreat to after a long day of visiting the sensory overloaded strip, then there is no better place. This is by far the most elaborate and visually stunning room that I have ever stayed in. The amount of attention put into every detail of this hotel accompanied by a very friendly and polished staff made it a unique retreat from the Vegas strip.

There are so many positive things to say about my stay so the review may be a bit long. First, the online reservation system is very easy and intuitive. I love the various Special Requests I can make when I make reservations. I choose Quiet Room, Away from Elevator, Non-Smoking Room and Early Check-In Requested (I check in around 1:30 PM, but more on that later). I can even give them my arrival flight # and they will arrange a Mercedes Benz Sedan to pick me up! But as many reviewers mentioned, this service is definitely based on availability. I receive a confirmation e-mail after I finish the reservation and a few days before my stay I receive another e-mail to welcome me to their hotel. It is very heart warming. On the day of visit, thanks to all the reviewers here, I find the entrance with no problem. It is indeed very subdued and I like its quietness/calm ambiance. I walk in, tell the attendant that I am here to check in, and he walks me (not just point to me) to the elevator where it will go straight to 23rd floor. To my surprise, there is a very comfortable bench inside every elevator! The lobby attendant greets me right away, and after confirming with my reservation I am being greeted by my last name during the check-in process. The process is quick and straightforward. She re-confirms my special requests with me and she asks me for my daily newspaper selection, then she explains the private and non-intrusive personal walk-in cabinet where they deliver newspapers, toiletries and so on. Because I use my debit card when booking the hotel, she explains the held fund to me clearly and I really appreciate her attentive service. Then she walks me to another elevator area where hotel guests use and she shows me how to use my room card to operate the elevator. My room is on the 12th floor facing Planet Hollywood. It is clean and quiet, the bed is soft and fluffy, the Technology Kit is definitely a plus, the soaking bath tub is so big, and it provides all the amenities I can think of (and they are inside a beautiful chest!) The touch screen which controls the blinds, lightings, TV and music are just fabulous. This is the only hotel that will give me a morning call by playing \"sunrise\" music on TV, opening the blinds automatically, and turning on all the lights (the settings can be adjusted of course.) I think I will let other reviewers' photos to speak for itself. A few more things that not many people mentioned: 1) The HDTV in the restroom is built inside the mirror (unlike other hotels which are \"sticking out\" and in SD); 2) The big HDTV in the room is equipped with a simulated surround sound system with a subwoofer; and 3) Having the TV home screen shows the deadbolt is locked and both inside plus outside temperatures are very convenient. After a relaxing short rest, I head to the tea lounge on the 23rd floor. I strongly recommend making reservation in advance as the tables are full during my visit. Once again, the staff greets me by my last name and then leads me to my reserved seat. She patiently explains everything on the menu clearly and promptly, then she gives me some time to decide. I order engligh tea set (need formal name) and it is such a wonderful experience. Great tea, tasty sweets and yummy sandwiches (plus jams!) and marvelous views. Service is still very attentive but not intrusive. She asks me from time to time if the tea is hot enough and do I want to try more sandwiches. I go back to my room shortly after finishing my afternoon tea, and to my pleasant surprise I notice a personal and handwritten thank you card from the hotel manager placing under the room TV. Talk about wonderful service! I head to the pool in the evening as it closes at 7 PM. Once I walk in the staff immediately greets me and setup an empty lounge chair for me with a towel and a bottle of water. After knowing my name, all staffs in the pool greet me with my last name during my stay. There are two big pools and several smaller spa pools with the timer. I spend a good two hour there swimming, relaxing and reading magazines. I also order a freshly made mango and strawberry smoothie to help me keep cool under the 110F weather in Las Vegas. Before I head to Twist for dinner (dinner experience will be under a separate review), I receive a message from the front desk notifying me to re-arrange a turndown service. I guess it is because I place the \"Privacy Please\" sign outside my room for an extended periods of time. However I really appreciate their message as this is the first hotel I stay that will even contact me about this. Almost all hotels I stay will just leave things as is until I call them to re-arrange the turndown service. This attention to detail service totally wins me over! I eat my breakfast at MOZen (once again, the experience will be under a separate review) and it is again a unforgettable experience. Speaking of service above and beyond, before I leave the restaurant the server even asks me if I want a freshly brewed coffee to go. By the way, how can I forget Amore Patisserie? It is a gorgeous patisserie on the strip and I stop by one afternoon for their fabulous galeto. Then I decide to try its cappucino smoothie and walnut cake. Once again, always smiling and helpful staff, attentive service and love to explain everything clearly to me. It is such a perfect place for me to enjoy some quiet time on a busy street. I stay there for an hour while writing postcards to my friends. The checkout process is also quick and easy. The attendent asks me if I have a good time. Well, not only do I have a wonderful time, I don't even want to leave and I can't wait to come back next time.

You are met on the ground floor and then taken to the Sky Lobby on the 23rd floor for efficient check in, we then went to our room, a Mandarin Executive which enjoys great views of the Strip. As it was our anniversary the hotel had kindly left a bottle of French Champagne in the room for us which was most appreciated. The room was beautifully appointed, lovely furnishings, subtle artwork, great bathroom and the air conditioning was working well given it was 42 Degrees Celsius! The room was very technologically advanced, curtains, lights, TV, air conditioning, privacy all driven by bedside control panel. Finally, the bed was incredibly comfortable, could have slept all day!! Before we arrived the concierge had arranged several restaurant bookings for us which were all terrific, they were so eager to help and nothing seemed too much trouble when we had extra requests or changes we needed to make. We spent several days by the pool. After seeing some of the \"mega pools\" at the bigger casino hotels we were very happy with the pool deck at the MO. Although it was modest in size there were always plenty of sunbeds available and it was never crowded. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and there was a constant stream of complimentary snacks such as ice cream, popsicles and frozen fresh fruit offered during the day. Food and Beverage was good quality, a little pricey and the portions were huge, but we were happy with the offering. Although this is not a casino hotel you really do have all the action just outside the front door so you can easily get to Aria, MGM Grand, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood etc etc. These are all a short walk or tram ride away and most of the other big hotels are not much further away. We really enjoyed being able to return to our sanctuary at the MO after a busy day or night emerged in the madness of Vegas. Probably the only small gripe was the lack of free wi-fi internet, these days I think that is almost the standard, MO charge $US 60- per 5 days.

I'll try to give you a little background on our trip and then layout the good, the bad and the ugly. My husband and I stayed at the MO in February 2010 for 8 nights along with my parents. I've been to LV a few times before with my work but this was the first time I was going for pleasure. As this would be the first time for both my husband and my parents I wanted everything to be perfect so did many months of research prior to our trip. I've stayed at the Palazzo on previous trips and thoroughly enjoyed it so made a reservation there as part of my first research. A few weeks later I also got a good rate for Encore so did a booking there too. While further surfing I found an incredible deal on city and show.com for the MO. The only issue was I had to pay up front and the MO was not yet open so I had no reviews to enable me to make that big decision. Having stayed a other MO's and by asking LV Forum experts I took the gamble and made the city and show reservation. I rang the hotel a few days later and they confirmed the booking for both my husband and I and my parents and asked us if we had any special requirements. I think with tax we paid about \u00a3139 a night - bargain in my eyes. So to the actual trip...... We landed at McCarran, grabbed our hire car and headed to the MO. Contrary to later reviews we found the entrance to CityCenter and the tunnel to the MO very easily although some taxi drivers during our trip did struggle. As we pulled up we were greeted by the top hatted bellboys who asked our last name and radio'ed our arrival up to the main reception. Our bags were quickly whisked away although we asked for our golf bags to be stored - \"no problem Mr XXX\" came the quick response. We were escorted upstairs in one of the three elevators that leads from the lower lobby and shown to the reception desk. We were very warmly greeted by our names and informed that my parents had arrived safely the previous day (they came a day earlier than us and left a day earlier) and were settled in. We were then given cold towels and jasmine tea presented beautifully with an orchard. A quick check in later (5 mins max) we were shown to our room. A quick tour of the amenities followed and we were left to unpack. A few moments later the light for our valet closet went on and we opened it to be greeted by an MO bag which upon inspection contained golf balls, a presentation box of spa oils and a wonderful hand written note from the lovely girl on reception who had checked us in. In the few minutes it had taken for us to be escorted to our room and shown around she had written a card saying what a pleasure it had been to meet us, check us in and that she hoped we enjoyed our golf and spa treatments - something we had discussed briefly during check in - wonderful service. Our room was beautiful and although not big by LV standards was perfectly adequate for our stay. I loved the valet closet which turned out to be handy as we had to use it to access our room on two occasions (more about that later). The bed was extremely comfortable although the sheets were still a little new - a few more wash cycles and they would be perfect. The bathroom was great with good lighting, perfect for applying my make up and the amenities provided were excellent especially the hair straighteners. The bath was great - perfect to lay back and soak in. The wardrobe section of the room was good too although it was a little tight for hanging space for our eight days. Now for our slight problem - in our first three days we got locked out of our room three times - the first time in the afternoon and we were let in by security within 5 mins and our keys reset but the second and third time it was close to midnight each time and a major inconvenience as we had to wait for security for 15 mins each time. They arrived with a machine to reset the lock but when that failed I showed security how to open the valet closet and reach through to open the door. Not wanting this to keep happening as there was obviously a fault with the card reader on the door, I called the Duty Manager who was extremely apologetic and offered us an upgrade to a Premier room. He even arranged for all our belongings to be transferred to the same place in the new room. The next morning we left early and returned later in the afternoon to collect the keys to our new room. It was fabulous! Whilst I appreciated the cosiness of the standard room I loved the bathroom and closet space of the Premier room. We ate a few times in MOzen, used the bar and had afternoon tea and all were fabulous. So apologies for the long review - here are the good, the bad and the ugly: THE GOOD The service is just fabulous, everytime we left or arrived we were greeted personally by everyone we passed. Attention to detail. The afternoon tea - just yummy and very sophisticated The reception being on the 23rd floor kept riff raff from gawping around the hotel The lack of casino meant for an oasis of calm and feeling of tranquility The spa - hot stone massage was brilliant Cucumber and cilantro margarita in the Mandarin Bar THE BAD Just the lock issue THE UGLY Nothing at all In summary I cannot recommend the MO highly enough if you want a peaceful, professional, service rich oasis of calm in Las Vegas.

Maybe it will catch on, but I wonder if they will survive until it does. This place was dead. And not just in a quiet, exclusive kind of way (which it is), but a *is anyone else staying here?* kind of way. First, the entrance is almost impossible to find and not very impressive. Then you have to kind of luck out on finding where to go. The lobby is actually near the top floor and the ground floor was devoid of anyone to direct you there. Getting to your room requires first going to the third floor then transfering to another set of elevators that work with your room key. Okay, it's nice not having the general public accessing your floor, but also a little inconvenient doing that both directions. The rooms are nice, but not anything you can't get at Bellagio. Like Aria you better not be shy about the bathroom since the toilet stalls have translucient doors and little privacy. The pool is nice, but WHAT IS THAT SMELL? Remember what the intersection in front of Caesars was like a number of years ago - there was that sewer odor in the afternoon? This was several times worse. They even had incense sticks burning; I guess in an attempt to mask it. It didn't work. Unless the wind is blowing - wow. The pool service is very attentive, the drinks expensive ($15-ish per). We went to MOZen Bistro while there, very good and nearly empty. The Mandarin Bar has a great view and was about half full the evening we went. When we got home I looked at the invoice they emailed me. It had charges for in room dining, mini-bar and a day of parking on it. We never ordered room service, opened the mini-bar or even had a car. I called and they were very good about removing it from the bill. Overall I would say it is a nice place, but I doubt we will be staying there again.

Although we live in Los Angeles, we only visit Las Vegas every few years. We enjoyed this hotel so much that we would consider going more often. This visit was inspired by a fantastic deal through our AmEx Platinum card. We had a tiny glitch on arrival (our luggage was delivered to the wrong room, and we already had little time to get dressed for a show that evening), but from that point on, everything was perfect. As a non-gaming hotel, the Mandarin Oriental is a respite from the chaos of the casinos, but the full excitement of Las Vegas is just outside your door. Because the Mandarin is a small hotel (around 325 rooms?), you don't feel like cattle, as in so many of the other hotels in Las Vegas. Service is personal and attentive, and while the hotel is completely central to all of the action in Las Vegas, it envelops you like a luxurious cocoon when you've had enough of the city. I think this hotel is the perfect base for exploring the Strip. Our room was thoughtfully designed, had a great view of the Strip, and the bed was divine (we had to force ourselves out of it each day!). All of the technology in the room worked perfectly. We enjoyed the daily New York Times delivery (including on weekends, which many luxury properties do not do) and our other housekeeping needs were attended to promptly. Turn-down service includes tall bottles of water on the bedside tables, and the valets also put chilled water bottles in your car. The bathroom was spacious and the bathtub and shower are both perfect for two. Our room was so relaxing and pleasant that we found it hard to leave. Our only minor problem with the room was that we found the safe, which is in a bureau drawer, a bit tight. Once our two laptops were in the safe, we couldn't fit jewelry boxes or other valuables. Breakfasts in MoZen were delicious with fantastic fresh fruits. My wife found the French toast a bit dense, but the omelettes were as light as air, and I could eat the apple-chicken sausages all day. Service was prompt without making us feel rushed. We had one late lunch at MoZen, too, which was also very nice with amazingly succulent shrimp in the pad thai. The concierge was helpful and efficient, securing us tickets for a top show in under ten minutes and offering great advice on restaurants. The gym is very well equipped with a large and nicely outfitted locker room. We didn't use the pool, but the area was attractive. I ventured into the spa for a Chinese foot bath with massage, which felt great on my feet after walking up and down the strip for two days. The treatment was very nice, although I found the high-backed chairs in the foot spa quite stiff and uncomfortable. Spa prices are very high here; for those interested in a splurge, the spa is extremely relaxing, staff are at once discrete and fawning, and the views are very nice from many of the treatment areas. For those who want to avoid the $30/night valet fee--and I really do think that's exorbitant for Las Vegas--parking in the neighboring Aria is free and is about a 3-5 minute walk--still easier than self-parking at the Venetian or Bellagio.

The bathroom amenities were of good quality; they even had collar stays (which was a good thing because I had forgotten mine.) I needed two shirts and a pair of pants pressed.

The Mandarin Oriental is a true 5 star city hotel with excellent service - you could be staying in any major city. The high level of service and detailed attention are yours whether you are there to gamble or not - and the hotel lobby is delightfully free of any slot machines or vestiges of a casino. The place is classy and luxurious, there is no line to speak to someone at reception, and the staff manage to show genuine friendliness - not just politeness.

From the MO (Mandarin Oriental) you can walk in <10 mins to the Bellagio and Paris, and in <5 mins to anywhere in CityCenter. The hotel has a complementary Mercedes to take you down the street if you are going a bit further, and without my asking they put me in it twice, after I asked for a Taxi - that is service and it really made a difference (thanks Dean!). Bathrooms are fantastic and large. As with most new hotels, the rooms are all very similar - both a positive and a negative, as you know what you're going to get, but you lose some of the variety and originality present in older hotels. The electronic systems are truly amazing, and worked well (and note that they provide cables to hook up just about anything including your ipod to the inroom stereo/tv) - although I worry that too much electronic interaction within the room is a set up for issues in years to come. The Spa is lovely, although pricey, but you get fantastic treatments in rooms with picture windows onto the strip. It's worth it if you have time.

They told me that it was just removed ) I asked for a rate reduction as I'd end in a premier room with booking a cheaper room. They agree and reduce the rate by USD 50. I did came back in February with a guarantee upgrade from executive to Dynasty as I had a nice chat with one of the manager there. I made 2 back to back bookings to enjoy 2 paid and 2 free nights. This was confirmed with one of the manager there. (we stayed 4 nights all together) 5 days prior arrival I received an e-mail from their reservation'manager indicating than 2 paid / 2 free nights is not possible and asked for an extra USD 795 (only one free night and 3 paid nights). After 10 e-mails back & forth explaining that I received the confirmation from a manager there (this manager was surprisingly not available) reservation'manager finally agree to keep what was already agreed as I was returning guest and they value my patronage etc etc. Make me wonder if they're honest there. By the way, some of her e-mails were very tricky for example she told me I'm pleased to agree with one paid and one free night, details of your reservation is below, it was written \"Executive suite\". I don't believe she was that stupid she was just tricky. Make me wonder if they're honest there. I was that close to cancel everything and my manager'contact who made the booking surprisingly came back (when the problem was solved) and e-mail me indicating that he made a mistake and he'll make sure that my stay will be grand bla bla (they're very good in blablabla) 2 nights prior arrival my manager'contact e-mailed me and advised he was able to block me a suite with a strip view but it won't be available before 6 or 8 pm. (they had some guarantee late check out until 4 & 6 pm and had to clean the rooms) I asked him if I can have the room earlier without the strip view and..... he didn't reply despite a second request. Believe he had none suites available before 6 pm with or without view. (anyway the strip view is a view of the polo'tower...) The dynasty suite is OK but doesn't worth the money, the PH at Bellagio is nicer and the Salone at Wynn is much nicer The Dynasty doesn't have jet bath. The suite is relatively small (the PH Bellagio is larger) They have a nice kitchen, in case you'd like to cook .... We were on the 20th floor, looking at the Polo tower. As someone already said, there is no view from the Mandarin Oriental. There is an expresso coffee machine but the coffee (nor tea'bags) are renewed Several problems during the stay : - As informed 2 days before the room was not available until 6 pm (no compensation given for the wait) - No amenities at all one morning - No amenities at all during turn down service - At 9 am we asked for the room to be cleaned, we come back at 1 pm and it was still not cleaned. - The next day, we can called at 9 am and asked if the room could be cleaned at about 10 / 11 am . At 9.30 two people came to clean the room, I was still in the shower.... - We had a complimentary fruits basket (& water) upon arrival which was removed the second day despite it was not empty at all - In January I a had the same fruit basket plus a bottle of champagne in a premier room, since they appreciate that they come back and come back in a suite they upgraded me... to water !! - Concierge booked me a restaurant but the restaurant didn't find the reservation. - I asked the concierge for an aisle seat at a show, I had no aisle seat despite the seats were available .... - I have read that the concierges at MO have a lot of connections... but they were not able to book me a window table at Boulud. - I use a towel as pillow at the hot tub'spa and one of the SPA'people almost cry one me : \"your're not supposed to put towels like that\".... oops I'm so sorry to have wet a little part of your towel ) After he start to dry it next to me... wonder what he was watching. - 20% tips on a massage and she was unhappy and clearly show it (no \"bye bye\" etc). The staff is usually speaking very nice, but there is no consistency in their service. We use a couple of time the valet'closet for ice, it was working well the first 2 times but the 3rd time we had no ice despite several trys They do have a free house car (Mercedes S, hybrid) but they don't market it and it seems that it's up the bellman to decide who you can use it (we were waiting for a cab for several minutes and someone arrived after us and the bellman encourage him to use the house car). The next day, we use the house car to see a show, the driver was from another time & world, when we arrive at the Wynn he begin to shout, in a very formal way to the Wynn'bellman : \"Mrs & Mr Z... are going to see Le Reve\" who cares ! It was almost funny We also visited one of their Presidential Suite, the Taipan, it was nice but really don't worth the money (about 7k).

A 5 dollar tip at the pool may be the smartest money you'll spend at this property as those same cashews run 12 dollars in your room! The pools and jacuzzis are beautifully designed trapezoidal shapes that are all heated to different temperatures.The way the buildings are configured, there is a venturi effect causing wind to funnel through the pool area. Stuff blows around a great deal -- the upside is that this may keep the guest cool during the summer months. Overall, this is the nicest pool area in Las Vegas and is in keeping with the vibe of the Mandarin. The spa is beautiful but pricey. A pedicure is 135$ I wanted to take a 15 minute steam at the spa but they wanted 100$. I passed and soaked in the room tub. They should cut that spa price in half. The room. If you like wood and asian influence, you'll dig the inerior look and feel. We booked this after staying at other vegas properties: Encore, Wynn, Belagio, Skylofts. It is nice not to have to walk through a smoke filled casino--even if your a big player, it is great to have an oasis of calm to stay in. The yoga room in this property is very cool. And it is worth staying at this poperty for the incredible service. They escort you to your room and cater to your every need. We were originally assigned room 1607 with a strip side view (of harley davidson and dingy polo towers) but Jing Li easily moved us to the back of the property overlooking the pool area (room 1732). It was very quiet on that side--if noise is an issue for you, i would get an even numbered room. The location of the Mandarin is a bit odd overlooking a really crumby section of the strip. You are very close to the self-parking lot, but it is a maze of paths and levels to get there. But hey, most will just valet their car anyway and pay the 30$. The self dimming lights and magical controls of the room are fun but take getting used to. Everything can be controlled with the TV remote and the TV screen menu. Turn down service is very nice. The room is very well designed and has some unique features that you should discover on your own. If money is not an issue, this is a great place to stay. If you are looking for a deal, the Encore has a nice suite for half the price. Would I rather stay here? Of course. We had dinner at MOzen and the Indian dishes are excellent and a good value. I was surprised by the beverage prices: 28 for a glass of champagne, 9 for a club soda and 9 for a cup of herbal tea. But the property itself is heaven. Very zen. All on a human scale. The city center: It's a mixed bag. Since Prada and most of the stores are opening in the fall of 2010, it is not fair to comment. Maestros restaurant is seriously an amazing design out of wood. It does not work like a real city because there is no ground level. Everything is on different levels and there is no logic to it.

There are some fabulous hotels along The Strip. A desire for something new and different prompted a change in favor of the new Mandarin Oriental at City Center. In a word, this hotel is FABULOUS! Rooms: While not the largest or most ornate rooms in Las Vegas, they do marry luxury and practicality in a previously unattained manner. From the butler locker to the Control 4 entertainment/comfort system the room designer maximized space and convenience. The modern room included a fully functional, nicely sized desk, a typically \"over-the-top Vegas\" bathroom, a lounge chair, and a pillow top mattress. The light switches were easy to locate and easier to use. The room was comfortable, luxurious, and practical. Physical Facility: The hotel is part of the massive City Center development between The Bellagio and The Monte Carlo. There is a casino about 1/4 mile away (In Aria). One does not have to walk through a casino and smell cigarette smoke to enter the hotel or the guest rooms. The hotel common areas are beautifully done. The spa is overwhelming in both scope and quality. The guest rooms are protected by an elevator security system which requires an active key in order to stop an elevator on a floor with rooms. This is becoming more common, but not yet standard in Las Vegas. The developers spent alot of money on this hotel and it shows. Bar/Restaurant: The bar is gorgeous and always had a buzz of activity. The bartenders made it tough to leave for other commitments. The drinks were of good quality and the winelist very well put together. While lacking depth (as is typical in a new establishment) it covered nearly all regions and varietals with at least one option. The glass list was also broad enough to cover most of the world's primary wine regions. The resaurant is beautiful and the food was fabulous. It was full on the Wednesday evening we visited. We enjoyed the tasting menu of six courses and a bottle each of white and red burgundy. It is on the level of the other \"best in the world\" French restaurants that have almost taken over the top-level dining scene in Las Vegas. Service: If the Mandarin is to succeed in the hyper-competitive Las Vegas hotel industry it will be because of the unprecedented level of service at this hotel. I travel frequently and generally stay in full service \"luxury\" hotels. The level of service I observed at this hotel is unmatched by competitors in the United States, including other Mandarin operated hotels. One needs to travel to a top property in Europe, India or Asia to experience the level of top-quality service I observed at this hotel. The friendly, professional, well trained staff is there at every turn. While the service was ready and willing, it did not \"hover\" and was not smothering. The men and women in management and on the staff at this hotel are to be commended for jobs well done. The only downside to this fantastic experience is the cost. It is significantly more expensive than its primary competitors. While \"value\" is always subjective, and I feel that the hotel was a good value for all it gives, other travelers may feel that they are being over-charged. The restaurant and bar are at the TOP level of pricing for Las Vegas. The spa treatment I enjoyed was likewise more expensive than any similar treatment I have received in Las Vegas. Having said that, all of these experiences exceeded the quality of other like-experiences, so, as I said, value will always be a subjective determination. Bottom line: Las Vegas now has a quiet, professional luxury hotel of un-equaled service for those who enjoy the fine touches and distinctions that make a hotel great vs. nearly great or very good. If that fine line matters to you then you have found a new home in Las Vegas. If these intricacies are of little value or you use the hotel primarily for sleep and little else then you will want to save your money and will do better at other high end properties.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Best!\u201d", "Author": "easton1", "ReviewID": "UR57941821", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in March 2010.

Even your alarm clock can be set to open the curtains when it is time to get up. The bathroom is simply huge and is definitely a feature which makes the stay even better.

This is my first time staying at a Mandarin Oriental property and now I am a doting fan! For those visiting Las Vegas interested in spending $300 and up for a room, I would implore you to give the Mandarin Oriental a shot. It will be well worth it\u2014the impeccable service should win you over. Considering the hotel has less than 400 rooms/suites (392 to be exact), the hotel can cater more to your needs than that of a mammoth casino hotel. The starting room category size is roughly 500 square feet but I would highly recommend guests to book the Mandarin Premier Room (about 650 square feet). Useful information about the hotel: I was happy that the hotel allowed us to check-in early and check-out a little past official check-out time; but notwithstanding that, check-in is 3\u2019oclock and check-out is noon. The hotel is centrally located between the Monte Carlo another City Center hotel/casino. The hotel has a Mercedes S-Class Hybrid available on a first-come, first-serve basis to shuttle guests in style (limited-radius) to area hotels/casinos. Valet parking is $30 per night and a twin-sized rollaway is $150 (I am not sure if it\u2019s per stay or per day, although I would assume the latter to be safe). When ordering room service the following taxes/service charges will apply: $5 delivery fee, 18% gratuity and local taxes\u2026 2 orders of rice congee and smoked salmon/bagel was ~$58. On that note, taste wise, I found the food to be average\u2014I was not wowed and it proved to just be a convenient option when you don\u2019t have time to visit other dining establishments in Las Vegas. To access the guest quarters, you will need to go through two sets of elevators (for security purposes) and need your room key to access guest floors. The pool is scheduled in open in March 2010 and there is a fully-equipped gym open during regular business hours. There is an on-site spa/salon and from what I hear, MO properties are renowned for their spas so I imagine being a new property the spa is on par with that of its sister properties around the world-- I did not try the spa so I can't comment). The hotel\u2019s website offers detailed information about the room /suite categories so I won\u2019t bore you with the details. I will share what I found interesting about the Mandarin Premier Room that I booked. There is a valet closet in the hotel\u2014basically a small closet to discretely hide shoes that you want shined (complimentary), find your morning newspaper, clothes returned that you had cleaned/pressed, and anything else you require from the hotel so it\u2019s not hanging outside your door (convenient if you need something from housekeeping but do not want to immediately answer the door). The bathroom was the best feature of the room. Our bathroom was expansive and it seemed unnecessarily big. I liked how the toilet was separated from the shower/tub (separate) so that one person could use the toilet and the other could still shower without intruding on each other\u2019s space. This feature is accomplished through the use of a series of locking doors. The closet was big too, enough to hold several days worth of clothes for two people. Bathroom amenities were Aromatherapy Associates and was designed with consultation with the hotel. There was a jewelry box that contained the useful toiletries. The selection of TV channels is varied and plentiful. Never have I came across a hotel with so many channels (channels in French, Russian, Chinese\u2026and plenty of high-quality cable channels from US broadcasting stations). On a last note, everything is automated in the hotel (including the expensive mini-bar). There is a PDA that can control the entire function of the room/suite including lights, curtains, and A/C. Traditional guests can rest assured that there are still \u201cmanual\u201d controls to operate those functions as well. To sum up the level of personalized service in one word: WOW. Being a first-time guest of the hotel and the brand in general, I was completely wowed by the superlative level of service provide to me and my travelling companions. I wanted to express kudos to both the Front Desk and Concierges at the hotel. They did a wonderful job anticipating our needs and exceeded our wildest expectations about seeing me through a vulnerable time. The ever-resourceful Concierge team did a great job pulling through last-minute requests for dining arrangements. FYI: some of the Concierges are members of Les Clef d\u2019Or\u2014which basically means that they are the best of the best in the industry and are at your full disposal when staying at the hotel. They were very personable and had excellent dining recommendations. If I had to be nit-picky, I would say there were several service deficiencies that I encountered. Housekeeping did not turn down my room even though I had asked for turndown to be performed during a set time period. Additionally, during peak times, calls were intermittently given the busy signal (i.e. to housekeeping) and were either routinely transferred to other departments or not answered (i.e. a call to Front Desk \u2013 not answered or a call to the Concierge, rolled to the Front Desk or Hotel Operator). There were glitches with the television intermittently freezing up and the A/C automatically resetting to a default temperature. Other than that, which I am sure the hotel will improve upon after settling into the locale that is Las Vegas, I would whole-heartedly recommend the hotel to everyone and anyone looking for a hotel to cater to their needs while enjoying all that Las Vegas has to offer.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, CA", "Title": "\u201cA truly unique Las Vegas experience\u201d", "Author": "brian714", "ReviewID": "UR57125321", "Content": "One of a kind in Vegas.

Next we were shown to our room by the lead agent who was charming and professional. These employees are accessible genuine and friendly. There is nothing stuffy about them or the hotel for that matter. The room itself was a beautifully designed space of about 500 sq ft. Plenty of dark wood, marble and etched glass. Wonderful touches such as fresh flowers and a valet kit in the bathroom and an assortment of elegant stemware in the bar. The floor to ceiling windows offer views of the fake Eiffel Tower and the beautiful City Center. The beds are exceptional--you sink slowly into them when you lay down. There is calming accent lighting in the room and bathroom. There are bath salts provided for the deep soaking tub. Twice daily housekeeping was thorough and thoughtful. I brought travel size mouthwash which housekeeping noticed and kept replenishing the supply for me. Did I mention it was quiet? It was as serene as a temple in that room. Definitely an oasis in the middle of Las Vegas After exploring the City Center across the pedestrian bridge (which is another beautifully desinged space with shopping and dining) we had dinner at Twist on the 23rd floor. The hostess recognized us by sight. The check in agents knew our dinner plans and had briefed the restaurant staff on who we were, what we looked like and why we were there (birthday celebration--earlier she had a delicious chocolate cake sent to the room). We sat by the window which afforded a great city view. The care that goes into the food and service at Twist is fantastic. Again-it is not in the least bit stuffy or formal (although it is dressy). We were thoughtfully cared for without any hovering. Upon exiting Twist the same agent came over to us and inquired about our meal and then corralled us over to the M Bar for a final drink. Even though the place was crowded there was a couch and 2 chairs immediately available or us. The berry bellinis are excellent. The pricing here ($20/drink) keeps this from being a rowdy party place. Most people (including us) stayed or one round only. The view and design at M Bar are very special. I ordered breakfast to be delivered between 8:45 and 9. The doorbell rang at 8:45 precisely. How often does THAT happen in Las Vegas or anywhere? The coffee was piping hot and the juice was perfectly chilled. The pastries and fruit (with huge ripe blackberries) came with an assortment of butters and Viennese fruit preserves. They wheeled it all in on a table with an vase of flowers on it. Check out was equally as thoughtful as check in. No waiting--lots of personal attention.
