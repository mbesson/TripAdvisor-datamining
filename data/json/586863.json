We took the airport bus (about 5.10 euro) from the airport to Placa Catalunya and then caught the subway to the hotel. We walked up by the giant library in the Lesseps square to our hotel. There is also a supermarket across the way! The hotel is nice. You can hear people from upstairs rooms but we slept great. We got a triple occ. and the 2 beds were full beds and one twin. All were comfortable. Some street noise from the cars passing below but its a really quiet residential neighborhood. Our bathroom was clean and we had hot water all of the time! Not too shabby with 3 girls! Room was a decent size and we had a safe and hair dryer but only 3 clothes hangers. There is also an ironing board but no iron. Lots of outlets. The wi-fi isn't free but it reaches to the second floor. No mini fridge but we turned our window into one. (Hey we went in Jan/Feb it was super cold outside so we kept our water and snacks out there. lol) Reception was nice and helpful. They spoke English! :) You'll see most people in BCN don't! So brush up on some phrases in Spanish! There is breakfast for extra $$ but we never tried it. There is a soda machine and water machine too. (I'd recommend going to the super market and having water on hand no matter what time of year you go) The hotel is next to Park Guell so you can leave that for your last day if you want to relax and walk around the neighborhood. There is also a bakery by the library and a shop with lots of tourist stuff for cheap further down. For 3 girls in Jan/Feb we loved the place and we'd def stay again!

I am not sure why there are so many good reviews. If the beds were comfortable we may have given it a better review but they are like boxsprings with a blanket thrown on them. At least 1 English station (even CNN) would make this nicer for Americans. The room was clean except for the filthy shower. Even worse, no AC after October so we had to go to a local store 2 mins away and pay 25 euros for a fan. Sorry, we can't recommend this no-frills hotel. They rate it 3 stars but we barely give it 2. PROS- Great front desk staff - Very helpful. In room safe. Morning breakfast bar was good, cheap and convenient. Only 2 blocks to Lesseps subway station. Neighborhood appeared safe. Good restaurants within 10 min walk. CONS- 1. Noisy area - construction across street, busy traffic on front and side streets, could hear walking in above room till 3AM every night, could hear water running down pipes from above rooms. 2. No english TV stations. 3. Very hard beds. Double bed was just two singles pushed together. 4. No air conditioning. Clerk explained that AC is turned off in entire hotel in October so only heat. Temps were in 70s so had to keep window open and listen to constant traffic including mopeds and buses. Thermostat in room does nothing as heat controlled by computer at front desk. 5.

Service from all the 3 reception managers was outstanding, clean and modern rooms, ample bathrooms and the neighborhood is nice with casual and simple cafes, bars and restaurants. It is not located in the center of everything, but who cares as long you have a metro station which can take you anywhere, especially if it is only 4 metro stops from Ramblas (15 minute ride). Actually, it would be safer to stay away from Ramblas which can be dangerous at night after 11pm. Also dont expect great exterior visuals from your room windows. This is the only setback.

The gave us room 103, wich was appearently OK until we discovered that night the pillows smelled to human sweat; and worst of all, the drainage piping croses thru that room, so we heard a loud water (and whatever came with it) roaring noise in the room every time a toiled was flushed upstairs. It was really disgusting - the noise was so clear and loud that seemed like the waste waters were spilled in our floor. Every night we had to leave the TV on trying to block the sewage noise and get some sleep. The 4th night was the worst. The water noise stayed for hours - we suspected a toilet was leaking and had the hotel people check our room at 3:00 AM. They said it was \"the air conditioning\". We had to catch an early flight but we did not get much sleep because of the noise.

We weren't able to find any other comparable hotels in a decent location at that price. Rooms are clean and very nicely furnished, big by European standards, very modern with hard wood floors, flat screen TV (with only 1-2 english channels), a couch, and speakers which you could plug your IPOD into. The decor and rooms are definitely a nice surprise. Bathrooms, however, are moderately clean. There are fingerprints, hairs, dust. There is a small jacuzzi bathtub/shower, hairdryer and some freebies (shampoo, soap, comb... although I wouldn't use the jacuzzi and the products didn't smell very good). There is a general odd smell in the bathroom and rooms... seems like it might be the cleaning products they use, although this can easily be fixed by opening the window to air out the room a bit. You have to pay a 20 Euro deposit for the remote control, and access to the safe is 4 Euros per day. Parking is 20 Euros a day. The hotel is not in a very noisy neighborhood but the walls of the hotel are very thin. Location is good, especially if you want to be able to easily access the city center without having to worry about being in a sketchy neighborhood. It is only a few minutes walk to the metro (Lesseps) on the Green Line, which is around a 10 minute ride to Placa Catalunya. When the metro stops running (around midnight), it is very convenient to get back using the N4 bus which leaves from Placa Catalunya and drops you off almost in fron tof the hotel. I would recommend getting a T-10 travelcard during your stay. The neighborhood has a few grocery stores nearby which was very convenient, some bakeries, very little cafes and restos, and an internet cafe about 5 minutes away. Parc Guell, which is beautiful and one of Barcelona's main attractions, was only about a 10-15 minute walk away which was a definite bonus. The staff is not accomodating and generally unprofessional. They were not able to get us an extra cup, pillow and towel when we arrived at night, though we had booked a triple room and the room was only furnished for 2. Getting some ice from the bar was also an issue. Breakfast is now 10 Euros and definitely not worth it... the fruit is not even fresh but out of a can. Go to a bakery or cafe instead. We ran into problems with the staff when we had one of our friends stop by the hotel and they basically would not allow any visitors. Overall, I would not rate this a 3-star hotel. It's more like a really nice hostal since there are no guest services that hotels normally offer. The staff (both cleaning and front desk) are amateurish and seem unwilling to go the extra length to accomodate you. Other 3 star hotels in Barcelona seem a lot nicer and are definitely more accomodating. But they are also a lot more expensive. Definitely excellent value for your money.
