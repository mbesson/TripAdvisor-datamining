The reception area is large and the welcome was great, very friendly and efficient. We booked a king room, there was no view but it overlooked the side of the hotel and was quiet, apart from a bit of noise on the Saturday, but that didn't bother us. The bed was big and comfy. If I have one niggle about the room it is that the bathroom is very small, but it was clean and serviceable. There is a charge for wiFi but we found this almost everywhere in Australia. I paid $5 to use the computer in the reception for 30 mins...but had 24 hours to use it and as I was only doing a couple of quick checks it was fine for me. We had breakfast included in our rate and it was Ok, a typical Holiday Inn breakfast with cooked to order eggs. Taxis were readily available outside the hotel. We actually walked to Darling Harbour, it took us about 40 minutes but it was lovely, then we got the ferry back to Circular Quay. We didn't do the Harbour Cruise but took the ferry to Manly beach and had some great views from that. I wouldn't really recommend the open top bus tour..there is a lot of traffic in Sydney and the buses are old and smell of petrol fumes...better to walk or take ferries and taxis.

After having read many reviews of various hotels in Sydney, we eventually opted for the Holiday Inn Old Sydney. We weren't disappointed. This hotel deserves 10/10 for location. The Harbour Bridge was literally a 5 minute walk away and the Opera House only 10 minutes walk. Circular Quay was two streets away and the Sunday market is right on your doorstep. Our room was clean and modern with a choice of soft and firm pillows and one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in. The bathroom, however, was small. The fittings were modern and it was well equipped but if you like a bit of space this could be a problem. Sydney is noisy, bustling and busy with more bars, pubs, and restaurants than you can shake a stick at. However, if you like to eat late be aware that a lot of the restaurants seem to close by 10 so this may not suit some. Getting out and about in Sydney is very easy with ferries departing from Circular Quay to various destinations. Poopular with tourists is a round-the-harbour cruise which gives you the chance to see the multi-million dollar homes and pretty little inlets. Ratonga Zoo is another popular day out or take the ferry down to Manly Beach, a crescent of pale, clean sand patrolled by lifeguards. Manly is great for trying to learn to surf or for just sitting and watching how the experts do it. Bondi Beach is a bus or taxi ride away but some of the locals we spoke to said Manly was nicer and less crowded. A real 'must-do' is to take a trip to the Blue Mountains an area of outstanding natural beauty. On your way there call in at Faversham Wildlife Park and take the opportunity to get up close and personal with a Koala or one of the Wallabys. When you reach the Blue Mountains Heritage Site take the Skywalk Cablecar ($9) across the valley to Scenic World then take the almost vertical railway car down the the bottom of the valley. You have to hang on tight for this section of your journey. It's a bit of a knee trembler but great fun. When at the bottom of the valley wander along the rainforest walkways then ride back up on the smaller Cableway Cablecar ($21). This is a great day out and gives you the perfect opportunity to get out of the city for a while. Most trips include the costs of cablecars, railway, and wildlife park admission in the general cost. Sydney is easy to get around by any means of transport but the easier options (if you are going further afield) are ferry or rail. Buses and taxis are plentiful but the heavy traffic in and around Sydney (especially at peak times) is a nightmare. Most modes of transport can be picked up around Circular Quay. Prices generally are high and most organised excursions are expensive. The Harbour Bridge climb is extremely popular but again the cost of this may put some people off. Sydney is one of those cities that you must visit at least once in your lifetime. With its iconic Bridge and Opera House set in a stunning harbour it is still classed by many as the ultimate desination.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cneeds an update\u201d", "Author": "Silas K", "ReviewID": "UR127521101", "Content": "This is a hotel without a soul.

There are quite a few details that I think they need to upgrade as they are starting to look rather tired. The bathroom needs a refurbishment as the tiles are all black and almost had a grubby appearance. The vanity was old and tired.

There are two areas that I would be less positive about. The decor and furniture in the hotel is quite drab in the main communal areas and non-coordinated and quite cheap looking in the bedrooms. We took breakfast in the hotel only once due to the state of the furniture and overall depressing feeling of the dining area and the bedrooms looked like a major overhaul was well overdue. I realise that the hotel has various heritage / conservation restrictions it needs to adhere to but that's no excuse for not keeping to basic Holiday Inn room quality standards. My second gripe would be to do with Internet access and cost. $25/ day for a very slow and weak Internet access is firstly robbery and secondly an insult bearing in mind how technologically advanced Sydney is and what is available outside of the hotel's walls. However having mentioned the good and not so good my bottom line is that it's a highly recommendable hotel made by its staff and location and if ever back in Sydney I'd seriously consider staying there again.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, nice hotel.\u201d", "Author": "ozmuzziemoo", "ReviewID": "UR125359150", "Content": "This hotel is excellently located located at the Rocks, Circular Quay, Sydney.

First a couple of gripes....like others I am always disappointed when a large hotel chain doesn't offer free internet nowadays (I mean how much would it cost to put wireless routers in, seriously) but what annoyed me more (Tripadvisor censored my true feelings) was the hefty 1.5% surcharge I was charged to pay my bill by credit card. This is not mentioned on the official website (or is well hidden) and unless you have an Australian bank account and/or carry hefty amounts of cash, how else are you going to pay. And to blame the banks for this is very poor customer service in my opinion! Otherwise this is a decent hotel. Rooms are arranged around a central atrium and appearance is frankly prison-like due to the colour scheme (yellow) but our rooms were fine. Luckily we were allocated a front-facing room on 7th floor with great views of opera house and harbour bridge. Don't worry about room location too much though because you get a great view of both from the rooftop terrace (unless there is a big cruise ship in Circular Quay which can obscure view of opera house). Our bed was very comfortable and noise wasn't a problem although front facing rooms on lower floors might get some road noise. Room was clean and regularly serviced during our stay. Air-conditioning was fine. Breakfast was buffet style with a wide choice and plenty of food available and they had a chef cooking eggs fresh in whatever style took your fancy. They don't serve lunch or dinner but there are plenty of restaurants within couple of mins walk (although be warned that many/most will stop serving early around 9 pm ish!). Hotel has a small bar serving bottled beers, spirits and wines but this also closes quite early (due to potential noise from atrium apparently). Shuttle service is offered at $14 AUD per person so if you are single traveller this is economic option of getting from/to airport.

Its a great spot within walking distance to Circular Quay (ferries to the zoo, other parts of the city, train station, and more), the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Another great thing about this hotel: the rooftop pool has views of the Bridge and the Opera House! Just amazing - you can go for a swim and marvel at Sydney's beautiful harbour!

As we were there for 7 nights, the King room was definitely an improvement, but nowhere near as good as those in previous hotels of the same rating that we have stayed in.

The Good: Incredible location in the historical \"Rocks\" area of Sydney - just a few minutes walk to Circular Quay, the ferries, the train and the Opera House and right next to the Harbour Bridge and the Rocks markets (held on Sat and Sun each weekend). We really enjoyed the markets - many lovely craft items that would make great souvenirs for anyone visiting Sydney. We also walked straight up George Street into the heart of the city - probably about a 15 to 20 minute walk. There are many restaurants around the Holiday Inn. Many of them were quite expensive - but we found a really fun German restaurant/tavern in the street running behind the hotel. There is also a Subway and other takeaway shops behing the hotel - great for a quick and inexpensive lunch. The rooftop pool has the most incredible view of the harbour, the bridge and the opera house.

The lobby area was inviting and atrium style, with the walkways to the rooms looking down over the lobby. There was a nice little bar area in the lobby. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The not-so-good: They charge $35 per day for parking. They call it valet, but it isn't true valet as there really isn't any place to pull up in front of the hotel and hand your car over. Instead my husband had to get back in the car after a 4 hour drive and go back into heavy traffic to go around the block and park it in an alley right next to the parking entrance before any one would take it off him - so, basically he did all the hassle, but they called it valet and charged us $35 per day. Either they need to figure out a way to make it true valet or call it self-parking and lower the price. While we really enjoyed this hotel (mostly because of the location), I can't honestly say that it was good value as, even with the mystery deal, it was over $200 a night. I find it difficult to consider any hotel at that price good value - but, unfortunately, that was as good as we could find anywhere near the Sydney CBD.

As a member of the Platinum Ambassador program of the InterContinental Hotels ( or equivalent to the Priority Club Platinum status), I fel something should have been done as I do not receive any amenities in my room nor do I feel special other than the 2pm late check out offer that was offered. General knowledge has often been overlooked and directions were not being able to be visualized by staffs when directing over the phone. I have to run for an appointment and I have passed on a message requesting a staff to assist me with directions but to no avail after checking out, the puzzle has not been resolved. Thankfully the Information Centre at the station helped me a lot than a hotel concierge.

Circular Quay for the ferries, buses and trains is less than 5 minutes walk away. Our room was adequately sized plus they have been recently refurbished. While we were there, you could see other rooms being re-carpeted and worked on, so things are improving at this hotel. The open central atrium did not create a problem for us with hearing doors close or noisy kids. The buffet breakfast was very good, the in room TV's were huge, storage was good, and the views from the roof of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge are spectacular. Now for the faults. The swimming pool is small and only suitable for 'a dip' and not lengths. The bathroom was compact and the quality of tiling in our room was dubious. The aircon was ridiculously noisy and fortunately Sydney was cool enough in August that we could leave it off. However, the biggest problem we had was external noise, hence you need your earplus.

The hotel itself is clean and tidy, the room that we had was on the 3rd floor so the view was looking between 2 buildings towards the water, smallish in size but serviceable for what we required. The furnishings in the room are modern, the bathrooms are showing a little wear and tear now but still very nice - all white, the baths could be replaced as they have lost all their shiny enamel from them. The room contained a fridge, electric kettle, 2 coffee mugs, 2 teaspoons, 2 wine glasses, 2 drinking glasses, various tea and coffee condiments but only 1 packet of biscuits containing 2 cookies) Come on Holiday Inn, if the room caters for 2 guests provide 2 packets of biscuits - a little stingy I thought. The walls are thin in the rooms as we could hear the people in the next room talking and laughing. Also I would like to point out to management was we received a knock at the door in the afternoon from one of your staff wishing us a welcome to the hotel and a Happy Birthday greeting. Wrong room, wrong person, she had been instructed that a Mr Hogwart was staying in our room (was someone from Harry Potter visiting). Your staff member did apologise and was very embarrassed by it all, and needed to check with services to find the true Mr Hogwart. He was not traveling with us I can tell you that. The main foyer (atrium) is very light with plenty of lounges in pocket areas around to sit on and a lovely fireplace area that was very popular to sit by. Please remove the fake library books from the foyer area they look very tacky. All of the rooms open from this main atrium so it looks like verandahs on the inside looking down. When my daughter made the initial booking through the hotel she did advise reservations that she was traveling with a 2 week old infant but unfortunately we were given a corner room that required getting up and down 6-8 stairs; very impracticable when you have a pram which is kind of necessary with a 2 week old infant. Checking in to this hotel if you arrive by car is difficult as they only have 2 x 15min parking bays at the front. And if these 2 spots are taken good luck with checking in. Parking was another issue we were advised to arrive early to secure parking space at the hotel and were advised at the time of booking that as long as we arrived by 2pm we should be able to secure a spot. We arrived early at 1pm and parking was all booked out. We were given a map of the closest Wilson parking station which was around a 200m walk from the hotel at a reduced overnight rate of $25. Inconvenient when you are traveling with an infant and so you could not come and go to your vehicle with ease. All staff at Reception were friendly and courteous. I did not eat breakfast here so cannot comment on that experience, nor did I visit the pool area.

The room was pretty old and shabby, the carpets worn and the bathroom in dire need of replacement, but it was clean and the beds two double beds were comfortable with a great selection of pillows to choose from. Having lived in Sydney for the last few years I'd walked past this hotel many a time, but never stepped inside. It's pretty impressive upon entering, with an atrium that reaches right up to the top of the hotel, and all the rooms surrounding this central space - it looks good, but didn't prove practical as we could hear people chatting in the bar and the doors of other peoples rooms slamming shut well into the earlier hours as it reverberated around the huge space. We were also diwssapointed to find the restaurant, which we'd found menu's etc for on the internet prior to booking, was only open for breakfast - we'd made arrangements to meet up with friends to say goodbye and while the bar menu ended up sufficing this was a bit of a dissapointment. I'd imagine most people chosing to stay here would be visiting as tourists - my advice... there are much better hotels in the viscinity to enable you to get the most out of your holiday with a decent nights sleep and comfortable surroundings.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGREAT LOCATION, AVERAGE HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "kiwiKento", "ReviewID": "UR116685053", "Content": "We used this hotel as a base to explore Sydney for the weekend. The great thing about this hotel is that it is just a stones throw from the Sydney Harbour Bridge and therefore many of Sydney's other key attractions. The Holiday Inn Old Sydney is located in an area also known as \"The Rocks\" and is a very short stroll to Circular Quay where you can enjoy the many restaurants or as I would suggest - catch a ferry to any of the stops throughout Sydney Harbour. (Darling Harbour is a great spot to get off and have a walk around.) The Holiday Inn for its great location, is a very underwhelming hotel and at best could only be considered average. I am usually pretty generous in my reviews, however it is quite difficult to be generous when reviewing the hotel layout or rooms. The floors are split and therefore half of the rooms on every floor are half a level lower and make you feel like you are walking down towards a dungeon. These half level hallways are dark and dingy and not at all welcoming. The rooms themselves are very small and quite expensive - you are definitely paying for the location at this place!! In terms of the amenities: there is a very cool pool and jacuzzi up on the roof with great views of the Sydney Inner City, however is only any good in the summer as in the winter (when we were there) it is ridiculously cold and unusable. The bar downstairs is small and we found ourselves waiting a long time to be served. We also witnessed the bar staff on numerous occasions fail to make the cocktails correctly as per their own menu. We had a look at the breakfast on offer and it looked in no way appealing so decided to find a nearby cafe on Circular Quay. I would not recommend this hotel if you are after a decent room, there are a number of other hotels nearby that offer far better rooms. I would however recommend it if the room does not matter at all and you require a good location to explore Sydney's famous landmarks.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cA bit too expensive.... for the old and tired.....\u201d", "Author": "redsienna", "ReviewID": "UR116562869", "Content": "A great location but a tad tired with patronizing reception staff.

We tried watching a movie, and about 20 minutes into it, it kept cutting out, which meant we had to restart the program again (we were ultimately only charged once), but could not fast forward.

The rooms also had tea/coffee making facilities, tv, safe, toiletries in the bathroom etc We used the Internet at the hotel which you buy vouchers for from reception and had no problem with it. The actually interior of the hotel initially looks like a prison with big yellow bricks and this would be our only very small negative but apart from that we couldn't fault it and would definitely return and recommend this hotel. The staff were very helpful, we had a problem one day with a tour that didn't turn up and the member of staff tried to ring them for us and then searched the internet and provided us with train times / routes etc so we could go ourselves and not have our day ruined. TIPS 1. Definitely do the Bridge climb even when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pouring with rain. Yes it's expensive but it's also an incredible experience. Book online before you go and the photos are far cheaper. 2. Eating out is expensive but if you walk up from the hotel rather than into the marina area there are some cheaper pubs and many of them do deals on certain days you can pick up a little promotional book at any of them. 3. The hotel provides airport transfers which we used to return to the airport this was far cheaper than getting a taxi. 4.

The bathroom had all the necessary complementary toiletries, plenty of towels and a hairdryer. Our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noisy as mentioned by some other guests who have written reviews, but that is possibly due to the fact we were at the back of the hotel, not overlooking the road?

Our decent sized aroom was on the 7th floor with a view of the Sydney Opera House across from Circular Quay. No need for taxis, the hotel is convenient to Circular Quay trains and ferries and all the major Sydney sites are within walking distance. A word of warning though, the American dollar does not go very far in Sydney these days particularly if you are fond of fine dining. Fortunately, we found some passable moderately priced restaurants in the Rocks within walking distance of the hotel which BTW also provides a simple continental brekkie for $10 - 12 AUD. The nearest Coles (reasonably priced grocery store) is about one mile from the hotel. If you are travelling to Oz for an extended stay get to Coles. They are in every city. My only complaint with the hotel and it is a general one for all hotels in Oz is that the typical charge for wifi or internet connection is $25 per day. We brought an ipad and had to hoof it to McDonalds for free wifi, bummer. Sydney itself though is fabulous and this hotel could not be better located (check out the Royal Botanic Garden for great photos of the cockatoos, fox bats and the iconic view from Mrs. McQuarie's Chair).

I suspect it survives because of its location (which to be fair is ideal) and its rooftop swimming pool and large patio area which enjoys panoramic views of the Bridge and Opera House. Those two points aside, the rest is very poor indeed. We were part of a larger family/friends group although we all made separate bookings and arrived/departed on different days so would not have been associated together by the hotel. This gave us an insight into whether our experience was \"unique\" or not - it wasn't! Three in our group of four parties had to change rooms - two were due to unacceptable noise (inside and outside, see later) and one because the kind of room booked was not available on arrival, Our \"standard\" room was quite roomy although this was because the room lacked furniture! The bedhead/bedside lamps etc were marked out for a king-size bed but we only had a double so there was quite a gap on either side and only one bedside table - a chambermaid kindly borrowed another from a nearby room so we could enjoy one on each side of the bed. We also had only one chair, no coffee table or anything like that. My sister had the same kind of room but she got a king-size bed all to herself and two bedside tables, two chairs but still no coffee table. All of us had the same tiny bathrooms with the smallest bath I have ever seen - it was a struggle for me and I am only 5 ft 1 inch tall ! The roof of the bathroom was very low and made up of painted plywood with a crude hole cut out of it to fit the sprinkler through and you could see up into the ceiling space (hardly surprisingly, I saw one non-identified bug/beetle thing in there). All of us endured the same noisy airconditioning which cannot even be turned off in the bathrooms so you must suffer it to some extent. One room was changed because of its exceptionally louder than usual noise. On the subject of noise, DO NOT ACCEPT A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR OVER THE SIDE ENTRANCE. You will be kept awake by a live music band at the pub below and from general revelry in the street outside this pub. As well as our group member who requested and got a room change because of this, we overheard two other parties on different days discuss room changes due to being allocated rooms there. The hotel must know these rooms have a problem. The room decor itself was good albeit minimal through lack of furniture etc but the window blinds encased between the panes of glass were filthy - as the inner glass window can easily be opened, why have these not been cleaned in years? It all smacked of a lack of care. Staff were - well I suppose the fairest thing to say is \"inconsistent\". Some were good, others pretty clueless and one manager quite rude when dealing with a simple housekeeping query. We would be told one thing by one member of staff to have it refuted by another half an hour later - very confusing! So if you want to stay at the Rocks and are not too concerned about your accommodation, then you will enjoy the location and the pool area (which was very well maintained at least). Otherwise, if you like to sleep in a quiet, clean, cool room - go elsewhere and don't risk spoiling your trip to Sydney to save a few dollars.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNeeds renovating\u201d", "Author": "AusTraveller033", "ReviewID": "UR109351689", "Content": "Looked great when going into reception but the room was very tired, mildew on the shower curtain, toilet cracked and the vanity bar in poor condition, The window blinds looked to have never been cleaned.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "imrose", "ReviewID": "UR109022892", "Content": "I just returned from Sydney with my 2 daughters and one of their friends.

The room we were allocated was on the 3rd floor which was directly above George Street, almost at street level. This meant that we got a lot of noise from outside, the early morning garbage trucks seemed to be a constant and the George Street weekend market (although excellent) was also right outside our window, the noisy set up of which started at 3am on a Saturday morning! The room was clean and spacious but the window set up annoyed me - the blinds were tatty and some were broken. The tea, coffee and biscuits were replenished daily ( much to my husband's delight!) and the cleaner did a good job. We were also given a complimentary bowl of fruit as we were staying for 8 days. We had a bit of an issue with the card key reader for our room as the keys kept failing to work. Eventually the manager agreed to reset the reader unit which did solve the problem. The hotel itself is a bit of an odd layout, with all the rooms opening onto a balcony which overlooks the main lobby. This makes the hotel very open and quite cold as the floor is tiled. The hotel bar is oddly placed in the corner of the room which meant it had no atmosphere - we only went there once and we didn't see many other people there. Having said that, the bar food was very good. We didn't have breakfast included in our deal but we did pay for breakfast on one day. The selection was good, but the food quality wasn't great. The hot items weren't filled up quick enough and some of these had run out. There was only one toaster and there was a big queue. We felt it was hugely overpriced and went to the local cafe for breakfast for the rest of the week. On one of the days we went up to the roof - I didn't go in the rooftop pool - it was much smaller than I expected and I think the photos exagerate its size. There is a good view of the Opera House though and plenty of seating. The location of this hotel at the rocks couldn't be better and the staff were first rate - always being friendly and helpful.

I confirmed the booking that week and it was mentioned that parking was noted for the 7th Jan. My husband arrived at the hotel on the 7th only to be told that we had to book another nights accommodation to receive the extra nights parking. He was sent down the road to a parking station. This was disappointing as parking was available if we book another nights stay however not forthcoming if we didn't. We were willing to pay for the extra nights parking. We then made alternative arrange for the Fri parking. We arrived to check into two rooms on the Sat only to be told that parking was not an option as the parking lot was full. What a joke. After numerous discussions we were given a parking spot in a non parking area and again my husband was sent down to the International Ferry Terminal and offered parking at a rate of $25. Why wasn't this suggested for the Fri night also that parking cost us $65. I must mention that this $25 fee was later waived due to the inconvenience for the Sat parking. I did read the ad for the room and presumed from the wording that we had Harbour Views.... this was not the case the harbour views were only from the roof top pool. The pool area was also very 'tired' however spectacular views. I was very disappointed with the way 'things' turned out as it was our daughters wedding night and we wanted to share the glory of the day.

Unfortunately this hotel has introduced credit card surcharges of 1.5%. I find it poor that while hotels enjoy more benefits of credit card use than most other industries (booking guarantees, pre-authorisations, charging for no-shows, charging for late charges, avoiding large cash transactions), the industry has been one of the most bullish industries in Australia to introduce credit card surcharges, and that most major groups have magically chosen exactly the same percentage to surcharge. This surcharge will encourages me to look elsewhere next time I travel rather than simply rebooking at this hotel.

I would not pay the going rate, as I think that this hotel is overpriced for what it is. The location, in the heart of The Rocks in Sydney, is absolutely perfect. You are only a short stroll to the harbour or any number of attractions, eateries and transport. The check in was smooth, although I has to make a phone call to the hotel from my car to ascertain the arrangements for parking. The hotel is valet only, and they only have 3 spots for pre-valet parking. I was given a room on the 4th floor, with a view of the Opera House and Circular Quay. The view was only partially obstructed by a heritage building accross the road, but that is to be expected on the 4th floor. The room itself was clean, but in need of a refit. The sofa had wear holes in the arm, the bathroom, although clean, was best friends with tile paint and gap sealent. You need to excersize caution when drying your hair, that you don't catch the towel on the fire sprinkler. I found the safe to be beyond my expertise to operate, as I followed the simple instructions of inserting my room card to no avail. I gave up after about 15 minutes of trying. The steam button on the iron parted company with the rest of the housing as soon as I touched it, and had to be \"fixed\". I attempted to turn on the TV, which was not functioning. I suspect the batteries in the remote needed changing, however, I wasn't really there to watch TV, so it didn't really bother me. The pivoting bracket which holds the TV to the wall is probably the worst designed object in engineering history. You have to fight the thing to make it move, and it leaves the TV sitting on an odd angle when extended. the bed was comfortable for my large frame and dodgey back, and offered a choice of pillow density. The room was quiet for the duration of my stay, and I slept well. I took the opportunity to use the rooftop pool. The trip up to the roof is worth it, just for the view over Sydney Harbour. The pool must have been photographed with a fish eye lens from a helicoptor, as the website shows a far grander body of water than is actually available for swimming. Having said that, it is ample to cool off on a hot day, and the hot tub is a pleasant temperature. The internal atrium of the hotel makes a spectacular light well and gives a spacious feeling to the public areas. I did notice that a bowl and an apple were left near a railing outside a room for the duration of my stay, which is a bit substandard in a modern hotel. Check out was efficient, however there is an annoying practice of surcharging for credit card use. The surcharge is only 1%, but I hate the feeling of \"tacked on\" charges. My advice to management; bury the charge in your room cost. The valet charge for my stay was $35, which is very reasonable for CBD parking. All in all, a nice stay, which suited my purpose and budget. If you're not too pickey about decor or wear and tear, and you want to stay close to the action, this hotel is excellent, but only at at dicounted price.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt met my expectations and I loved it!

My only complaint was that I wasn't informed breakfast was included in my rate until day 3 (when I asked), and that internet was $25/day and movies were $17. With the US dollar almost matching the Aussie dollar, it made for an expensive week long stay.

All the buildings in this area are historic and this hotel has been built along the same lines. It is situated right between the Harbour Bridge and Circular Quay, one block from the waterfront. We stayed on a Sunday and the Rocks market was in full swing in the lane below our room which was very convenient albeit expensive. Our room 429 was located right next door to the guest laundry and in a small alcove with 3 other rooms off it. As such we suffered thru constant noise of doors opening and closing (22 times in 15 minutes!!!) and the washer and drier operating til 10pm. I would recommend that you avoid rooms around this number if this is likely to annoy you. However the two queen beds were very comfortable, the room was clean and the bathroom was stocked with lots of cute bottles of shampoo etc. One thing I missed in the room was the folder of information about the hotel facilities - I don't know if someone had removed it and it hadn't been replaced yet, but it was frustrating not having all those details on hand. It took a while to figure out how to turn the air conditioning down and we visited the pool to learn it's opening / closing times.

We loved sitting in the spa at dusk watching all the bats heading out for the night. We ate at the little Pizza restaurant just down the street which seemed very popular and was reasonably priced, and had desert at the Guylian Chocolate Shop as a treat (yum!). Breakfast at the hotel cost $18 ea and was more than adequate. There was a chef cooking omelettes and pancakes to order as well as a fresh fruit/vege juicer which I thought was a nice option. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to my friends based on the location alone provided the price was right.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "Pearl65", "ReviewID": "UR60816150", "Content": "We always stay here primarily for the location.

Luckily the a/c was less noisy. We also had issues with the key cards and had to get them reprogrammed.

The hotel is in the most amazing location within a couple of minutes walking distance of Circular Quay. You're right in the rocks which is great for lovely bars and restaurants and the markets that they hold there regularly. It's also just around the corner from the Tourist Information Centre which is handy. The views from the roof terrace are fantastic and we loved going up there at night after dinner just to stare over to the harbour bridge and opera and house and back at the city. The only complaint here was that the biggest cruise ship I have ever seen was blocking the view of the opera house for 4 days of our stay. This was replaced by a smaller one the next day from which you could see over the top of. If you're booking a harbour view room I would check if a cruise ship is going to be in as they really aren't that pretty to look at! We used the pool and spa up on the roof twice which was good but could do with some serious TLC. We were given a room on the top floor initially which unfortunately we had to ask to be moved from as the air conditioning grate was loose and there was no way we could have slept through the rattling noise. Reception moved us without question and were very friendly about the whole thing. The room we were moved to was on the 4th floor and overlooked the Italian restaurant at the back of hotel. The air con was still noisy but nothing like the first room. The room was smart and clean (though there was a dodgy stain on the bed runner...) with modern decor and a newish bathroom. The bath's plug was broken, but this didn't matter to us as we only used the shower. One of the electical sockets by the desk-come-dressing table was intermittently broken which was odd. Sometimes I had to unplug the alarm clock to dry my hair! We paid to use the internet computers in the lobby on 3 occasions to update our family on our trip however the computers were a bit battered and slow and kept crashing which when you've paid $10 for half an hours internet access is a bit of a nightmare. With one particularly bad crash where the receptionist had to unplug the computer and start again we did get a free internet card as an apology. The bar area is very nice and we ate there once and had the odd after dinner drink. It's quite pricey but then so is most of Sydney! What we did eat and drink was good quality. All in all it's a nice hotel, with friendly staff, in a superb location but I would have expected less niggles for \u00c2\u00a3170 a night room only.

I must admit to having reservations about staying at the HI if I was to pay full rack rate. Having due regard to the many reviews available for this hotel on TA we emailed the hotel direct with a couple of requests and they were quickly dealt with and responded to. Our biggest concern was noise from the hotel next door and from the market setup on Saturday and Sunday mornings. My fears were allayed as we were given a room on the 8th floor in the north east corner well away from the offending areas. The real noisy part of the hotel is the south east corner on the lower levels right next to the hotel. Because of its proximity to the pub there is little hotel can do to stop the noise from the live bands permeating into the rooms. My discussions with the General Manager indicated that where possible they put the younger party goers in that part of the hotel on weekends. The upper floors of the hotel are still to have their bathrooms renovated. The renovations are currently on the 6th floor and should all be completed I am advised by November. Our room was adequate for the two of us and being on the uppermost floor we had views of the harbour and an obstructed view of the Opera House. The pool area on the roof offers magnificent views of Sydney Harbour, the Opera House and Harbour Bridge and back through to Circular Quay which to say are spectacular is putting too fine a point on it. The pool on the roof top is heated to 27 degrees and the jacuzzi 37 degrees centigrade. The main pool is approx 8 metres by 3 metres and is 1 metre deep. Around the pool is a balcony ideal for having drinks and nibbles whilst enjoying the view. Pool towels and a shower are provided on the roof for guests use. We had one breakfast in the hotel during our stay and that was a typical full buffet style Australian breakfast with bacon, eggs, sausages etc toast, tea and coffee. We were given a voucher on arrival for a discounted price of $16 per head instead of the normal $24. It was very filling as expected. A guest laundry is available on the 4th floor from 9.00 am and 8.00pm which we took advantage of. Cost of a washer is $2.00 as is the dryer. Each cycles takes approx 35 mins. As a Prestige Points member ( which I joined after booking the hotel) I was invited to meet with Senior Management of the hotel to discuss my stay, an invitation I took advanatage of and had a very friendly chat with the General Manager. I was pleased to advise her that the level of service we had received during our 5 day stay was of the highest order and that all members of staff from the highest level to the cleaners were courteous, polite, friendly and extremely helpful. A previous review of this hotel made comment about the lighting in corridors or lack of it. Unfortunately the hotel is using ECO bulbs and until manufacturers can come up with an ECO bulb with the same lux( amount of light level) as an incandescent bulb this problem will continue. We come to Sydney every year around the beginning of October and we will stay at this establishment in the future. The Old Sydney Holiday Inn is situated right in the middle of the Rocks in Old Sydney Town and because of the heritage nature of the area limited improvement on the buildings is permitted. The area is full of character, a few minutes walk to the ferries and trains at CIrcular Quay and restaurants and cafes abound. My one negative about our stay would have to have been our inability to find a decent cup of coffee, that was until our last day when we were recommended to try the french cafe / patisserie in Argyle St a few minutes walk from the hotel. This is where the hotel staff have their coffees. They were not wrong. In conclusion a big thank you to Leanne Graham and her team for a very pleasant stay in Sydney and we will see you again next year.

It is close to all the attractions, and the Rocks Markets are right outside the hotel. It is a short walk down to the water, where there are good views of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and the city as a whole. We stayed on a gift certificate and are Priority Club Platinum Members. The hotel makes a very big deal about its pool and the great view. While all of this is true, there is an infinitesimal chance that you will get the pool all to your own. There is a small spa and the pool is not much bigger, perhaps 4-5m in length. There are many tables and chairs on the rooftop where we found people sitting, having drinks or food and enjoying the marvellous view. The rooms have been recently renovated and were quite nice and spacious. We had a glimpse of the Harbour Bridge from our room, which was quite nice. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of TV channels. There was an inroom safe and plenty of closet space. We had no noise problems although there were bars and stuff that we could see outside. One thing I would like to say is that the hallways are EXTREMELY dark, so dark in fact that you can barely see the room numbers! This was completely shocking and I think the hotel needs to rectify this immediately. Also, some of the rooms are on a sort of mid-level, where you get out of the lift and have to go down some stairs. If you have trouble with stairs, make sure that you specify that you want a room where you don't need to go up or down the stairs. Our package included a bottle of wine, which was supposed to be delivered at 5:00pm. At about 6:00pm we called the staff who said they were very busy and weren't able to deliver it. We had to pressure them to bring it up to our room. When it came they did not bring the full-sized bottle that the package entitled us to, but instead just a glass of wine. I would prefer if the hotel kept to what was promised. Dining options at the hotel are quite limited. There is a room service menu available, and the same menu is available at the small bar in the lobby. Breakfast is served at the Playfair Terrace restaurant and costs $24/adult. It is a hot breakfast buffet and there was a chef cooking eggs to order. An interesting feature was the chef's daily special, which was an item that was cooked in the kitchen and brought out to the table if you requested it. For us it was pancakes, and they were quite nice. The hotel passed a letter under the door of all rooms the night before with a coupon which entitled two guests from each room to the same breakfast at a discounted price of $16, which was very reasonable. We had dinner at Wok 'n' Noodles, a small restaurant just outside the hotel which had quick Asian food at a very low price, coupled with a nice view of the city. If you would like to go there I am sure that the staff can provide directions. Another place that looked good was the Pancakes on the Rocks, which was VERY busy. As Platinum Elite benefits come, we were given a letter saying that they welcomed us and would be delighted to speak with us if we had the time, and a phone call in the evening to ask a few survey questions. We were also given a late check-out. They did not offer us the complimentary room upgrade entitlement.

This hotel was formed about 1980 and although still seemingly acceptable as we walked across the huge Atrium Lobby to check in but it seemed weary. As we checked in we were persuaded be the receptionist to upgrade at a cost of A$ 25 per night on the basis of a larger room and bed. It was on the 5th Floor at the front. The room was large and had a view of the historic buildings across the street and with a minute peep of the bay above. The wardrobe space was adequate and the bathroom, although dated, was OK.

When we woke after our second night my wife found and killed a huge 5mm long Bed Bug, which was strolling across her pillow! We reported it to the duty manager Kimberley, who was most apologetic and asked us to move to another room on 6th Floor with a good view of the Bridge, opera house and Circular Quay. She removed the upgrade charges and gave us a free breakfast. The lifts created a lot of congestion due to one of the two being replaced. There was excessive traffic noise from George St well into the early hours. This hotel, if it had been bug-free, would have been acceptable but there are better situated ones at about the same price, such as the brand new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSEBEL PIER ONE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the actual waterfront past the famous bridge.

No one offered assistance in wheeling the items in - it appears that they have surplussed their entire bell staff. Nevertheless, check in was expedient and trouble free. My room was on the second floor (the hotel has eight) and overlooked an alley. It turns out that the alley is used as part of the bar and lounge for the Observer Hotel and thus is loud and rowdy until all hours - but it wasn't so loud within the room as to require different accommodation. Tips: Breakfast is $24AUD. period. This gives you a buffet of the usual faire. Whilst the restaurant opens at 0600, the customised egg slash pancake station does not open until 0700. Rooms to avoid: Unless you like the sound and smell of laundry - avoid rooms 429 thru 432 as they are directly across (within meters) of the guest laundry facility. (This is especially interesting as Room 430 is labeled as an Executive room.) Internet: Internet Access is very expensive - at $5 AUD for 25 minutes.

We stayed there around New Years last year and even though they were very busy the service was great. We were able to leave our luggage in their locked luggage room even after we had checked out so we could see a bit more of the city before we packed up and headed out of town. They didn't charge for this service as other hotels often do. The rooftop pool is a great asset to this hotel - it really provides some stunning views of the city skyline, opera house and the harbour bridge. Although some rooms are smaller in size, our room was quite large and had a great view of the Opera house. We were upgraded to a room on the front side of the hotel for free - all we did was ask for an upgrade and we received one. From my experience, big city hotels don't often do this. It was a nice touch on their part. I've been to Sydney a couple of times now and this was my first experience staying at a hotel right in the city. The location of this hotel is great - it's in The Rocks district of Sydney which is not quite the City Centre, but it's within walking distance of it. The location provides a quieter atmosphere with many small shops and a wide variety of restraunts (if you visit, you need to try Pancakes on The Rocks, it's great). You don't need to deal with the crowded City Centre sidewalks or the noisey buses on the streets. Plus, if you don't feel like making the 10-15 minute walk to the city it's only a $5-7 cab ride to downtown. Even though the stay was great, there is always room for improvement. My only gripes with this hotel are the overpriced breakfast they offer and the cruise ship docking station right across the street. First, the breakfast: You expect to pay in upwards of $15-20 per person for a buffet breakfast in the city, but this buffet was $24/person when we stayed and it certainly was not worth that much. A short walk up Geroge Street or in the other direction up through The Rocks will yeild many smaller restraunts with much more competitively priced breakfasts (and often times better tasting too). Regarding the cruise ship docking station - that was the biggest disappointment of our stay. Shortly after we arrived, a very large cruise ship came into town for the remainder of our stay at the hotel. For anyone who doesn't know, these oceanliner cruise ships are absolutley massive in size. They are so massive that they block any view of the Opera House from the hotel, even from the rooftop pool area. It wasn't a huge problem, but it was disappointing all the same.

The relatively cheap cost and supreme location alone made it a good fit for us, and the executive room was certainly good enough for my taste as well. The bed was fine, the room size was okay and overall the room was just like many others i've experienced in similar 3 1/2 - 4 star hotel chains. My only slight problem was that it was pretty noisy one of the nights. The surrounding area is a popular eating out precinct, and it has a few pubs as well I think, and one night the sounds of a few loud people walking down the street seemed to effortlessly drift in the window for quite a while, but in the end that was only a minor problem and didn't do anything to ruin my stay. The staff were generally friendly, although they didn't meet you as you arrived and offer to bring your bags up to your rooms etc which I probably would have expected, but no major issue again. I didn't eat dinner there as the circular quay, darling harbour and rocks areas are so inviting to eat out at, but we had the buffet breakfast, and as a lover of a good hotel breakfast, i can tell you that this one was good with a great selection! Another thing I liked was the rooftop swimming pool/spa area. It has a really spectacular view of the opera house and harbour one way, and a good view of the city the other way. I reccommend going up there to see the night lights, very nice! All in all a very enjoyable experience.

We didn't eat in the hotel so we can't comment on that At the weekends outside the hotel to the left they have a very good market and it's worth having a look around The only downside to this hotel is that it gets extremley noisey especially from the Irish bar down the road, we could hear all the music and noise but as we were only there for 2 nights we decided just to put up with it and it really didn't effect our stay Enjoy", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancashire", "Title": "\u201cincredible location\u201d", "Author": "cuddlydudley", "ReviewID": "UR15147082", "Content": "Very expensive but as a one off it was certainly worth it.

The hotel is not new, but is tastefully appointed. For us mere mortals without access to expense accounts or superannuation draw downs this hotel delivers much bang for its buck. Under our package a cooked buffet style breakfast was included, and the kids ate all meals in the restaurant for free ( Meals were very tasty!). That certainly puts a bit more weight in the wallet! The staff were attentive and polite and didn't miss a beat in terms of advice or help. The kicker for the kids was the pool on top of the roof. The weather was slightly inclement but that didn't stop them ( and by definition dear old dad!) giving it a nudge. Granted the pool is smaller than those depicted on the hotels web site - but the view over Sydney taking in the opera house and over the bay is out of this world.

We were looking at the Tourist leaflets one morning and the concierge asked if he could help. We explained what we were looking for - a nice day out, perhaps to the zoo and something to do in the evening locally. He suggested we take a train up to the blue mountains and then come back and go to the funfair park on the other side of the river because after dark you can take alcohol in and have competions to see how many rides you have to go on drunk before you have to throw up!!!!! Hm.... The hotel TV program talked about their excellent concierge service (well we had alredy experienced that) and suggested we ask for a complimentary DVD about Opal mining. On asking the Concierge, the reception staff and the current manager on duty no-one seemed to know anything about the DVD. We were even told we couldnt watch it in the roo as there wasnt a DVD player in there. We had to explain what complimentary meant. Needless to say we did not get a copy.

Thanks to a 30+ hour journey we slept on our first night. That was the only night we got a proper nights sleep. Our room was fine. The bed was very comfortable and the decor was alright. The restaurant was very nice and had a very extensive buffet breakfast selection. The restaurant and accommodation staff were very friendly and helpful but a couple of the reception staff were unhelpful. One in particular tried to charge us $25 for renting an adapator that we didn't as I'd brought my own. She wouldn't believe us when we said we didn't get an adaptor but had to eventually back down and not charge us but made it plain that she didn't believe us. About 2 weeks prior to our visit to Sydney I emailed the hotel requesting a room on one of the higher floors. We were given a room on the second floor practically above the main hotel entrance. The noise was unbelievable with modified cars speeding up and down the road until about 5am. There is also a taxi rank at the hotel entrance. The taxi drivers get out of their cars and spend the night chatting and even shouting out to other taxi drivers while waiting for fares. The windows are not sealed properly so are not sound-proofed. Between modified cars, taxi-drivers and revellers you will get very little sleep. The walls are also very thin as every night we could hear the occupants of the next room get up for their 4am pee. The restaurant has a self-service juicer and due to the design of the hotel atrium you hear it on a fairly constant rate from 7am. It's even worse when you're having your breakfast and hear it in constant use. It's very noisy. The weekend before we went to Australia we stayed at a Holiday Inn on the North Circular in London. It's an extremely busy road with 6 lanes of traffic on one side and two lanes on the other side. The hotel had properly sealed windows so our sleep wasn't disturbed. I think it's time the Old Sydney did the same. I think the convenience of the hotel's location is excellent but I like to get a night's sleep when on holiday so for that reason I'd avoid staying here.

Again like a previous review, when I politely asked at reception about the noise I was given a blank look, an attitude of 'how dare I complain' and and a denial that no-one had ever complained about it before. I asked if we could be moved but was told that the hotel was full so I returned to the room but had to return to reception to see if there was anything that could be done. I was then told there was rooms available but not executive rooms ( which were available for the next day) but we were not caring about that so we moved rooms at 12.30am and then got moved the next day to another executive room. We did not get an apology for having to move and we then found the attitude of the staff towards us as downright rude and we can only put it down to their childish attitude to us asking to be moved.

Go up at different times, both day and night to get some great photographs. Those are the positive points of the hotel. However, what spoilt it for us was the way we were treated. Having not had much contact with the front desk staff it was only on our last day that we discovered how incompetent they really were. The hotel is very noisy every night - if you have a room at the front of the hotel. We politely asked at reception if it was like that every night and they seemed to take offence and gave us some 'attitude.' However, we thought no more of it until our problems started with the staff. At this time we asked them to book us an early morning wake up call and we later double-checked that this had been done. This call never arrived and when we telephoned reception to ask why it they had not woken us up, we were rudely put on hold with extremely loud music and the phone was never picked up again. We had also asked at the same time for the reception to book our shuttle to the airport. We were there when the receptionist was on the phone to the company so imagine our surprise when the shuttle did not arrive for us. We know that the shuttle was booked for everyone except four (including myself and my travel companion) so it does not seem to be the shuttle company's mistake. We also know that the woman on the front desk did not mistakenly book us with another company, as we waited in reception for an hour and no other shuttle arrived. Therefore, we can only think that the front desk staff deliberately failed to book our shuttle. Perhaps they did not like us mentioning the noise.

Although it was the plushest place we stayed in during our holiday, it sadly proved to be the most disappointing too. Walking into reception, we were impressed to find the atrium reaching all the way up to the 7th floor, the walls lined with rooms facing into this impressive, vertigo-inducing space. Unfortunately it was downhill from there. Our room only appeared to be allocated by the receptionist when we checked in (\"Oh, did you book a double room?\"). Given the room we ended up with, we couldn't help but get the impression she didn't like the look of backpacking youngsters like us. Our room (624) was located in a dimly-lit back corridor (thus no view of the grand atrium). Once the keycard finally allowed us access to our room (both keys were reluctant to work on numerous occasions), we found our well-furnished but small room had a great view of, er, the restaurant and apartment blocks behind the hotel. The bathroom (and bath itself) was laughably small/cramped, literally half of the size of the one we'd had in a hostel we'd stayed at previously! I even had to remove the bin from the bathroom as it took up too much floorspace in there. The other facilities in the room were decent enough though (safe, iron and ironing board, minibar). While we were checking in, another guest was complaining at Reception about the price of his room/breakfast package, one which was apparently $70 AUD cheaper than what we had paid for our room. As it turned out, our room rate didn't even include breakfast, although we only found this out when we asked at Reception later that day (such info wasn't included in any of our booking information, nor was it mentioned at check-in). As mentioned in other reviews here, the rooftop pool does indeed offer good views of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. Unfortunately half of this area was closed/fenced off for refurbishment when we visited it, as were several other areas in the hotel (most notably various large sections of the Reception floor that were being varnished). It would have been nice to have been advised of these works when we made the booking, or even when we checked into our room. This is undoubtedly a great location for a first-time visitor to Sydney, close to many areas of interest (the Rocks, Circular Quay, etc). However, having paid what we felt was a considerable amount of money for one night's stay in a chain hotel, we couldn't help but feel disappointed, cheated and even belittled.

Breakfast in the room was a bit of a luxury, but very well presented, and there is enough for two people in one breakfast. If you stay over a weekend, the bonus is that George Street is blocked off just outside the hotel, and the Rocks marketstalls are erected to trade all day Saturday and Sunday. Agree with other comments about the noise, mainly from cars we found, which can go on until 1 am at weekends, but hey, you are in Sydney, not the Outback. I think you can chose a room round the back, but you lose the views. If you need to sleep, ask for some earplugs on your longhaul flight! The keycards for the door were faffy; something we didn't master during our stay. There are plenty of places nearby to eat and drink. A really nice walk is to cross over the road, down the steps to Circular Quay, round to the Opera House, and then follow the walkway through the Botanical Gardens round to Mrs Macquaries Chair, where you get the best views of Sydney. Would recommend the hotel to anyone. Don't forget to read my review of the Bridge Climb. It is a must do, and if a 3 minute walk away. Have fun.

I bought a Vodafone SIM card and called up the hotel after taking a shower at the airport. Given that the checkin time was 2PM, I was expecting the worst, but was told that a room might be ready by the time we got there. Sure enough, we were checked-in to the hotel by the very friendly staff as soon as we got there! The room was nice, with no real view (we were on a low floor), and the noise from George St below does make it into the room. The breakfast and internet access are way overpriced, but the views from the rooftop were amazing as were the views from the docks a mere 2 minutes from the front door of the hotel. The location of this hotel is the best I could imagine for Sydney. A short walk to Circular Quay, near a variety of restaurants and eateries, etc.... All this for around $100 (USA) per night bids on Priceline! We returned the following weekend at the tail end of our Australia trip and got similarly great service.

The room was a decent size with a double and single bed. The bathroom was pretty small, but overall the place was very clean. We thought the breakfast was over priced at $16 for continental, $24 for full English but the choices were quite good, lots of fresh juices, fruits, cheeses, yogurts, breads, cereals, pastries etc. as well as the usual hot fare. The staff were exceptionally helpful & friendly, really a nice bunch. Only downside was the noise from the street which was a bit intrusive throughout the night as there are quite a lot of bars close by. Plus the traffic and police sirens.

The windows were dusty and the TV was horrible. The channels were in red tones. The bath room was also very small, if you didn't shut the bathroom door all the way it would smack your knees when stittin on the stall. The toilet also ran almost 24 hours a day. Sometimes we couldn't even get it too flush. I don't want to forget....BEWARE of the HOT and COLD water changes when taking a shower! And the walls are as thin as paper, you can hear everyone who walks by. The view on the roof is what you would call the \"Million Dollar View,\" but if you want to go in the hot tub or heated pool...again beware it is freezing. It was very disappointing! The only good thing is that the bed was comfy and it was close to the harbor, which has great live performers!
