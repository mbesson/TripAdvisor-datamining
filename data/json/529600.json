We were fine with it, but I definitely recommend getting in touch with the hotel ahead of time if this is something that would bother you. The hotel is a bit out of the way, a block behind the Museo Nazionale, but it was LOUD outside. The windows were noise-reducing, which was nice, but there was nothing to keep all the traffic noise out. I am a really light sleeper and still had to use earplugs. My husband, though, slept right through it. There was no heat in the room, but they had additional blankets available which were thick enough to keep sufficiently warm.

The Ascot ticked all those boxes and delivered except that wifi was only available in the lounge on the 2nd floor and my room was on the first floor which at the time was inconvenient. There is a lift from the ground floor so had no problems lugging around my bag. The rooms were reasonable in size, very clean, bed was comfortable (others i have stayed with were very hard) and quiet and i didnt hear any noise from any other guests. Breakfast was good but it wasnt available until 8am and as others have noted that is a bit inconvenient if you want to get out early to do sightseeing. Plenty of restaurants/take aways nearby as well as general shops. Location in terms of sightseeing in Rome is good if you are ok with public transport (the buses are actually very good in Rome), but the Ascot is at the Termini end which means it is a walk across town to the Forum and Colosseum.

There is a market almost every morning in the street as you exit the hotel Except for one gentleman who went out of his way to make a copy for me, the desk staff seemed distant and preoccupied with concerns other than their guests. Maybe it is just Roman reserve but I never saw a smile returned in the four days I was there. Once, when I asked if we could eat 15 min earlier, the clerk pointedly looked at the clock and said nothing. Breakfast is not until 8, which is late when you are trying to get out early to avoid the crowds. Often there were people waiting to eat and some just went in and started early and did without the coffee. It is convenient to the train station, Metro and buses.

Proximity to Termini is good from a connectivity perspective, and not being in the immediate locality is advantageous considering that Termini is crowded and not entirely safe. Therefore the location of Hotel Ascot is a significant plus in its favour. The hotel lobby itself is on the second floor, and since the door to the main road is always closed, one cannot be blamed for missing it. Keep your eyes wide open and you'll spot the sign on the wall. The room I had was spacious while not opulent. My room did not have a window overlooking the road, but this didn't hurt as the room was large. The restroom was also large (by European standards, anyway!) and well furnished. It appeared that the toilet had actually been redone recently as the fittings seemed to be newer than the rest of the room. The water in the shower pulsated between scalding hot and mildly cold, which was a trifle annoying but tolerable. In some areas (lobby, the door to my room, etc.) there seemed to be a bit of decay but I must add that this did not translate to a lack of cleanliness. The breakfast - included in the tariff - is best missed. There are no fruits, just one fruit juice, and no eggs. Just two options for breads too. Breakfast was the single most disappointing aspect of the hotel - and it was a lot worse than just poor. The people at the front desk were helpful and offer maps upon request. A word on the Wi-Fi - it simply works! I had no trouble logging in, and the speeds were very good - I was able to stream live video on my iPhone. My visit was just after Easter and that probably explains why I had to shell out more than 120 euros for a night. Even so, I feel it is a price too high and I only booked Ascot because I couldn't find a cheaper alternative in as good a location.

At first it is decieving when you look at the front door, but when you get inside and take the elevator to the floor on which the hotel is located you will feel more reassuring that you made the right decision. We resided in room number 25.Its the best room in the hotel since its close to the reception and breakfast area. Internet speed was super fast and we slept well but I think that was mostly because we we so tired from all the walking tours that we had been doing during our 4 days in Rome. The room faces a street so there could be a lot of traffic in the morning honking and also somedays there is a hawkers market but if you are a person who has well planned your itenary for the day then you would probably get up early and run out of the hotel to catch the train and find the meeting point from where your walking tour actually begins.Breakfast is italian, which include Croissants and cappucino.if you like there are also some other items like tea,cheese,jam,fruit yougurts,toast etc..The hotel is located walking distance to Roma termini, just make sure you have travel bags withe wheels so you can pull it across the road.Also there is a store right across the hotel where you can buy some daily groceries or even some wine and beer.There is also a restaurant across called Baboos that serves italian food. The only problem we had was that the shower in the bathroom did not have a good spray and the water fluctuated from hot to cold ubruptly, but we managed just fine... The Bathroom is very nice and bigger than other bathrooms in other italian hotels, but the shower area is very small which is also like other italian hotels.

The only little drawback is the noise when you get room facing the main street. But when the windows are shut, the isolation is pretty good.
