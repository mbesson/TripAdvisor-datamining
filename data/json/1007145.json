Great location if you want to be in the city, just a block from the plaza. Old hotel, so it looks a bit tired but at least it's clean. Road noise was loud, I'd ask for a room that doesn't face the road next time. It took several minutes of running the shower until hot water came, but it did. We had rooms 2 and 4, the latter had a much better looking bathroom with newer tile, the other one needed updating ASAP. Overall satisfied, great value if all you need is a bed for the night.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "WPB florida", "Title": "\u201cfunkytown\u201d", "Author": "ronbonbfhon", "ReviewID": "UR121291906", "Content": "Everything I read in previous reviews is true. I stayed in a single room 2 nights for $53 per night. This was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever had. It is an old building, with some modest upgrades. The WIFI worked good sometimes, other times no. There was a TV but don't think I used it. My room was on street side and was noisy, but the a/c unit muffled the street noise okay when left in the \"low cool\" position. No elevator, very small breakfast provided in the small breakfast room. Nice parking lot in the rear, but I didn't use it, they have security camera on the street in front also. Everyone super nice at the hotel. The town is very cute. Everyone should stay a few days at the Colonial, for a change.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFor the price, very good.\u201d", "Author": "rvp2", "ReviewID": "UR120025343", "Content": "We paid $70 for a double room.

I was only staying for one night and i am not a very demanding person and for the price I paid which was about 70$ plus taxes, I did not expect much. I arrived during the night and the front desk clerk was really nice, his name started with an A, I am soo bad with names!. But only one problem, I had booked two rooms (i went with my boyfriend and my sister with her husband) and neither of them had hot water. I was a little bit mad since that is the least you should expect from a hotel, it sucks showering with cold water during the night! I went to the front desk and told him about our problem and he said that we should not worry, that when we arrive from going out the water would be boiling.... To my surprise, when I decided to take a shower the next day during the morning, we still did not have any hot water. At that moment I was very pissed and at the moment of ckeck out the guy that was in the front desk, which is an elder man with glasses, I explained to him the situation and asked him if there was anything we could do, he just said no and was very rude, and was talking to me as if I was lying, I felt really bad and he groaned like if he was saying \"oh whatever\".

Large, clean rooms. One block from the lovely main square in Mayaguez. This hotel used to be a convent for the nearby church. The biggest disadvantage we found was that the rooms (we stayed in 2 different rooms) did not have windows, so there was no opportunity to get natural light into the room. The hotel offers free continental breakfast, but it just consists of cereal, toast, small muffins and juice/coffee/milk.

Hotel is adequate and inexpensive. Rooms are very clean, with a small television (high on the wall). Beds are on the \"very firm\" side, and because the hotel was full, showers during peak morning hours only reached \"lukewarm\". We had to ask for a hand towel and washcloth. Maids were extremely friendly; we didn't encounter the rude woman that an earlier reviewer noted. There are no elevators, so be prepared to carry your luggage up stairs, or request a ground floor room. We were in room 21, and oddly, there are shuttered windows in the room that open to the lobby. So several mornings we were awakened to people conversing in the lobby. Ask for a room that doesn't have that. Not the place to stay if you're used to resorts or high-end accommodations, but if you like \"unique\", you're comfortable in hostels, B & Bs, etc. , and you like to support local busineses, then you'll be happy here. There is secured parking out back and the front desk folks spoke English and were helpful.

Now, the front desk service is divided by those who are polite and efficient and those who are not. That is, The morning front desk person (a middle age man) was very polite and helpful, but when his shift is over--everyone else lacks the qualities the morning person, except one young man with eye glasses--who was very nice and even offered me a refund for leaving the hotel before my initial stay. Now, the worse thing that the hotel has is the room service, specifically a middle age lady that constantly knocks your door to disturb your sleep to offer you towels. If you wake up and leave the hotel for the day after 9:00 am she would not clean the room--she did this twice when I stood there, for I expressed grievance the next morning to front-desk. This lady made the whole stay at this hotel my worse experience ever--I mean, one of the day's during my stay--she even handed \"clean\" towels and told me that because the room seem to be clean, she didn't have to clean it, and complimenting me for being neat. beware of this lady", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cClean, good security and service\u201d", "Author": "CtFreddie", "ReviewID": "UR55640068", "Content": "This hotel is a block from the town square where events are frequent, but otherwise a bit out of the way and the area is pretty run-down.

The price is very good, and the hotel offers free onsite parking in a secured (locked) parking lot. If you look past the somewhat shabby dresser and bedspread in the room you will notice that the floor is a beautiful old tile that people now pay dearly for when renovating homes. Appreciate the architecture and the fact that it's not a sterile American-style hotel -- it is more reminiscent of what you find in Europe. Our room (#19) was very small (a marvel of engineering in how they fit the double bed and dresser \"just so\") but had cable television and an updated bathroom. Seriously, if you are an obese person, you don't want this room. The water pressure in the bathroom was excellent and there was plenty of hot water. We slept well and the hotel was quiet. We passed on the free continental breakfast (travel packs of cereal) but there's a wonderful local bakery two blocks away (Ricomini Bakery) that we enjoyed. It also serves hot and cold sandwiches and other deli offerings. There is free WifFi but it only works in the small eating area off the lobby.
