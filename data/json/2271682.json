It is located in the centre of the city in few steps from the Taksim Square and the major restaurants, bars and shops. In few minutes walking distance from the tram station that takes to the old historical city. We spent 2 nights in hotel just before the 2011 year end and no complaints. Overall good location and value for money for both business trips and sightseeing. The staff is very polite and helpful. I forgot a shirt in my room when we left the hotel and I was assuared by the hotel managers that it will be posted to my address in Bulgaria at the hotel's expense. Honestly I did not expect such an attitude and I was very pleased.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cEmerald hotel\u201d", "Author": "gcapraz", "ReviewID": "UR121883145", "Content": "Perfect location with smiling and friendly Staff.

The hotel is located near Taksim Square metro, but it is not particularly pedestrian (or taxi) friendly. It was cheaper and cleaner than surrounding hotels in the immediate vicinity, but we discovered there are numerous better (and cheaper) options in nicer locations just a few blocks away in the Pera district. The photos of the room on the website are pretty accurate, but they don't show the dreary view or convey the isolated atmosphere of the hotel, which seems to cater to traveling Arab businessmen. The television offered 15+ channels of Arab porn, the Mecca channel (all Mecca, all the time), and just a handful of English-speaking channels. Some staff were helpful and friendly, others were oily and didn't offer much help when the wi-fi wasn't working. The staff spoke limited English, and could not offer much assistance when asking for directions, etc. but basic communications were okay. Despite requesting a non-smoking room, we periodically had to stuff towels under the door to prevent smoke from coming up from the lobby below. The linens, room key, and stationery say Panorama Suites Hotel, not Emerald Hotel, which caused some momentary confusion when we pulled out the room key when instructing our taxi driver where to go and didn't recognize the name. Shower had mildew (as do many in Istanbul), but since this hotel is completely renovated, I am not sure why they didn't re-caulk the failing areas. Room was fairly clean but I did notice some surfaces weren't clean, and I had to wash the coffee cups in the sink before using them. My main gripe about this hotel (besides the breakfast), was the ridiculously annoying and useless wireless internet access. Each guest must obtain their own log in and password (a challenge depending on the staff working) and log in every 30 seconds or so. It was so bad, it was virtually unusable. In one night, we had to visit the front desk four times before we could finally get access to the wi-fi: once to get an additional password, once to decipher staff's writing, twice to get a new account because the ones they issued didn't work. It was almost as if they don't want people using the internet at all! This was the main reason that prompted our search for a new hotel (using the wi-fi at a coffee shop, of course), for which we are grateful, because we found a different hotel in a better location for a slightly better price. Breakfast looked great in the photos, but was in fact inedible. The wilted, tired garnishes were unappetizing, the eggs were rubbery, the cheese was crusty, the bread stale, and the juices fake and watered down. However, the service was very good, and even though the cook spoke very little English, he undoubtedly gave the best service of anyone in the hotel. Bottom line: we recommend staying in the Pera district instead just a few blocks away, a more scenic area in close proximity to shops and cafes and Istiklal street with comparable prices.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Erkan_K", "ReviewID": "UR118885614", "Content": "From the minute we arrived the attentive staff ensured our stay would be memorable.
