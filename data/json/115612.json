I was forced to stay here by my landlord because our building was being tented for termites. Thank goodness I didn't pay for this room or I would have been extremely pissed! I was on the bottom floor on the very end of the hotel (room 101) conveniently located next to the dumpster. The flies from the trash attempted to follow me into the room which let off a musky smell. The comforter had blood stains, and other large yellow circular stains all over it (not to mention the cigarette burn holes in the comforter in our NON smoking room). There is no air conditioner but they do provide a large standing fan which works well to blast air around the tiny room. Not using the disgusting comforter, and needing to use the fan because it is the middle of summer, I had no sleep because I was in a constant temperature fluctuation battle. The bed was super hard and no better than sleeping on the ground. My body hurt the next day from being so stiff. The bathroom was old and the shower dingy with some type of rust casing the bottom of our shower. The bathroom window also provided a nice view of the Burger King across the street. I could hear the person in the room next to our snoring, as well as the sounds of the bar across the street bumping the music well into the night. I am young and go to the bar across the street as a regular, but I am really glad I don't live next to that noise; it was a traumatic experience, which I hope never to relive. My landlord gave me an apology gift certificate for a restaurant because he felt so bad.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cCute, Budget Friendly & Great Location\u201d", "Author": "KellyZ_AZ", "ReviewID": "UR116288014", "Content": "We stay here every year when we come to San Diego.

It's a minutes walk away from the ocean, restaurants and nightlife. Now to the bad: The water faucet had a really hard to operate, stuck lever. The sheets were dirty, and it was disgusting to sleep in them. It's near all the bars, so don't expect a very quiet night in your room with cars driving by and people yelling around from time to time. I didn't mind too much though. They advertise free wireless internet for their guests. The connection in my room was extremely weak, so I wasn't able to work on my time-sensitive projects. I complained, and they gave me a key to another room where it should be a lot better. So I packed and lugged all my luggage over, trusting them they knew what they were saying was right. There the wireless turned out to be even worse. When I got home the next day and I walked into the room in the afternoon, I was greeted with water splashing out of a completely soaked carpet with every step. Ok, admittedly there was a strong downpour which did cause a lot of flooding around the area, but apparently that happens yearly. Besides making sure that those rooms don't end up being flooded every year, they should have had their room service check the flooded rooms to make sure that no guests left sensitive items on the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g. clothing, documents, laptops, ... They also should have offered a new room immediately, without me actually having to ask for one. I ended up getting so fed up that I checked out of the hotel at 11PM at night, lugging my luggage over to the (now relocated) Bed & Bay Residence Inn nearby which turned out to be an excellent choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even closer to the beach, nicer, cheaper & friendlier.

Let me be very frank, this is not a ritzy elegant hotel, so don't expect a concierge and Westin beds. But this is a great value and fantastic location. The motel is literally a block from the beach and about 3 blocks to Grand Ave where all the fun Pacific Beach restaurants, shops and bars are located. There is a market right next to the motel and a starbucks a block away. What I loved about the hotel was that our car could be parked right outside of our room, and we could leave it there for the trip (parking is really horrible in PB). The room was your basic motel room with no extra frills, but it did have a sizeable closet compared to its Motel 6 counterpart. There was a TV, 2 pretty comfortable double beds, a smaller bathroom with just a shower and the closet. There is no air conditioning, but there are fans. Frankly, you do not need the air conditioning at all! I was totally comfortable the entire time, and I can be pretty heat sensitive. We had no issues with noise, bugs, dirtiness or rudeness. The management warned me when I made the reservation that they don't tolerate extra people in the rooms or partying, and I totally understand that sentiment. I would recommend this hotel to the budget traveler who wants to be in a fantastic location, and doesn't mind simple rooms.

We decided that we would park one car two-blocks away, one in a regular spot, and the handicapped vehicle in the handicapped spot.

Well, ok...perhaps that MIGHT be, because there truly isn't much to say? The Mission Bay Motel is simply what it sounds like. A Motel. It has quite a few years on it, ( Oh, I'd venture a guess of about 30 years or more) and offers few \"extras\" or amenities as you might expect in most Hotels or other Motels ( ie; Days Inn, Motel 6, etc). The rates I have paid vary anywhere from $60 up to $160 depending upon the time of year and the room. Romms seem to vary from a single ( which are located on the western side of the property both up and downstairs ( 2 level establishmant) to the room with 3 beds( no, not a 3 bedroom...1 room --- 3 beds) with a kitchenette( actually a stove and a mini-fridge with some supplied utentils). You are not really paying for the simpleness of this location ( though there is a small pool directly behind the office on the Mission Blvd with a fence around it) but more so for the location......one block from THE BEACH!!. There is also a Hooter's Restaurant directly across the street and up the stairs. There is also one of the best bars for sightseeing in Southern California called La Heina's ( located ON the beach boardwalk and slightly to the south) which is touted as the ONLY open deck bar in California located on the Boardwalk. I sure would love to know if this is true, but aftre a couple hours there you forget why you are there. Back to the Motel, though, there is no ice machine, there is no soda machine, there are no vending machines. There is a liquor store on the same block just to the south. There is a Burger King JUST to the North across the street. There is a Tony Roma's restaurant across the steet, as well as a couple of fantastic breakfast eateries ( make sure to visit The Eggery for early morning breakfast). The Motel does offer both smoking and non-smoking rooms, but of course I can only tell you that I have seen smoking rooms during all but 1 of my stays. One time I did have to stay in a non-smoking room which I hated, but respected by stepping outside to smoke. I can't say how often that practice is followed, so be prepared. All the rooms have a color tv with a remote and get basic cable ( about 60 or so channels) and HBO only. They do have a little clock radio with AM/FM but you'd be better served to do as I do and bring a Boom-Box and CD's ...after all...you are at the beach!! You may wish to bring your cooler or a mini-fridge to store soda, beer, ice in. You depending on how long you are staying, you may even want to bring a mutli-outlet as they only have a couple of outlets in the rooms. Speaking of, one of the BEST things about staying at the wonderfully simple motel, is not the name, the service, the maids, but something MUCH more.The LOCATION!! Think of it this way. you are in Pacific Beach...you can go drinking on Garnet St and walk back to your room ( 4 blocks) and not worry about drinking and driving. You can also get a room as I do on most holiday weekends ( unless I am in Vegas) and go enjoy yourself with beer on the beach and make or take at least ONE good reliable friend who will watch your belongings on the beach while you walk ONE BLOCK back to your room to use your own BATHROOM. See what a worthwhile investment it is? No drinking and driving, good location, parking is ok except for on weekends . Most get parking in front of their rooms. Some may have to park on the north end of the Motel or on the street. Holiday weekends parking is insane, so if you are there on a Friday, my advice is DO NOT LEAVE. Take a taxi to downtown for about $25 bucks, a bus ( which stops in front of the motel) or walk. If you live in town, just take a cab down, why bring the car? If you have kids, be preapred as this is a beach area and sometimes the language and scenery can be a bit R-rated, but not too. Police try and keep a good job on things, but as in any college town, summer destination, where you have women , men ( well..young men) , beach and beer well....sometimes you need a little extra help. The staff at this motel is wonderful though sometimes a little tired from long hours trying to help guests and keep an eye on things. They always keep fresh coffee in the office and a number of flyers for out of town guests to use for sightseeing around the area. Simply put, this is in my opinion, a great value for your money. If you need glitz and glamour, there are other hotels/motels around the way, but if, like me, you care for a tv, a locked door and convience, this is your place. In all of my stays, I have never seen any pests of any sort...so that has never been an issue. At least for me. As many times as I have been there, I have never once had any problem other than a problem with a backed up toilet which was repaired quickly. Lots of foreigners tend to stay here I would imagine because of \"Location\" and \"Zonies because.....It's near water. Not sure what a 'Zonie is? Ask when you check in...
