I'm not going to argue with them. Our experience was good enough though. The rooms are definitely cramped. We had a room with a bathroom and shower ensuite. So no having to wander up the stairs to use the bathroom. Our room was clean, the shower was hot, the TV worked fine, and wi-fi was included. It also includes a breakfast of bacon, eggs, and beans. There was also cereal, fruit, bread, jam, juice and tea available. At 55 GBP the price was decent. We chose it primarily for its location just a 5 minute walk from the family we were visiting. It is maybe a 15 minute walk to the tube and connected into the main transport line. Would stay there again simply because of location close to family. Definitely would want to make sure to check out the room and realize you truly do get what you order and nothing else.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlow, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNot an Hotel by any means\u201d", "Author": "Anthony N", "ReviewID": "UR120321117", "Content": "This is not an hotel for a start. The room we were in was very basic. It had a wash basin but no toilet (In fact there wasn't even a bathroom on the floor that our room was situated). Two beds, a sink and that's it. Also, most \"Hotels\" have a bar and food service. Neither of these are present here. It is very much a \"Hostel\", though most hostels even provide a self-service for cooking food that one may have purchased while out and about. By no means should this particular venue be allowed to class itself a Hotel. I have seen bad B&Bs that are miles better equipped than this. The Price (at \u00a3156 for 2 nights for 2 people) would have been decent if the establishment lived up to its own title (Hotel). In the actual event however, I am sorry I didn't book a tourist hostel in the City Centre for a fraction of that price. I am struggling to think of positives. I really am.... It is close to City Centre Tube and Bus routes. The young lady that greeted us on our first entry to the place was very nice and friendly.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience I have ever had when travelling\u201d", "Author": "CiaranT81", "ReviewID": "UR117430437", "Content": "I was returning home from a year travelling around Australia when I had a stop off in London for a few days before heading home. Unfortunately for me my friend lived near here so I picked this place based on location, but in all the places I EVER stayed in this was the WORST experience I have ever had from start to finish!! I'll start with the positives. The rooms were fairly good (if you got the right one) and it's not in a bad location. I should have realised what was coming when I booked the place over the phone however as I was passed onto to three different people as they could not understand English. I am talking about not being able to understand the word SEPTEMBER! Yes someone with barely a word of English was hired as a booking agent! I arrived with 2 friends late in the evening after a 17 hour journey from Thailand and were tired. I had booked a triple room which was clearly stated on my booking confirmation. I was given a key by the receptionist who clearly was peeved at having to stay later to check us in (which I checked beforehand if it would be ok). Once we got the key he shut everything up and headed on his way. We get to the room and it is a DOUBLE, with a bed barely big enough to get 2 into. Plus it was broken! Tried to get in contact with anyone who could help us but to no avail, the place was deserted. We had to drag a fold up bed that was lying abandoned in the corridor into the room just to give us all something to sleep on. The next day I had the joy of meeting the hefty owner of the hotel. I was just happy to have got a good night\u2019s sleep and have had bookings like this happen before when you get booked into the wrong type of room and sort it out in the morning, usually not an issue for me. What flabbergasted me was the manager immediately gave ME a telling off for putting 3 into a double room!! I explained that I had booked for 3 people and would go upstairs and get my booking form. As I was disgusted by his attitude I said that the bed in the room was also broken and he retorted \u201cWell that\u2019s what happens when you put 3 people in a double bed.\u201d His attitude absolutely stank and I was very angry after that statement. Once I brought the booking down, explained my dealing with his non English speaking staff and made him aware of his appalling customer service he changed his tune and apologised. He said we could have a triple room for no extra cost (even though I\u2019d paid for one!) and we moved rooms. That incident was enough to spoil any stay, but what happened the next day was beyond belief! Might I add at this point Five Kings calls itself a bed and breakfast. So we were told breakfast was served until 9:30am, and arrived down on the second day at 9:20am. The cook was still there and plenty of people were around having their breakfast. However the cook was just starting to clean up. When I requested breakfast she told me she was done cooking and no more breakfast was being served. I was shocked at this and immediately went upstairs to the manager to complain. The \u2018friendly\u2019 porter from the first night was there and followed me down to the kitchen. He told me it was now too late for breakfast, even though it was still only 9:25am! I also said I was here 10 minutes before the end of breakfast when others were just starting theirs. He then proceeded to tell me that other hotels/B&B\u2019s near by do not serve breakfast, and their establishment does it \u201cas a favour!!\u201d To say I was dumbstruck was an understatement! I booked a BED and BREAKFAST and was down IN TIME for breakfast! His attitude stank just like every other person in the establishment and at this stage I was seething! I requested to speak to the manager but was brushed off. They gave me his number and I left a message but was not called back. I was leaving later that day (on the day of a tube strike) and they were equally unhelpful in helping us work out alternative transportation. I was just happy to get out of there but as I\u2019ve said this was the WORST experience I ever had staying anywhere. The customer service was ridiculously bad and I have never met a worse run establishment in all my time travelling. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have stayed in places in a lot worse condition, but this place just STANK of bad manners. I don\u2019t usually write reviews but often use them when booking places, they are more often than not accurate on sites like this. When somewhere treats you this bad they don\u2019t deserve to be let off the hook.

The lady on the front desk was rather rude and didn't seem to care about anything.
