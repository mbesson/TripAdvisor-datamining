If I'm visiting for any other reason, I prefer a different property. The Good News - This 2-story property is within 15 minutes of Sea World, close to the older Sports Arena venue, and within 5 minutes of San Diego's Old Town. The rooms are generally clean, showers with tubs, Wireless Internet (separate charge), small refrigerators in the rooms, and during the day, parking is plentiful. There is coffee in the morning, but no breakfast. A Denny's Restaurant is immediatly across the driveway. I've stayed here for years, and again, for an inexpensive quick stay, I'd recommend the property. The (Not So Good) News - While others comment on plentiful parking, you might find the upper lot totally filled at night. There is underground parking, but I don't consider it safe to walk up to ground level if you're alone. This property does not always get the best clientele. Over the years, I've seen the Police there a few times. Less so in the last 2 years, however. The hotel is adjacent to a slightly unsavory area, and yes, there is a strip club and adult store around the corner (Mostly out of sight).

The one wierd thing is that they charge you for a deposit (20$ I guess...) and they transfer it back in 5-6 days...

That's THE upside. There are many downsides though. Upon checkin it was discovered that the AC/Heat was not functioning as it was actually like raining that day and a little chilly. The room phone also didn't work, I could hear the front desk but they could not hear me. After about three attempts I called on my cell phone. After the fellow sent up to fix it obviously couldn't, I requested and received another room. Thank gawd we hadn't yet unpacked. These rooms have like one tiny 2 ft long clothes hanging area (not really sufficient for two girls and three nites), 3 drawer TV/wardrobe combo and only 1 of those folding thingies to set your suitcase on, a super small bath counter with no space for anything (think $69.00 Home Depot vanity for your remodeled basement), and I had to set my suitcase on the top shelf of the hanging area unless I wanted to like live on the floor. We were literally using the top of the TV cabinet, the desk, the refrigerator and wutever had a top surface to place stuff. I'm talkin' just basic stuff here folks. Wut a so totally waste of space in a otherwise large room. The whole place is way past it's heyday and sorta tired and needs much TLC. It had a eewww factor of about 5. I noticed the second room had a newer AC/Heat unit as well as a few cosmetic upgrades. I always request the upper floor, it keeps the stomping elephants above, running drains and all other wutever if on lower floors at night at bay lol, so elevators are important. There is a almost empty underground parking area that is only accessible from the far back end of the property, the front entrance is gated and locked. However it did enable us to like park right next to the elevator as the other is handicapped. The only problem is it's on one end of the long building and not in the middle. Go figure? There are ice and soda machines in the center of the building on only the first 2 levels, but not the third one. Instead there are washers and dryers, I don't know why not a ice machine? Again, although in the middle still a long walk to the connecting stairs and down a floor for some ice. Maybe we just hit it wrong but the first nite (of three) there were a bunch of younger guys, like 15 total or wutever, a few who were very loud and partying, might have ended up at one of the strip clubs next door, ok one block away, and returned about 2:15 AM loud enough and shouting to wake us up. We complained the next day and maybe something was like mentioned to the group leader, it was considerably toned down the next night. The morning \"compliments\" consisted of lobby coffee and nothing else, which seemed strange as the Chula Vista property also offers orange juice as well as assorted muffins. It's a hard place to exit from onto Rosecrans St as I-8 dumps cars off the freeway still winding down from wut seems like 65-70 MPH making it hard to pull out in a slim lull and get out of the right turn lane only down the road to the signal light. Got a few horns and fingers, I just nicely waved back as they like cursed my Arizona plate I'm sure lol. The short of this though, if you don't mind the little extra distance like 10 freeway minutes south to Chula Vista, use THAT property. It's like a few bucks cheaper, has a MUCH nicer well kept atmosphere w landscaping, larger and nicer clothes storage and hanging areas, much larger bath counters for makeup and wutever and a pool as well as morning muffins, right off the E street exit and still no freeway noise.

The last thing was when we arrived late, there were no more front parking spaces and our high truck wouldn't fit in the garage, but the manager came out and was so friendly and awesome, and gave us VIP parking, well let us park in a great spot. Hope my review helps.

The place seemed a bit sketchy, strip clubs, \"adult arcades\" and sex shops are all right near it. Checking in was easy and the girl at the front desk, Ava, was sweet. Parking was odd, there was one car in the underground parking so we didn't know if we should park down there, and one side of the garage was locked. We parked in the regular lot and had to walk around to the backside for our room, whatever. Room was very basic, the bathroom was nothing great at all, very small, small shower, small counter, no blow dryer. Room smelled like bleach...which to me shows they clean, so I was okay with that. Sheets weren't disgusting, and the bed was decent. I'm really picky about beds and sheets and I slept just fine here. The curtains I hated, I feel like most hotel rooms have two sets of curtains, black out ones as well as ones that go all the way from one side to the other. This didn't, there were two panels that came together, so, there was a space between them. I had to try and overlap them to get privacy since I definetely could not get dressed in the too small bathroom. Besides minor things though, the room was okay, cable was appreciated and they had lots of menus for delivery. Checking out this morning was easy and the woman at the front desk mailed something for me.

It felt less like a name-brand motel and more like either a bad dorm room or a nice-ish prison cell -- take your pick.

We decided to save money by staying here this summer, and we immediately regretted that decision. First off, the room was never cleaned as there was dried food all over the AC unit and what seemed like dried, orange vomit on the floor next to the bed. The first night, as we pulled into the parking lot, we watched as a man escorted a prostitute into his room. Also, we were awakened at 2 a.m. by someone banging on our door, which thouroughly freaked us out. We also were frightened by the loud yelling and screaming from the room next to us. The next morning, we tried in vain to switch hotels, bu the agency we booked it through would not give us a refund. The second night, before going to bed, we discovered dried BLOOD on the bottom side of the comforter!! Being nursing students, we had seen plenty of blood before,a dn undoubtedly knew it was not a drink or any other liquid other than blood. Not only was it hidden since it was on the bottom side, it was right at the top, and the night before my friend had unknowingly covered her face with it! Since it was midnight, we took the bloody comforter to the front desk where the guy working there said he would hang onto it and told us to come back in the morning when the manager was there. At 7 the next morning, the first thing we did was go to the office to talk with the manager. Not only did she actually say that WE were the ones to bleed on the comforter, she proceeded to lie and say that she sent it to \"Eco Lab\" (which doesn't exist) to have it tested for blood when we asked to see the comforter to show her the stains. We argued with her for an hour, with her finally refusing to talk anymore and demanding us to leave. She was incredibly rude and never offered to do anything for us or even a simple \"I'm sorry\" at all. We then contacted our booking agency who were appalled to hear our story and assured us that they would contact the owner of the hotel about our dispute. We left sad that we had been treated so badly, and appalled at the conditions of the hotel. This is the most disgusting, horrid, and terrible place to stay at in San Diego.

Yes, the hotel is a little older, the carpeting isn't in the best shape, however - our room was kept very clean by the maid service, we received an abundant supply of towels upon request & there was no complaints from any of us about any odd smells or bugs as mentioned in other reviews. Although I must say that if we had seen a bug it wouldn't have surprised or horrified us - it's San Diego people - when you have perfect temps, high humidity, lots of flowers & an ocean close by you're bound to see a bug or two. The front desk help was always happy to answer our questions, give directions, recommend local restaurants, tell us about coupons & discounts to places we were headed & super friendly whenever we asked for more towels (my kids us a lot of towels lol.) I loved having the refrigerator in the room for the kids snacks & drinks & bottled water that we brought with us everywhere because it's a lot cheaper buying that stuff by the case then paying $3 a pop at some of the attractions. There's also a laundry area which we didn't think much of at first, but after 2 days of swimming in the ocean we were glad to have it so we could freshen up our beach wear & towles.

My husband, son and I just stayed here a week ago and for what we paid, this hotel exceeded our expectations! Sure, the guy at the front desk was a little greasy looking, and had tattoos, but he was super helpful and very friendly! There was also another girl working in the morning who was very nice! I've stayed at ritzy hotels with classy looking staff that just ended up being snobby, so I was quite happy here! There's a Denny's and a Jack in the Box right across the street. You get 10% off your bill at Denny's if you tell them you're staying here so that was a nice bonus. There's a big mall very close by that's definitely handy for picking up any necessities, or any food you might want to get. Although the area does seem a little shady (strip club near by) we felt very safe there. There is a train station about a 10 minute walk away which was also very handy! My only real complaint about this place was that yes, the walls were thin and we could hear the water running in the other rooms, but other than that it did the trick! I'm really shocked that for the very minimal price you pay for this hotel, people complain about the fact that the ground is stained from the a/c, or that there's a strip club around the corner! For what we paid, we were very happy and would definitely stay there again!", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cFor sleeping and showering only not kid friendly\u201d", "Author": "maliaismyname", "ReviewID": "UR19779235", "Content": "My family and I (me, hubs and 2 young boys) recently stayed in the good nite inn at seaworld.

Before stepping onto the elevator there was a huge puddle of liquid (lets hope it was water) that you had to walk through. Walked to our room which had a view of a kitchen appliance dealership and a junkyard. The ground of the hotel had so many stains from the antifreeze of the air conditioners. To our surprise the room was immaculately clean. The room was spaciious for all of us. The walls were pretty thin so we could hear our neighbors shower or sink on and off. No kid channels. Gets humid in the room. This hotel is approxiametly 15 minutes from sea world. No shuttles. They do have a excellent delivery service in the area.

Friday and Saturday night parking can be difficult as there are a lot of cars parked due to the adult entertainment complex just across the street, but no need to be alarmed.

Normally stayed with friends but this time we chose to stay @ a hotel. 2 mid 20's single guys, 1 room with 2 bed set up. We didn't occupy the rooms during the day much as we were busy with San Diego/Comic-con. Hotel advertised free wireless internet. I called about 2 weeks before our trip date to confirm that the wireless net was there and the woman I talked to reassured me that \"all rooms\" have wireless access. Reason I asked is we both own laptops with wireless network cards and at the time were deciding whether to bring them or not. We flew from Seattle, Wash. and carrying a laptop can be a cumbersome with airport security plus always that risk of it getting damaged or stolen during travel. We brought our laptops on our trip to find that the room we were assigned had no wireless connectivity. The room was on the ground floor near the main office/lobby area. I asked about it and was told that whoever I talked to was misinformed and that wireless internet access only could be obtained from the main lobby. My other complaint is the bathtub/shower I felt was abnormally small. I will not lie, my travel partner and I are big guys. 6'3 and 250-300 lbs. Showering was a huge hassle for us. Very narrow and cramped space. (no, we did not shower together XD ) Beds were comfy, pillows a bit flat. On the 3rd night of our 7 day stay we requested extra pillows and bath towels to deal with our water mess from showering, which we got from the main lobby. An old A/C unit was in the room and it worked great when we used it. We requested non-smoking room, unfortunately there was a slight stale odor of cigarette smoke to our room. I did leave a few dollar bills and some spare change that we accquired from using the Trolley on our table in the room during the stay and it never went missing. We did however keep our laptops out of plain sight and under lock and key in our lugguage when not occupying the room. Hotel is near a XXX strip club but that didnt bug us. It was pretty calm and quiet during the nights. Overall other than the shower/bathtub issue the hotel is not bad for the value.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mokuola", "Title": "\u201cClose to Sea World\u201d", "Author": "Mokuola", "ReviewID": "UR11637779", "Content": "The hotel was very conveniently near the I5 exit.
