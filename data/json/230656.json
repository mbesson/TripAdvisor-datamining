The metro (El Capricho) is not going directly to the airport. This hotel has got two big pros when you are travelling with a group or a family. First the rooms have a lounge with a big kitchen area without kitchen utensils. When you book a room for four persons, there is a big sofabed and another real bed in the lounge. The second pro is the reliable 24 hour airportshuttle for free. When you arrive at the airport, you first have to collect your suitcases and then you call the hotel. In our case the shuttle arrived in 10 minutes at the special hotel bus stop of the airport and went directly to the hotel ( a 5 minute ride). For guest who want to go from the hotel to the airport there is a shuttle bus every 30 minutes. This shuttle has to be reserved one day ahead. Next to the hotel are some bars and Tapas restaurants that serve rather expensive meals.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cFor Price it is ok, but don't expect anything nice\u201d", "Author": "marcus232", "ReviewID": "UR135196503", "Content": "I stayed here for 1 night and imo it was 1 night too long. At the same time it was really my fault bc I booked this hotel thinking it was closer to the city center, which it is not. Bad mistake because this hotel is right next to the airport so it is pretty far. If you are looking for a commuter hotel to the airport then it might not be bad. The room was spacious but felt dirty. The couch had these brown holes in it and was stained. The floor felt dirty too and I wound up wearing slippers all the time. The good thing is the wifi worked decently well, and the place is pretty spacious. I also only paid $58/night so it is definitely budget. Now, this place is great if you are a backpacker and want to stay in a private place with another person for the equivalent price of a hostel. Like i said before though, the hotel is far from Madrid city centre so it is not convenient for sightseeing.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johnson City, TN", "Title": "\u201cA good, clean hotel for the price.\u201d", "Author": "RustyJohnsonCity_TN", "ReviewID": "UR133524985", "Content": "I visited twice and found the hotel quiet, pleasant, clean and roomy.
