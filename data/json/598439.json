Our purpose was shopping and going to Silver Dollar City. We just needed a cheap, decent place to sleep and this place fits the bill. The staff was nice, the room was clean, the pool was clean and nice. The breakfast was minimal but we enjoyed walking across the street to have breakfast at Panera. There are decent restaurants right around here, and it's close to the outlet malls. I almost booked a much more expensive hotel that was right down the street, and was so glad I didn't. This is a good, safe, quiet area. The only downside was there was no exercise room but since we were only there for a quick trip it was okay.

We love the Green Gables Inn! The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating! The rooms were a great size with plenty of room and very clean. The inn is located just off the strip, so battling traffic was not an issue! Another plus of the Green Gables Inn was the pool. The kids absolutely enjoyed swimming!

We had a wonderful experience with Grace, her family and the cleaning staff there. Grace and her husband went out of their way to make us feel at home, they were so helpful and friendly, it made us feel like we had known them for years. The lense fell out of my husband's glasses and we thought our day was ruined, but Graces' husband was very gracious about me calling him so early in the morning and helped us find a place where we could have his glasses checked and repaired and we were back on track with our day without missing a beat. Our room was exceptionally clean and the beds so comfortable that we both slept wonderfully, something we don't usually do in a motel room. Our room was clean and fresh every afternoon when we returned from our day. Norma did a wonderful job !

There is a great coffee shop across the street and eating places and minature golf within walking distance. It is an inexpensive way to see Branson on a Budget and still have money to have fun. The rooms are larger than most motels, due to the fact that this is an older property, there is a pool, that is outdoor, but we have used it. The staff is right there on property and the owners know us by name. They have several repeat clients. We are one of them. My kids love the bigger room and the quick breakfast in the morning.
