This is a great place for large families not wanting to break the budget. The price is very affordable for similar lodging near Branson. It is conveniently located next to Silver Dollar City so if you are looking for something within walking distance to the shows in Branson you would need to stay somewhere else. The outdoor pool was very nice and clean. We stayed in a 2 bedroom A-Frame cabin. The beds were nice and comfy. The kitchen is very small that is one complaint that I have. It has a mini fridge and an apartment size stove. Very little counter space as well. If you are planning on cooking every day I would recommend spending a little more for one of the newer Chalet's they offer. The owner's were extremely nice and very accommodating. They allowed us an early check-in, gave extra towels and pillows, and even offered an extended check-out. They went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay.

This resort was acceptable but i just wasn't wowed in any sense. We stayed 3 nights in the newer chalets. The appearance was nice and overall it was a good size for the 6 of us. I wouldn't say the kitchen is 'fully stocked' as advertised. Some of the items were just unusable they were so cheap. Luckily we had brought a huge skillet from home or cooking breakfast just wouldn't have happened with their tiny pan and flimsy cookware. Coffee pot took forever to make coffee and the dishwasher was super super loud. Our bed was terribly uncomfortable. I had to sleep with my son the last night, his was much better. Overall, I think they cut to many corners while constructing and stocking these units and it showed. The owners were very nice & helpful. The pool was nicely kept as were the grounds. Everything is just very tight in the resort. We had issues with 2 cars getting in/out of the parking spots allotted. One of the neighbors had a very large truck making it more difficult. One walk to the dock and you learn quick...the walk back up is extremely steep! The dock itself was nice but we didn't use it as much as we would've liked because of the walk back.

Very up to date with the A frame cabin we had and the new 3 bedroom chalets are awesome looking! We had one in the middle of the area so wasn't too far from the pool. Quite a walk down to the lake, when we went to the dock we usually drove, as the hill back up was not much fun to walk after a day on the lake. No complaints though, the dock was quite clean and the swim area was perfect for the kids (and us) to play in the lake with (ladder to get back up was a wonderful thing!). We spent 7 nights there and the cabin did not have a lot of room for 5 during the day (one futon and a kitchen table) but sleeping was perfect. Two beds upstairs in the loft were great for the kids. Only one thing I wish is that it had a full size shower, those small square ones get to be a hassle if you are trying to shave your legs for a week. Also keep in mind that the A frames only have small refrigerators, so pack accordingly. Parking is at a prime and sometimes tough to get through the road, specially with a boat/trailer on the back of your truck, people park along the sides and make it very difficult to travel the road when you have it loaded. Boat ramp was not too bad but coming out we decided to go to the State Marina down the road on Indian Point to put on the truck, worked out great and we will do that on/off from now on and just drive the boat to the resort!

He accused my family of breaking a board in one of the futons. I didn't really know what to say. We did have 3 young kids with us, but they were never alone in the living room to jump on the futons, there was a 13 year old and 8 adults in the house also. The young kids were never alone to damage things. The first mornng we were there, my father-in-law was putting the futon bed back into a couch I remember him saying \"this thing is broke under here\". We were all rushing around trying to get ready and out the door so no one did anything about it. Now looking back we really wish we would have went straight to the office that moment. I honestly didn't think of it again after that. One thing I know for a 100% fact is the futon was only sat on and then slept on by one adult, there is no way that we broke it. Now after I got this call from the rude man I called my father-in-law for more details. He said the board had a big crack in it not broke in half. So maybe it did break while we were there. The owner doesn't seem to understand things break from normal wear and tear. I can understand how there could be a issue of how it happened and so on. I'm a honest person, if we broke there furniture I would have told them right away and took care of it. I think this man KNEW that board was cracked decided not to repair or replace it and instead wait for it to give out, we just happen to be the unlucky ones in the cabin when it happened. The reason I think this rude man is not a honest man, is that on top of him talking to me like I was a criminal trying to get away with breaking something, he said we left the cabin trashed...WHAT????????? I was in shock, I was never informed we were to clean the cabin for the next guest staying in it??? We bagged up all trash, and washed the dishes?? There wasn't stuff laying all over?? It did rain most of our stay there, so maybe the floor got a little more outside stuff on it then normal, also we did have 12 people, that we paid the extra money for???? I mean really...what more did he want us to do?? We are paying to stay there, are we expected to do there job for them and vacume, scrub the toilest, etc..?? Did he want us to do the laundry as well?? I told him we DID NOT leave it trashed, he said \"well your idea of clean must be different then ours\" in a very condescending tone. I told him \"no I guess not,since the house smelled like a stale old house when we opened the door\". We had to get candles and fabreeze to make it bearable in there. He informed me he would be charging my credit card for the futon to get repaired. I told him I needed to speak to all the people in the house before I agreed to anything. He just kept saying \"oh no\" like I was not going to get out of it. I am sorry for this long story, I am pretty annoyed by it, it just happened yesterday and still fresh. At this moment I haven't heard back from the Alpine Lodge. I did call my father after the rude man called me. I asked him to call the Alpine Lodge and talk to them about what he saw with the futon. He did call but spoke with a women, she said the man was down at the cabin dealing with the futon. She didn't know anything about the cabin or futon, so it didn't help much that she was the one to speak with my father-in-law. So that its so far. I would've stayed at the Alpine Lodge again, due to its old charm, affordable prices and pretty setting, but none of that wins over being treated like a liar and told you left the place trashed. I will NEVER stay there again and will NEVER send anyone there.

While the staff were very nice and helpful, we were not impressed with the cabins at all. They were dark inside, not much lighting, and limited electrical outlets. The elec outlet in the bathroom is totally useless, as there is a mirror below it that blocks it. The TV was above the kitchen table, which made it hard to talk to each other if someone wanted to watch it. The area was secluded, which would be nice, but it was a long drive into town. The website says it's 5 miles, but maybe as the crow flies, but not with those long, winding Branson roads. We got lost the first night and it took us FOREVER to find the place (when we first arrived). The cabins are very old and outdated. The kitchens are not much, no cabinet space and no fridge space. Nowhere to set anything down. It would be almost impossible to cook anything in there. And if you did, you would not have room in the fridge to put leftovers. And don't get me started on the stairs in there. I'm surprised there hasn't been a lawsuit yet. The stairs are very steep and narrow, inside the cabin, and NO HAND RAILS at all. I can't believe no one hasn't fallen and hurt themselves really bad. When you get up to the loft area, where there are two beds, the banister is loose. My sisters said those two beds were VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. It was a hassle, driving in and out of that place. Unless you want to go to Silver Dollar City only, and not the strip, I wouldn't stay there. We won't be staying there again, for sure. For SDC access, it would be great, but we were not interested in SDC. And, I almost forgot the bathroom. YIKES. The shower is so small, you have to be a barbie doll to use it. The people in my family are all big people. If you are over 200 lbs, DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE!! You will not be able to take a comfortable shower. No place to put your shampoo, and if you put it on the floor and bend down to get it, you will hit your head on the water knobs. It was AWFUL. I wll be so happy to use my own shower today!! There was also no cabinet space in there. A few people could put a few things there, but for the most part, it was just a sink, that's it. No cabinets. And the fact that there was only one bathroom and it was in the bedroom where my husband and I were, people were coming in and out a lot. That wasn't a big deal since they were adults and were quiet, except it just would have been nicer for the people upstairs if they didn't have to treck downstairs to go in the middle of the night.
