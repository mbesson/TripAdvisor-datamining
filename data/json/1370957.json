The staff is amazingly friendly, the concierge's are sooo helpful with daily itineraries for winery visits, and the location is picture perfect. Downtown Napa is a posh small city with amazing restaurants, tasting rooms, and shopping. You are located right next to both highway 29 and the silverado trail, and very close to Sonoma and The Carneros region. We wanted to split our trip up by spending a few nights in downtown Napa, and a few nights out in \"the middle of nowhere\" with views of the mountains and wineries. I will definately be coming back here. The rooms are gorgeous and big, the breakfast is fantastic, the complimentary tastings from local wine reps on Friday and Saturday Nights are a great touch, and best of all the rates are sooo affordable. If you have AAA, acquire about a AAA rate which lowers your rate and gives you $40 per day towards breakfast! Wineries Visited (Look these up, they are unreal): Domaine Carneros (Amazing courtyard views and champagne) Artesa (Best views in all of Napa) Michael Mondavi (Great Spellbound Chardonnay) Robert Mondavi (Great tour for first timers) Cline (Wonderful Desert wine with Chocolate Pairing) Jacuzzi (Free Tasting, unreal variety) V. Sattui (Great wines and great lunch spot) Alpha Omega (Favorite Red Wines in all of Napa!) Castello Di Amoroso (You need to see this to believe it, its a castle and 2/3 underground!!

After the 2nd time (at 4:15 pm) they offered us a complimentary drink at the bar but it still meant we had the use of a very expensive hotel for less than 18 hours. The room we were given, 226, was extremely small with an uncomfy bed, wafer thin pillows, & two small uncomfy chairs. They also put a premium on the \"tub\" rooms, which means you only have an oversized \"rain\" shower in most other rooms but no ability to soak. (Pay for the upgrade if available; they told us they were sold out.) With no hotel pool or spa, they have comp arrangements with the health club next door but that seemed very crowded with community members.

The staff seemed to really go out of their way - the front desk, the bartender (Hunter rocked!), bellmen, etc. They also had free wine tasting that Friday and Saturday night we stayed there which was neat. A few words of caution. We had breakfast that Saturday morning at the hotel restaurant. The food was really good and not overly priced but the service was VERY slow and it took FOREVER (I would say about 30 min from the time we ordered to when it was served). They did come an apologize and the charge was never applied to our room. The other caution I have is DO NOT get a room facing First Street. We had a room on the 2nd floor on the corner of First and more like an alley street (room 234). At 6:30 am Saturday the recycling truck woke us up and we could hear people coming in from a late night out.

It was my birthday so I decided to spoil myself with the Lux Tub Suite. I highly recommend this room. The hotel has a very modern feel and the rooms are decorated beautifully. I loved the wall color and hardwood floors. We also had a great view of downtown Napa. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a spacious living area with a comfortable couch and chair, a flat screen TV, and a mini-bar stocked with snacks, drinks, wine glasses, and cork screw. The top shelf in the fridge is open for guest use, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up anything on the bottom shelves unless you want to pay for it. The bedroom area has a comfy bed, a second flat screen TV, desk, and bathtub. Yes, the bathtub is in the bedroom but trust me it makes perfect sense. Connecting both the living area and bedroom is a fireplace that makes the room nice and toasty (why bother with the heater?). When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the giant bathtub, you can watch the fireplace and spend the night relaxing. The bathroom has two sinks and an enormous shower with two shower heads. The bath products are great and the shower is wonderful. There is a restaurant downstairs that serves breakfast. While we had a great meal, it was a little pricey for breakfast items. My only complaints are similar to the AVIA in Savannah. The front desk employee we had was accommodating by letting us check in early but was also a little short. The concierge, while nice, I think was judging us a little bit. Yes, we are a younger couple and probably don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like we come from money like other guests in Napa, but being in sales I know that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really mean much. All the restaurants she suggested had entrees priced at less than $15 a person and I was hoping to have a really nice meal for my birthday. Also, all the wineries she suggested were giant and where all the tour busses drop off thousands of people a day. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrong. Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what most of the guests are looking for and she suggests them to everyone. Also, if you make a reservation with a particular discount code and need to change your reservation, make sure the same discount code is applied to your new reservation. I had originally had a AAA rate with free breakfast but needed to change the date of our stay. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to change your reservation online, but they had given me the AAA rate without the breakfast. When I went to check in, I asked about our free breakfast and was informed that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t qualify. After checking my reservations later (the original and the changed date), I saw that the discount code had been changed. Overall, this is a beautiful hotel right in downtown Napa and within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. Treat yourself right with a Lux Tub Suite. Free Wi-Fi and parking, valet extra.

The price was quite reasonable for the Napa area, and I LOVED the modern style of the hotel. This hotel had just recently been acquired by Hyatt, previously the name was just \"Avia Napa.\" Even though this hotel was now technically a Hyatt hotel, we didn't really feel like we were staying in a chain hotel. The hotel still retained a lot of its \"boutique\" feel which we liked. The hotel is located in downtown Napa. We have been to Napa a number of times, but surprisingly haven't been to this area of town. The hotel is on a quiet street area, across shops and restaurants. It was nice to be able to walk around and check out downtown Napa from our hotel. One thing to note, we thought that the parking was valet only ($15/night). We had a lot of luggage for our stay :p so decided to valet. On the second day did we realize that we could have actually self parked at the parking garage in the back for free. We booked the hotel via hotels.com and after reading many reviews on Trip Advisor, we splurged and booked the Master Tub Suite. The Master Tub Suite had a separate living room area, as well as a HUGE tub. :) The room was quite spacious, and there were actually 2 flat screen TVs (one in the living room and another one in the bedroom). The bedroom area was beautiful! There was a HUGE tub to the side of the room, which was very unique and so lovely! The tub was GIGANTIC! If we ever build our own house, I would want a tub like that! The bathroom area was also really spacious, with a separate shower area and dual his/her sinks. There wasn't a swimming pool in this hotel, which I thought was a little surprising. But we didn't mind since we only stayed for one night. Their evening turndown service was a nice touch, which included 2 free bottled waters and mini chocolates. The hotel also provided free drinks/appetizers in the lobby area from 5:30-7:00 PM nightly as well as free chair massages. How awesome is that? Unfortunately, we were not able to participate since we had early dinner reservations at 5:30 PM.

We stayed in one of the deluxe king suites I believe it was called and it was perfect, lots of room with very modern attributes which I loved. The hotel has several dining rooms and and outdoor veranda which is amazing in the evening. Some of the things I loved about the hotel was how many events and little things they had going on while we were there. We attended a radio hosted part on the outdoor landing and met some great people. The staff was extremely friendly, there was always someone new to chat with. Finally, my favorite service the hotel offered was a concierge. I don't think they have the company through the hotel, but the fact that the hotel has that available is amazing!!! With the wedding planning, the honeymoon wasn't very high on the priority list, my husband and I just wanted to relax. The concierge Julia met with us a few times and really got to know us in order to make great recommendations. She also shared with us several cards that gave free wine tastings or other benefits.

The staff is very friendly and especially the bartenders. They allowed us to enjoy some of our own wine that we had purchased in Napa and also had great knowledge of wines they were serving at the bar -- advised us or suggested some great wines when we were ordering some early afternoon glasses of wine.

For the price paid, this is definitely not somewhere I would recommend. I'll start with the pros: The hotel has free parking in the garage behind the street and is within walking distance to restaurants. In addition, the staff was really nice. They did do everything they could to make the stay pleasant. Here are the cons: We reserved a Lux Suite Balcony room (Room 317). I was really looking forward to having a room with a balcony. Unfortunately, our balcony suite overlooked the concrete wall of a parking garage. It was definitely not worth the extra money that I paid. I have no idea why this hotel would sell balcony rooms with no view. The room itself was a good size, but getting a little worn (couch had pulls in it). No bathrobes in the room, we had to call down to get some stocked. I'm not sure how those could be missed as part of a room cleaning and preparation, but they were. In fact, for 2 nights we didn't have them. But the worst part of the room was the horrible sewerage smell in the bathroom. It got worse at certain times of the day, but it was really awful. I mentioned this to the front desk on my second day, but nothing changed, nor did anyone provide me with any feedback that they had looked into it. The restaurant had a great breakfast, but the service was really slow. This was a management issue, I cannot blame the servers for this. They were understaffed, and could not get keep up with the demand. It took 10 minutes just to seat us for breakfast. There were lots of open tables, just no one to set them. It then took 10 minutes to just get coffee. Just a really bad experience overall. When I checked out I was asked how my stay was. When I explained the above, the gentleman at the front desk wrote everything down and was extremely nice, and asked if it was okay if his Manager emailed me. I told him that I would be more than happy to discuss this with the Manager. No email was sent. As I said before, I see this hotel as having a Management issue. This just confirms that. The Avia is trying to be an upscale hotel, and certainly charges the prices, but falls short on many aspects. There are better values in Napa.

Maybe mine are too high?\u201d", "Author": "msblueyz", "ReviewID": "UR118946573", "Content": "We were very excited to stay at the newly branded Hyatt Avia in Napa. Based on the pictures on the Hyatt and former Avia web sites, along with numerous Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews, we thought we were making a great choice of accommodation in Napa. My husband is a Hyatt Diamond Passport so our expectations are always high. I had called the hotel manager about a week before the conversion to Hyatt (September 1st was their \"live\" date) asking if we could book using our Diamond suite upgrade awards for two nights and pay for the rest. She was very accommodating in obtaining a suite for us during high season. Check in was smooth although the front desk is not quite Hyatt-savvy. The front desk agent was very kind, but really neglected to give us the dog and pony show to which we have become accustomed, especially when it is our first stay at a particular property. Although the manager was helpful with making the reservation, I really believed that as Diamond Passport, they would have pulled out all the stops for us. Not! Not even a welcome letter in our suite! The front desk agent said we have already blocked you a great room! Ha! We were given the lowest level of suite (a lux suite) with a view of the parking lot behind the property! It was also right next to the elevators! It would have been an insult to any Hyatt Diamond. It is important to note that this property is not a view property and a \"premium\" view would be overlooking First Street in downtown Napa, and maybe, it might have a balcony . . . Ours didn't. Fortunately for us, we didn't need a view or a balcony, but for those who want to have accommodations that overlook the vineyards, gardens or even a pool or water feature, this is not the place for you! On the positive side, the property has a lovely patio area with fire pits where you can order your wine or BYOB and enjoy the crisp air in the evenings and relax after a long day of wine tasting. The hotel also offers some wine tasting events in the evening, a plus if you want even more wine. Service was good, but not great. The concierge was definitely on her game when she was able to get us a much-coveted appointment at Pride Vineyards! I would definitely rely on their concierges for any and all information you might need. There was otherwise very little in personal attention for this boutique hotel. Our suite was sweet, but nothing about which I could rave as others have previously done in their reviews. The bathroom does have a quasi walk-in shower with a rain shower head, but unless you tilt it towards the wall, all the water overflows onto the bathroom floor. You don't even realize it until you step out into a huge puddle! In our bathroom, the toilet faced the windows, so if the drapes were open and you forgot to close the sliding bathroom door, the entire parking lot can see you squat! In addition, the web site shows a lux suite with double sinks, but in ours, there was only one! Breakfast service is very slow. We waited ten minutes for our server to offer us coffee. The weekend buffet is, however, lovely with lots of options including yummy hot items and an egg and omelet station. The applewood smoked bacon and chicken apple sausage are delish! The location is perfect for exploring downtown Napa which has had a massive revitalization since our last visit over six years ago. You can walk to great markets, eclectic shops, wine tasting stores and fabulous four-star restaurants. I think that is the Hyatt Avia's strongest selling point since it definitely does NOT have any of the following amenities that one associates with the typical wine country experience. Nothing near the quaintness and personality of a bed and breakfast or small inn. No luxurious grounds to meander. No spa, although they do have privileges with the fitness center next door. No pool. No hot tub. For $400 per night (that is what we paid for a SUNDAY night stay), I think you can get a lot more bang for your buck in Napa Valley. We were so enamored by the fact that Hyatt finally had a property in the Napa Valley (they have a Hyatt in Santa Rosa which is too far from the main attractions) that I forgot to do my homework! When we returned home, I looked up some of the rates and amenities of comparable properties, like the Westin Napa, and found the rates very similar for the last weekend in October, and the Westin has its own fitness facility, outdoor pool and spa. Are we too spoiled? I think not, given that we stay pretty much exclusively at Hyatt unless there isn't a convenient location. We have expect a certain level of bend over backward-ness as Hyatt Diamond guests. In conclusion, I would by no means discount the Hyatt Avia as a contender when deciding on a property in the Napa area of the Wine Country, but I would seriously consider what amenities are offered before I plunked down my credit card guarantee!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cexcellent in many ways\u201d", "Author": "BN712", "ReviewID": "UR118626782", "Content": "Here are a few ways in which Avia Napa met and exceeded my expectations: *Room was very well appointed and clean.

It's in a great location in downtown Napa within walking distance of good restaurants, shops and lots and lots of wine tasting rooms.

The front desk, restaurant and bar staff were all very good, but the valet and bell staff was not so great. They brought the wrong car around twice and were very slow regardless of how busy they were (or weren't!), and some of them were not very pleasant. I'd recommend using the free self-parking instead of valet. We just used valet for convenience but it didn't really pay off. Our room was 321, which was close to the elevator and I had concerns, but we didn't hear any noise from that. The room was a master tub suite, with modern decor, and a separate sitting room from the bedroom. It was clean and nicely appointed. Both the bedroom and sitting room had televisions. Loved the giant bath tub, which is actually in the suite, next to the bathroom, not in it. The large, open-style shower has an overhead raindrop and a regular wall spray.The only reason I'd steer clear of this particular room is that it was right over the outside patio area and people hung out there and were kind of loud. They also have live music but it was over early enough not to interfere with trying to sleep. We had breakfast in the restaurant twice. The regular menu was fine and reasonably priced. The weekend buffet, however, was not great and they didn't replenish the fruit. The buffet is the only choice on the weekend. We stopped at the bar for some wine (go figure) flights and the bartender was very personable and knowledgeable about what he was serving. There's no gym in the hotel, but they provide you with complementary access to the ExerTec which is right next door, so it's like having a gym in the hotel anyway.

My boyfriend (now fianc\u00c3\u00a9) told the hotel he was going to propose that weekend so they set up reservations in advance for us to top notch restaurants (Redd, Mustard) and wine tastings. Even though the hotel was at full capacity they put us in one of the best rooms/best views in hotel ahead of time. They also sent a bottle of Chandon champagne to our room to toast to our engagement. The concierge ladies (Jenny and Pamela) were wonderful! They went above and beyond to make our stay special. Even the hotel staff were extremely helpful and had excellent service. We stayed in the king master tub balcony suite overlooking First Street. The room was top notch from the comfy bed to the dual sided flat panel tvs and fireplace to the giant terrace balcony. Very clean, very spacious. You also get free gym passes which is next to the hotel and has plenty of treadmills, weights, and cardio-even classes along with a sauna, steam room, etc. The breakfast buffet wasn't cheap ($17/person plus tip) but was well worth it. The food quality was excellent and the spread of food was great. There are fireplaces throughout the hotel which was great on a cool night. The only negative I can think of is no hot tub or pool. The fire pits and cabannas were cool but there were so many people out there it was hard to enjoy a quiet moment. Glad we got the room with a balcony. The price was $399/night during the weekend and $309 Monday. That isn't bad at all for a 4 diamond AAA hotel on a holiday weekend in Napa. The location was perfect and there were a ton of great restaurants, nightlife, and shops on our street and a 10 minute walk from Oxbow Market. The wineries are very close driving distance. I wouldn't stay anywhere else as that part of Napa has so much to do and is new and nice. Also I can't imagine any hotel or inn being as spacious and new as Avia so I wouldn't risk staying elsewhere. However, Hyatt did just buy Avia so perhaps in the future there could be changes so we'll see.

It is a centralized downtown location and walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The self parking is not too bad but behind the hotel on the 3rd and 4th floors. The lobby is nice and modern. We did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food. Our room was 208 and it was really great. The bathroom has a rain shower along with hand shower, a sitting area in the shower, and double sinks. The amenities are very nice. The room had a very comfortable king bed, a chair with desk next to it, a large sitting chair, and a bench beneath the 42\" LCD TV. There was a nice mini bar that was electronically sensored, and an area for personal items. The coffee service was PODS and there was nightly water with turndown service. The real highlight of the room was the balcony. It was approx. 500 sq. ft. and came with 2 chaise loungers and a table for 4. It was very nice to enjoy a bottle of wine before dinner and enjoy the nice mild weather. I was very satisfied with the room. As I checked out, there was a discrepancy with the bill as I was charged for parking. I spoke to her about the pending change and she was informative. Please to not take these a concrete things because it was one host. -It will be branded a Hyatt September 1st -She did not know which brand of Hyatt (my guess would be Andaz) -I made the comment it could not be a Park Hyatt due to lack of high end restaurant.

We went back at 5p.m. and checked in. The room was nice and good location, however two of the drawers had bunch of hairs in them that was not cleaned. The next day the room service did not clean our room until 4 p.m. We tried the hotel restaurant and it was fine, the hostess was very nice. The bell boys were 10 times more polite and attentive than the front desk people. We had to ask the front desk some questions and boy they are dry.

I called them 5 times including leaving a message at the Accounting Dep. but no one got back to me.

I had fax them the invoice they gave me at the checkout but they did not credit the difference that was a mistake by their side and not even the minibar charges which it was totally wrong too.

The lobby is very nice, the rooms are great, aesthetically, it is a very pleasing hotel. The location is also an added bonus as you can walk to top quality restaurants near by. The hotel comes with several flaws though: 1) The dining options are sub-par. The menu is very limited and the room service menu is even more limited. I went to dinner at the restaurant and there were two entrees! What kind of restaurant has only two entrees?? Also, it was completely vacant at 8pm, there was one couple in the entire restaurant which was a big turn off. Fortunately, there are great dining options nearby since Avia's don't quite cut it. 2) No pool. There is an indoor pool at the free gym next door but no pool to dip your toe into after a long day of wine tasting. Kind of a bummer. 3) The staff while very nice is in desperate need of training. I was told contradictory things on multiple occasions. Someone said there would be live music, but when I got to the patio, I found out it wasn't happening. I'd ask for nearby breakfast places and got contradictory responses. Worst, I asked for my car to be ready and they just forgot about my request and I had to wait 15 minutes which was a huge pain considering that we had a flight to catch. 4) They are doing construction and room upgrades during the weekend. I don't want to see people moving furniture in the hotel and using a passenger elevator as a freight elevator - super tacky! Do this during off peak times. So while I think Avia has great potential, it really needs improvement on the service and dining side for me to consider staying there again. I'd give it 3.5 starts.

I would call these room accommodations a 3.5 to 4 star quality. Above average but not great. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, however they seemed to lack training. One morning I sat at the coffee bar in the lobby where someone was supposed to be making latte's etc. There was a machine and all the evidence of a coffee bar but no one to service it. We ate breakfast at the hotel once and it was just a bit unorganized, from being seated to being waited on and getting coffee refills it just wasn't a smooth process. Hyatt has purchased this small chain of hotels and my feeling is that they will train the staff which will take this hotel up to a 4 and even 5 star facility. Like I said, it has potential. The terrace bar is beautiful, but it only serves wine and beer as does the bar in the lobby. So if you want a mixed drink you have to find someplace else.

The hotel is well-situated and relatively new, and our Master Tub Suite was spacious and comfortable (spoiled just a little by a sorry view of the rear of the neighbouring Safeway supermarket.). The valet parking staff and porters were personable and helpful, offering useful tips for eating and drinking nearby (big thanks to the young man who recommended Morimoto for our evening meal - it was wonderful.). But from there it all seemed to go inexplicably downhill. We'd both arranged to get massages (after three weeks driving around in a cramped convertible we were more than ready for these) and had enlisted the help of the 'concierge service' here. Inexplicably, the duty concierge subsequently took it upon herself to cancel one of our massages, meaning that another had to be arranged at very short notice, for a later time. This knocked our whole evening out of sync, and rendered the 'relaxation' element of the enterprise somewhat redundant. We had also asked for some help in arranging a tour of the Frog's Leap Winery, which we were very keen to visit, but were told by the same concierge that this would not be possible. She did not offer any alternatives, though we had asked for some (by email, prior to our arrival) if Frog's Leap turned out to be full, so more time was wasted as we sorted out some visits under our own steam, the last of which turned out to be...Frog's Leap, who kindly fitted us in on the last tasting of the day - which begged the question of how hard the concierge had actually tried in the first place. Most of the staff were, to be fair, perfectly pleasant and helpful, though at breakfast there seemed to be a discrepancy between the vast numbers of waiters buzzing around and the actual service being delivered - we had to ask for coffee three times! The receptionist allocating tables at breakfast also struck a discordant note, with a somewhat disdainful manner that jarred. Eye contact costs nothing, Miss! One further detail that disappointed was that free internet wireless connection is only available in-room for a limited time - after that you have to pay, or use a public computer on the first floor. This is particularly mean-spirited in a hotel so visibly aiming to provide a 'high end' experience. We did feed back our comments directly to the hotel, and received an emailed assurance that our disappointments were taken most seriously and would be investigated, but that was the last we heard, back in May. Hopefully, staff training has been tightened up a little and the concierge service given something of an overhaul...but I guess we'll never know. My feeling is that next time we're in that part of California, we'll head straight for Sonoma and stay there instead.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "btran321", "ReviewID": "UR115048645", "Content": "Great Hotel with awesom fire pits on the back deck.

I'm not sure whether or not we got an unusually good rate for our mid-week stay but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how posh this hotel was for what I would consider to be a very reasonable rate compared to everything else we looked at in Napa/Yountsville. The room: We opted to upgrade to the Master Tub Suite for $20 more/night and it was totally worth it! The suite had a two-sided fireplace that separated two distinct spaces for living/sleeping. Both sides of the fireplace also featured a large flatscreen TV above it. I also took advantage of the HUGE soaking tub which sits just outside the bathroom (where the equally huge shower, vanity and toilet reside) so you can actually sit in the soaking tub and either watch TV or enjoy the fireplace. There is a curtain you can close around the tub but if you were looking for privacy from the rest of the suite, the semi-transparent curtain won't deliver. Hotel overall: The hotel overall was also very hip/modern. We didn't eat at any of the onsite restaurants so I can't comment on those but we were a little disappointed to find out upon check-in that the advertised \"free wine tastings every evening\" didn't apply Sunday-Wednesday. The other thing that we noticed was (as another reviewer noted) it seemed that the hotel was lacking in staff in some areas. For example, we attempted to visit the 2nd floor veranda/fire pit bar but there was nobody tending to the bar and yet there were dirty dishes/wine glasses everywhere. We actually went back out the next morning and the dishes were still unattended to which was unfortunate because it certainly didn't make you want to sit down and enjoy it. The other two things to be aware of with this hotel are that 1.) there isn't a pool and 2.) there isn't an on-site fitness facility (you can, however visit the gym nearby for free.) Again, not the end of the world for us but I was a bit surprised that a hotel that has so much else to offer would not offer such basic amenities. Location: The location of the hotel was great-- very central to Napa and within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, the wine train, etc. Be aware that Napa itself is transitioning a bit so although it seems very safe it's not (yet) as much of an up-scale yuppie of a town as Yountsville, for example. Having said that, there are lots of very upscale shops/restaurants especially along the riverfront if that's what you're looking for. But if you're like us you might appreciate that because it's not quite as up-scale of a town there are lots more reasonably priced restaurants to choose from within walking distance. Our favorite place that we visited was the Oxbow Public Market. You simply MUST check this place out if you visit Napa... a great place to grab breakfast/lunch. Also check out ZuZu for dinner (tapas)... delish! Overall Experience: Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Avia so although I debated between giving it 4 or 5 stars ultimately I came back to value for the money and (assuming it stays reasonably priced) I wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, best location, needs more staff\u201d", "Author": "RoadO", "ReviewID": "UR114838380", "Content": "I and my family stayed at napa for two nights.

There is a local shopping center right next to the hotel and great wine tasting bars across the street.The staff was really friendly. We got a free coupon to the mumm vineyard which saved us a cost of one person's admission fee. One thing I think AVIA should improve is the front desk staff. There is Always one staff super busy with phone and customers. Everytime I called for service they made me wait forever. We had valid parking service. But we had to tell the car staff to get our car by ourself because the front desk never got time to let the car peile know. I don't know what's the point that's the hotel asks us to dial for car since they never have our car ready. Everytime we wait and when I asked the car staff if our car is coming soon, he told me he was never told by anyone to get any cars. I don't think such service worth $15 a day. There is a free public parking very close to the hotel. You can unload your luggage in front of the hotel and park somewhere else free. Speaking about the front desk, they always say they will send someone up right away but you can never expect them to come within twenty minutes. There is one time that they didn't come at all.

Although the main reason I am writing is because they charged my card $300.00. When I called a week later to ask why they claimed I had been smoking in my room. I then asked to speak to a manager and when she was unavailable I left a message. They never called back, and I called them about 6 more times over the course of the week. I never could get a hold of the manager and the people I did speak with told me they would leave a message. The only thing I was told was that the Engineer had proof (which is absurd seeing as I didn't smoke in my room). I did have one of the rooms with a balcony which I did use to smoke and i'm assuming someone saw me and complained. Anyways they said they had to speak with the Engineer and of course they never called me back. If they really had any proof I'm sure they would have called me back, but I was very surprised at the lack of resolve they had to do anything at all.

The bed was amazing. It was similar material to the Posturepedic, but made by Simmons (I had to check the tag!). Interesting, since I may have never considered buying a Posturepedic-type bed before this trip. It was incredibly comfortable. Since this was Napa, we didn't spend much time in the room.

If your visiting Napa, you can expect to pay at least $200 a night for the worst rooms in town. At $300 for the suite, we got a smokin deal! Avia's rooms are priced at the bottom of the scale for Napa, but the quality of the hotel is leaps and bounds above the competition. Location: If your not into the bed and breakfast in a vineyard experience here in the valley, the downtown setting might be more to your liking. Its centrally located in downtown Napa in walking distance to shopping and a plethora of awesome restaurants to fit all budgets. Try Cole's Chophouse if you want steak, its omg good! The Service: Valet, great service, but fair warning. As other reviewers have complained about, they do not inform you $15.00 charge. There is no sign and the the valet did not inform us of a charge. The front desk clerk asked us if we used the valet but ALSO did not mention the charge. The doormen were polite and on the doors when they should be. Front desk were knowledgeable about the area and efficient in their jobs. Plus, they hooked us up on the room big time! Seriously, always ask how much to upgrade when you check into a hotel! we've got some great deals that way. The Hotel/Room: Modern decor, innovative design, like new appearance. Very clean and well kept. The Vintners Suite is the best room at the hotel. 1000 sq ft, well designed, and well appointed with the exception of the lack of microwave. C'mon, really? Its got a 10' wet bar there...but no microwave? And what ever you do, dont even TOUCH any of the items in the wetbar unless you want the charge to show up on your room bill.

The suite is just as it appears on the website. The bathroom is very nice, the bed is very comfortable and the fire place does a nice job heating up the room. We were on the fourth floor in a quiet room (one window looked into a wall, the other overlooked the hotel's terrace area). It is a shame the weather wasn't great because it would have been nice to take advantage of the terrace, which looks beautiful. We had no issues whatsoever with housekeeping, our room was clean and every day we had enough towels, soap etc etc. We had room service (hamburgers and fries) the first night there and we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The next morning we had the buffet breakfast, which was also very good. Our waiter was extremely attentive, as was the lady custom making our omelettes. Other hotels would charge much more than the $17.00 (or so) that the AVIA charged for the buffet. Check in and check out was a smooth process. The only glitch (charged for something on the mini bar that we didn't use), was fixed quickly with no issue at all. The valet service was also very efficient. We are a pretty picky couple, and we have stayed in several of the higher end inns and hotels in Napa/Sonoma where the rooms cost 2-3x times a night.

Avia wants to be a high end hotel but lacks the service to achieve that. I think the issues reflect the way the hotel is managed. It would be so easy to make this a nice experience but they missed the mark. What we expereinced: * Valet parking - No notification that this costs $15/day. No sign, no printing on the ticket, no discussion by the personanel. I discovered this when checking out. The valet parking and self park are in the same parking garage behind the hotel. It's easy to self park and I would have done so had I known. At checkout, I protested the fee since it was not disclosed but the attendant would not change the charge. Bad management. * Gym - We asked for the location of the gym and were told it's \"next door\". So, we walked down the street looking for it. It was next door but the entrance was behind the building. Once we arrived, the gym told us we needed a form filled out at the hotel. So, we had to return to the hotel for the form. Again, no one told us we needed a form. This unnecessary delay, walking back-forth and confusion could have been avoided had the personnel mentioned the process and entrance location when we inquired. Bad management. * Doormen - There was a group of doormen that serve to open the door and answer questions. It would be great if they had any knowledge to share - they don't. I saw people ask about restaurants, gym, etc and they seemed ill prepared to answer and their answers were incomplete (gmy, parking as examples). Why don't they have a prepared list to provide of local restaurants? Bad management. * Maid service - We left our room in the late morning. While in the room, we had a \"do-not-disurb\" sign. When we left, we flipped it to \"service-room\". We returned at the end of day and no service was performed. Since they do a turn down service, that means it was missed twice. * Room - The room has nice ammenities but is very, very small. The bed was extremely comfortable. * Restaurant - We ate at their restaurant the first night because it had good reviews. The food was fine but the seating was uncomfortable (weird shaped chairs) and staff amaturish. The restaurant is open and a loud group of people were sitting at the lounge area behind us, which was disturbing. It was an ok meal but for these prices, you'd expect better. We would not eat there again. *Location - It's in the heart of the city of Napa. The entire downtown area has been redeveloped and is fairly new. With the downturn in the economy over the last few years, many of the establishments in downtown Napa have left. We saw a lot of empty store fronts while walking to the Opera House.

The hotel's oversized wrought iron doors open to a modern and spacious lobby with a wine bar providing a convenient place to relax after a long day of wine tasting. The hotel website advertises \"complimentary wine tasting every night in the lobby wine bar\" however, it's actually a representative from a local winery offering a limited number of tastings. The night we stayed, he ran out of wine within 30 minutes. The 5-story hotel offers 141 stylish guestrooms and suites with hardwood floors and 9-ft. high ceilings. The rooms and suites vary in size and luxury. We booked the Master Tub Suite via the hotel's website. Initially we were given the wrong room, the Lux Suite, upon check-in and had to go back to the lobby with our confirmation email pulled up on our iPad to get the correct room. I recommend booking the upgraded Master Tub Suite. The Lux Suite is really just a large room with a too small haphazardly placed wall dividing the living space from the bedroom, whereas the Master Tub Suite had an actual wall dividing the two rooms. The Master Tub Suite included a comfortable king size bed, 42\" flat screen television, iPod docking station, coffee maker and organic gourmet coffee, fluffy bath robes, a waterfall shower and an oversized tub located in the bedroom to soak in. The mini-bar is stocked with Dean & Deluca snacks and an assortment of beverages. When you check-in ask the front desk to \"unlock\" your mini-bar, it took us about ten minutes of fighting with the thing to figure out we had to call the front desk to open it up!

In an area where they know how to do luxury well, but they also know how to charge for it then AVIA represents tremendous value for money. Firstly the booking process is novel, with the option to request upgraded rooms at reduced rates (and subject to availability at check-in time). So you don't know for sure whether you'll snag an upgrade, but if you do it won't cost as much as the standard rate for the room. This is a really good idea, and we got a tub suite at check-in instead of the standard room we had booked for a modest increase in price. The room was great; large, modern and sleek, but yet also cozy. The bed was really comfortable and as well as the tub, we also had a small sitting area with a second flat screen TV, and a fireplace. They offer a wine tasting most evenings in the lobby bar (incidentally the bar doubles as a coffee shop in the mornings), and we were lucky as the night we checked in it was a local brewery showcasing their beers. Just what the doctor ordered after tasting wine for a few days. We ate breakfast in their restaurant and were pleasantly surprised by the prices - we'd just come from a resort which charged $10 for an orange juice, and $8 for a coffee; at AVIA it was more like $3 each, and the quality was really no different. We also really enjoyed sitting by the fire-pit and talking with other guests as the sun went down, enjoying a glass of wine. We also can't praise the concierge enough, they found a shop selling difficult to get wine for me, and also gave us free tasting passes for several really good wineries. As much as I would like to, I just can't give the AVIA a rating of 5 as our room suffered a bit of a noise problem. It was seemingly above a loud refrigeration or air-conditioning unit which rumbled into life of its own accord during the night, and did wake us both on a few occasions (but we'd just come from the quietest hotel we'd ever stayed at, so anything would suffer in comparison). Also the housekeeping staff knocked to do a turn-down service just as my wife was stepping out of the shower. I asked them to give us 15-20 minutes as we were going out, and they agreed. Yet when we came back to the room after dinner, they hadn't returned. It would also be nice if the hotel had a pool. However, despite that I was still hugely impressed and pleasantly surprised by AVIA. Having stayed at a number of different hotels in the Napa Valley I thought that getting value and luxury in the same place was something that was impossible to find.

I'm also very thankful to Juliette and another front desk gentleman who helped me coordinate getting my keys couriered same day from Avia to my SF hotel on Saturday the 13th. No keys would have meant a huge hassle when we got back to Minneapolis. Thank you Juliette! Sorry I forgot the other fellow's name. The front desk staff we're always chearful and willing. Can't say enough. If you want one tiny knock it might be that you had to go next door to a freestanding health club to workout but that wasn't a big deal. Everyone in our group loved this place.

Our review would have been 5 stars were it not for a couple of strange service foibles. First of all, the hotel is almost brand new; the rooms are extremely clean and linens, beds and bathrooms are excellent. The location is right in the heart of the city of Napa; it is easily walkable to many of Napa's best restaurants. We had a few strange service issues. None of which, however, was a deal killer. When we checked in, we requested a late checkout. Always worried that these types of things don't get recorded, I later that evening walked to the front desk to confirm our late checkout request for the next night. It was not. The front desk said, however, that it would be no issue and entered the late checkout into the computer again. The next morning, we got a call from the front desk warning us that if we needed to check out. They didn't have our late checkout in the computer after two inputs into the system. It was no big deal, we ended up changing our plans and were leaving at that moment anyway, but still??? Lastly, the hotel concierge gave us a restaurant recommendation for brunch, gave us a printout of the address and driving directions. After driving for 45 minutes up into an absolutely obscure country road in the hills of Napa, I concluded that this couldn't possibly be right. My wife called the restaurant to learn that the hotel had given us the address of their associated ranch/farm and that the restaurant was half an hour away. So, two pretty serious goof ups. Thankfully neither ended up ruining our stay. We ended up not having an issue with our checkout b/c we ended up deciding to leave at noon and we weren't too hungry for our brunch! On the upside, they have a great hidden discount for California residents and generally speaking the service was very friendly. As mentioned before the facilities are very good and the price that we got was a tremendous value. I would stay here again but if I did, would check our checkout time repeatedly just to be sure =)", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent boutique hotel in Napa -- a real steal\u201d", "Author": "Frequent_TravelsSF", "ReviewID": "UR84700463", "Content": "We've stayed at Avia twice this year for last-minute Saturday night getaways -- both times we had excellent experiences.

Pierre, at the front desk, recognized how weary we were from our arrival and quickly processed our check in. I can't say enough about his skills, he was meant to be working with people as his professionalism and friendly demeanor was a welcome after 12 hours of travel. We had a basic king room at the end of the third floor, which had plenty of space for us to spread out and relax for the week. The hotel has a restaurant that we did not partake in, but it was very busy for breakfast so I must assume it was good. Where the hotel severely falls short is on it's cleaning staff. Not one day went by that we didn't have to call down for supplies to be replenished - be it coffee, soap, coffee mugs, wine glasses, etc. All items, by the way, were initially in the room when we checked in, so it would be safe to assume that these items would be replenished as part of the daily cleaning. The guest services staff were more than accommodating, and items were brought to us almost immediately. Our room was outside of their supply closet and we were awoken on most mornings around 8 by the chatter and laughing of the maids in the hallway. We also noticed that the toilet hadn't been cleaned, which again was far below what we expected. If the cleaning staff were expecting a tip, they did nothing to earn it.

It had a very contemporary design and was roomy, with a separate small living area with a couch and coffee table. Someone brilliantly designed a rotating flat screen TV on a half-wall, so that you could watch the TV from bed or rotate it and watch from the small living area. The king bed was exceptionally comfortable. There was a small desk in the bedroom area, along with two nightstands. The bathroom was huge and very stylish (although the beautiful half-wall of glass didn't totally keep the spray from the very nice, large walk-in shower from getting some of the bathroom floor wet). The bathroom was all marble--even the walls--and had a huge vanity countertop with a basin-style farmhouse sink. (and the much more water-efficient single-handle faucet that all hotels should have). The room really felt like a haven--quiet, Zen-like, beautiful. My only complaint about the room was that the a/c unit was quite loud and only had a one-speed (high) fan. I had to turn it off in order to sleep, but then the room got too warm--since it was very hot in Napa--so I got back up and turned it on a few times. But it did cool the room very well. The hotel was still doing construction on a new wine-bar downstairs in the lobby area, so there was some hammering during the middle of the day, but since the manager made sure I got a room on the top floor (5th), it was very quiet in my room. I think the construction will be over soon, but if you're concerned, just contact the hotel ahead of time to ask for a quiet room on a higher floor. The staff were cordial and professional, and the concierge was especially nice and helpful. There's an area with several computers one can use for free. There's a huge terrace at the hotel, but the one time during my trip that it was cool enough to want to sit outside, it was closed for a private event.The hotel provides a free wine-tasting from 5-6 each day. The room service menu doesn't have too many choices. I didn't try the food at the hotel, but the breakfast buffet seemed like a pretty good deal. In spite of being downtown--but in a rather charming area of downtown--it was quiet around the hotel--and easy to self-park, either in the free garage parking provided by the hotel or even on the street, if you're coming and going. As others have noted recently, a number of storefronts in downtown Napa are now vacant and/or awaiting more urban renewal. There are a number of restaurants (and even a Safeway supermarket) within a few blocks of the hotel. The nice Oxbow Market and riverfront area are nearby. I highly recommend Sweetie's Bakery-Cafe for breakfast; it's near the riverfront. The riverfront area is a bit disappointing, since some of it overlooks industrial things rather than a woodsy river. I highly recommend the nice drive up a small mountain to the Hess Collection with a very impressive modern/contemporary art collection (and good wine, to boot). All in all, if you're looking for a reasonably priced, stylish, comfortable, centrally located, and quiet hotel in the Napa area, you can't go wrong with the Avia. Compared to some of the other boutique hotels (and especially the many high-priced B & B's in the Napa valley), it's a great alternative. I was there alone to relax and unwind and not for a romantic getaway, but I think the Avia would be a good choice for different kinds of travellers. They seem to have various good deals available (e.g., on weekdays), and they offer a good \"staycation\" rate for Californians. If you prefer modern/contemporary hotels to frills and frou-frou (as I do), and if you'd rather be in a pet-free rather than a pet-friendly nonsmoking hotel, as I also do, this is a great choice. marilano", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAVIA Napa is WONDERFUL!\u201d", "Author": "soonerpsych", "ReviewID": "UR69837354", "Content": "We stayed with AVIA Napa for our honeymoon and were beyond satisfied.

I also give especially high marks to Juliette, the hotel concierge. She arranged a train ride to St. Helena (great little town) for their monthly street festival, arranged a bike wine tour with a great host (\"Tom\"), and arranged dinner reservations at Farmstead which was an amazing new restaurant 20 minutes north of Napa.

We went to the train station and were told NO tickets were bought and paid for and that we can purchase NEW ones to get on the train. WE WERE TOLD THAT OUR TRIP WAS BOOK BY AVIA!

First of all it's in the heart of downtown Napa. It's within walking distance of several great restaurants and bars. A great starting off point to head north on your wine tasting adventures. We arrived to the hotel a few days after they had a large water line burst and flooded the ground floor ( lobby ) with two inches of water warping the floors. They were in the process of attempting to restore the wood floors when we arrived so there was a bit of construction going on, but so what..... things happen. I heard several people mention that the floors actually looked very rustic because of the warping. Any way, it wasn't a big deal. Check in went smoothly and everyone we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. There is free self parking at the back of the the hotel with a very short walk to the front door or a $15 valet fee per day with all the in and out privileges you need. The room we had was on the 5th floor. 519. Right next to the elevators. We could never hear the elevators or anyone out in front of them so it was never a problem. But we could hear the people on the other side of the elevators, which again wasn't a problem for us because it was my sister. But if you didn't like listening to my sister and brother in law laughing.... it may be a problem. The rooms are Fantastic!!!! They are very large (we had a Luxe room) nice hardwood floors, swivel TV so you could watch it while in bed or while watching it in the sitting area that has a small couch. Very comfortable king size bed with comfortable crisp sheets. There is a large bathroom with one sink and plenty of counter space. There is a lighted magnified mirror. Ladies... Don't look deeply into this!!!!!! You will scream and run for the tweezers! But... do what you gotta do! The shower has two shower heads, one rain head shower and a hand held shower head. Our water was as hot as you want for as long as you want. The only complaint or suggestion would be about the open shower area. there is just small glass pane that really doesn't keep any of the water in the shower. So just make sure you have 2 or 3 towels down to soak up the water and keep you from slipping and breaking you neck while getting out of the shower. I didn't have a problem wiping up the water, but you shouldn't have to and I can see some people really complaining about this. The view from our 5th floor room was of the parking structure at the rear of the hotel. beautiful.... no but we really didn't spend that much time looking out at the views. We were there for the room. If I'm going to get an amazing view, it's probably not going to be for the price I paid for this hotel which was a bit over $200. They had a very nice outdoor area with wood swings and rocking chairs surrounding a large fire pit and the second floor. We spent a very nice evening around this fire pit and met some very nice interesting people. They is a very great breakfast buffet for around $20 per person. Eggs, omeletts, bagels, muffins, fruits, cereals, meats, cheeses, yogurts and all kinds of other wonderful filling things. In the evening they have a complimentary wine tasting with a few appetizers. In the morning the have a coffee station set up in the lobby if you would like to take a coffee on the go. Over all, myself and all my companions who stayed here had nothing bad to say about this hotel. We were very pleased and felt like we got a great deal for the price. I did a lot of research on hotels and bed and breakfasts in the area and thought that this looked like the nicest hotel for the price.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the interior design is phenomenal. Every staff member that we were in contact with was WONDERFUL!!! We had a suite which was well maintained by housekeeping staff who took the time to replenish tolietries and ensure that we had an abundance of fresh, fluffy towels and clean linens. Our 5th floor view allowed us to see the mountains and the courtyyard. Our room was comfortable, BEAUTIFUL and spacious. Most impressive was the fact that this hotel was QUIET!!! Juliette is the ultimate concierge; she was very knowledgeable,personable and accommodating...she worked very hard to ensure that we felt special and we did. If you attend the evening wine tasting events make sure you find Scott who is usually in the bar area. His knowledge of wines is quite impressive and you will learn a great deal if you listen. To make your arrangements make sure you talk with Vicki as she is very prompt in her responses and great to work with. She even took the time to come out and say hello upon our arrival. You can bet that I will stay at the AVIA whenever I go to the Napa Valley again or any place that has an AVIA hotel. The people there take the time to know your name, listen to your questions and provide honest responses. The valets and bell hops are bright, witty young people who prove that the true art of customer service is not an ancient practice. They were great as well.

The first night we ate a couple of blocks down at Ristorante Alegria--YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was such a great meal. The second night was Cole's Chophouse--Ok food, but after an hour wait for a table and then another hour wait for our food, I was very disappointed--and VERY pricey!

We couldn't pass up the great value! The nightly rate averaged $147 a night including weekends with the \"staycation\" package for California residents. Wow, what a deal that was! Even w/o breakfast included, we felt we got our monies worth and even more. The check in isn't until 4 but our room was ready when we arrived around 1:30 and they even upgraded us to Lux Suite which has the double facing fireplace warming up both the luxurious bedroom and the living room.

We were on the 3rd floor facing the street but we were never bothered with noise in or out of the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel the first morning. It was good but we found other places near the hotel that was better and much less expensive. The lady at the concierge desk really knows her restaurants.

Valet parkers were young but were always very courteous... opened doors, helped with luggage and always said hello. The hotel is very new, a mix of modern and rustic. I helped myself to a glass of sangria before walking up to the desk to check in. Front desk staff was very polite and quick. Went up to our room on the 4th floor (#416) that overlooked 1st street, even with it being a holiday weekend we never had trouble with too much street noise. The room (we got the master tub suite) was very spacious. The soaking tub in the bedroom was huge and definitely could fit two. The bed was big and not too soft. The bathroom was decent size with a 5 x 5 walk in shower. It had both a rain shower head and a hand-held that you can adjust the height. I appreciated the option of the hand-held as I'm not a fan of the rain shower (I think I'm the only one :P ). The room with a separate living area was nice although we never used the living room half. The fireplace surprisingly gave off some good heat except we didn't use it much because of a high pitched noise it made every time we turned it on. This could have been a problem just with our fireplace and not all of them, not sure. I only had one experience eating the hotel's food which was room service for breakfast. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of my favorite parts of any vacation. Sadly, I think this may be the one place where this hotel is lacking. The menu choices are extremely limited. Your basics for lunch/dinner: club sandwich, burger, cheese/meat plate etc. Breakfast had options like fruit, cereal, and their signature which is eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon and sausage. I ordered the signature and asked for my eggs over medium; I was told they only serve scrambled eggs for \"health reasons\"?!?! I have never heard his before and was pretty disappointed, but whatever. My food arrived in about 20 minutes but they forgot the potatoes, and when they arrived they were not golden as it said on the menu but over buttered, over cooked and not one inch of crisp. Also, I had one piece of toast barely toasted and the other was burnt. At least the sausage was good? Sigh. As I said before, room service (especially for breakfast) to me is important, but other than this one minor problem our stay at Avia Hotel in Napa was delightful.

I solved the problem by heating the room up and then switching it off before going to bed. Not a big problem though. 2. If you move anything in the mini-bar they'll automatically add something to your bill. We like fresh milk in our coffee and put a carton in the bar to keep cool.

Wireless internet worked easily and the staff friendly and helpful making the stay an enjoyable one. At around 8:30pm we settled in for the night after an exhausting day, turned off the tv to realize loud blaring dance club type noises and music were clearly close by. I kareoked for a few moments to the lyrics which were easy to distinguish before laughing at the wild girls 'whoooo, hoooo' ing to something else going on. Don't have any idea where this came from- my husband woke at 1 am to find it was still going on. On the 5th floor overlooking the fire pit and relaxing area below, and next to the parkind deck it was odd to hear this. We never mentioned during our stay the only downside but we were so exhausted from the travel day it was the one night this wouldn't have mattered. Any other stay I certainly would have inquired on a relocation to a quieter room- it was more than a little loud. Just beware of this during your stay- it seems like the other side of the hotel may be quieter? OR if it's a romantic get away this may certainly spoil the effect. Overall we enjoyed our time, would probably reccommend despite the last and only negative aspect of our stay- just be a bit wiser to the noise potential. Affordable, clean and just great for a stopover while in wine country.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando, florida", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel !!\u201d", "Author": "citonyc", "ReviewID": "UR53239990", "Content": "we arrived at the hotel fairly late at night due to delays by the airlines, but we called ahead and the friendly staff were informed of our delay.. we stayed at the hotel only a few short months after its opening and if i could describe it in one word..WOW !! the hotel is amazing.. the surrounding area is in the heart of napa but still up and coming, there were many of new business( store fronts) buildings that were vacant. the staff was very nice and polite and the concierge station was extreamly helpful in planning some great wine tours, they even gave us free sampling cards of other local shops and winemakers. the patio area has a fireplace which is great for enjoying a bottle of wine and winding down after a long day. the rooms were very nice, clean and had a safe in each room along with flat screen tv and a incredibly big walk in shower!! valley parking is expensive but there is a free parking garage literally right behind the hotel !!

The only down side was the room was very expensive and that did not include any of the refreshment bar that was stocked, anything you took out was charged to your room stay. Also the hallways were rather dimly light and there are no ice machines yet. They don't have a pool, spa, or workout room, but they do have a terrace with swings. :) The breakfast is an extra charge of $12.95 again something I was hoping would be included with the room. Other than that it was an amazing stay and I would recommend it to a friend, just with caution of being prepared to spend money.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cHas potential\u201d", "Author": "krb1622", "ReviewID": "UR34345395", "Content": "The property is modern and attractive, and the rooms are spacious, with nice finishes. The bed was one of the most comfortable that I've ever experienced. The bathroom is large, with a long counter top for all my cosmetics and a shower big enough for two. I loved that we could open the windows and enjoy the gorgeous weather. The location is in central Napa, convenient to restaurants and tasting rooms. The Avia just opened last weekend and service is still pretty rough around the edges. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, some of the staff was more accommodating than others. For example, one morning I asked if I could get a pot of coffee to bring to my room and was told \"there's a coffee maker in your room.\" I knew that, but I wanted real coffee, with cream, and not that powdered cream substitute poison stuff. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly. In general, it was a nice stay, but the service needs some refinement, which will probably come with time.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "AVIA Napa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d1370957-Reviews-AVIA_Napa-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$238 - $375*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1450 First Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Napa</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94559-2843</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1370957", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/df/85/73/avia-hotel-napa.jpg"}}
