So, the best thing I can say about this hotel is that it was the least expensive I could find, outside of a hostel. The second best thing is the historical location in The Rocks. It is a primary tourist location and a short walk to the Quay, CBD, Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. There is also free wifi available thru the pub downstairs, but you really need to use a small sitting room downstairs or one of the sidewalk tables. For this price in the U.S., we would get a pretty nice place, but, this is not the U.S. So, here is the down side of this place. Very tiny room...there is actually not enough space in the room for two people to unpack and store some items. No a/c...not a huge problem if it is cool. But, it was hot and humid. And, when you open the window, there was no cross ventilation, so it stayed hot. Then you have to deal with street and pub noise from downstairs. Finally, all rooms are on the 2nd floor and there is no lift. My husband struggled to get our luggage up the very narrow, winding staircase. But, the man who checked us in was very nice to help. In the U.S., we rarely get a room w/o a bathroom, so you would have to feel comfortable going down the hall. There were however, several bathrooms, so it was not a problem getting in one. Generally, this hotel, altough an historic landmark, is very old and not well taken care of (stained carpets, cracked tiles, torn curtains). Having given you all the negatives, I would stay there again if it was below 20 Celsius. The reason is that we are generally gone all day sight seeing, and spend very little time in the room. It could be right for the right traveler, but not one used to the Four Seasons!

You're far more likely to find true travelers here rather than your average tourist. The Australian Heritage Hotel is a pretty good example of what is sadly becoming an increasingly difficult to find style of classic Aussie accommodation.....the pub. While certainly not unique, Australian pubs are different to those found in other parts of the world. A little worn and tattered around the edges, minimal facilities (typically have shared bathrooms) and sometimes prone to be noisy, they are invariably cheap. If you are looking for a quintessentially Aussie experience, it's worth staying at least a night or two to really understand what this style of accommodation is all about. If however you want an ensuite, pillow-top beds, big buffet breakfast, flat screen television and sterile conditions, there are Holiday Inns, Radissons, Hiltons or Best Westerns about 1km away. This 12 'guest' room B&B style pub gives travelers the chance to experience how it was in the 1920's and 30's in Sydney. While not located in the absolute heart of the city, the pub is in the historic Rocks area, practically on the harbour. OK, so if you look behind the facade, she's starting to show her age (just shy of her 100th birthday) but so long as you acknowledge this is a pub after all, you will find the experience is quite enjoyable, offering as it does a great location, pretty comfortable surroundings and an experience that true travelers often crave and actively seek out. I've stayed here a few times now and may have simply been lucky, but I've yet to have a bad experience. I've never had problems with bugs, excessive noise from either the bar downstairs or the street and the bathrooms have always been clean and available. The free (included) continental breakfast is available 24/7 and while basic (three cereals, milk, toast, jams, tea, coffe and fruit) it's laid out in a pleasant common room which also has a TV and chess table. You can even have a free Port in the evening. Free Internet is also acessible here although strangely only between 0500-1900.....go figure? There are plenty of tour brochures and the Airport shuttle can be booked - it will take you to the airport for AU$14 each. It's a pretty good option as it's an awkward 800 metre walk to the train station lugging your luggage up a number of stairs on the way. There is a kitchen and larger dining room up the hall with a fridge, oven, cooktop and other equipment if you choose to self cater....although with so many great dining options within a very short walk, why would you bother? Check out the roof top balcony - a nice place to enjoy your cold beer from the bar downstairs. The hotel is less than one kilometre from Circular Quay and even closer to the stairs up onto the Harbour Bridge. A really nice option is to take an early morning walk up and over the bridge on the eastern side returning on the western side from Milson's Point for a different perspective (about an hour). Alteratively you can walk down through the Rocks and around the Quay to the Opera House and onto the Botanical Gardens. The key to getting the most out of a stay at the Australian is to remember it's a pub, its old, it's cheap (I've never paid more than AU$80) it's basic, the paint may be peeling and its quite likely to be a little noisy. The up side is that it provides an increasingly rare and uniquely Aussie experience in the historic heart of Sydney for a pretty reasonable price.

Yes the accomadation/pub is old looking, a little run down and has that old smell but thats what happens when the place is over a 100 years old and yes it is not a 5 star hotel but it is a great place to stay which is very central to everything. We only paid $65Aus (through lastminute.com.au) for the night and we had friend that were paying $150aus elsewhere and our accomadation was so much better and it included breakfast. What more could you want. I must admit i was a bit worried when i was reading the other reveiws, but i can honestly say we do not agree with any of there comments. So if you are looking for somewhere to stay that is cheap,clean and close to the everything I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cCareful of the Pizza\u201d", "Author": "Warning4u", "ReviewID": "UR19866328", "Content": "My husband and I ate at the Pub's cafe. He had a Moroccan Lamb pizza and has been vomitting and had diarrhea for 2 days since. I had a taste of it on the night and it seemed alright but I felt nauseous the following morning and also thought I might throw up. Don't bother ringing the staff about problems with the food. It just adds insult to the injury. They couldn't give a damn. A rotten experience all in all. I would think seriously before eating anything at this place.

This place markets itself as a nice antique place, but it is really not kept in a good state. The rooms were not very clean as was the rest of the hotel. But the most impressive, was at night when I went to shower in the common bathrooms, I was met by the biggest cockroaches I had ever seen. I went ot another of the bathrooms to find the same sight! When I spoke about this to the staff, the kindly came up and put some sort of bug spray telling me this was normal because \"the Rocks are a very old part of town and are infested with these bugs\". They seem to get these all the time...

The whole place needs a good clean. Rooms are not serviced- beds not made, towel (only one provided) not changed. The furniture is tatty and certainly not 'antique'. The curtain pole in our room was held up at one end by a belt tied to a vent in the wall. One small heater is provided and the rooms are not air conditioned. The music in the pub beneath the accommodation was loud and played until 2.45am on both the nights we stayed and restarted at 8.15am. None of the rooms are en-suite.

The website photos and talk of antique furniture gives a somewhat flattering description. The furniture was antique but it was very tatty . The rooms are small and the beds extremely creaky.The bathrooms were also unattractively antique ie nasty stains on the bath etc! Overall the standard of cleanilness was very poor . We stayed there for 3 nights and didn't get our room serviced once or clean towels/linen which considering how hot it was whilst we were staying there wasn't good! At no time did we ever see a cleaner in our entire stay ! That said the atmosphere was quirky and it is in a great location. If I had paid backpcker prices I would have probably rated it as reasonable value but at the prices it charges I would expect more . You are paying premium rates for the priviledge of staying in the Rocks!
