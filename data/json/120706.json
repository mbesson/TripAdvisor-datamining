Perhaps we had set our expectations too high based on all the great reviews both here and in guidebooks, and on the exhorbitant cost, but this is simply not a place we would go back to or recommend. We drove up to the hotel and were directed to leave our car and go to a desk, where the first thing we were asked to do was sign a waiver saying that if anything happened to us on the property we wouldn't sue them. Not very welcoming, to say the least. We were then escorted to our room. While huge, with a view of the ocean and a tray of snacks and drinks awaiting us, it was also extremely basic. The bedding was worn and stained, and the mattresses were in need of replacement. The couch and chairs were dirty - we didn't want to sit on them, and in fact placed towels on them before we did. There was very little lighting in the room, and after dark the only place light enough to read was at the dining table. The baseboards were peeling away from the walls. The rooms are just so tired and in need of serious refurbishment. The place is filthy and falling apart. The grounds of the hotel are lovely, though the \"infinity\" pool is just a regular pool filled to the very edge. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Hana is a beautiful place and I would recommend that anyone driving \"the road to Hana\" stay in Hana for at least a night or two, but I would recommend they save their money and stay in one of the local B&Bs instead of the Travaasa Hana.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boerne, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice but missed opportunities\u201d", "Author": "hillcntrytraveler", "ReviewID": "UR125908154", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Travaasa Hana and while overall it was a good stay, the whole place just misses the mark in terms of luxury. We had wanted to stay in Hana because on other trips to Maui, we did the usual hurtle down the Road to Hana in a day and never got to see the local sights. After staying at Travaasa, our feeling was that they are wasting an opportunity to provide a truly spectacular hotel/spa experience. The hotel was apparently allowed to fall into some disrepair by its previous owners and is in need of some basic TLC and room updating. I'm referring to things like the need to repair and paint some rotted wood siding (not just apply a layer of fresh paint over the rotted wood), some small plumbing fixes in the rooms, fixing cracked and probably rotted plaster in the room, the pools were a little dumpy and the tennis courts were a joke. Our room could have used a better mattress. When you pay this much for a room the mattress should be at least as comfortable as one at a Holiday Inn Express, but ours was a bit saggy. The place just needs some freshening up not a complete remodel. While they're at it, it wouldn't hurt to have a TV in each room. I know they are trying to create a spa-like experience where you supposedly shouldn't care about TV watching, but in the evenings in Hana, there isn't a whole lot to do. Besides that, I felt very cut off from the outside world and this doesn't make me feel relaxed, it makes me anxious because I want to know what is going on. It would have been nice just to be able to watch the local weather and find out if it was going to rain the next day (answer--yes). Now the pluses for Travaasa. The everyday upkeep of the place is meticulous. The huge staff does a great job of keeping everything clean, even to the point of picking up the leaves that have fallen off the trees from the last rain, so guests won't slip on them. The rooms are very clean and it is a nice touch to have the welcome basket of fruit and free drinks in the frig--no mini-bar charges! The entire staff was friendly and efficient. We had a junior suite and our package included breakfast, and after reading some other posts on this site, I was apprehensive about the meal. I needn't have been concerned--the breakfast was excellent and the service very fast. The food was quite good (pancakes with strawberries were very tasty and had a huge helping of berries, not just one or two) and the view from their restaturant in the morning was outstanding. We didn't eat there for lunch or dinner so we can't speak for those meals. The grounds are just beautiful and wonderfully maintained, like a big tropical sanctuary. They have an activities center where you can borrow boogie boards, snorkel gear and more, then they have a shuttle bus that takes you to Hamoa Beach 5 minutes away. Your room key also gets you into some private bathrooms/showers at Hamoa and while we were waiting for the shuttle bus to pick us up, the attendant at Hamoa brought us some bottled water. They really do pamper you at Travaasa. We did not do any of the spa activities, as we were staying there just as a local spot to explore Hana, not to go to a spa. So if we had availed ourselves of those services I'm sure I would be raving about it, as all their other things were first rate. But as I said, some capital investment in refurbishing the rooms would have made this a 5 star plus experience. If you choose not to eat at Travaasa your dinning options in Hana are extremely limited. Even the grocery stores there are very inadequate. We ate lunch one day at a spot on the road to Hana, at least 5 miles before you get to Hana--Island Chef, a small one man operation in a trailer. There are a couple of other restaurants in the same area. Look for it on the left side of the road as you are approaching Hana. Island Chef was very good--mostly Asian entrees with a good variety and large portions. Don't know if they were open for dinner or not. There was also a plate lunch place a couple hundred feet down the road from Travaasa near the little market but we didn't eat there although it smelled great. On our way to Hana the first day, we stopped in Paia and went to Mana Foods, a small but nice grocery, and purchased some really good sandwiches and cookies. That was dinner for the evening. A travel tip--if you have room in your suitcase bring along one of those collapsable insulated bags that we all seem to have. It is great for bringing along a sandwich or just a cold drink as you're driving around or at the beach. Hana is a beautiful place and worthy of an overnight stay but may be a bit too slow paced for many. Prepare to take it slow and easy, which might not be relaxing for some. And I sure wish they would take care of the deferred maintenance and make this place into a true paradise.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cHeaven at the Travaasa Hana Hotel\u201d", "Author": "IUJHU", "ReviewID": "UR125473577", "Content": "We visited Maui in early February for 10 days.

Every staff member was considerate and friendly, in a genuine and welcoming manner. We only wished we had booked more than one night there. The room was lovely and we had the garden view cottage, but we still had a partial view of the ocean. in our room, we were greeted with banana bread, fruit, sparkling wine, in honor of our 25th anniversary. Though we stayed in both the Kaanapali and Wailea areas during this trip, I only felt truly relaxed here in Hana. I will never forget the stroll there on the grounds of the Hana hotel near the Sea View cottages overlooking the bay. If there were other people staying at the hotel, we hardly saw them. It was so tranquil. We, like others, were surprised by the no tipping policy but it helped with the ability to unwind since we weren't always fishing for dollars in our pockets.

We were somewhat apprehensive about the changes that the new management company might have made. We are not against change, but with a special place like Hana it is extremely important to make changes very carefully and maintain the really good things about the resort. It was such a relief when we arrived and felt the same warm Hawaiin reception. This lasted throughout our stay (four nights). The beauty of Hana combined with a first class hotel and staff...what a great combination! As for our accomodations, we stayed in a Sea Ranch Cottage. It was very private and quiet with an excellent view of the ocean. The cottage was spacious and clean. The ocean breezes kept everything cool and comfortable day & night. We had a hot tub on the deck. The hot tub was clean (maintained daily) and was nice and toasty/hot when we used it each evening. We were also pleasantly surprised at the \"no-tipping\" policy, however, it was sometimes difficult to hold-back since the staff were so helpful and friendly.

This hotel gets the top Conde Nast readers award for hotels in Hawaii? Either the hotel stacked the dec, or the readers were hypnotized by the beauty of Hana. Let me start by saying this hotel is probably at one of the most idyllic spots in the country. Hana is a gorgeous location, and the Hotel Hana Maui's Sea Cottages have to be one of the most beautiful places to situate a hotel. However, a great location does not a great hotel make, and on many other elements the hotel falls far short of expectations. We live on the island of Maui and travel extensively, so our perspective is both steeled by understanding the island culture and shaded by experiencing many of the great hotels around the world. If we start with the rooms (this is just a perspective on the Sea Cottage rooms), their location is picturesque, however, the rooms are a bit threadbare. The fabric on the sofa and the chairs is stained and extremely well worn (not at all what one would expect at a four or five star resort). The room is nicely appointed, but definitely dated and in need of renovation. We understand the hotel is under new ownership, and the new owner has been refurbishing some of the cottages. The ocean is hard on wood and metal, and indeed there were rotting floor boards on our Lanai (making standing out on the Lanai somewhat perilous), windows with rotted frames and shutters, and a refrigerator with shelves that the salt sir had rusted to scrap status (again, living on the island we understand this, but it can be combatted). These are only a handful of observations regarding the fatigued condition of these cottages, and comes with the side bar that our bellman told us our cottage had been in the group that had been refurbished-he can't be serious. The only noted improvement (and believe me, we were looking) was the partial replacement of the steps leading up to our cottage, with a more durable wood replacement product. Not exactly our idea of a facelift or refurbishment-this seems more like a repair. The pool is pretty, and the policy change to the ranch cottages being an adult's only area (except for limited times of the year) is great (despite the fact that we saw people at the adults only pool with babies). The pool area however is populated by aged teak lounge chairs (several broken) with filthy cushions (again not what you would expect at a five, four or even three star resort). The small private hot tub located on the lanai of some cottage units is wonderful, and emptied and cleaned between guests; thank you . . . Since there is little to do in Hana except enjoy the location and local sight-seeing, the hotel has an activity center staffed with knowledgable long-time Hana residents. They are a delight to talk with, and can teach island crafts such as Lei making or Ukelele playing, and offer other activities such as a nature walk. There is also a \"library\" stocked with games, but alas, many of these reside in broken down boxes and having missing pieces, used up score cards etc. It is not such a long journey to the island Walmart or Kmart, that would prevent these from being replaced from time to time, and at a minimal monetary investment. Now let's talk about the restaurant - horrible, horrible, horrible! When the hotel was taken over by the current owner they decided they did not want to run the food side of the business, and contracted all of the food service at the hotel with Longhi's - a long term island restaurant firm. Unfortunately, Longhi's is known by most on the island for overpriced, poor quality, unimaginative food and lack-luster service - basically a tourist trap (look up the reviews for either their Lahaina or Wailea restaurants). In Hana, they have taken it to a new low. Their are basically two \"real restaurants\" in Hana, one at the hotel, and one at the ranch across the street. Both are run by Longhi's and are equally sub-par and overpriced. They also have a bar/lounge at the hotel called Paniolo Lounge (that serves exactly the same sub-par uninspired menu). Don't expect many choices - every day they offer the same five or six entree's (and only one fish item - on an island in the Pacific where fish is plentiful). Let me start with our breakfast on the first day. We paid extra for their breakfast package, and if you are going - pass. The first thing the waiter told us was what was not included with our package. One of these items was French Press coffee, but we ordered a pot anyway ($15). The first French Press was delivered to our table cool-and this is where the lack luster service piece comes in-the manager took the pot away and we thought she was going to have the coffee remade. Ten minutes later the waiter appeared and said \"the manager told me there was an issue with the coffee.\" We explained it was cold and would like another (something we wrongly assumed the manager was handling). Ten minutes later our waiter arrived with another pot. This time the plunger had not worked, and the strong Hawaiian coffee we were hoping for was basically brown water. One would think if French Press was offered on the menu, someone on the staff would understand how it is prepared-not so. My wife ordered soft-boiled eggs, and two eggs were delivered in their shell, in a bowl (they claim on the menu they were \"Maui-Fresh eggs\" - they were not, they were mainland eggs stamped by a mainland producer...don't lie on the menu). However, the eggs were hard-boiled, and when we told the waiter he responded \"All I do is put in the order, I don't make them.\" We asked that they be remade offering the suggestion that five minutes should be all that is required to prepare them properly. Our waiter returned with two more eggs - hard boiled eggs. We gave up on soft-boiled eggs from that point forward (but this gave new meaning in our mind to a chef that cannot boil an egg). On the second day I ordered the island pancakes (sans banana's - as they told my wife - \"we are out of bananas\"). We could not understand how a hotel in Hana could be out of bananas. Literally there are probably 25 banana trees on the property, and another dozen at every turn of the twisty road to the hotel. They also had two lugs hanging in the lobby for anyone (including the chef) to enjoy. Apparently no one on the staff, chef and manager included, thought there might be banana nearby in Hana, including their own lobby! My pancakes were delivered with batter still on the inside and the french toast my wife ordered arrived cool and only partially cooked; raw egg still evident,m as well as bacon that was cold (not cool). At this point I sought out the manager and complained to him. He had our food remade, but it came without a hint of an apology and he never checked on us - just bad service. On the third (and final) day when we ordered our breakfast we explained to our waitress exactly what we wanted (we made it simple; eggs over easy and toast), and that we wanted her to ensure that everything was hot - she did, and our final breakfast was good. What became clear to us was they had no food runners or method of informing the staff that an order was ready to be delivered. While this explains why all of our meals (and we do mean ALL, as our dinners were delivered cool or cold as well) it does not explain all of the other lapses from ill-prepared food, to poor service, especially from management. One of our evening meals was spent in the Paniolo Lounge where the bartender provided drink service to both restaurants (the lounge and the main restaurant) but also handled food service within the lounge. While it was quite obvious she was working her tail off, what she could not be was attentive. How could she be with having to handle so much on her own. We very much understood her predicament and made no complaints or demands of her other than placing and delivering our drinks and food. What was really unfortunate though was when she brought our check she said \"I could have provided you better service had I not been so busy!\". Too bad she felt she needed to say this and more to the point, where was her help? Oh, we know, it was the manager (different than we had seen before) who popped up to ask \"how's everything?\" but was literally turing away from us as we responded \"fine\"-clearly just going through the motions. W have been at many busy or understaffed restaurants where the manager is doing ANYTHING to ensure good service is carried out, from cleaning and setting up tables to taking orders, making drinks and running food. Apparently this manager did not think any of those things were important. Our experience at the ranch restaurant across the street was similar. We had one good lunch there, but returned on another day for drinks. We ordered their homemade lemon and limeade (delicious) with two shots of vodka. We received two badly watered drinks, and when I went to talk to the bartender, he menacingly said \"are you questioning my pours?.\" When I said I was, he said, I don't know where you drink, but said he would add another shot if we paid for it. If you are counting, this would seem like we each had three shots of Vodka, which we did not. Fifty dollars later we left, each having one drink and feeling abused for the privilege of having a drink at the ranch restaurant. We would return to the hotel again, only because it is definitely one of the most beautiful places on earth and the ability to relax and do nothing is hard to top.

We were in a garden cottage suite and it was beautiful. At first the lack of AC concerned me, but the ceiling fans were romantic and we was never uncomfortable. In fact the room temp was just perfect. Our living area was relaxing, the king size bed so comfortable with lots of soft pillows, and the daily Kona coffee for the in-room coffeepot was delicious! I loved all the little extras, free water in the fridge and sodas, the nightly bed turn down and notes for the next days activities, the fresh Hawaiian flowers on the table, and our patio overlooking all the graceful beauty of the grounds from our comfy lounge-chairs. We took the bikes out (free) for a spin, we took two yoga classes (free) overlooking the pacific from the yoga hut, we played golf (free) on the chip and putt, and, the best of all, the steam-sauna-plunge-jacuzzi experience (also free), and so private! We swam in both pools, so clean and at a perfect temperature, and we took a trip to the hotel's beach a mile away for some bodysurfing too (though you don't go to Hana for the beaches). We literally enjoyed every moment of our stay here. The staff are friendly and welcoming and eager to please and will go out of their way to help in any way they can. We ate at the restaurant on site twice, and although expensive by our normal standards, the food was better than any other you can find in Hana. We enjoyed our talks with Valerie and Darwin and although we didn't take advantage of the other offered activities, (ukelele lessons, lei-making, etc) they were there for the taking.

We spent the first two nights in one of their Garden View suites; and the last two of our stay in one of their Sea Ranch cottages (didn't want to *completely* break the bank!). If you are looking to totally unplug, this is the place. It is definitely low-tech; and it seemed a little empty when we were there (though one of the staff members shared that they were at ~90% capacity - pretty crazy if so, because it felt like we pretty much had the place to ourselves - a good thing!)....but once you settle into the groove...it is incredible. Our rooms were airy and comfortable....almost felt like our own little tropical cottage :) We didn't mind the lack of AC - we had ample ventilation and the breezes were perfect. Again, we started in a Garden Suite, which was great. Peaceful room, tasteful tropical touches....hardwood floors...comfortable bed.....the onnnnly thing I could possibly note was that the bathroom *maybe* felt a bit \"dated\" - but really, it was spotless. This is not a complaint...I'm reaching for any sort of constructive criticism here :P From there, we moved on to our Sea Cottage, which aside from being larger & more stand-apart, came as part of an all-inclusive package - 3 meals (alcohol not included in that....) & one spa treatment per guest per day. I could also tell that the Cottage felt newer than the Garden View room - definitely a VERY nice interior. Again, same calm, tropical touches....but just felt a bit more up-to-date. And our view was right out to the sea :) We ate almost all meals of our stay at the restaurant, and it was quite delicious. It was kind of fun to get to return & try other items on the menu / return to things we had really liked before. I was ready to move on after our stay, but while we were there, everything was fresh & very well-prepared. Oh and - we also enjoyed the delicious banana bread left in our room (I make a mean banana bread, and this definitely impressed me!). Our one small issue - we did have a tiny ant situation on our hands at one point, but a quick call to the front desk took care of it right away. Definitely understandable when everything is so open....we didn't really mind at all. Spa treatments were top-notch. I can only speak of the lomi-lomi massage, which I got two days in a row (talk about spoiled :P). But the facilities are beautiful - each treatment takes place in its own little bungalow with a sliding glass door that opens to tropical foliage in the back. I had two different technicians; both were incredibly skilled & left me feeling refreshed. It was fun to be able to hang out after....not have to pay (well - at that moment :P), and be able to wander out & relax in their dipping pools....or on one of their chaise lounges immediately after the massage. That's how to emerge after a massage! Beyond that, we just really enjoyed the grounds - spread out across several acres, with lush, quiet landscaping.....tucked just a short bike ride from the Hasegawa General Store, among other landmarks....a short car ride (or - nice long walk) to the AMAZING Hamoa Beach (ack, we loved it so much, we never even tried the other beaches that you pass along the way! :P). Oh! And our last day there we checked out a couple bikes from the hotel (so fun!), biked around town & down to the bay, and picked up some *delicious* Thai food from the 'tent' by the school, just down the road from the hotel - I believe it must be this one: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60630-d1989754-Reviews-Thai_Food_By_Pranee-Hana_Maui_Hawaii.html A must-try.

Plan to use the community tennis courts, just outside the hotel property (just over a fence from the hotel's courts). The hotels courts are not maintained and have moss growing in the corners. They're in rough shape. The community courts were in very good shape considering the amount of rainfall Hana gets. The resort is spread across a city street, so if you're in the cottages/adults part of the resort you'll have to exit a gate, cross the street, and reenter the property. Most resort amenities are in the garden part of the resort, not the ocean facing part. Call the front desk and they'll send a golf cart to pick you up.

Other than that it was a great place to spend a night. We didn't like the selection of food on the dining room's menu so we went to the bar.

We travel with a 3-year old, and March was one of the last times that families will be welcome in the Sea Ranch Cottage section of the property. In fact, they were in the process of walling off that section of the property from the rest while we were there.

You won't be welcome to enjoy the beautiful expansive lawn that fronts the Pacific. Nope, that part is behind the wall. You'll be sequestered to the sub-par rooms away from the ocean, and you won't be able to look upon the ocean unless you go to the restaurant. It's all very disappointing.

Or they did a honeymoon there and want to have positive memories. Travaasa is a good place. Unlike my own rating, though, it is not \"very good.\" If I could give it a TripAdvisor 3.5 stars, that would be about right. I am giving it the benefit of the doubt with the \"Very Good rating, but feel this is too generous. The best things about the place are that it is well located, the staff is friendly, they try hard to have good activities, the musician who sings in the restaurant and bar is a phenomenal local Hawaiian who sings his heart out, and you feel safe there. The \"misses\" are really in the details. For five days, we've had two light bulbs burned out and not replaced. And they are in obviously places (like one of two lights by the bathroom sink). The shower nozzle fitting is rusted beyond belief and you can see where the pipe goes into the wall with a huge hole in it (is this where the gekkos keep coming in?). Oh, and gekkos. There are little gekko droppings that don't get cleaned up. The countertops of the table and bar area have not been cleaned at all. Door handles have been grimy. The inside of the refrigerator has never been cleaned and was dirty when we arrived. You get the picture. Just lack of detail. If I were the manager, I would schedule once a week detail inspections with the head of housekeeping and maintenance. Maybe five units each time. And give no exceptions to these kinds of things not getting addressed. The reason is simply: if Travaasa is going to charge as much as they do for rooms, they ought to be up to the test. Honestly, there are hotels and resorts that charge half as much and are twice as neat and clean. Someday, this is going to catch up with them. This is, as I said, a good place. I will stay here again. But these reviews posted recently about Travaasa--the ones that state the place is flawless as well as the ones giving it a \"Terrible\" rating--are just plain unreasonable. Go there and you'll be okay. You'll be warmly greeted, you'll be safe, you're in a great location, you can chill out pool side or at its beach nearby, the help desk will be generous with their time and smiles, there are a couple of good stores and restaurants nearby but off-property, and you will have a good experience most likely.

Travassa Hana as an accomdation. Well it turns out it was also the most perfect place to have our private, romantic wedding ceremony on the black lava rocks over looking the waves crashing, with breathtaking mountain views and a horse pasture as our back drop...Where do I begin....First came Hubert , he is the hotels event coordinator...and honestly, i cannot put into words how wonderful he was. I wanted a private dinner after the ceremony and he created the most perfect intimate setting on our private lanai with hanging lanterns and candles paying attention to detail with perfect pink flowers leading from the entrance to the dining table. He wanted it to be a surprise for us...and boy was it..it brought tears to my eyes!We stayed at the Sea ranch cottages, and even though the price was higher, it was well worth it. There was breakfast included and it was so delicous. More food than my husband could finish... and lets just say he is a healthy eater! My wedding day was perfect thanks to the wonderfull Alana and her fabulous photographer Kaua! She created what we had only dreamed our wedding might be. From the beautiful wedding bouquet, to the musician and his ukele, and the fabulous Dots salon where i was placed into two lovely ladies hands and made beautiful for my wedding day! My hair and make up was done more professionally and elequently then even salons in the big cities back home...To top it off I was dying to have the beautiful horses in the background in the pasture...and of course Hubert pulled through again. I wish you folks could see the pictures. My words do this place and the staff that care for you no justice. You have to see for yourself. So get in your care and drive down the Hana highway and make sure you give yourself a whole day to see each inch of it beauty...and rent a convertable! We satyed for only a few days...This is the only place i would stay on Maui. And when we return it will be for at least a week! You could not possible see and experience all this island and town have to offer. And did i mention the spa...wow! Soaking in the out door rock hot tub over looking the ocean... amazing!

There are like 2 hotels in the town, and few restaurants. If you are looking for a classic Hawaii beach/resort experience, or for convenience, Hana isn't for you. If you are looking to have some mega relaxation, unplug from the world, and enjoy incredible, unspoiled natural beauty, Hana is for you. * The \"Travaasa\" experience is designed 100% around relaxation, serenity, and natural beauty. The grounds are gorgeous and immaculately maintained, the setting so beautiful, and the activities that the hotel provides are fun and relaxing. The pricing is also designed around relaxation and peace of mind (more below) * Quick hits on what you can do at Travaasa and Hana: - Awesome beach that is a 5 minute drive or hotel shuttle from the hotel. Hamoa beach is rad though - All kinds of fun hotel activities (croquet, bike riding, hiking, ukelele lessons, lei making, etc etc) These are all free/included - Awesome, top notch spa - Beautiful infinity pool - Great restaurant, which if you get the 'sea cottages' will be 100% free/included All this great stuff comes at a pretty stiff price however. The regular rooms are in the 300-400'ish range, but then all meals/spa are extra, and breakfast averages like $25, lunch like $30-40 (including a drink or two), and dinner will be like $100 (with 1 app, 2 drinks - all per person). On the other hand the sea cottages are all inclusive, and for 900-1500 PER NIGHT (!!!) you get 100% of meals included and 1 spa treatment per day. Obviously $1K/night is incredibly expensive. But what you get for that is 100% peace of mind ... you don't have to worry about a single meal, paying for the spa, and they even have a very strict no tipping policy - everything is 100% included and you can worry about just relaxing. Additionally you get to stay in these very cute 'cottages' right by the beach. Other little issues to note about the hotel, which I don't consider a big deal at all, but that you should be aware of before booking are: * It can be a bit buggy. There will be the occasional ant attacks in the room. But these are quickly cleaned up by the staff, and it really isn't a big deal. That comes with the fact that the property is in a very unspoiled, beautiful, natural location * There is no sand beach right by the property. Hamoa beach is very beautiful and fun, but it is a short drive (they have a free shuttle, or you can easily drive in 5 minutes) away. * If you want multiple restaurants or any kind of 'night life' Hana is not for you * Getting to Hana takes 2.5-6 hours depending on if you stop (which you should, the road to hana is gorgeous!) and is a bit difficult - you'll hear the stat '600 turns and 30 1-lane bridges' - so if you are worried about a difficult drive, be forewarned - but the drive is perhaps the most beautiful drive you'll ever take in your life!

Compare that with the generic options this trip with just the Travaasa Hana stamp on each item. Times change and this hotel has gone through a bunch of them. But there was no way we'd miss Hana and an extended stay in town seemed like the perfect way to end out visit to Maui. We booked a garden cottage for 3 nights in August. We had some kinks, slow toilet needed snaking, a light switch needed replacing, our friends' screen door was a piece of work. However, each call to the front desk was responded to immediately and each problem resolved promptly. Frankly we experienced fantastic service from the entire staff our whole stay. We got into the Hana mood and spirit within a couple hours of checking in. Quiet, serene and languid. Perfect. We enjoyed the infinity pool and hot tub overlooking the ocean, ate our banana bread and fruits, courtesy of the hotel, ordered pool side frozen drinks and plotted our days in Hana. We did so little. We loved the hotel, the grounds and the offerings, free Ukelele lessons, hula lessons, cold plunges at the spa, 3 hole golf, lawn croquet with the kids, tennis (courts need fixing up a bit). Not crazy about the $10/adult/day resort fee but that was in lieu of tipping. Mini fridge stocked with water and soft drinks; call to replenish and there's a knock at the door with drinks (though soft drinks aren't cold, no big deal). No TV, no internet, no clocks in the cottages help restore and rejuvenate the soul. A great large bathroom with separate shower and a tub with outdoor views. Large unit with two queens and a sofa by the kitchen area. Large patio facing the interior lawn. Hiked to the red sand beach (what a difference, the trail is quite dangerous now, wear good shoes), drove to Hamoa beach though the hotel offers a shuttle service; they have facilities there and can provide you with beach chairs, bought avocados and apple bananas at the farmer's market for breakfast. That's about it. Ladies checked out the spa offerings one afternoon. So, if you want action, don't come to Hana and don't stay here. Visit for the day and head back before it gets dark on the \"highway\". But if you want to truly get into the spirit of the land spend a couple nights here, turn off the iphone and soak it all in.

(+ some tips)\u201d", "Author": "talula001", "ReviewID": "UR117315618", "Content": "I just came back from a wonderful stay at the Travaasa Hana hotel. Let me first make clear that we love to travel in hotels recommended by Conde Nast, Kiwicollection or SLH, and we have travelled extensively over the world in many, many high end lodges & resorts. Hana was high on our list. Now looking back to it, I loved it, but there were some issues. The main advantage of the lodge is it's peaceful location in the sleepy town of Hana. This is the Hawaii everyone should see (not the mega-resorts). I would recommend everyone to stay 3 nights as this is long enough to come to peace and take in the environment (any longer would cause boredom). The lodge is composed of garden suites (located around a well manicured garden) and after crossing a small street you enter the second part of the lodge with the ocean view cottages. It is here that the beautiful infinity pool & hottube can be found. We were first located in a garden suite, but were moved for our 2nd and 3th night to a ocean-view cottage. They are totally different, and I would highly recommend everyone to book an ocean-view cottage : these cottages are nicier decorated, have softer and thus better beds, have large terraces, and some come with private outside hottubes. At night, you can leave your window open and listen to the surf. The hotel and its environment are so peaceful you will forget all stress in a split second. Food at the hotel was pricey but good. Staff was wonderful and always helpful. Nevertheless, there are some issues that need to be addressed (and these are the reasons why I did not rate this hotel as excellent) : (1) we were with 3 friends, so we requested a rollaway bed in a 2 queen sized room. However, the quality of the rollaway beds that were provided were horrible. A very thin matras, so impossible to sleep at all. They dropped the charge of 50 US $ per night for the rollaway which was the right thing to do. (2) the extra price for a 3th person in the room was 140 US $ (excluding breakfast). This is the highest we ever encountered in any luxury hotel so far, and definately the highest we encountered in Hawaii (for comparison : St Regis princeville and Four Seasons Maui ask 100 US for a 3th adult). (3) The hotel is now part of the Prefered Hotel Group, so we booked the room with our I prefer number. When member of the latter program (free), complimentary room upgrade wil be provided at check-in when available. An upgrade was not offered to us, and we were very disappointed that night to find out that less than 50% of the hotel was full. The next day, we were granted an upgrade due to a big insect in our room that freaked out one of my friends. (4) breakfast is good, but ... before arrival, I changed our rate to a breakfast including rate because I was worried that breakfast would be to expensive when ordering a la carte (after reading reviews on tripadvisor). The difference for a room (for 3 adults) with and without breakfast was 96 US $. When breakfast was included, you could choose from a juice, coffee, and one entree. I was rather disappointed to find out that eating a la carte would have been a better deal after all, as our breakfasts never reached 96 US $ a day. I do not understand why the hotel offers a breakfast including pakkage, when eating a la carte is cheaper. I would recommend them to lower either the price of their included breakfast, or make the breakfast a free choice option (choose whatever you want as is done in many high end hotels). (5) the temperature in the hottube should be warmer (was opinion of all guests the days we were there) (6) be prepared for rain, lots of rain, as this is the wet part of Maui. Because of the climate, in room televisions/internet should be a nice touch, although I understand and respect the management's decision to keep the cottages free of electronics.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by a Hawaiian lady who provided us with fruit juice, a lei and wet towels to cool us off. Even my 10 year olds twins were \"wowed\". We were upgraded to a cottage near the beach. If we had known this hotel was as nice as it was, we would have arrived earlier so we could have enjoyed it more. I believe I had one of the nicest nights of sleep in my life...the doors were open, the Hawaiian ocean breezes blowing into the room, the sound of the ocean waves. It was as if we had the entire area to ourselves. The next morning we enjoyed the luxury of the heated infinity pool. We waited to check out until the last minute we could. If we could have stayed another night, we would have, but we were on a tight schedule and had to go. The red beach is walking distance from this hotel although we had a hard time getting someone who would tell us how to get there. We had been there before and was told the trail had washed away from erosion. There is a trail from the fence at the left of the hotel where you see the graveyard. Some of the tombstones have washed onto the beach below. The red beach is on the other side of that graveyard. It is hard to describe how to get there so I suggest you ask some locals you see walking over there. I finally found the trail to the bottom beach and then you have to go across the rocks to the other side. It's too treacherous to try to go down from above. Remember, you go at your own risk (probably why no-one at the hotel will tell you how to get there). If I could do it all again, I would allow 2 nights there and arrive at check-in time so you have plenty of time to enjoy the beauty and serenity.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cJUST LIKE COMING HOME!\u201d", "Author": "julie-bugg", "ReviewID": "UR115703012", "Content": "Oh how I love this hotel! I spent alot of time worrying about the new ownership and how it was going to affect my stay this time.

We drove from the Four Seasons in Wailea and didn't take any of our luggage, we left it in the room and planned on a quick one night stay and then would head back to the Four Seasons and complete our trip. We were so happy there we stayed a second night! My husband said there was no way we could stay any longer, he wasn't paying for two hotel rooms for a third night! But that is how much we loved it. This year we wanted to take our daughters who are 18 and 20 to Hana and this hotel so they could experience what they have only heard us talk about. I was concerned things would be different but things were WONDERFUL as they always have been. All the familiar faces of the employees with their warm, kind welcomes, all the same therapists in the spa who recognized us, the same amenities, the same level of service and enjoyment. Each time we stay there it just gets better! Do not stay here if you prefer an environment like the Atlantis Hotel in Nassau, Disneyworld, or the Grand Wailea. Those are lovely places to go, and I enjoy their kind of experience, but I also appreciate the serene, laid back beauty of Hana and the \"Travaasa\" Hotel. Nothing is quite as magical as sitting on the deck of my sea ranch cottage watching the ocean waves and Alau Island, or hearing those waves as I lay in bed at night with the doors open as the wind blows in from the sea and billows the curtains as I lay in the moonlit bedroom.

This hotel sits in a spectacular place overlooking the wild Pacific. We stayed in one of the oceanfront Sea Ranch cottages, where our unimpeded view of the waves crashing ashore was one of the best we've ever had, especially when we could see Kilauea on the Big Island looming over the horizon. We often sat mesmerized by the power and beauty of the waves. Over the years, we've found that sometimes when we paid up for a room with a view, it was worth it and sometimes not. This is definitely worth it. For those that prefer not to pay up, the view from the pool by the Sea Ranch cottages is beautiful as well. The good news for us was the quiet and serenity of the resort. If you prefer the activity and frenzy of the Grand Wailea, then this is not for you, but if you don't, this is perfect. The service was as outstanding as the view was beautiful. Since we didn't have access to a car, a very friendly staffer took us for a guided tour out to Oheo Gulch (or the Seven Sacred Pools) and Kipahula. In the Haleakala National Park, we hiked the incredible Pipiwai trail up to the 400 ft Waimoku Falls. While the Falls were dramatic, hiking through the Bamboo forest was truly magical. Afterwards, our ever helpful guide took us to a local fruit stand for delicious fresh fruit smoothies. We never would have found this great local spot without him. Not only did we get an in-depth view of Hana from a local's eyes, but we thoroughly enjoyed his Aloha spirit and lively sense of humor.

They also collect your bags and take you on a quick tour of the grounds on a golf cart which was helpful because they have a lot to offer here. The infinity pool is beautiful and the view from the pool is splendid. We did not wake up to see the sunrise, but wish we had. They also offer activities and classes (complimentary with the room) in their wellness building and the 7:30 a.m. yoga class facing the ocean was such a relaxing way to begin our very last day in Hawaii. It is a good idea to plan ahead for your meals - the restaurant is exceptional, but pricey. They do give you a basket with fruit and banana bread as well as a fridge with complimentary drinks (water & soda) and there are a couple of small stores within walking distance, but the selections are varied and pricey as well. Also, the hotel rooms have a small fridge, but no microwave or stove (at least not in our unit). We stayed in a Garden Suite. We stayed here primarily because we wanted to be more relaxed on the drive to and from Hana instead of rushing through the drive in one day.

This is the place to stay to enjoy true Hawaii and to get away from the crowds. This is going down as one of my favorite places, the hotel and especially Hana, Maui. There is no a/c, but as Floridians, we felt comfortable in anything that's not 95 degrees and 100% humidity....there's plenty of fans and the tradewinds help during the day. The resort grounds are beautiful. Walkways meander through plumeria trees and the views of the Pacific Ocean and Hana Bay are beautiful, a really unique location. It's right off the road in Hana, so some rooms, including the one we had, were backed up against the road. You'll hear the occasional loud car, but it didn't bother me. We were in room 43 and it was a bigger room, the bedroom was closed off from the living area...nice to request those rooms. The Sea Cottages looked amazing! But, the hotel recently changed ownership and those expensive cottages are to be made part of the all inclusive part of the hotel, which may be locked off from the other resort property (which means future guests might not be able to use that pool area, not sure about that but that's what staff employees say was being proposed. That would be a shame since we stayed in the regular cottages and the pool by the Sea Cottages was a highlight.) I'm not sure how the changes will affect the hotel. We heard a lot of chatter about the changes. The Hotel Hana-Maui name has been around for years and now the name has changed along with new ownership. We had a local lecture us when walking out of the hotel one day about how terrible we were for staying at a hotel that treats it's staff so poorly. I was concerned and researched online and by talking to others and found that some big changes have been made and the locals and employees may be leary. We had a family of 8 there and we all hoped that the new ownership does not change much beyond just changing the name. The hotel has stuggled in years past and no doubt to keep up with a lagging economy changes are expected, but I hope the true Hawaiian feel that we felt there stays. As for highlights.... Hike to the Red Sand beach right off the property by the Pacific Ocean side, a hidden treat. Breakfast in the only restaurant on property was delicious and came with incredible morning views of the ocean. Our family ate dinner almost everynight on our lanai by ordering room service. The staff was so sweet and helpful, especially Kaya. There are lots of activities that the hotel puts together to do, like lei making, ukulele lessons, bike rides, etc...

I have stayed in many nice hotels during my life, but Hana Maui is something else. The staff immediately makes you feel like a part of their family. You are welcomed with juice, necklaces, and a golf cart ride around the property. There is a welcome basket in your room filled with delicious local goods. Every time you encounter a staff member they greet you, and they can answer any question. But most importantly, they were not too pushy or over bearing like some luxury hotels. They gave you your space, but they were easy to find and helpful as well. The rooms and grounds were kept very clean as well. VALUE It's pricey - no getting around that, especially if you eat your meals in the dining room. There are many things included in your room rate, however, such as scheduled events throughout the day including some fitness classes, pool use, snorkeling equipment, complimentary drinks in the refrigerator, the welcome basket, etc. We stayed for two nights, and would have loved an extra day just to \"hang out\" pool side and enjoy the quiet town of Hana (we used our full day to go to Haleakala National Park to see the rain forest which was well worth it too, however). ROOMS The rooms are large, clean, and comfortable. We stayed in the garden rooms instead of the sea cottages. There is no air conditioning, but keeping the screens on the windows and doors prevents the stuffy feeling. The bathroom was large as well, and the shampoos and lotions provided were some of the best hotel toiletries I have encountered. The rooms really felt like being in old-world Hawaii. They are re-doing much of the hotel in the next year, so I'm very curious to see what will be changing. OTHER The hotel is situated on a lot of land and is very spread out, making it quiet. The main pool by the sea cottages was heated to the perfect temperature, and we were always the only ones in it. The Jacuzzi was nice too and has an ocean view. It was fun to wander around the grounds and take pictures of the great scenery. The only down side was that the hotel was not right next to a beach, just a cliff over looking the water (which was beautiful too, however). The restaurant is also very expensive, and there aren't a whole lot of alternatives in Hana. The food was great though and the service was wonderful, so the price was worth it.

On each visit we always make one trip to Hana and in recent years have usually stopped for lunch at the Hotel Hana Maui. We like the sense of peace and relaxation that you feel as soon as you walk into the hotel, so a slightly expensive lunch is a small price to pay to soak up the atmosphere, which seems to be so consistent with the feel of Hana itself. This year, after making our a day-trip visit, we decided to come back and actually stay a night at the hotel. It's really way out of our price league but we decided to splash out for one night and we're really glad we did. Our room - a garden view room in the cheapest category - was large, attractive and well equipped, without being excessively luxurious. It had a large lanai with a lovely view out over rolling lawns that sloped down to the fitness center at the bottom. A little way beyond that we could see the ocean. The bathroom was large but, although perfectly maintained, felt just slightly old, probably in need of a refit by now. There was really nothing wrong with it but at these prices I become quite picky! The room had proper coffee making facilities and a fridge - not a mini-bar (hooray!). Better still the fridge contained several cans of soft drinks and bottles of water, which were free to use. I wish more hotels would do this - the value in customer goodwill surely outweighs the modest cost to them. We're not great fans of A/C so won't at all concerned at the lack of it here. However, we were rather warm overnight, mainly because I couldn't find a way to get any movement of air through the room - there didn't seem to be any windows I could open at one end to encourage a breeze through the room. I can imagine in the full heat of summer it could be very uncomfortable. There are no TVs in the rooms (a good thing in my opinion). There's free wireless Internet in parts of the lobby area only - not in the rooms. My wife has a mobility problem for which she uses a wheelchair. Our room was fairly close to the main building and we were able to get to and from it easily with her wheelchair. Other rooms would be more difficult, I think, so it would be worth discussing this when booking. Also, the staff were very willing to take us anywhere we wanted around the grounds in their electric carts; we used this to get to and from the pool, which is some way away. The main buiding, with Reception, restaurant, bar and other common areas were all accessible. We found the staff all friendly, welcoming, responsive and efficient; just right, I would say. Overall then, the hotel is excellent - so much so that we seriously discussed staying for a second night we couldn't afford. We were less happy with the restaurant. We've lunched there many times over the years, and found the food good, the service variable, and the price high but this time of course we also had breakfast and dinner (I say \"of course\" because there's almost nowhere else in Hana to eat). Breakfast is not included in the room-rate and is VERY poor value for money. We paid $68.64 for two of us for a meal that was neither lavish nor delicious. I can't remember all the details but my wife paid $9.00 for a very small fruit salad, that consisted mostly of watermelon (surely the least interesting of melons) with a couple of strawberries, about three chunks of pineapple, and not much else. It seemed so inadequate that she ordered a portion of pineapple for (I think) $6.00, which consisted of what appeared to be one slice cut into chunks (note: in Safeway, a whole pineapple costs less than $1.00). For $15.00 I ordered french toast. It consisted of four slices of rather thick soggy white bread, with no sign that it had been toasted, and very little evidence of egg or cinnamon, etc that one might expect. Definitely the worst french toast I've ever had. Dinner was also a disappointment, though not as bad. The items we ordered were OK but not nearly as good as half a dozen restaurants we frequent elsewhere on Maui, and it was one of the most expensive meals of our whole two week visit. Please don't be put off - it's a beautiful and wonderful hotel that feels - and really is - a very long way from the crowds and glitzy hotels and condos elsewhere on Maui. We hear the hotel has new owners who are about to change its name. We just hope they don't spoil what's good about it, while improving the areas that need improving.

My husband and I were honeymooning on West Maui and took the famous \"Hana\" drive. What we didn't plan on was it taking so long. We arrived in Hana around 4pm and it was overcast and drizzling out. We had our hotel room with all of our belongings on the west side but really wanted to be able to do the Seven Sacred Pools and waterfall hike. So, we had a choice to make... lucky for us the wonderful staff at Hotel Hana were more than accomodating. They offered us the standard room at half the price for one night and then when they found out it was our honeymoon, they upgraded us to a cottage. It was a beyond incredible experience! We lucked out and had checked in on a Thursday night so we enjoyed the Manager's cocktail hour (Mai Tais and apps), then used the facilities at the spa, and the gorgeous pool even though it was raining. Because we only had *hiking* clothes with us we were limited in our dining options to room service only but how fun that was too! The food was yummy and yes, expensive but expected given its remote location and no competition. The next morning we made our own coffee (complete with a coffee bean grinder!) and enjoyed yummy banana bread and fruit compliments of the hotel on our own porch. We couldn't sleep in because we were so excited! We watched the sunrise and then headed south to hike the waterfall and the Seven Sacred Pools. Again, the attentiveness of the staff impressed us as we were allowed a late check out (I think 2pm). So we were able to come back after our hike and enjoy the beach and boogie boarding before taking showers for our road trip back to the west side of Maui. Whenever we think of Hawaii... we think of our incredible escape away to Hana. My husband says it was the best decision we made and I agree.

We each had valid reasons for our impressions, based on our individual tastes. Do you like camping? I do. If you do, you'll probably like the Hotel Hana. The Hotel Hana is a connect-with-nature no-cell-phones-please experience, where the local activities include hiking through rainforests, volcanic beaches, and horseback riding, among other things. The Hotel Hana has no air conditioning, although the temperature always remains between 70-80 degrees. The rooms do not have TVs or wifi. The primary restaurant was surprisingly good (despite some reviews we'd seen claiming otherwise), although ridiculously overpriced. Of course, it's the only \"nice\" restaurant in all of Hana, so there's no competition (nor is there probably enough of a market to create new competition). Nonetheless, I recall everything I had there -- including fresh fish, steak, and breakfast -- was quite good. The pool is beautiful, overlooking waves crashing into the rocks. The spa is serene, the perfect complement to the peacefulness of Hana. The service at the spa and the hotel was excellent. They seem to have preserved the friendliness of a small business that can escape the larger luxury brands elsewhere in Hawaii. I thought all the foregoing was wonderful, and thus the Hotel Hana seemed wonderful to me. When I found a gecko in our room it was not a crisis; I put it under a glass, took a little photo, released it outside, and went for a swim. Wonderful. My wife's experience was different. She is not a camper. Recall that East Maui, and certainly the Seven Pools area, are known as a rain forest region. That label held true in our experience, as Hana was overcast and extremely humid at all times. Think, for example, of those steamy rain forest exhibits at the zoo. The humidity aggravated my wife horribly, and she was unable to sleep -- as in, ever. And how to escape the humidity? There is no escape. The humidity is everywhere, and there is no air conditioning. You feel as though you are always in water, whether swimming in a pool or knifing through the thick air. If you have allergies or sinus issues that are aggravated by humidity, this could be a problem. After two nights of not sleeping, my wife fell on a hike returning from the Seven Pools / Haleakala National Park trail and basically lost it. She couldn't take it any more, and I started calling around to hotels in West Maui (our next destination) to see if there was any availability. Things that were only minor annoyances at first became interolable for her, such as bugs or the geckos in the hotel room. Think of a movie where the atmosphere slowly builds pressure on the character over time, ultimately escalating to a breaking point. I think that's how my wife would remember the \"Hana experience\" -- as a challenge. When we checked out, she didn't \"leave\" Hana -- she escaped. Ultimately we did enjoy our honeymoon (a week at the Wailea Four Seasons helped), but I am 100% certain we will never return to Hana. Yes, it is beautiful. But, at least for my wife, once is enough.

We arrived to find fresh-baked banana bread and a koa bowl of lush tropical fruit waiting for us. Tasty dried mango and pineapple snacks were also provided.

The service was fantastic - everyone was incredibly nice & helpful and with the no tipping policy we felt that the service was sincere. The room furnishings are fine - not five star quality in a big city, but we had no complaints. The amenities: take advantage of the classes/activities. The pilates, yoga were great. We thoroughly enjoyed our hike to Fagan's cross with Doug - he was so informative & friendly. The sea kayak/snorkling tour with Kevin was awesome. We enjoyed our massages - if you are athletic, ask for Jan. Our only disappointment was that most of the cardio equipment in the fitness center was not in working order. The food: we stayed four nights at the Hotel & the food was our biggest disappointment. Breakfasts weren't bad especially considering they were included in our package. Some were even good including the pancakes & the lox benedict. But dinners were horrendous. The service was great but the focus on our disappointment is most definitely the food. The caprese salad was fantastic - the fresh tomatoes were a highlight. But the main courses were disasters. The food was lukewarm. My husband's fish (mahi, I think) was overcooked and my \"rare\" ahi was cooked over halfway through. Another night we decided to switch to steaks and these were equally disappointing. The preparation of the food was just not good, especially at these prices. Because of our disappontment in the restaurant's food at dinner, we did eat at the Ranch Restaurant twice. The first night the ribs were fantastic. The second time we ate there, the ribs were almost inedible - the marinade was excellent, but the cut of the ribs were downright disgusting. The pork sandwich was decent. The activities around the hotel : we highly recommend the hike through the bamboo forest, the Shoreline hike at the black sand beach & the sea kayaking/snorkling with Kevin. The banana bread & smoothies at Hana Fresh are great. If you are athletic & adventurous we recommend the hike right off the hotel grounds to the small red sand beach mentioned in \"Maui Revealed\" (our new favorite guide book). Hamoa Beach is worth it - but the waves can be rough. Overall, our 4 nights here were fantastic and we will be back and recommend this hotel to others.

We ate two of our best dinners here, but after three days we were ready to move on to another town since the dining options are limited in Hana.

The hotel communal areas are beautifully decorated with some amazing art. The room we had was nice, it did appear to have been refurbished recently but still retained that 70's vibe which was fun. As the other reviewers have indicated the food in the restauraunt was amazing but really expensive although there is a sister restaurant across the road from the hotel which does good inexpensive food , we ate lunch across the road next day and enjoyed it. All in all an interesting place to stay - unique quiet atmosphere, you feel like you're away from it all.

From the time we arrived here we were treated like very honored guests. From being greeted at the car by a friendly bellman, to being escorted to the outdoor checkin area where we were presented with kukui nut leis, passion orange guava juice and fresh towels to clean up to being given private lei making lessons...we couldn't have asked for more. We were given an upgrade to a sea ranch cottage, which was by far the more desirable location over the garden cottage. The place was very quiet in terms of guest and staff. My husband had a couple spa treatments as gifts, so while he was pampered, I spent some time in the spa in the steam room/plunge pool and the outdoor pool overlooking the bay. Even as it started to rain while I was in the soaking pool, I hated to leave the tranquility of the water. The room was very old style ranch Hawaii. It was like stepping back in time with no tv or internet. It was very quaint while still being comfortable. I love to stay in a luxury resort hotel when I travel for leisure...but this was just as decadent without being pretentious. Our cottage overlooked the water and abutted the general store. Horses roamed by just on the other side of the fence. We enjoyed the fresh fruit basket, the ample supply of beverages and the generous bath products. The deck chairs were perfect for relaxing with a book, a drink and letting time go by. When I went to see about the complimentary activities going on the next day, I was disappointed to find that our somewhat early departure would preclude me from participating. When I was asked about getting involved in these activities I told the activities attendant my dilema. She happily arranged for me to do the activity I wanted, making leis, even it wasn't scheduled for a convenient time. I was able to make leis, enjoy fresh coconut milk and really make the most of my stay there. It was this attitude of going out of their way that really made this stay so special. We were so disappointed that we couldn't stay another night to really take advantage of all the hotel offered. As other reviewers have noted, this is not the newest, fanciest or most opulent hotel you will ever stay at. But I realized that sometimes those aren't the things that make you feel special or make your stay extra ordinary. Sometimes it's people taking the time to treat you well and slowing down to enjoy the beauty of nature that makes for an unforgetable trip.

Sitting in the magnificient jacuzzi (not the cheap, plastic one, but real stone) with a view of the ocean in the distance and nobody else in sight was magical. The spa would be second rate in any city with an abundance of them. But out here - after the drive down the Road to Hana - the little imperfections add to the atmosphere. Rooms are so spacious you could safely play a raquet ball match inside. I can only recommend staying in Hana, since you'll be one of the first people to see fabulous Oheo Gulch in the morning. Two downsides: Prices at the restaurants are prohibitive. I believe that a hotel that charges so much money to stay there should downsize it's prices for hotel guests at least a bit. And, to stick to the truth: If this hotel would be located in any other town on Maui, it would need to update its ground and amenities to stay in business against the stiff competition.

For fear of too many people \"discovering\" it, I hate to recommend it so highly, but I think the word has already gotten out: no place in the world compares. I have never felt such a euphoric sense of \"place.\" Being here is taking a trip back in time to Old Hawai'i, before the days of mass tourism and over-development. THIS is genuine Hawai'i, at its most authentic and naturally beautiful. I strongly recommend staying in a Sea Ranch Cottage to experience the sound of the pounding surf, and views of the gorgeous, unspoiled Hana coastline from your giant lanai deck. Ignore all reviews complaining about no A/C. We were there in August -- the hottest time of year -- and the 2 ceiling fans and ocean breezes were plenty to keep us cool (and we like it quite cool when we sleep). The service here is also superb. The staff -- many of whom are Hawaiian -- are gracious and welcoming. The all seem genuinely concerned about your happiness. The wellness pool is stunning. There are no crowds or screaming children. Gorgeous. The food is delicious. Ka'uiki and the Paniolo Lounge are obviously awesome, but we also very much enjoyed the Hana Ranch Restaurant -- a bit more casual and also very delicious. There are plenty of activities -- and they give you a sheet each day describing all of them. All are free. No nickle & diming here. Hamoa Beach is 5 minutes away by car, and also unspoiled and beautiful. The 9 hole (3 holes w/ 3 alternate tees) pitch 'n putt is fun even for beginners. Short hike up to Fagan's Cross for a great view. We'd recommend this place most strongly for couples and adults. Although kids are allowed here, the general atmosphere is peaceful, serene, and very quiet. Also, there is no nightlife for teens, and there are no waterslides etc. for younger kids. This place is really meant for adults. We will be back (and next time we'll stay 2 weeks instead of 2 nights).

Maui more than any of the other islands and while having driven the road to Hana at least 5 times in past visits, this time my girlfriends and I made it our destination for a long girls weekend. We wanted some relaxation, exercise, outdoor adventure, good food and some quality time together without the standard touristy trappings that some places in Hawaii are so famous for. We stayed at the Hotel Hana Maui and we were not disappointed. Our rooms were amazing, we stayed in the Sea Ranch cottages and each one of ours hadd a stunning ocean view and the sound of surf. Each morning we enjoyed freshly ground coffee on our lanai's (they have beans and grinders in the room for the real coffee pot, I loved it!!) Then we would go to a yoga or pilates class and a different activity each afternoon including horseback riding, surfing lessons, kayaking and spa day. While having visited Hawaii so many times, this time I felt like I was in old Hawaii, with locals who had a passion for the Hawaiin culture and folklore. It was nice not seeing any high rise hotels timeshare salespeople, or cheesy luau's. The hotel had a calming and healthy feel to it and at times I felt like I was on a private estate. For me, staying there was peaceful and relaxing; an authentic Hawaiin experience. I personally, did not even notice there was not a TV in the room until the second day and I did not miss it. The grounds were just enchanting, the whole property is single story and at night with the torches lit, the pool area looks like something out of a movie set. It was very quiet while we were there but the day we left, a wedding party was coming in so there was lots of activity. I read the review about Hubert and was quite surprised as our experience with him was completely different. He was responsive and helpful as were most of the other hotel employees. Hubert and fellow staff made our stay stress free and his enthusiam specifially was refreshing. The food in the dining room and bar was very good and along with the hotel, is under new management. Everyday there was a new special and they can do anything with ahi and I would order it again. The fresh fruit in the morning was so good and you have to try the lobster eggs benedict. We didn't have too many lunchs there but had dinner there almost every night. I enjoyed the bar versus the dining room as it felt more open and casual ,plus a couple of nights they had hula dancers and music. One night the kids and grandkids of the hula dancers came in to dance hula with them, very charming to see ages from 2 on up dancing hula. We also went up to the ranch restaurant, good food, more casual feel, great patio and that night, they had a duo playing contemporary music. Other than that, your choices are limited, just some local places which I admit, we didn't try very many. The BBQ place down the street was really good (I had salmon), but bring your own beer or wine. Hana has some activities in the area that are worth exploring as well. The hotel set up the horse back riding and kayaking but we had a rental car to drive to the park and go on the hike to the waterfalls. The kayaking also included some snorkeling and although we didn't see turtles, it was nice to jump in the water. Horseback riding was a blast ,but we went as a group so we all had fun with each other. The drive to the stables and scenery on the ride was nothing short of outstanding and our guide (Keone) was knowledgable of the area and culture, not to mention the horses! The hotel will take you to Hamoa Beach, where they had chairs and such set up if we wanted to stay ,but we chose to go back and enjoy a day around the pool. The bamboo forest and hike to the waterfall was well worth it, but go early, it gets very crowded. Spa day was our down day and I enjoyed just hanging out on my lanai, relaxing, sipping some wine. My deck had a hot tub as well. So I say definitely go to the Hotel Maui and enjoy the Hana area. Talk to the hotel staff and locals and although we ran into a grump at the fruit stand, all others were so welcoming and throughly enjoyed talking about their part of the island. Admittedly, I did some corny stuff like hula lessons and coconut tasting but in the atmosphere of the resort, it was fun and I learned so much about the plants and environment. The hotel is incredibly warm and unique, again if you are looking for a Waikiki type of Hawaii, this place will not interest you.

Although staff were friendly and the overall look of the resort was pleasing, there were important elements that were less than satisfactory, especially for a hotel as pricey as this one. The pros about this hotel are the friendly staff, cart service for guests and luggage upon check-in and check-out, no tipping policy, spa, and beautiful eternity pool overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately, the cons just cannot be forgiven. The first being no A/C in the rooms. That should be a must in a 4.5 star hotel. We did request an oscillating fan but even with that on full blast along with all 3 ceiling fans, we were still sweating at night and couldn't sleep. We even left the screen doors and windows open hoping that some breeze would enter, but it did not. And why is there A/C in some areas on the resort, such as the lobby bathroom, spa, and games room? Second, the cottage we had smelled like bug spray. I should have gotten the hint when I saw the big can of Raid in the closet. We were changed to another cottage that smelled better, however, there were ants crawling all over the bar counter, coffee maker, and sink. My husband also killed a cockroach underneath the sink, where the garbage can was. This, in my opinion, is unacceptable for a \"luxury\" hotel. And before the hotel management can say that \"Living in this magnificent natural environment sometimes poses challenges with insects, and we do strive to use appropriate measures at all times to deal with any infestation. Since your visit here in March and your encounter with ants in your room we have taken steps to make sure this is always handled in an environmentally friendly way\", as they did to a poor couple who experienced something similar 5 months prior to us, OBVIOUSLY, the problem has not been fixed.

I LOVE the bathrooms, I love the furnishings and decor, I love everything about this magical place and the thought of it changing or being gone so that I cannot return is something that would make me very very sad. During the heat of the day I visit Red Sand Beach, Hamoa Beach, spend time at the lovely gorgeous and serene swimming pool on the property, visit an ancient heaui or hike to a waterfall. As far as nightlife, what could be more wonderful than sitting outside looking at the stars that seem so close in this peaceful, beautiful one of a kind paradise.

So, after a beautiful, but long, drive to Hana, I was really looking forward to splurging for a 2 night stay at Hana-Maui. Upon arrival, I was a little thrown off by the lack of elegance I felt the place had. But, the staff were exceptionally warm and welcoming. Our room was very large, with a nice sitting/bar area and a large lanai. But, the place continued to appear dated and wasn't what I expected from what professes to be AAA 4-diamond resort. Now later, upon further consideration, I began to appreciate the \"old Hawaii\" charm that this resort has, and it really is very quiet and relaxing. But there were a number of things that I remain disappointed with. First, the bed was aweful, really aweful. I read in the hotel information that guest often comment on how well they sleep in these beds. Not sure what these guests are used to sleeping on, but I'm guessing it approximates a pull-out coach. Also, there is no A/C. This isn't such a big deal during most days and once you get the ceiling fans going and windows open, but upon arrival the room was really stuffy and it took awhile for it to air out and become comfortable. The bathroom was large, but quite dated, and the ceiling fan in that room was stuck on high and squeeked. Also, the towels seemed quite dated/used. Again, not a huge deal, but when you are paying these prices... Finally, there was the restaurant service. The prices they charge, well, I recommend not even looking at them, because you may just lose your appetite. But hey, you are in a remote area of an isolated island, so such is life. And, I wouldn't even bring it up if it weren't for the poor service. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming, but the service was really slow, from recognizing the table, to getting drinks, to getting water/coffee refills, to getting food, to getting plates cleared... you get the picture. Now, I am all for \"island time\" and just letting things roll, but this is supposed to be a 4-diamond service place, and this was way beyond \"island slow\". And, the food really isn't all that great. It had some high points, but out of 4 meals, I had to send two back because things weren't cooked or were wrong, and I could have sent a 3rd one back, but didn't feel like waiting for the re-cook. All in all, we had a nice time in Hana, you should defintely visit, but I would not spend the money to stay here again, and would probably just complete the loop and stay on the other side of the island.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Charles, LA", "Title": "\u201cWorth Every Penny\u201d", "Author": "LATaz", "ReviewID": "UR65975858", "Content": "This was our splurge!

The winds picked up at certain times so just be prepared when packing. We should have brought more for rainy or windy weather. Not to be missed: the hikes nearby are breathtaking.

It is surrounded by interesting places, such as waterfalls, beaches, jungle gardens, etc. There are activities available with snorkeling, horseback riding, and the worlds second smallest golf course. The service was excellent. The people were friendly, helpful, and seemed to take real pride in Hana and the community. They also don't nickle and dime you - there's no 'resort fee', and lots of little servce extras made us feel valued and that we weren't making cost choices but simply enjoying our stay.

My first longer stay (that was 3 nights), was my honeymoon in January 1991. Prior to that we did the usual, when you live on Maui, 1-2 nights at the most. I've enjoyed many 2 night stays at the Hotel between 1991 and 2010. I am a BIG FAN of the Sea Ranch Cottages w/ jacuzzi spa on the deck. The best ones are the 2 bedroom oceanfront suites w/ jacuzzi tub for a family or 2 couples. The bed and pillows are so comfortable, that one morning I could not peel myself out of bed until 8am (I usually get up at 6am or earlier). I would rate the bed at a 10! Room service was fast and delicious. I enjoyed one dinner (fabulous preparation of fresh fish and fresh vegies), and one breakfast (eggs benedict with fish.. my FAVORITE). YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY. As usual the staff in the dining rooms were friendly and attentive and the wine selection made my mouth water! I enjoyed a 2004 Heitz CabSav over a 2 night period. As they say in Hawaii, \"Broke the mouth\"! On Friday nights, the staff of the Hotel perform Hawaiian song and dance for the guests (a dinner show). The old timer ladies are so much fun to watch. Every night, except Friday, there is Live Hawaiian music in the Paniolo Bar from 6:30-8:30. That would be the only thing I would change. Keep the music playing at least until 9:30! THIS stay, was beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most delightful, relaxing and FUN ever. Somewhat of a Sabbatical (even though I did do some work), I managed to partake of many of the activities that YOU will want to enjoy when you come for more than 2 days (yes, you must come more than 2 nights!). 2 Thai Massages that are the very best. My therapist was Cynthia. I sit a desk all day and really need to be stretched out. This is so relaxing and you are engaged in the process (versus just lying there being massaged). There is some of that too! I also enjoyed a Watsu water treatment, which is floating in water while you are being massages and softly stretched. OMG for both of these treatments! The one hour horseback ride in the pastures in front of the Sea Ranch Cottages is gorgeous and just enough to make your bum a little sore (for someone who does not ride!). I went on a kayak/snorkel tour with Hana Bay Kayaks that was spectacular. The weather WAS stellar the whole 6 days I was there and the water as flat as a pancake! I've know Kevin Coates for years. My final big adventure was Maui Stables 3 hours horseback ride in Kipahulu. Not only is the scenery picture perfect, but the guide we had, Keone Smith, was a wealth of knowledge about Hawaiian history (some I had never heard before and I've lived here for 36 years... just how old Keone is!). Keone was witty, funny, cute, very interesting to listen to.. the perfect guide, the perfect day, the perfect Maui horseback ride! Well, honestly, the very last wonderful adventure was driving my cute little miata back home to Kula with NO CARS in front of me. A beautifious day, convertible top down, the sound of the varied thrush birds in the trees, jungle breezes freshening my face and whispering, \"be sure to come back soon, Melissa\".

We called them about the dishwasher problem and we never got a response. So for the rest of the week we washed everything by hand which was a pain because we don't even do this at home!

Even though they give you free bottled water we didn't want to contribute to the local environmental issues, so we would drink water from the tap as much as possible...guess what? By the 3rd day, all 3 of us adults had major runs. Once we stopped drinking tap water and didn't use the dishwasher, we were back to normal. Good thing we didn't give our child any local water. The dining rooms chairs were all peeling off & when you wear shorts, all the pieces would stick to your thighs & legs, etc. and made a mess throughout the house. We asked them if they could exchange the chairs & we got no response about this again. When we checked in we found rusty knives which they were able to exchange with clean ones for us. What we don't understand is how could they be charging $1800 a nite for this suite with all these problems? The staff tried their best to help us but it seems to be more of a management issue.

The Resort is beautifully manicured, quietly majestic, and subtly surrounded by the town's markets and mystical beaches. The cottages are unbelievable! Huge open rafter ceilings, amazing ocean views through barn door style giant sliding walls onto the decks and jacuzzi. Giant open bathrooms. Yet, everything is designed with an eye for privacy. The food is very special. All grown on the surrounding small scale organic farms by families and cooperatives. Beef is from the ranch on the other side of the mountain. Fresh fish, amazing sushi. The hotel restaurant had the best salad bar that my wife or I had ever experienced. Hana and it's surrounding beaches and National Park are stunning. Waterfalls and idyllic pools abound! The Road to Hana is well worth the drive. The photo opportunities are endless. Weddings, honeymoons, and anniversaries...any time you want to capture the magic of the moment or celebration, this is the place. The Resort's resident wedding and events planner is a pro and showed us countless spectacular spots for ceremonies from intimate to grand. The photographer, who has a studio on site, is a local who knows all the special hidden spots for once in a lifetime photo opportunities. The facilities are all top notch. Spa facilities and general amenities throughout are on a standard comparable to luxury spas and resorts in Los Angeles, for example. But, all is tasteful and subdued. No flash or gaudy displays, it would not harmonize with the natural beauty. The weather is paradise. The warmth and humidity are gently bathed in constant cooling breezes. Cleansing rains punctuate the days. Neither air conditioning nor heating are needed, but if you're habituated to an air conditioned environment and will be disappointed without it, then do not visit Hana. The lack of in-room television and wifi is a true blessing. The rolling sounds of the ocean and breezes are comforting enough. Time with loved ones is made more special.

To my pleasant surprise, not much has changed. The staff is still warm, inviting and helpful. The peace and solitute are still as they were. The Sea Ranch cottages are still a wonderful escape from the world. From the lanais of the sea ranch cottages, you still feel like you have your own private slice of unspoilt paradise.

The maintenance isn't flawless (the fitness center is sorely in need of an update/remodel, and the lower pool area doesn't appear to have had the landscaping touched in months--there are weeds everywhere around the pool), 2. The service isn't as seamless as it should be or as I remember (e.g., housekeeping and room service don't seem to talk to one another). Case in point: I asked a passing housekeeper for a few items for the room, including shampoo and ice. When we returned several hours later, there was plenty of shampoo, but no ice. Later, I learned that \"room service\" handles ice, not housekeeping. At a 5 Star hotel, the guest should not be bothered with such \"internal disconnects\". 3.

By that I mean it could be so much better than it is. There is the potential for it to be a world class resort but, unfortunately, there are just too many flaws with it right now. By way of background, I stayed here with my wife for one week as part of our honeymoon. I would only recommend this place to honeymooners or other loved up couples as this really is supposed to be a romantic retreat. There were a few guys there with 'friends' who must have felt very uncomfortable. Firstly, the good bits. The location is absolutely fantastic. Isolated on the east side of Maui and hours away from any large towns, the hotel is set in impeccably maintained gardens which back onto the sea shore (not a sandy beach though). (When I say isolated it's only 30-40 miles at the end of the road to Hana, but it takes about 2 hours to drive. Do not think about driving along the road to Hana unless you are a reasonably competent driver!) The hotel facilities are very good - 2 tennis courts and a pitch and putt (free to use and equipment provided), 2 swimming pools (one of which is excellent), a fitness centre, free desktop internet access, laundry facilities and the spa of course. All very nice. We had a very warm welcome when we arrived and were given a free upgrade to an ocean cottage (which would otherwise have been $100 extra per night). The cottage was large with a free minibar (in theory re-filled everyday with water and soft drinks - see below), very comfy bed, sofa and welcome basket of cake and fruit. There was an ample sized bathroom with power shower. Other reviewers seem to have encountered all kinds of nasty bugs - the only problem we had was with mosquitoes (bring insect repellant!). We also noticed a lot of geckos running around but that's it. Sadly we had a long list of gripes with the Hana Maui which tarnished our stay a little: - The number one problem with the hotel is the level of service, which is amongst the worst I have ever encountered. Should the hotel review its recruitment and/or training policies then it would improve dramatically. The waitresses at the main restaurant all seem to be middle aged local women who really really don't want to be there. One of them in particular would shout at you when taking your order. It was almost comical. You really have to see it to believe it. Whether you then got what you ordered would be 50-50 at best. Or they may choose to completely ignore you. One morning my wife actually got up and walked into the kitchen to check if anyone was still serving us. - On a similar theme, housekeeping was equally abysmal. Our mini bar was supposed to be re-filled each day but it was hit and miss whether the maid would bother to do so. Missing out on cans of coke is one thing but when you plan ahead that you're going to have 4 bottles of water in there each day and you end up with none, it can be a bit annoying! We also left a note asking for English Breakfast tea to be added to the tea selection in the room. The maid wrote back that housekeeping didn't have any (which we thought odd given that we had it in the restaurant no problem). We called the concierge and she agreed this was nonsense. The next day about a dozen bags of English Breakfast tea mysteriously appeared in our room. Also, we had a serious problem with getting clean towels. Each day we would be given only 4 towels and despite complaining each day to concierge that we needed more, we only ever got 4. Until one day when we came back and found we had been given no towels at all! Finally, as I've mentioned above, there is an issue with mosquitoes in the area. Despite this, our maid would leave our porch doors (including the netting to prevent bugs coming in) wide open, which is also a bit of a security concern. - The Hana Maui cannot be a world class, or even a 5*, hotel until it provides a greater number of restaurants serving a wider variety of food. There is only one restaurant, which serves dishes that are supposed to be a fusion of cuisines and made from local ingredients. This is fine and the food is generally very nice, but day after day it gets a bit tiresome. The menu is supposed to change daily but it doesn't, or at least it didn't while we were there. At least one other restaurant serving say Japanese, oriental, Italian or French or anything else would be welcome! The only alternatives are the local Hana Ranch restaurant (which is essentially a karaoke bar serving burgers) and the hotel bar (which is essentially a wine bar serving expensive burgers). - The cost of food and drink is outrageous. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the final bill at check out. I'm so glad that breakfast was included in my package because it would otherwise have cost us about $60 per day! - Everything closes way too early. The pool bar closes at about 5 and the restaurant stops serving at 9. Even the hotel bar stops taking orders at around 9.30! Totally bizarre. - 90 degree heat everyday, fairly high humidity, expensive hotel - no air conditioning ... anywhere ... Why?? After a morning of typically abysmal service at breakfast followed by the no towels incident we'd had enough and asked to see the manager. To be fair, he came to our cottage straightaway and was very apologetic. He offered us a free meal that evening and a voucher for 2 nights' free should we ever come back. This was the best bit of service we experienced there. Despite the flaws, the Hana Maui can be easily fixed and I'd be tempted to go back in a few years when hopefully they might have sorted themselves out.

After we were checked in, we were escorted via golf cart to our private sea ranch cottage. The grounds are beautiful, serene, and uniquely Hana. Even the drive on the golf cart was peaceful -- quite a change from the previous 8 nights at family-infested Hyatts. Admittedly, I was a little \"nervous\" when we walked into our cottage and noticed that there was no TV, no alarm clocks, and no air conditioning, but I was quickly at ease after a dip in our private patio's hot tub. Our room was stocked with complimentary water, soda, and champagne, as well as banana bread, crackers, jam, fruits, and sweets. The bathroom was magnificent. Inviting tub and wonderfully comfortable stand-up shower with a heavenly shower head. Dinner at Hotel Hana was very good the first night. We ate at the hotel's main dining room and were impressed with the service and quality of food throughout the night. We also enjoyed fresh fruit and rum beverages at the adjacent bar before dinner. We spent most of our second day at the Hamoa Beach and then the hotel pool, then back to our cottage for the hot tub and relaxation. Later in the afternoon we played the hotel's 3-hole practice golf course a few times. The hotel is great because they give you balls, tees, and clubs for free. They also gave us snorkel gear for free. No hidden surcharges, which I greatly appreciate in a hotel. Dinner the second night wasn't so great. We ventured off the main hotel grounds to the Hana Ranch restaurant. Very limited menu and painfully slow service. My steak arrived undercooked and the white rice was cold.

We ate on the property (not many options in Hana) because we didn't want to leave and come back. We didn't eat at the \"fine dining\" restaurant (we felt under dressed) but we did eat in the lounge. There was live entertainment from 6-8:30pm. The food was coming from the fine dining kitchen and it was about 25% less on the price. I had the kalua bbq pork sliders and fries. The fries were seasoned with a seaweed/salt/spice (I specially requested the upgrade on the fries) and they were amazing! My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had a cheeseburger and it was really good (huge). We self parked our cars across the street from the lobby upon check in, only to find out our suite was on the other side of the street behind the lobby.

If you prefer to go into town to eat, the bell staff will take your party to and from the location.

We called for the cart to go to dinner but ended up driving back to the second lot. Be prepared to tip if you use the golf cart service (especially if you are leaving the property). We gave $5 for the \"check in tour and ice\" and $3 for the ride to dinner. The hotel gives you a \"mahalo card\" to put money on at the end of your stay for their \"group tips\". The \"group tips\" exclude the Concierge and food and beverage. The property provides transportation, chairs, towels and bathroom facilities for guest at Hamoa Beach (voted one of the most beautiful beaches in the world).

Our room was in the sea cottages one row back from the ocean, no hot tub. About a 7 minute walk from the main hotel where the restaurant and spa is. We could hear the ocean from the room quite well and had a great view and wonderful sunrises. The bed was a little old and had indentations where people sleep. There is NO AC! It was hot and humid our entire time there and even with all the fans and windows open, it was hot and hard to sleep. The bathroom was large, shower small. They have free coffee and sodas and water all free and replenished as needed. Very nice. But there is nature all around, including an old japanese cemetary at the very left of the area on the walk to red sand beach and a very loud gecko that clicked all night long and kept us awake. Should have complained... The only restaurant has a nice bar with pupu menu. The restaurant itself was wonderful for dinner- great service. great food. We really enjoyed a chef's table dinner with a tastigng menu and paried wines- well worth it if they have it when you are there. The breakfasts were included, which is good since it is very expensive. The SERVICE at BREAKFAST was the very WORST we have had anywhere, EVER. one server we had two of the three mornings was so bad (pulani or something...) that people would wait to stay out of her station. Try to sit in the station of the lady with short hair- she looked like she did an awesome job. The food however was great! We had it delivered one day to our room and was good there too. The pool was nice and heated and clean. The hot tub over heated and could barely use- like 105 or something. The poolside bar was decent. the drinks were ok and refreshing. The spa was quite nice, and the couples massage the best we have ever had anywhere, but I would hesitate to say that the spa was one of the best in the world... the locker room were small and had a cool plunge pool and a dirty steam shower. They have a great private hot tub that was very nice. The beach is about a 10 minute drive from the hotel and they do have a shuttle. I would recommend going during the morning or early afternoon as it gets shady later in the day. One of the most beautiful beaches with tropical plants. They have free towels and boogie boards and snorkels for hotel guests, and a guy that will lay out your chairs, you just need to tip him. You can have a box lunch delivered- NOT very good. Great body surfing and snorkeling. Not very busy when we were there... gets windier as the day goes on. One other restaurant nearby is not very good- Hana Ranch. hamburgers and such, No veggie foods... The best part was the sense of being very out of the main stream- no phone or TV in any room (though one club room has a TV and internet access- wireless). The grounds were beautiful. the foliage is more tropical than any othe island I have seen. Would I stay here again, probably not, but you should experience it at least once. It was a great way to start a honeymoon and the food was delicious. I recommend driving down to the seven sacred pool area early in teh morning and doing the 2 mile hike ot the falls before everyone else does.

They have wooden plantation blinds on them that were so fragile I was afraid to try closing the rest after the bathroom one fell apart. There is nothing seperating the shower from the rest of the bathroom...no curtain or anything (felt like I was back in Italy) as the entire bathroom is all tile. It just made me feel like I had to wear my flip flops in there. The bathtub looked really dirty and was surrounded by window that could be seen from the main walk way. As I mentioned earlier there is a local park very close and anyone could just walk right into the building so it was a little scary at night. The room did stock the fridge with drinks and bottled water that was included at no charge and they left some nice dried fruit and banana bread for us along with a bottle of \"bubbly\" for our anniversary. The property itself is beautiful with flowers all over the place and the events they had did look good, though we didn't have time for them since we only stayed overnight. If you're going to stay I would at least book 2-3 days. I think any other time of year it would of been very quite and nice but since we had the relay to contend with (something I think the hotel should of mentioned when I booked) the feeling as wasted on us. They also make it sound like they have a private beach for the hotel but it's not private, anyone can go, it's just that the hotel has a little cabana that puts out some chairs for you. When we went it was very crowded with young, loud people getting ready to build bonfires so we left. Service was slow here and it took over 30 minutes for someone to come get us and our luggage when it was time to go (you can not drive to the rooms) and that was after we called a second time to remind them we had a plane to catch later in the day.

While we were at the hotel, we got married and celebrated part of our honeymoon; we could not have picked a more beautiful, intimate, and romantic location to officially begin our lives together. A few things potential guests of this hotel should know: There are NO TV's, radios, or clocks. If you are the type of person that must be surrounded by technology or obsessively check your Blackberry, then THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. Also, you are immeresed in nature, so you will occasionally experience bugs (the hotel provides you with bug spray in the room) and while there are fans and screens in the room, there is no air-conditioning...it's not that hot anyway. Open the windows, wear some bug spray when hiking around the property, and become one with nature.This hotel experience is about quite literally getting away from it all, so arrive with that type of attitude. Needless to say, my husband and I loved it. We stayed in a sea ranch cottage with an ocean view and jacuzzi. During most of our stay, we felt like the only people at the resort, that's how quiet and relaxing it was. Just the sound of the surf, an occasional bird call, and the star-gazing for entertainment. Perfection. Food is quite expensive at the resort, probably because of the remote location, not much competition for business, or a combination of both. Recognizing this fact from other reviews we had read, and knowing that our room would include a sink, fridge, and small kitchen area, my husband and I went to a supermarket near the airport and stocked up on some basics, even buying a small styrofoam cooler to keep perishables cool on the drive to the hotel (the Road to Hana takes a few hours, especially if you stop for side trips, but what an amazing journey and well worth exploring). Breakfast was included with our stay, so we'd eat a hearty breakfast and snack on our grocieries for the rest of the day. I'm a bit of a spa-afficiando and the Honua Spa is one of the best-maintained in the business. Treatments are extremely expensive (probably because of that \"only-game-in-town\" reason again), but you do have complimentary access to the locker rooms, steam room, plunge pools, and jacuzzi. It was so clean and beautifully decorated and I had the amenties to myself most of the time. A truly relaxing experience. My husband and I generally prefer \"boutique\" hotels as opposed to chains, meaning that we really appreciate old-world charm, historic architecture, and cultural influence as opposed to the \"this could be anywhere\" blandness of many chain hotels. At the Hotel Hana, many of the employees are locals and will gladly \"talk story\" with you, the prints on the linens and wall art in the rooms were comissioned by local artists, food is prepared in that \"locavore\" spirit, and there are classes offering hula dancing, lei-making, and playing/singing the ukelele (in which the instructor gives you an explanation of the history/cultural significance behind each art). Our wedding coordinator was Alana Ross and she was so warm and helpful throughout the entire wedding process. She arranged for our wedding liscense appointment to occur shortly after landing in Kahalui and she thoughtfully picked a time and location that would be convenient to the airport. She took care of absolutely every detail: flowers, lei for my husband, pressing of clothes, music, photgrapher, makeup, hair...the only thing my husband and I needed to do were make sure we brought our wedding attire! Some of the nice touches she included were to type up a minute-by-minute schedule for our big day, so we would know what was happening. My nails were wrecked from all the sun and surf I had been enjoying in Waikiki before our arrival to Hana, so she booked and DROVE me to a local woman to do my nails. During the service she made me, the nervous bride, feel completely at ease, extra bobby pins, makeup, and water at the ready. She even took photos with our camera so that we would have instant memories before our photographer could process all of his shots. The hotel is on the pricey side and I wouldn't think this is the best environment for kids. But I could not think of a more unique or romantic place to spend time with the person you love.

Given the great reviews of Hotel Hana, we planned our tour to include 3 nights in this luxurious but secluded location. However, we were very disappointed with the overall experience: 1. food is bad, and extremely over priced (for example the $50 /person buffet barely included some vegetables /salad , basic chicken + rice , and some shrimp/ scallops that were not fuly done.) 2. we woke up one morning to find a spider right in the middle of the room (the big and hairy kind that made me go \"wow, interesting creature\", but would totally have made my wife scream had she seen it first ). 3. we went to bed one night to find a bug within the sheets -yes, she did actually scream this time as a result. 4. on our last night we took an evening/ late night swim in the pool (which is probably the only thing I really enjoyed there) and all of a sudden 4 teenage hudlum-looking guys in shorts come running toward us, and eventually make their way to the outdoor jacuzzi, one of them whispering \"wassup dog\" while passing me and my perplexed reaction. We alerted the front desk and as it turned out, these were local kids, coming to enjoy the awesome Hana (by far the most developed undertaking in the whole of town Hana) hoping no one would see them. Front desk told us they had been chased away, but at that point the damage was done : we were already back in our room, wondering how safe we truly are in our cottage and on this wide perimeter that has no real gates, fences or barriers with the surrounding town. 5. everything is massively over-priced, and almost everybody expects a tip (for example the yoga instructor (my wife said she wasn;t even that good) suggested she be tipped); daily breakfast would have cost us $62.00 had it not been included in our package (and that's for plain eggs , OJ and coffee for two - nothing earth shattering) 6. they have no carpets in the entire cottage (we had the Ocean front ) , the bamboo floor in the room is sticky and does not feel great to walk barefoot on. No A/C ... and the cottage is very noisy when it rains , if you are trying to sleep (no choice there really) with windows open. 7. although the place would be ideal for a romantic get-away, our quiet and enjoyable day at the pool one time got ruined when a family with 3 very noise young kids totally took control of the pool and turned it into their private playground.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWhat's not to like?\u201d", "Author": "WashingtonChicago", "ReviewID": "UR35582101", "Content": "Wonderful plush hotel in the middle of nowhere.

My wife and I stayed here the first two days of our honeymoon before going to the other side of Maui. By the end of our stay here we really regretted only booking two nights. This hotel is by far the nicest place we both have ever stayed. If we could do it again we would have stayed here for the entire time we were in Maui which was 5 days. We arrived after 10p.m. after over 18 hours of travel our first night and couldn't wait to just go to sleep. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and driven to our beautiful room by golf cart. We were upgraded to a deluxe sea ranch cottage which was awesome. In our room was a hand written note thanking us for choosing the hotel for our honeymoon and letting us know there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the fridge. There was bread and fresh fruit as well. The fridge was stocked with complimentary soda, juice and water. I would compare the rooms at this hotel to a bunch of duplex beachhouses. The interior is open with vaulted ceilings and exposed truss beams. Our room had a huge bathroom, comfortable king bed, sitting area and breakfast/kitchen area. When we woke up the next morning we couldn't believe the view. The pictures don't do this place justice at all. The hotel is set on miles and miles of property owned by the Maui beef company. On one side of the hotel is a beautiful, rocky ocean front, on the other side are amazing mountains littered with grazing cattle and not much else. A really unique place. Rarely did we see more than 2 or 3 other couples at any one time during our entire stay and this includes sitting by the pool during the day. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful without being intrusive. We only ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was extremely good albeit expensive. We took the shuttle to the public beach which was nice. In the summer there's just enough surf to make it fun but no so much to make it scary to swim in. As others have said, this place is not for everyone. Being that you are in a one story cottage with no air conditioning, you will be sleeping with the windows open. There are lots of birds so if you're a light sleeper and being woken early by them will bother you then you should consider this before booking. Also, being so close to nature also means dealing with some bugs (theres a can of raid in every closet.) We only saw one or two live bugs in our room over our two day stay although I did see a couple dead ones that I guess the cleaning staff missed. Overall though, the room felt very clean. I highly recommend the horseback ride. Our guide was a local girl who was very down to earth while being informative as well. I won't go on and on, although I could.

On the other hand, if you love to hear ocean waves, are easily impressed by magnificent scenery, enjoy just walking about and chatting with people and are looking for a quiet retreat this is the place for you!

Our cottage was huge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots of space both inside and on the deck. Yes, the cottage could use a little fresh paint but gee, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hawaii and on the ocean front.

We either passed on lunch or ate at the Hana Ranch up the street from the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very satisfactory sandwiches and salads.

The main dining restaraunt at the hotel was very good - my wife really enjoyed the fish and the steak I had was good. We ate one night at the hotel bar and found that satisfying, as well. We ate a late lunch at the Hana Ranch (at the take out) and while my wife enjoyed her fish sandwich, I was not too crazy with my chicken sandwich. We also found the service and hotel employees super nice, friendly and accommodating. For those interested in this hotel - please know that the hotel is very secluded and your goal should be to relax. Also, try to get anything you need on the other side of the island because nearly everything is more expensive in Hana (A gallon of milk is $9.85 and a gallon of gas is over $3.50). Overall, we had a very positive and relaxing experience.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oregon", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommend, and check internet specials\u201d", "Author": "bhoppy", "ReviewID": "UR27451645", "Content": "Prior reviews pretty much say it all, and it is expensive, but with the downturn in the economy the Hotel Hana is much more affordable if your check their website, but yes, still spendy.

The drive to Hana is extraordinary and worth so much more than a day trip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even after four days of exploring the area, the scenery and natural beauty of the area never failed to deliver. The highway south of Hana towards Haleakala National Park is, in a word, jaw-dropping. We were treated to gorgeous waterfalls, pristine tidal pools and glorious coastal vistas. Do not miss this part of Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.it is true aloha spirit, free from the hordes of tourists, tacky eateries and ABC stores! We enjoyed a four night stay at the Hotel Hana-Maui in the glorious sunshine. After hearing from hotel staff and locals that it had rained constantly for the previous weeks, we were blessed to enjoy this spectacular location in its full glory. The resort is simply stunning. Set on expansive grounds bordering Hana Bay, the resort is gorgeous, peaceful and very much the Maui that I have always imagined! The grounds are well cared for, the pools and hot tubs welcoming and the spa facilities were wonderful - outdoor showers, steam rooms and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lava\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hot tubs provided solace and relaxation at the end of every day. We booked a garden view junior suite with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explore Hana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package. Even with the free night and the resort credit, the cost bordered on prohibitive even despite that we were in the lowest class of rooms. The room itself was spacious and comfortable, if not a bit weathered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we overlooked the grounds and had a nice view of the pool and Hana Bay. Save for some noise from the mini-fridge, the room was quiet and peaceful with a nice lanai. The furnishings and d\u00c3\u00a9cor are a bit dated, however, and a bit dark in the evening (lots of natural light in the day). True to other reviews, there are lots of ants and you cannot leave food or toiletries out. The hotel staff was gracious and welcoming, particularly those at the concierge, valet and Hamoa Beach. We were always able to get fresh beach towels, water and directions! The private facilities at Hamoa Beach are a nice touch and we really enjoyed our day there, and we also enjoyed the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cocktail party (yummy mai tais!). The yoga instructor was really good as well. The one very substantial drawback about Hana, however, is the lack of dining alternatives. While the hotel provides mini-fridges, cooking in the room is not an option as there are no barbeques or kitchen facilities. You are very much at the mercy of the hotel when it comes to food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that, we found out, was a very expensive proposition indeed. There are basically only three options \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel restaurant, the lounge and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hana Ranch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant just down the street. There are a couple of more casual, local places with BBQs, but certainly not the dining options you have in say, Paia or Makawao. The hotel restaurant fell very short of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the chef is clearly trying to be inventive, the menu selections were odd, the portions too small and the prices ridiculous. The main courses at dinner run $30-35, wine by the glass $12 upwards and cocktails $10 and up. The lounge menu is extremely limited and pricy as well, but not as bad as the restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we did enjoy the burgers there. The service in the restaurant was just plain lousy most of the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one morning at breakfast I received my meal and then never saw the server again! The same morning, I had a conversation with one of the busboys outside the restaurant while checking the breakfast menu after returning from my morning run\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6when I returned to eat he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even remember that I was the same person he had a conversation with fifteen minutes previously! In addition, we were very put off by the fact that locals dining in the restaurant seemed to receive preferential treatment\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.extra large fruit trays and scones in the morning, servers oozing over their tables while we could not get a word in edgewise. Our four days in Hana were magical and we will return to this area. We would recommend Hotel Hana-Maui, on the caveat that the hotel has some hiccups with pricing and its food service.

I'll get my only complaint out of the way. The Disappointment of the food. They actually seemed to master the bar menu foods, which I actually thought were quite good. The main dining room was very disappointing - I would recomend saving yourself $30 on the fish and just go for the cheeseburger in the bar. I had to send my appetizer back twice and was not impressed witht the oddly concocted fish dish I ordered at our last meal of our honeymoon. Did't let it spoil my overall feeling though. After being nickled and dimed to death on parking and safe fees and the like at OTHER resorts (I will also be reviewing) around the island that were just a tiny bit cheaper, I was pleased to find that almost everything (except food and drinks) was included at the Hotel Hana Maui. Not just the large stock of Water, Juice, Pop, Champagne and Grind Your Own beans coffee, we had unlimited access to the excellent spa facility and a wide range of amenities to do indoors and out. We had a larger garden cottage. The room was very spacious, comfortable, neat and well stocked with quality linens and furniture and a basket of fresh papya and other hawaiian foods to snack on. Attention to detail and service is obviously a constant at this hotel. They even seemed to inform all the managerial staff that my wife and I were the newlyweds in town. We were congratulated even by the building engineer at the manager's Thursday cocktail reception. The hotel was hardly booked when we were there, so we fortunately were able to sign on for a third night here and extend our stay. Pretty well all of Maui had beather weather during our stay in Hana, so it definitely rained in Hana about 90% of our stay, and we still loved it deeply. Could never say that being cooped up in the rain at some resort on the beach. The best part of this experience, and I can't stress this enough - I would have a difficult time truly capturing the serenity and beauty of this place in words - you have to experience it. The hotel is the social and geographic center of town and is the largest employer in the area. So, most of the staff are locals and many of the locals come to the hotel and are very friendly. It really felt like were a part of the town for our stay, which is a really nice feeling after I felt most other parts of the island had a lot of anti-tourist attitudes that could be felt and seen at times. The town of Hana is so nice and is a place that will stay in our hearts and minds for a long time.

Its the kind of place that makes you stop and think to yourself what a priviledged life you've lived to even be at such an amazing location. Everywhere you look is simply breathtaking. They have done an outstanding job with their landscaping. Very impressive and you will not be disappointed. The spa is fabulous. I had the best massage of my life there. You can use the spa facilities for free (services are expensive but top quality). For free you can do the detox steam therapy which basically consists of using the steam room and then getting into the freezing cold plunge pool, back in to the steam room, then to the hot tub, and then a cold shower. Its really a nice treatment, you should try it if you go. The spa hot tub built out of lava rock is facing the ocean and overlooks a rock pond with a fountain. Its stunning and so serene. I kept thinking to myself as I was in the hot tub what a lucky person I am to be experiencing all of that beauty and I felt sorry for all of the peole who will never make it to Hana. It is something that should be experienced by everyone. Truly spectactular. We had a sea side cottage and it was nice and spacious. There is a little kitchen with a small fridge, a sink, and a coffee maker but not microwave or oven (which would have been nice considering how bad the restuarnat is). They had a small basket of food and fruit for us which was really nice. The bed is comfortable and the room is clean. The view is to die for. I loved sleeping with the glass doors open and the sreen closed. The sound of the ocean was so relaxing and a real treat! The bathroom was not that nice. It was pretty ugly, but clean. The lighting is awful. I ended up just using the spa facilities to get ready every night. The lighting is way better and the counter was bigger. I recommend doing the same if you stay here. It worked out perfectly actually because we timed our days so that we were doing the spa detox thing in the steam room around five thirty and I would just get ready there after I did the shower portion of the treatment. I reviewed the restaurant elsewhere, please see that review for more detail but the short version is that it is horrible and because it is the ONLY option for dinner in Hana and surrounding area, it feels like a cruel joke to be in such a beautiful amazing place but have nothing to eat. Yet, despite all of that, I will definitely be back because I just can't imagine never seeing Hana again. You have to go, at least once. We were there two nights, wish we'd stayed five.

We decided to make a trip to Maui on a whim. There were non-stop flights from Seattle so we decided to give it a try. We stayed at Hotel Hana for 3 days/2 nights, and had we known it was going to be that relaxing, that beautiful and beyond our expectations in every respect, we would have stayed the entire trip there. The drive over to Hana from Kahului was a great way to begin the trip. The drive isn't nearly as daunting and dicey as books/websites make it out to be. Don't get me wrong, there are some dicey sections of the road but all the drivers we encountered were courteous and seemed to be careful as well. The drive is beautiful and breathtaking in many spots, and is a great way to be introduced to the beauty of the island. So we arrived fairly late in the afternoon at the hotel, but were still greeted with enthusiasm. The staff was very inviting and knowledgeable as well. We were given a sunset tour of the grounds as we were driven to our seaside cottage. The room was amazing and very much captured the spirit of being on the island. From our cottage we were able to watch an amazing sunrise over the Pacific Ocean. We had gone in the fall but I have read complaints that it maybe too hot in the summer in the cottages because there are only ceiling fans and no air conditioning, but for an October trip, the days were warm and the evening were cool. The temperatures were perfect. And the sound of the evening rain was a relaxing way to fall asleep. Days at the Hotel are wonderful. There are bikes available and riding around the grounds is a great way to get yourself acclimated. And a shuttle to the beach is also offered. Service at the beach is great as well. We were set up with lounge chairs and an umbrella as soon as we arrived and towels, toys, boards are all available there too. The infinity pool is great as well. Now to the downside. It wasn't necessarily a downside for us, but for many people it could be. There are no clocks, televisions, or internet connections in any rooms. Television and Internet is available in one spot on the whole grounds though. This hotel is really a place for those who want to completely get away from it all. If you plan on coming here, plan on leaving your regular life behind and relax. Also, being that Hana is the only town for miles, there's one place to eat and that's the hotel. The food isn't bad, but sometimes you just want to venture out you know. In conclusion, we would gladly make another trip to Hotel Hana, but in the future, it will definitely be for longer than 2 days.

The Hotel Hana Maui is one of those special places. My family and I stayed here for five nights over the week of Christmas 2008. We took both rooms (219/220) of a Sea Ranch Cottage that was about as close to the ocean as you could get and we loved every minute of our stay. I had been looking forward to coming here for years and, after the temporary tourist chaos of Honolulu, the inter-island flight to Maui and the three hour drive along the famed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Road to Hana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was pretty wound up when we arrived. But the Hotel Hana Maui has an extremely soothing effect on the soul, you just need to let it take effect and calm you down. The hotel grounds are stunningly beautiful and immaculately maintained. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize that the hotel was actually made up of two separate and distinctly different areas: the Bay Cottages (which extend from the main building and are spread out across huge expanses of lawn) and the Sea Ranch Cottages (plantation style units which are across Hau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oli Road below the fitness center/wellness pool/hot tub area and stretch across a wide open grassy knoll cascading down to the coastline.) Unit #220 was a suite with a huge, comfortable living room, large king bedroom and connecting bathroom that had separate shower, tub, toilet and counter areas. (It would have been nice if the counter had two sinks instead of one.) Both the living room and bedroom had access through sliding glass doors to the expansive covered lanai which included a hot tub. It had a small refrigerator (which was replenished daily with sodas and half & half for coffee) coffeemaker and fresh coffee beans. Unit #219 was a smaller unit with its own, separate entrance that featured two queen beds, a similar bathroom and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own, private deck. No radios and no television? No problem. It was a perfect cottage for our family, offering a front-row center view of Hana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spectactular sunrises and pounding surf. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop staring at the beautiful view and I never got tired of swimming in the Wellness Pool, a beautifully designed infinity pool with a small soaking pool and cascading mini-waterfall on one end and the hot tub on the other. The pool area is ringed by lava rocks and surrounded by swaying palm trees and gorgeous landscaping. There are lots of comfortable lounge chairs and several hammocks but I seemingly spent hours floating in the pool, intoxicated by its location, view and atmosphere, staring up at the sky and letting it wash over me. Because of Hana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remote location, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mad dash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of hotel guests trying to stake out their lounge chairs in the morning. In fact, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mad dash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of any kind here at all. Things just move at their own relaxed pace and I often found myself enjoying the pool staring out at one breathtaking view, and then rotating 180-degrees to enjoy another one. Everywhere you looked, it was beautiful. We also enjoyed the highly-regarded Honua Spa, which lived up to its sterling reputation. Members of my family were pampered with ninety-minute Lomi Lomi massages from a world-class therapist, a Thai massage and facial. (Morning yoga classes are available, too.) The spa rooms opened up to the outside which allowed the flower-filled air and sound of birds to fill the treatment rooms. There was a separate soaking pool nearby. The men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well appointed locker room offered comfortable robes and slippers, a steam room, cold \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dipping pool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (that was out of order during our stay) and a great, outdoor shower. It was really easy to get in a mellow mood here! We took all of our dinners at the Kau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122uiki restaurant, preferring to enjoy the covered lanai section. The meals are delicious (although I found the portions somewhat small) the wine list is good (but expensive) and the service staff is well trained and first rate. The day before we left, they began a really good breakfast buffet service that includes a made-to-order omelet station but otherwise we bought yogurts, cereal and milk in the nearby Hana Ranch Store and ate breakfast in our room. (Beware of ants! This is a tropical climate and an army of ants can descend upon the smallest of crumbs in an instant if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not careful!) The adjacent Hana Ranch Restaurant no longer serves dinner but they have a pretty good plate lunch and there are a few other small places to have lunch nearby. One of my best memories of the trip was a special Hawaiian music and dance show performed on Christmas Day in the Kau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122uki restaurant following dinner. Local musicians were accompanied by various groups of dancers to the delight of guests. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your typical, touristy Hula show because practically all of the musicians and dancers were family members spread across many different generations. The leader of the festivities and the matriarch of the group was a woman in her 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It was good, honest music and a very sweet memory. Because the Hotel has been the main employer in the area for many years, all of the employees either seem to be friends, family members, or married couples. And everyone who works here always seemed to be smiling and friendly. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stable just across the Hana Highway behind the gas station and horse rides are available. My wife and kids enjoyed what they said was an unforgettable ride in rolling pastures adjacent to the ocean. At the end of the day, the horses are allowed to roam free and eat grass in some fenced pasture area right between the water and where the hotel property begins. One evening, a couple of horses figured out a way to get through the fence and started running around the grassy slopes of the Sea Ranch Cottage area. Watching them run free was pretty interesting, but watching some of the Hotel employees try to chase them down in golf carts, playing modern day mechanized paniolos was hysterical. Exploring Hana was quite enjoyable, too. Since our family was there over Christmas, there was a service that day at St. Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Catholic church and I enjoyed watching locals come out for that. But right across the street, there is the older, Wananalua Congregational Church (that was open but unoccupied the afternoon I stopped in with a small cemetery along the side that offers a fascinating history lesson in to some of the area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier residents. Hanging around the pier at Hana Bay was fun, too and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the view from Fagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cross. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plainly visible from down below and can be quite an uphill walk but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth making the effort. There is supposedly a shuttle bus that takes guests to nearby Hamoa Beach but we never saw it in service during our stay there. There is no parking at the beach itself and only limited parking on the side of the road at the top of the steps that lead down to the sand. Hamoa Beach is a pretty nice spot, but the hotel postcards make it look a little more luxurious than it really is. Continuing up the Hana Highway past the hotel, we stopped briefly at O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122heo Gulch but Haleakala Park Rangers had banned swimming in any of the pools because of fast-moving runoff from heavy rainstorms. That gave us time to hike up towards Waimoku Falls and we made it as far as the beautiful bamboo forest before becoming soaked to the skin in a torrential downpour that made us reluctantly retrace our muddy steps. A little further on up the Hana Highway is the Lau Lima fruit stand on the right where the blender for the best smoothies we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had is powered by pedaling a stationary bicycle! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a first. As far as the famed Hana Highway goes, I like to drive and enjoyed navigating all the twists and turns (or which there are hundreds) and our family enjoyed the sights and sounds of nearby waterfalls just off the highway and the beautiful coastline vistas. But I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy the oncoming traffic, especially from my fellow tourists. Locals seem to be able to drive the road much faster than out-of-towners, and it always made sense to give them the right of way or let them pass, which usually resulted in a friendly wave of acknowledgement. But tourists at the wheel gawking left and right seemed to always take a direct path smack dab down the center of the road, rarely yielded and the concept of common courtesy seemed completely alien to them. There are lots of tour vans making the drive, too and the road can get extremely busy at certain times. When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent five days in almost utter solitude, the drive back to civilization can be a huge shock. A good measurement of how much you enjoy a place like this is how difficult it is to leave and for us, it was almost impossible to tear ourselves away. I could easily have spent more time there, and would very much like to return someday. Now back home, when I find that I need a little peace and mental serenity, I try to imagine myself floating in the wellness pool or sitting on a comfortable lounge chair sitting on the grass at the far end of the Sea Ranch Cottages listening to the sound of the pounding surf and staring blissfully out to a never ending sea. Time definitely stands still here and you will probably wind severely testing your budget at the Hotel Hana Maui, but paradise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t free.

Clearly, if you're going to stay at the Hotel Hana-Maui, you're going to drive the gorgeous \"Road to Hana.\" After all the amazing scenery along the drive, you'll still be impressed by the grounds at this hotel - which were lush and immaculate. You'll also enjoy the greeting by the staff (fruit juice and leis) - a welcome break after the intense drive! We stayed in one of the Sea Ranch Cottages. These cottages, located across a small street from the main property, are quite private (two cottages to a building, but we hardly saw anybody and never heard our neighbors). No TV and no internet access in the rooms helps with the \"get away from it all\" feeling. (there is a TV and computer with high-speed internet access in the business center) The cottage was well equipped inside (kitchenette with coffee & snacks provided, bathroom with soaking tub and luscious bath products, comfy bed), and also had a lovely porch overlooking the water. I stepped out onto that porch and was overwhelmed at the beauty surrounding us - I wish everyone I know could go to this hotel! My only regret about the room is that there wasn't an alarm clock (yes, I know it takes way some of the relaxing feeling, but it's important when you have to wake up to check out). We enjoyed the Friday night Hawaiian-themed dinner and show at the hotel's restaurant. We weren't really sure we wanted to be there for the program, but it turned out to be a great experience. The program felt like a hometown/family celebration with musicians, singers, and dancers from the hotel staff and their families. It wasn't a big production with faux culture, but was instead very authentic and personal. The food was excellent - both at dinner and at breakfast the next morning. We enjoyed walking along the shoreline, taking the walk up to Fagan's Cross (which is more intense than it looks), and sitting in the pool & hot tub. In a word: \"peaceful.\" We hope to return someday - staying longer next time.

We stayed in a private house up in the hills, and when we visited the Hotel Hana Maui, I decided that's where I would go for my honeymoon. Nearly 20 years later, it finally happened. We spent 5 nights here before going to Wailea on the other side of the island, and the Hotel Hana Maui was everything that I remembered, and more. We booked the least expensive sea ranch cottage they had, and even on special it was expensive, there's no real getting around that. But it was wonderful. We arrived in the evening, after a calming evening drive on the Road to Hana. We took our time and enjoyed it. Top down in a convertible (highly recommended for those who might get carsick), the sounds and smells of Hawaii eased us after a long flight from the mainland and a hectic week of wedding stress. We pulled into the torch lined circular drive and were greeted with fruit juice, a cool towel and fresh leis that were incredibly fragrant. We checked in to find we had been upgraded to an ocean view cottage. Room 207 was quaint and comfortable. On the table sat fresh banana bread, snacks and champagne glasses. In the fridge, alongside the complimentary drinks, was a cold bottle of bubbly. We rolled open the large glass doors to let in the cool ocean breeze and the sound of waves pounding the rocks below. Perfect. In the morning we had coffee on the lanai as the sun came up. Could this get any better? In a word, yes. Not knowing what to expect from our complimentary breakfast, we made our way across the beautifully lanscaped grounds to the dining room. This was no breakfast buffet, it was an honest gourmet breakfast that please Zagat, or at least us. Each morning we tried different dishes, everything from standard bacon and eggs, to pulled pork with poached eggs, to seafood eggs benedict, etc. Is there anything more wonderful than sitting on the patio at the Hotel hana Maui enjoying jackfruit jam on a freshly toasted english muffin? I think not. During breakfast and dinner, we saw some of the other guests, but most of the time the entire hotel was pleasantly deserted. I know that Nov is low season and hope it was not more a function of slow economic times. After our first night, the manager contacted us and told us that as a wedding gift to us, we were again upgraded. If we liked, an oceanfront suite with jaccuzi (#409) was ours. It was very nice and quite spacious. We accepted, although it lacked a bit of the coziness of our first room. The reviews by \"hollydc13\" and \"kingfriday\" are spot on. Massages were great. Staff was friendly & helpful. Food was excellent, though pricey.....\"the best $17 cheeseburger I've ever had\". The friday night buffet and show was very nice and worth the price. Late eaters might be frustrated with the lack of options after sundown. Just plan ahead and you'll be fine. Take the opportunity to eat from the locals grilling along the road. We passed one by planning to have lunch there the next day, but for the next 3 days, they were never cooking again. Doh! In my opinion, Hamoa beach is perfect. It's beautiful, small and uncrowded, although my wife was not a fan of the waves. She preferred the calm waters of Maui's south side. Sacred pools are less busy in the morning. Go a day or 2 after a rain as the day we went, the water was not moving much. Lindbergh's grave, black sand beach, red sand beach are all worth visiting. It was wonderful to see that after 20 years, not much had changed in either Hana or the hotel. Hasegawa's had moved (after a fire in 1990) and there were a few new structures. But in this world of bigger is better, Hana is pretty much a holdout....and for that, it will always be special to me. Yes, it's expensive.....but all of Hawaii is expensive. The Hana Maui is not the Four Seasons. It's much more casual, and the staff really doesn't fawn all over you, although I suppose they would if that's what you wanted. I don't understand any of the negative reviews, but we are not hard to please people. This place is all about relaxation, and there it scores an A+. I finally made it back to Hana, and promise........\"we shall return.\"", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cParadise\u201d", "Author": "hollydc13", "ReviewID": "UR22834792", "Content": "As a gift to us, my husbands parents surprised us with these accommodations for part of our honeymoon stay. After a long day on the road to Hana it was so lovely to arrive at this beautiful location. First off - let me stress that if possible, stay over night in Hana so you can do the entire drive on Hana Highway and you don't have to make a round trip in one day. Anyway - we arrived in Hana and found out we had been upgraded from a garden view to a delux ocean view. How exciting! We are then greeted by the bellhops who brought us each a lei flower and a cool towel and fresh juice - again so thoughtful and refreshing. Our room was larger then our apartment in new york city. Now i know that's not THAT hard to beat- but it was gorgeous. The bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower. huge sink area. There is a bar area with a mini fridge and safe to hide valuables. The hotel gave us a gift basket with banana bread, nuts and fruit. Complimentary drinks in the fridge that got restocked as needed (we didn't need them restocked, they gave us so much to start with) The view deserves its own paragraph. Incredible stretch of sky and ocean. I drank my morning coffee on the balcony and watched the waves. I took a yoga class while there - only one other person was with me so it was almost like a private lesson - it was my first yoga class - i loved it. I wish i had more time to take them here. NYC is a very different pace. The food at their main dining room is delicious. We had breakfast and dinner there. It was definitely expensive, but everything was delicious. we ate in the bar the first night which really is just a more casual restaurant - its still very lovely. On Friday evening there was a buffet and hawaiin show -a traditional show not like the touristy shows you'd see on the other side of the island. However for $50 a person its VERY expensive, so arrive hungry. My Husband and I had a couples massage while we were there. It was so incredible. they were gentle and relaxing. My husband thinks he fell asleep during it he was so relaxed. Afterwards we used the spa facilities. The steam room is great, the cold plunge is SOOO cold, but fun to try. the hot tub overlooks the beautiful ocean (they have another hot tub on the other side of the hotel that is equally as gorgeous) Their lotions and shampoos smell so yummy I had to buy some lotion to bring home and remind me of my wonderful trip (i savor it) The one negative thing I have to say about this hotel (besides the price which actually for the attention you get i think its not that bad) is that there is no beach access - you have to take a shuttle van that only leaves i think 4 times a day in each direction. We had to wait for our shuttle for 20 minutes we called the front desk twice to make sure its still coming. The beach they brought us to was not that large (although large enough for us since its pretty quiet in Hana) The waves were too dangerous so we didn't swim, just sat on the beach. The hotel provided chairs and towels which was nice. Anyway i would have rather been able to come and go to the beach on my own time -rather then a shuttle. We only went to the beach once because of this. The best part about this hotel is how quiet it is - you never feel like you're on top of one another. Also - the staff is so wonderful. They do not leave out a single detail (which is why i think the price is ok) Even as we were checking out - my husband was paying the final bill and I am waiting in the car. A staff member came by and gave me a fresh cold bottle of water for the ride. So thoughtful. So in conclusion -if you can afford this trip i definitely recommend the hotel hana maui and spa.

The room was very comfortable with a private jacuzzi, cozy king size bed, excellent tub and separate shower. The staff was very friendly, especially at check in where the manager gave a thorough explanation of all the facility has to offer, we were greeted with beautiful leighs, and given a tour on the way to the room. None of this felt like a sales pitch but was simply friendly and informative. Here are some tips for understanding this hotel and making the most of your stay: 1. There is no TV in the room. There is a Club Room which has a TV and Internet terminal in case you get the itch for a connection. 2. There is no Air Conditioning in the room. They have great ceiling fans and, with an excellent ocean breeze, we never found the heat to be a problem. 3. This place is huge! The walk from the restaurant/spa to the cottages is a pleasant stroll but the staff are happy to whisk you around in the numerous golf carts on the property. 4. There are some nice freebies ranging from bottled water, soda and juice in the room, yoga class each morning and laundry facilities. 5. The gym is one of the better ones I've seen for a hotel. It had plenty of cardio equipment (treadmills, bikes and eliptical machines), free weight dumbbells up to 50lbs and one of the better all-purpose pully machines. 6. The hotel is one of the few places to eat in Hana. Fortunately, the food is good but, whether in the lounge or the restaurant, it's pretty expensive. Just further past the hotel there is a plate lunch place called Braddah Hutts which offers delicious BBQ food at a reasonable price. As for things to do, make sure to spend some time body surfing on Hamoa beach. The waves are amazing and the hotel has free towels, chairs, body boards and snorkel gear available there. Also, check out the Red Sands beach that is a 15 minute hike from the hotel. The hotel staff might not be willing to tell you about this as it requires careful footwork and may not be ideal for everyone. That said, it's a beautiful beach that's worth the effort. Guidebooks like Maui Revealed describe exactly how to get there. The hotel has a great spa on the property. Ask for a massage from Jan! They also have a huge menu of activities including horseback rides, guided snorkeling, etc. Lastly, make sure to at least once set your alarm and see the sunrise.

During our first night on property at around 10pm, I heard scurrying noises around the balcony and roof area. These noises were loud and persisted for several minutes. I called the front desk, and they sent maintenance to take a look at the problem. The maintenance worker also heard the noises but indicated it might be a cat or something that jumped off the roof already. I continued to hear noises throughout the night and kept every door and window securely locked. Needless to say, it wasn't a great start to the stay. The next morning, I stopped by the front desk to see if a maintenance person could follow up during the day to make sure whatever creature was making the noise was gone. She sent two men out who set a rodent trap in the roof of our room. At around 6pm, my husband heard the trap snap followed by loud thrashing. He called the front desk, and the maintenance man from the previous night showed up to find a still very much alive rat in our room. We were temporarily displaced from the room while the maintenance worker removed the rat from our room. During this entire sequence of events, we were never once contacted by management which I find completely inexcusable given the inconvenience we were caused.

But, we were also inconvenienced on three separate occasions, our vacation was disrupted, and there was a rat in the room!

The resort overall is truly breathtaking--sprawling lawns leading right down to the ocean's edge, a lovely pool (at least the one on the Sea Cottages side), and perfectly maintained grounds bursting with what seemed like every kind of flower and tree on the island. The scale is large enough that golf carts are the norm for staff and guests who aren't up for a 10-15 minute walk from the ocean side of the property to the main dining room (we enjoyed the stroll when it wasn't raining). After the gracious welcome and personal tour we were given on arrival, it's easy to see why the hotel is famous and highly rated. We were thrilled to be upgraded at checkin to one of the Ocean Front Sea Ranch Cottages. The experience of waking up with the ocean as your front lawn is one we will not soon forget. Unfortunately, the interior of the cottage didn't meet the high standards set elsewhere. Quite a few of the interior wood shutters/blinds were broken, losing paint or even flat-out rotting at the edges (see photo). Our bathroom ceiling fan was broken. And the dresser in the closet reminded me of the repainted garage-sale furniture I had in college. It was definitely not up to what I've come to expect from a top-rated luxury resort fetching $400+ a night on the low end. Others have mentioned the lack of A/C. While it's hard to imagine the sound of the ocean being interrupted by air conditioning units kicking in all over the place, it must be said that our room was muggy and fairly miserable inside from midmorning till late evening--even with all windows and doors wide open and the fan running full-blast, and even being as close as you could get to the ocean breeze. Only during the early hours around dawn did we feel comfortable. As Texans, we are quite used to 100-degree summers, but we met our match in this room. That said, there were other nice touches, from the fruit and snack basket waiting when we arrived to the soft drinks and waters in the fridge (free and restocked daily) and the whole-bean gourmet coffee in the room. Service was across the board outstanding, although a couple of calls for a bellman were definitely on \"island time.\" We agreed with our fellow guests that the poolside bar could've made a killing had they ever stayed open past 4:00 PM. Meals at Ka'uiki and the Paniolo Lounge (which serves the same menu evenings) ranged from OK (avoid the pasta) to outstanding (ceviche, all the breakfasts). Wine is on the steep side by the glass, but surprisingly affordable by the bottle. Wait service was always fine for us, if not exactly crisp. After spending $100 to share 3 small apps plus 2 glasses of wine each our first night, we quickly learned to seek out the excellent and cheap roadside food stands during the day and save the splurges for nighttime. We had a memorable stay in Hana and are glad we didn't rush back after making the drive out from East Maui. Even with its flaws, the hotel was still enjoyable.

This is a great place, and I'm really glad we stayed there. I had just about given up on Hawaii and the Disneyification of so much of Hawaii, but a number of things converged, and my wife and I spent a very pleasant week there. The rooms and common areas are very nice and comfortable; the food was great; the staff couldn't have been nicer. Much of the niceness comes from the way the Hana Maui fits into Hana itself. The resort is clearly the 800 pound gorilla in Hana, but it seems to have found a very responsible relationship with the town, although I'll of course let the locals speak for themselves. In many ways, the resort is built within the town rather than tacked on the side of it. No fences, gates, and guard stations; to get to our \"cottage\" in the Sea Ranch section, we walked to the \"other section\" of the resort, past one of the local churches, the baseball field, and the community center. Hasagawa's General Store was closer to our cottage than the resort's offices. Staying here, you have a feeling of connection to the rest of Hana, which counts a lot for me in how I feel about a place. There are only three things I can think of to whine about, and only one of which you should take too seriously: * I was a little surprised that the restaurant menu didn't change at all while we were there. The menu itself was fine in both breadth and quality, and I never repeated a dish. Still, there aren't all that many dinner options in Hana, and, given the agricultural focus of the area and the food opportunities that must exist there, I would have thought that the chef would leave at least one slot open for a special driven by what looked nice at the market that day. (Like I said, this is my opportunity to be really whiny...) * If you're thinking about staying in Hana, you've already decided that you won't be bothered by the lack of an exciting night life. Nevertheless, I have to say that I wish the bar had stayed open later than 8:30. This is only a minor exaggeration: to be perfectly accurate, they stayed open until 9:30 the Saturday night we left. But you get the idea. There's not much to do there at night other than, um, the obvious, and having later hours for one of the common areas would have been nice. (Note: this could be an off-season limitation; perhaps they stay open later during high season?) * As you'll see by a careful reading of their web site, there is no beach right at the Hana Maui. They have facilities about 15 minutes down the road at Hamoa Beach, and run an hourly shuttle there if you don't want to drive. The semi-famous \"red sand beach\" is right below their property, but they officially discourage resort guests from going there because of property access issues and, if asked, will refuse to tell you how to get there (see earlier comments about relations with the locals, as well as their lawyers I suppose). The water around here also tends to be the kind that you don't want to turn your back on -- great for body surfing and boogie boarding, but not well suited to lazing around on a float or raft. My real point here is that if your idea of a tropical vacation is to never be more than five steps away from sand and ten steps away from water (and I can sympathize with that attitude) the Hana Maui may not be right for you.

I have stayed in SLH hotels throughout europe, asia and Hana Maui was my first US SLH hotel. I was extremely disappointed with HANA MAUI - i will not return, but this is my view - my fiancee enjoyed it. I disliked because: 1. it's a very boring, slow paced hotel - which to some is great, but it doesn't have a beach front, and your exposure to sun/water is with their two pools. rooms do not have tvs, there is no wifi/internet, and even newspapers are hard to get. Bottom Line: if you want to get away from civilization, this is your place, but after 4 nights, i could not have been more excited to leave 2. Food - only one restaurant at the hotel, food is the same everyday except for fri where there is a buffet. given their monopoly the prices were not unreasonable, but the service was slow, and the food highly mediocre. stay away from the kebabs which are massively overpriced, $50 for the combo - seafood/beef, and you get like one piece of shrimp!!! So food was sub par 3. Rooms were old - ive stayed at cottages before, and Hana Maui is very old. the rooms dont have air con, and the breeze was not very effective, so we were sweating a lot at night and there are a lot of mosquitoes in the area. 4. the type of customers were not to our preference either - they were not very friendly, social, and given the small resort, it was disappointing conversation was not made with many guests. SO I WOULD NOT RETURN BECAUSE THE HOTEL WAS OLD, SERVICE WAS MEDICORE, FOOD WAS BAD, NO AIR CON, TOO EXCLUDED FROM CIVILIZATION.

We live in Hawai'i and were taking our first trip on the Superferry and driving our own car, a Miata (with the top down) over that amazing Road to Hana. When we got there, however, I was delighted in the extreme! I think it's safe to say that this hotel meets or exceeds all expectations for a place that gives you solitude, seclusion, luxury and a perfect Hawaiian visit. I do think, after looking the place over and having read some of the more negative remarks, that they must have been limited to the people who stayed in the \"Sea Cottage\" rooms. Where the rooms in the main part of the hotel are beautifully landscaped, the ones at the Sea Cottage area looked as if they had been plunked down in the middle of an open plain. We were very happy with our \"Garden Suite,\" which included a large bedroom, a very large sitting room and one of the best bathrooms I've ever found in a hotel. A deep, relaxing tub, a stand alone shower with a very nice, strong shower head, and a completely isolated toilet. In fact, it's one of the most luxurious hotel bathrooms I've ever discovered. The lanai was really a great place to relax, with a nice table and chairs and a great view of the ocean. I really loved the fact that everywhere in our little area of the hotel the landscaping was so lush it was hard to see if there was anyone in the lanai next door. We also found clever little nooks where chaise longues had been placed, surrounded by the same lush vegetation which allowed you to relax in total privacy and enjoy the veiw. As for the food and service, it was all first rate, four star, perhaps even five star quality. Our server for both the nights we were there for dinner was Laura, who knew her food and wines and was very nice about giving us the information we needed to make our dinners just perfect. The breakfast buffet was also quite wonderful, especially the fresh fruits, fresh juices, etc. The night we arrived (July 4) the dining room had a very nice buffet, which made it nice because the next night featured their usual menu, so it made for more varied fare. They also featured a show which included local people singing and doing the hula. As Hawai'i residents, we usually try to avoid these things because they're usually the same old packaged format in all of the major hotels. We were, happily, pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the evening's entertainment, it all being provided by \"real\" Hawaiians with a definite love for their art. We didn't sample much more of the services offered, mainly wanting to just relax and take it easy, so I can't comment on the spa, the horseback riding, etc., but I do think it would be easy to spend more time here and try to get to know about all the offerings of this truly top of the line hotel. There is just so much more I could mention but this is already a book similar to \"War and Peace.\" This is definitely a place to go to \"get away from it all\" and enjoy nature, superb service and food, and just to take it easy.

This is the type of place that soothes your soul. It is tranquil and relaxing - perfect for romantics. My husband and I agreed it was an excellent way to begin our Hawaiian honeymoon. We booked an ocean view sea ranch cottage but we upgraded to a deluxe ocean view upon arrival. We received a lei greeting, as well as some tasty fruit juice, and cold washrags to refresh ourselves. We could feel the stress and tension just melt right off. After a quick tour of the property in a golf cart we arrived at our cottage next to the rocky shoreline. The cottage was spacious and decorated simply. We appreciated the wet bar and complimentary drinks and snacks (especially the delicious banana bread and whole bean Hana coffee). The bathroom was huge with a soaking tub, separate shower, and separate toilet room. I usually pass on the complimentary toiletries but in this case they were awesome and made in Maui. For the most part the room was clean, though if you looked very carefully you could find some scum buildup on the bathroom fixtures and grout. When we first walked into the room it was on the hot side so we opened the windows, which kept the room cool throughout our stay. (FYI: there is no a/c, no tv, and no alarm clock. We were glad to be away from all three, at least for a few days.) The best part of the cottage was the wall of sliding glass doors that could be opened up to screens. There was lanai (porch) outside with chairs and an end table. This is the perfect place to enjoy a fresh brewed cup of Hana coffee and enjoy the sunrise. I hesitate to mention it, but there is a possibility you will encounter bugs and geckos in and around your cottage. We only saw a few and weren't really bothered but some people may feel differently. The grounds are meticulously manicured. The hotel restaurant and lounge both served wonderful meals - we particularly enjoyed breakfasts. The restaurant is fancier and reservations are appreciated in the evenings. The lounge is a good alternative. You can order off the restaurant menu or the lounge menu. The lounge has a relaxed dress code, reservations are not needed, and in the evening there is live entertainment. The hotel grounds are on the shoreline but it is rocky with no beach. There are, however, several beaches nearby. Hotel Hana-Maui guests enjoy complimentary services at Hamoa Beach, including chairs, towels, and use of complimentary snorkels and boogie boards. When we visited the conditions for boogie boarding and body surfing were excellent but snorkeling wasn't so good. There is a shuttle running between the hotel and Hamoa beach during the day. A beautiful red sand beach is a 5-10 minute hike from the sea ranch cottages and it was absolutely amazing. The road to Hana is incredible and I would recommend that everyone take it. Don't try to do it all in one day - stay at least one or two nights in Hana.

We stopped for 4 nights in a cheaper Bay cottage then switched (as arranged) to an Ocean view sea ranch cottage with spa. First things first - the drive from Kahului is fantastic but a bit stressful especially if doing it in the dark after a long flight like we were. The drive back to the airport in the day was much better and we could see the spectacular scenery. It does however cut you off from the rest of the island unless you fancy spending 4-5 hours in the car - if you want to travel round the island, this hotel should not be your base. If like us however you want to totally switch off, relax and have a total break from it, this place is ideal. The grounds are fantastic and green, especially down near the bay where the sea ranch cottages are - we especially enjoyed the little pitch and putt golf course - watch out for the golf buggies however - they are biggest hazard! Breakfast and dinner are served from the dining room which overlooks the Ocean in the distance. Breakfast was great (try the Eggs Benedict) and kept us going until Dinner every day. Dinner in the main restaurant was also very good, with other cheaper options being in the bar and at the Hana Ranch (on Wed & Fri only) although the food and service at the Ranch reflected the cheaper prices. Rooms - the garden rooms are good if not spectacular for the price. Big main room with double bed, separate good size bathroom with sunken bath and walk in shower and separate living area which opens up onto a shared balcony. The living area contains a fridge which is refilled each day with water and coke etc which is a nice touch. If you can afford it, go for a sea ranch cottage, they are in a separate part of the grounds from the bay rooms, conveniently located overlooking the ocean (its not a beach) and next to the pool facility. The cottages are generally bigger, more refined and have a better feel - I will remember the view from ours for the rest of my life. We also had a spa treatment included in our rate - we went for a couple lomi lomi massage which I would recommend. Other recommendations - go to the Ola Gulch national park (probably spelt that wrong) and go swimming in the cascading pools. Its about 30 mins further down the coast from Hana.

After spending six nights at Ka'anapali with its \"Disney World\" atmosphere, we were a bit apprehensive that the Road to Hana would lead us to Dullsville. We couldn't have been more wrong! We managed to miss the throngs of daytrippers and tour buses by starting the drive later in the day. We passed Kahului just after 12 noon on a Wednesday and arrived at the hotel right at 3pm (this included a lunch break on the road, at a state wayside point that counted a menagerie of chickens and feral cats as inhabitants - quite amusing!!!). As such, we found ourselves alone on the road for much of the drive, which made it more enjoyable. That being said, we did not stop to see any of the sights along the road, given we had a convertible and our luggage was visible in the back seat. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeting with sweet-smelling leis, a glass of cold juice, and chilled lemon-scented towels - quite refreshing after the long drive. We were taken to our sea-ranch cottage via golf cart, and then discovered that there was a parking lot within a few feet of our cottage. Quite convenient! The cottage was lovely! It was *very* clean, bright, and breezy with a spectacular view of the ocean. We were given a welcome basket with a mango, banana bread, dried fruits, nuts, and chocolate macadamia nut candy. There was also a refrigerator stocked with water, Diet Coke, and Coke (complementary). We spent our first hour out on our private deck, enjoying the view and having some refreshments. As the previous poster mentioned, there was a can of Raid in the closet. However, we never saw any bugs in our cottage. Ah well - better to be prepared, I suppose? It is a tropical location, after all. We didn't experience any problems (we did have a bug problem at our resort in Ka'anapali, however!!!). That night we ate at the Hana Ranch Restaurant, which was a five-ten minute walk through the hotel grounds and down the road. A relaxed place, the menu didn't have a lot of options; however the food was good and not as pricey as the hotel's main restaurant. We enjoyed looking out at the ocean and listening to some live music. The next day, I took advantage of the complementary morning yoga class (with Laney - who was a great teacher), while my husband put on his running shoes for the trek up to Fagan's Cross (visible from the resort, as it is 30 ft. tall and perched on a high hill). He reports that the run was very challenging - a great option for runners who wish to continue training while on vacation. Our room rate included daily breakfast at the hotel's main restaurant. We were allowed to pick one entree, as well as one fruit-based \"side\", such as freshly squeezed juice, a smoothie, etc. A nice touch, as I was prepared for the typical \"continental\" fare normally reserved for \"included daily breakfasts\" at other places I've stayed. The service at the restaurant was relaxed, but I wouldn't call it slow. We ordered a picnic lunch to be delivered to us at Hamoa Beach later in the afternoon. This was pricey ($40 for two). Each box lunch included a large sandwich or wrap, two cookies, fresh fruit salad, and a bag of chips. Honestly, had we split a wrap and the salad, each had a cookie, and shared the bag of chips, it would have been more than enough for us and would have only cost $20! Before going to Hamoa Beach, we walked over to a red sand beach and a black sand beach for some photo opportunities. Hamoa Beach was fantastic - it was exactly how I imagined a Hawaiian Beach would be. There is complementary shuttle service to the beach - or, you can drive there (I also heard there is a walking trail to it). There was a beach attendant who gave us fair warning regarding the tide and roughness of the surf that day. It was nice to have beach chairs, towels, and umbrellas waiting for us, free of charge (as compared with the exorbitant $40/day charge at our Ka'anapali resort for beach chairs with an umbrella!). We spent a few hours at the beach, playing in the ocean, eating our delicious box lunches (delivered as promised), and people watching. Afterwards, we returned to the hotel and relaxed by the Wellness Pool. The pool bar had a nice selection of snacks and drinks (which were not watered down, like our other resort's drinks). We were also offered complementary chilled bottles of water. Although we did not book any spa services, we did take advantage of the sauna/cold plunge pool experience. One saunas for a few minutes, then plunges into a cold pool for a minute and repeats. My goodness, the cold plunge was.... COLDDDD! However, it was fun and felt really nice after the initial shock wears off! :-) We spent a few hours reading in the spa's garden, which was beautifully landscaped and very serene. Although we tried the beautiful lava rock hot tub, the temperature was a bit too hot for our day-old sunburned legs to take. We were invited to partake in a pupu/cocktail reception at the Plantation House; this was fun and we met the hotel's General Manager, who just took the helm two months ago (former Hyatt with 30 years of hotel experience). Sounds like he will do a lot of good for this place, which seems to have suffered from inconsistent service in years past. We enjoyed the tasting dinner at the hotel's main restaurant in the evening. It was very, very expensive ($300). The food was flavorful and the wine pairings were spot on, but I am not sure I would say it was worth what we paid. Given that it was our last night, we thought we'd splurge... but I wouldn't do it again. Next time, we'll likely eat our meals at the less expensive Paniolo Bar. Overall, we enjoyed staying here immensely and plan to return. We simply adored our cottage and with only 1.5 days at the resort, we didn't take advantage of the 3-hole golf, the bikes, the full suite of spa services, the workout room, the hammocks, the horseback excursions, the croquet, or any of the nearby sights (O'heo Gulch, Venus Pool, etc.). Next time, we plan to stay at least 3 full days, so that we can relax as well as have enough time to do all of the things that are available. You will not find a bunch of things to do in Hana - that much is true. However, if you enjoy the outdoors, there are plenty of athletic choices as well as relaxing sightseeing that can be done, which is where we found most of Hana's charm.

They all come from the town of Hana and most grew up there and continue to live in what most will consider one of the most remote places possible in the US. It's gorgeous and peaceful, if quiet. First, when we checked in, they took us and our luggage by golf cart to our room, with a tour of the grounds. Gorgeous. When we got to our room, and we were upgraded to a deluxe oceanview cottage, there was a bottle of champagne in the fridge with a note welcoming us and thanking us for choosing them for our honeymoon. Classy. By the way, the fridge was stocked with complimentary water/soda/juice and there was snacks (including banana bread and fruit) in the kitchen. What was a first for me, was that the coffee in the room is whole bean, and they provide a grinder. They have tennis courts, two pools (the infinity pool has the bar) and an adequate gym (with the best view ever). None of the rooms have tvs or radios, which is fine, as the sound of the waves crashing (we left the big door open all night) knocked us out each night. The only downside is the bugs. You're smack in the middle of nature, so they're to be expected. While the condition of the grounds is top-notch, the screens in our unit (like other reviews) needed repair and contributed to the problem. We even saw a lizard running around the walls a couple of times. When we called to complain about the bugs and lizard, they told us that the lizard is helpful, he eats the bugs. But they did come on down and spray when we were at dinner the first night. Recommendation - the food in the main restaurant is pretty darn good, but I'd recommend skipping the Ranch for dinner. It's a small menu and not very good. The spa is probably the most expensive spa I've every been to, and Cynthia gave the most amazing Thai massage - so it was worth it. The hotel maintains the Honua Beach nearby - so there are chairs, towels and decent bathrooms there for hotel guest. It's a gorgeous beach with the finest black and white sand.

Our curtains had fist size holes in the linings, which only showed at night with the lights on. Every night I left the door open so the surf , 50 ft away, could lull me to sleep. We draped our welcome leis over the headboard so the scent would fill our dreams and dispel any thoughts of tsunami.

We learned that both the general manager and the food and beverage director have given notice, so that might have something to do with it.. The spa was really first rate even tho at first they had no record of one of our appointments. They fixed everything tho and the spa experience for both of us won out over the Grand Wailea's, which is first rate in an entirely different way", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly Hana is no joke!\u201d", "Author": "berty101", "ReviewID": "UR12921630", "Content": "Sorry for the late review, again! This hotel is incredible! We booked a bay cottage, originally, but upon arrival, they upgraded to a sea ranch cottage, which there are no words to describe it's beauty. If you want to be away from everything, without sacrificing luxury, this is the place. First, we drove the \"road to Hana\", which is a little difficult if you get car sick at all. We had to stop a few times so that I could get my bearings. Arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with the sweetest tuberose lei. I'll never forget that smell! Escorted to our room on a golf cart and were amazed at the size of the cottage. You won't believe it! Rustic and tropical luxury is the best description I can give. You also won't mind the baby geckos running around your room... they hide in the rafters of the ceiling, so cute (and I'm not a bug person or creepy crawly person and they did not bother me). I also saw NO spiders, so don't worry;-) The bathroom amenities are from the Honua Spa, please enjoy the soaps, as they are outstanding. You have your own private deck with chairs with a huge sliding door that almost encompasses one entire side of the cottage. Leave it open at night (with the screen closed, of course) and enjoy the soft tropical breeze and russle of the palm leaves. It's so quiet and tranquil. The pool is beautiful as well as the hot tub. Picture the hot tub with the view of horses crazing by the Pacific. Beauty beyond belief. Then imagine a beautiful volcano in the background! One thing to mention is that the sun is in and out. Best in the morning and gets cloudy in the afternoon because of the volcano. You won't mind a bit, trust me. It's all part of the package. The Honua Spa is not to be missed. The hour and half massage is amazing in your own private garden room. Afterwards, try the cold plunge, it's crazy! The lava rock hot tub at the spa is unbelievable.

So we made the drive. I think their hotel philosophy must be to treat everyone as if they are on their honeymoon, as one might expect or hope to be treated on vacation. When we arrived, we were given fragrant leis and they had glasses of POG (passionfruit orange grapefruit) that were delicious! We were given a very pleasant tour by the super relaxed bell hop. When asked if he liked working here, he said that he loved it. We arrived to our room (a garden jr. suite bay cottage) which was very roomy. An uncut mango, banana bread, assorted snacks and macadamia nuts were in a small basket on the dining room table. I noticed there were very small ants wandering in the kitchen area... then a small lizard came into our room through the sliding doors, which my boyfriend caught with his hat. This made me somewhat concerned that little visitors might have bothered us all weekend, but it was an isolated incident. Here and there, I noticed little ants in the bathroom, but not so many that it was disturbing. I think maybe they are drawn to the small or taste of the the Hotel Hana's amazing handmade soaps. I noticed something odd in our trash can when we arrived--it was an ad for the Sopranos (from a magazine?) that remained there until we left. I didn't understand why it hadn't been cleared... I liked the hostess who sang pretty Hawaiian songs w/ her ukulele at the front desk. The hotel has a tipping service that they request at the end of your stay, I guess partially so you don't have to worry about carrying cash or having to think about it until its time to go. They also provided shuttle service to a beach which has no parking... and there were towels and water available there. I believe it runs every two hours or so during the day. We ate all of our meals at the hotel, and they were really incredibly good and satisfying. Especially breakfast! These may have been some of memorable breakfasts I've ever had. Smoothies, fresh fruit plates that make my mouth water thinking about them, flavorful breakfast meats... mmm...it was all so lovely, and the breakfasts were included in our hotel rate, so all we had to pay extra was tip. The dinners there were quite tasty as well. We had a few quirky servers: one was a very sweet, polite and fidgety Michael and a slightly less than pleasant person who served us breakfast. We also had the pleasure of seeing their Hawaiian show during dinner, with incredibly charming and talented performers. It's so romantic there. This hotel actually had turn down service which was efficient and a nice treat too. What else? Oh yes, the spa! It was really relaxing and fantastic. You can also use the men & women's locker rooms/steam room/cold plunge (my goodness it is really cold!), and outdoor showers even w/o a spa service. The outdoor showers are a bit odd in that there's a gap between the spa wall... Someone could very much potentially see you naked. I didn't really understand that design flaw. You feel totally rejuvenated after a stay at the Hotel Hana, and even a little bit sad to return back to real life.

I should mention this was after a long day of travel and arrived late in the evening. A fresh flower lei and juice was a welcome sight. Our sea cottage was wonderful, very comfortable to rest up for the next day of more relaxation.....what this hotel is all about. The bathroom itself is worth a stay. I mean the bathroom is really a sight. Now however wonderful and relaxing the resort is I did have some gripes. First the food situation, Ka'uiki the main dining room is great, obviously this is Hawai'i, everything is more expensive, but I honestly felt that the food was overly expensive for what you got. That leads to my next issue, I was there for four nights, other than Ka'uiki, the Paniolo Lounge (bar area) and The Hana Ranch (only open for lunch), they are all owned and operated by the Hana-Maui. You're pratically stuck eating the same food for four days. I realize it's no fault to the hotel, but something I should point out. Also, as I had mentioned four nights without any contact to the outside world (tv or radio) was charming at first but got a bit \"itchy\" after a while....they do provide a community TV and computer in the \"clubhouse\". Now for some finer details, although never really mentioned in any of the literature I saw, although we stayed in a sea cottage, there is no beach on the property to go to, at least not safely. The hotel provides a shuttle to beautiful Hamoa beach about 10 minutes away. Also, with all the beautiful materials and landscaping at the resort, some things that stood aout of place, was a water stain both by our bed and in the bathroom, don't know how it got there, the \"modern\" sink was awkward to use since the water controls were located behind and under the extended bowl of the sink that also facilitated some growth of mildew near the backsplash. This hotel is all about relaxation and not being in a rush (the dining experience may feel extended because of this).

The rooms are comfortable, clean, and uniquely Hawaiian. It was wonderful to have no television! The fitness center is incredible...the view can't be beat and the Hana air is inspiring.

We are very thankful that we ended our trip with two nights at the Hana Hotel -- had we started there and ended with five nights at the Kea Lani, we would have been seriously bummed out -- we would have missed Hana terribly. Luckily, we didn't know what we were missing until we got to Hana. Hana is what we thought Maui would be like -- utterly gorgeous, quiet, friendly, peaceful, etc. It's interesting to note that I was warned about Hana -- by others who have stayed at the Hotel, by a travel agent, etc. -- because the lack of TV's, phones and internet might make you \"stir crazy.\" I heard a chorus of \"there's not a lot to do\" and \"you will be bored.\" Well, I have no idea what these people are talking about. If you enjoy the outdoors and plan to spend time exploring the road to Hana and neighboring Haleakala National Park, then you will have more to do than you can possibly imagine.

It felt at times like it was our own private, 5-star spa. So, if you are seeking an ideal location to unwind and decompress completely, the Hana Hotel is DEFINITELY the place.

We enjoyed all the meals we ate at the hotel-- normally we ate at the \"bar\" type restaurant, but for my husband's 40th birthday dinner we ate at the fancy place-- and wow, that was the best meal we have had in quite some time-- years probably. Delicious! I can still remember the flavor of the lemongrass steamed mahi mahi! YUM. Driving there on the road to Hana was a wonderful experience too-- so many great places to visit. Sometimes we felt like we were in Bali. It was really nice to see this side of Maui after many days in the more tourist-populated areas. For stark contrast, we also stayed at the Grand Wailea.

Similar menu but cheaper than the restaurant. Food establishments are extremely limited in Hana. We had the famous Plate Lunch recommended by our Bell. It is basically a back yard lunch business and extremely popular. I had the Mahi Mahi plate. Excellent! Can't beat the price either. After lunch, they served shave ice. Also excellent. The spa facilities were pretty good. I have had the best massages ever here at the spa. Ever.... I had Shiatsu massages and I still can't get over how great they were. Don't miss the spa. The only complaint I had about the spa facility was the lack of shower stalls. There was only one stall inside the women's locker room and one outside by the (women's) steam room.

We spent the first 11 days of our two week trip to Maui on the south shore which is quite different from the lush atmosphere of Hana. It was a good way to see both sides of the island in a relaxed way. Driving out to Hana takes three or more hours depending on how many stops you make and we were quite tired by the time we arrived at the hotel. The return trip back to the airport a few days later seemed easier and more enjoyable. Also, we knew what we were in for - lots of curves and one lane bridges! Unlike most of the reviews I have read, we stayed in a more modest room at the hotel. We had booked a Garden View Jr. Suite but were given a nicer room with a view down to the water and a little golf course right in front of our lanai. It was very private and lovely and, best of all, right next door to the spa where we could walk 30 yards to a lava rock jacuzzi overlooking the ocean and gardens. This is available to all but we hardly ever saw anyone using it. Our room (#11) was elegant and spacious and very clean. A lovely basket of snacks and a loaf of banana bread along with a fridge full of cold drinks was complimentary and very welcoming. I loved making our own delicious coffee in the morning with organic beans (even a grinder) and enjoying the birds and flowers on our lanai. The Sea Ranch Cottages looked lovely - they should be at $600-900/day - a bit rich for my budget. We were more than happy a little further back and closer to the restaurant and other facilities. The infinity pool was spectacular and we enjoyed lounging around and swimming there each day. The grounds were beautifully manicured with many walking paths throughout. The main restaurant was very good, if not slightly overpriced. We did not have an included breakfast but I sure enjoyed my $13 bowl of oatmeal - ate every drop! We had a lovely Valentine's dinner and appreciated the local, organic sources for food. The best meal was the Friday night buffet along with a great show of local talent doing the hula and providing beautiful music. The lounge music and food was very good, too. Great wine list. If you like to walk I recommend a neat 3 mile hike through the ranch over to Hamoa Beach where the hotel has chairs and umbrellas for guests. We did this and then caught a ride back with the shuttle van. All the employees were friendly, professional and helpful - the bellmen looked like they were really having fun driving those golf carts everywhere.

What's all this about the bad food? Not our experience. I took my mother, who had a really big birthday on Feb. 11th, and six of her good friends, to celebrate. My mother and I were in the Plantation House and the others in Sea Ranch Cottages. All of us are seasoned travellers, used to 5-star hotels. I say this not to brag but to give a reference from whence our opinions come. Where to begin? The long ride on the Hana Highway: Beyond delightful. Yes, as others have said: Must be done during daylight. If you book the hotel and have not experienced this drive, have the hotel arrange for you to be picked up at the main Maui Airport by Mr. Joshua Blue and his van. He's a lovely man, entertaining and knowledgeable. Having now done this, I will probably fly in from now on, as it's faster. But this must be experienced at least once; especially for those who love verdent rainforested mountianous and gorgeous scenery with a little scariness thrown in. Not as scary as the Amalfi drive, however. The Arrival: My mother and I arrived a day earlier than our friends and the lobby that is not a lobby is calming and gorgeous. Another reveiwer called the front desk staff \"smarmy\". I am still agog with disbelief. They were so kind and welcoming. The affore mentioned juice and cool towels were brought forth and all was handled with ease and efficiency. Kudos to Michelle and her colleagues. The Plantation House: How lovely! My idea of the perfect island home. If you can stay there, do it. It has two bedrooms, two full bathrooms and one guest bathroom, a large living room, large dining room, entry hall, an enclosed lanai along the length of the house and an open, but covered, lanai outside with teak furniture. Also a professional kitchen and pantry, as the home is usually used for large events and staff parties. There is the oft-discussed A/C and a TV/CD/DVD player in the master. We didn't need the A/C as it was very cool and the TV was only used a little. They were kind enough to bring me a CD player for the livingroom as I travel with my own music. I realize that this was a major request but they were very kind about granting it. I had two dinner parties in the house, done by the hotel staff with music provided by three musicians. Everything was beyond delightful, delicious and de-lovely. I just don't agree with the reports of bad food and bad service. Our entire group of 8 people there for six days, did not experience that. Quite the opposite was the case. Fabulous breakfasts and dinners with friendly service. Service is \"relaxed\", not slow. As the Plantation house is a bit away from the rest of the hotel, one can walk or be called for by the hotel staff in the golf carts, or best of all, rent a convertible. That's the most fun and most convenient. Now, this is tricky....The Plantation House could be called a bit \"shabby\". But the use of this word does NOT imply lack of cleanliness or that things don't work. It is superbly clean and it all works, especially the water pressure in the shower. By \"shabby\", I mean that romantic island wear from weather that one finds in the tropics. It's a plus, really. It's \"South Pacific\"; It's \"Madama Butterfly\"; it's Cole Porter; it's Rudyard Kipling; it's Hemingway. Our friends were in Sea Ranch Cottatges and were very pleased with them.....no bugs and no problems with anything else. Even though we had a lot of rain and \"buggy\" weather. The Activities Desk staff was very kind and helpful. We dealt with Moni and Janelle mostly; who went out of their way to be helpful. They arranged a great tour for us with \"Steve Boy\", who is related to most of everyone in the area and took us to private places including a pool with a waterfall where there were no other tourists....my island fantasy come true. The water was clean and divinely freezing and refreshing. It was a very personal tour that was meant to last three hours but Steve extended it to five hours. The next night, he came to the Plantation House with his wife and two of his children to make us a great Hawai'ian dinner, which was so tasty. As this trip needed lots of high maintenance for the birthday and attendent celebrations, I have to highly compliment Ailina Patterson in Special Events who helped me plan the dinner at the PGH and the private luau the night before, at their beach facility. I wanted typical luau food, which they provided with a real gourmet flair. There was a lovely band and dancers, leis galore and a genuine old Hawai'i atmosphere. The entire staff, bellmen, housekeeping, spa and restaruant, were all kind and friendly to all of us all the time. And we were a handfull in a way. The manager, Doug Chang, was very kind and considerate. I hope he is there a long time, he's so perfect. The only nagative thing I have to say is not directed at the hotel but the guests who insist on bringing babies and toddlers. This is not a hotel for them. There are two child-free months: May and September. (Too bad my mom was born in February). I don't know why people bring babies anywhere, frinkly, but they do. There is a lot for teenaged people and kids from, say, 8 to 12, as well. The big, and also 5-star, hotels at the other end have tons of things for younger children....take them there. Luckily there was only one baby and one toddler during our week and the parents were considerate of the other guests and the hotel's atmosphere of peace and quiet. For all other ages....Go there! There is a lot to do and in a beautiful atmosphere of old and unspoiled Hawai'ian charm.

The one day that we spent there was the highlight of our 16 day stay in Maui. We only wished we had known about it sooner so we could have stayed longer! Everything was perfect. We decided to upgrade at the last minute to a Sea Ranch cottage. The front desk staff went out of their way to find us the nicest cottage available. The concierge personally greeted us with leis and cold, lemon-scented cloths. The porter gave us a tour of the property and explained a brief history of the hotel. Our Sea Ranch cottage was decorated with Hawaiian art and had a beautiful tiled bath, a bar, and a separate area to sit. On the table was a loaf of homemade banana bread and a basket with tropical fruit and snacks. The mini-fridge had an assortment of beverages which were included in the price of the stay. A small welcome note personally addressed to us was next to the snacks. We were lucky enough to arrive on a Thursday and enjoyed the manager's reception with appetizers and drinks at the plantation house above the hotel. All of the staff at the reception were warm and welcoming and this felt like 'the aloha' that people speak about. We were also lucky enough to stay in the month of September when the hotel is adults only. This made our time at the pool even more relaxing. The pools are open all night (at least in September) and we enjoyed a wonderful night swim. The view from the pool near the Sea Ranch cottages is fantastic, especially at sunset. We ate only one meal at the restaurant. It was the best dinner that we had in Maui. The menu had wine pairing suggestions for people less familiar with wine. The staff were completely unprentious, as is the hotel. The setting is lovely and peaceful. It is the perfect place for relaxation. It's not a good place for people who want lots of activity and nightlife - although there is a fair bit to see and do in the surrounding area. We were disappointed with the yoga class. The teacher seemed distracted and uninterested in teaching, This was the only flaw we could find with our stay. When we left we ordered box lunches. There wasn't a vegetarian option on the menu so we asked about it. The chef made us delicious vegetable wraps with homemade salsas. We had to wait a few minutes for our lunches because they were cooking them from scratch! Next time we go to Maui we want to fly directly into Hana and just stay at the the Hotel Hana Maui.

Knowing that the chef and hotel support the local economy truly made each of our meals a pleasure. The cuisine was refreshing and inspired with new selections each evening. Like the rest of Hana, the cuisine does not bend to the American standards. We tasted dozens of fish and fruit that we had never heard of back home. Some were incredible and others not too memorable- but we appreciated having the opportunity to experience the local flavors. After a week in Hana we arrived back in Kahului to catch our flight. While returning to humanity was nice, with its fast food restaurants and chain stores, I was able to forgive Hana for all that it lacked- because I realized that Hana does not evolve to what people think they want- it is what it is- not staged or contrived.

We genuinely loved every minute of our three-night stay there... as did all the other people we spoke with at the pool, restaurants, and around the property. We honeymooned for 14 days on Oahu (4nights) & Maui (10 nights) and the Hotel Hana-Maui was the most incredible honeymoon place we could imagine (we also stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Embassy Suite Maui). For any other late twenty-something women out there, imagine Dirty Dancing's set situatated on the Pacific. Got it? Then magnify that by 1000 times better than Dirty Dancing and you have the Hotel Hana-Maui. Ah... sitting by the inifinity pool (open 24 hours, lighted, huge torches on one side, stunning view of the ocean on the other) on the padded lounges with the food shack feet away... it was heaven. We were a bit worried about food options in Hana, so I went overboard at the grocery before we did the highway (on a Wednesday afternoon - we had all the pools/falls to ourselves) - we really didn't need to, but the money we saved bringing a cooler to the pool with our mixers and liquor saved some serious money. It was worth it for us to mix our own during the day so we could splurge on dinner in the evenings. Food options are liminted, but Tutu's at the Hana Bay is a great place to grab a breakfast sandwich and sit by the beach - we loved watching an elderly woman create lei's, the lifeguard set up his post with the local kids goofing off around him -- it was such a different way to start the day than we do in Ohio! The staff (Adam in particular) goes out of their way to make you feel like family. We loved everyone we met - I genuinely cried when we left - I could have someone pick me up in a golf cart and deliver me wherever I wanted anytime of the day for the rest of my life. I told my new husband I wanted to sell everything and stay at the Hotel Hana Maui forever. Other tourists on the property were friendly and ready to make friends - seven couples (including us) met one day poolside and had dinner/cocktails that night --- such a relaxed place to stay. All in all, I would highly recommend a few nights here for any couple. If we had kids I'd go elsewhere - that would be a L-O-N-G weekend with no tv, radio, or kids pools. WE LOVED IT!!!

However, the hotel grounds are quite breathtaking; and, if you are a fan of peaceful understated beauty, the seaside cottages, with their expansive views to the ocean, are quite charming indeed. The cottage interiors are immaculately kept, though we were greeted by 1 dying cockroach upon our arrival. We were sufficiently lectured - when informing the front desk about the cockroach - that we were seaside, with many critters potentially making their way into our cottage (but, are cockroaches really critters of the sea?). This initial oversight coupled with a few other incidents made us conclude that the service was pretty terrible all around (excepting at the restauraunt lounge, where the service was friendly, efficient, and warm). It seemed everywhere else however that there was a fair share of hostility in the air and an unnecessary fuss made (especially at check in and check out). After the drive it takes to get there, you'd think that they'd let their guests relax instead of making them stand around with lengthy explanations and indolent waits at the front desk as well as long-winded in-room tours / speeches. In a place like this, it seemed rather absurd to be so formal. Also, beware of front desk / room service overages, as both are very keen to overcharge your holding card. Check your bill thoroughly. To add, so-called 'complimentary' breakfasts DO include a $10 delivery fee + an 18% service charge. An average breakfast for two runs in the area of $80 - $100. So, be aware that the more they 'offer' you as 'complimentary' (ie. fresh fruit, an additional plate, etc.), the more they can tab onto the 18% service charge. If you can let the hidden fees and bad service slide, the place is really rather beautiful. We'd call it glorified camping at its best (with glorified fees to boot).

We were in btwn the 4S Manele Bay and the 4S Hualalai. I think we both thought the Hana Maui was our favorite. The 4S has a little better service with their Evian spritzers, and cold towels at the pool, but the Hana Maui was so totally relaxing. We stayed in one of the ranch cottages with a private hottub on the deck overlooking the ocean. I'm not sure which category it was, but it was great! Don't think luxurious 4Seasons - think relaxing upgraded church camp. The room was great, and we never missed the A/C or TV. We slept with the doors and windows open. What a way to sleep with the sounds of the waves pounding the rocky shore below. The pool by the cottages was fantastic. It was sort of an infinity pool, but my favorite part was the fact that it didn't have a concrete patio around it. The deck/patio around the pool was grass. There's a fantastic hottub, and a small waterfall falling into the pool. The gym is just above the pool, and is fantastic. The nautilus equipment is fairly dated and didn't work well (really at all) while I was there, but you're on vacation. The treadmills are in btwn open french doors looking down a hill at the cottages and the ocean behind them. My wife took the Yoga class and said it was ok. I think they have different Yoga instructors on diff days. The next day she saw the Yoga class and said it looked better than her beginner class the day before. We never even went to the hotel beach, so we can't tell you how it is. We used the pool and loved it. We ate burgers at the pool. They seemed fine to us, and not over the top expensive (I've read quite a few reviews complaining about the burgers). They weren't that expensive either ($12 or so) The Ranch restaurant was fine (a bit of local flair while we were there). Its not going to win any fine dining awards, but remember that you're in a small isolated village. The food was great for us. I had hawaiian style ribs, and my wife had a fish dish. Its a little expensive, but there are only 2 restaurants in town. The hotel restaurant was a little fancier. It had a large wine list (mostly $50+ bottles). I could see the service at this restaurant being a little below par if you don't know what to expect. Most of the servers are locals and they're not fancy fru-fru sommeliers from Manhattan. They're mostly from Hana. If you go into this knowing that, you'll be fine. Our server was fantastic, though. The live entertainment in the bar was great too. I only wish we could've spent more time there. This place is for the people that really want to relax. The drive up from the airport (OGG) was awesome. Waterfalls, hikes, etc. (get a guidebook). I would also recommend doing the powered hanggliding with Armen at the Hana Airport. That was fantastic. We also did the kayaking/snorkeling trip through the hotel, but through a local guy. I wouldn't really recommend this. The coral is mostly dead b/c of the waves, and the guide is much more interested in selling you his video service than the snorkeling or kayaking. However, if you have more than 2 or 3 days, it may be worth doing. Of the 3 Hotels we stayed at in Hawaii (4S Manele, and 4S Hualalai) the Hana Maui was our favorite. The 4S are nicer, have better amenities, sheets, frivolous services, but the Hana Maui really was a place to get away from it all.

As you read other reviews some find the trip a nightmare, others it is no big deal. We fall into the no big deal catagory. The road is quite scenic in spots and there are several roadside pullouts to stop. This end of the island is toatly different from the rest of the island's terrain. Local flura is a rain forest. Activities are all nature oriented. There is no real town, just a very small grocery, gas 7-11 type and 2 restaurants. Weather was really bad during our trip so no beach time or sunsets. Give way to the speeding locals to let them pass. The Good: If you have never visited a rain forest this is really a great area. You can stop along the road and visit the forest in several areas. Purchase the CD at the Shell station. Info in tourist areas. This gives a great narrative of the trip. The hotel is laid our on a sloping hillside that may be as much as 1/2 mile from the furthest cabana to the main lodge. Keep this in mind if walking is an issue. Nice outdoor pool and gym. Spa appeared first rate. We ate one meal in the lodge. I enjoyed the fare, even though it is pricey, and portions are small. The ranch across the street also serves on Wends and Sat nights. Much better fare for meat eaters. Need reservations. We grabbed some snacks in the local store and ate sandwiches etc. Also do the waterfall hike in the National Park, a few miles from the Hotel. Hotel propery is as advertised on the internet site. The cabanas are pretty private but not completely private. There is a small fridge in the room. Great coffee and free soft drinks. The hotel property is very senic The Bad: As are all properties in Maui they are pricey. There is no a/c, tv or radio in the rooms. (this may be good as well...) Bring books. No Microwave. The Ugly: As they tell you in the airport do not leave your valuables unattended or in sight in your car. Tough to do as most everyone drives an SUV, jeep or conv. We heard of several people being broken into on the road. All the guide books discourage you from going around the island to Waliea. Locals report road is supposed to be soft in spots but can be driven by a two wheel drive. Would not want to try in wet weather or a car.

What was amazing is that my husband loved it. He totally relaxed, and even took the yoga class each morning! When we got to our room, my first impression was of areally nice summer cottage. Our room had cathedral ceilings, huge sliding doors onto the deck from the living room and bedroom, cooled by ocean breezes and a ceiling fan. The view to the ocean was spectacular. The deck had two chaise longues, and a dining table with chairs, plus the hot tub (which was sparkling clean). The large bedoom was clean and simply decorated (natural wood floors, plantation shutters on the windows), with a very comfortable king size bed (it felt like there was a featherbed, but didn't check) with many fluffy pillows. The bathroom was large and nicely done with lots of wood and stone. Activities: there is yoga in the morning, a fitness room (newly remodeled), a three hole chip and putt, croquet, two lighted tennis courts, a fitness pool, and another beautiful large pool with waterfall and hot tub. We did a sea kayak/snorkel tour of Hana Bay (the coral reef, sadly, is mostly dead, but the sea kayaking was exhiliarating). The hotel also has a setup on a nearby beach--a shuttle takes you there on the hour. There are chaise longues, towels, boogie boards, etc. all free for hotel guests.

The breakfast buffet should be avoided--few choices and the quiche sits out forever. Order an omelet off the a la carte menu instead--freshly made and delicious. The french fries in the bar, seasoned with seaweed and sesame, are delicious and the \"share size\" portion is huge. Our dinners were always delicious.

The prices didn't match the experience. I ordered chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival. They charged us $31.00 for 6 strawberries that were probably the worst I ever had. Tiny and bitter! We were in Maui so it didn't bother us that much, we let it go. Everything went according to plan for the 2 days, it rained often which we expected, but we saw rainbows and that made us happy. (We were there before the March rains set in). They did have a few mud slides on the road to Hana the day we arrived but it was cleaned up before we were on our way. The drive is terrible at night but absolutely wonderful in the day. Choose day! My biggest complaint happened at check out. The hotel tried to charge us almost $100.00 more a night than our confirmed reservation stated. They tried to tell us that the confirmation was the average for a package deal. Only problem with that is we didn't book a package deal, we booked for 2 nights, thats it. They argued with us for 20 minutes even though we showed them our confirmation statement which showed 2 nights and the price. Eventually they gave in and honored our reservation price. After a pleasant stay it left a bad taste in our mouths. We don't go on vacation to argue about a bill, period! Unfortunately, this was the last thing we expected from this hotel, because of the good reviews. The prices were high for the restaurant, the food was ok but not great. They had a salad that they served with breakfast that was really good but they ran out on day 2, bad planning. I think you probably know by now that we won't return to Hotel Hana ever.

The Bay Cottages are not significantly cheaper and the Sea Cottages are without compare. I've never stayed at a place like it. This was my 10th trip to Hawaii and, I'm ashamed to admit, my first to Hana (although this was only my third trip to Maui). I can honestly say that until you've experienced this, you are seriously missing one of the best things Hawaii has to offer. It is one of the most relaxing, beautiful places you're likely to find on any of the islands. After a couple days you feel as if you're just going to melt away into the ocean and the breeze. It's expensive, yes, but it's first class all the way. If you're looking to treat yourself to a wonderful experience this is it. The only downer is the food, or lack thereof. It's mediocre and expensive and there aren't really any options. Stock up on banana bread from the Halfway to Hana burger shack and then buy a bunch of pineapples. The H2H banana bread is particularly good, and most of the banana bread I bought around the hotel wasn't that great. You can easily live on the bread, fresh pineapples, and a few mai tais by the pool (which is also stunning). You may doubt that... but give it a try. Given how relaxed you'll be on the beach or your lanai, you may find you're quite happy with bread and pineapple. Particularly since the other food options aren't really worth the effort of leaving the beach. Although, you can get too much of a good thing. There really isn't anything else to do besides the beach, snorkle, sit on the lanai and read. After four days in Hana it was nice to get back to the other side of the island where there was a bit more to do and see.

We went on our honeymoon to this hotel first and it was breath-taking. The resort was nicely designed and very relaxing. They took the beauty of traditional hawaii, which God made, and created the resort to fit into that, rather than making the resort like a modern day version of high rise hotels. The staff members were relaxed, professional, and helpful, but not in your face. There was a lot of privacy here. We stayed in one of the cabins and you felt like you were by yourself. The rooms had a lot of space, with a huge balcony, and the bathrooms were so amazing. The best part was that there was no air condition in the rooms. You opened all the windows to get the breeze from the ocean and there were plenty of fans. But some nights it did get chilly so we closed the windows. There isn't as much humidity in Hana as there is on the other side of the island. Hana is much prettier, more natural beauty, and greener. There are things to do, more natural based than tourist based, at this hotel. You can ride bikes, walk trails, go to the beach, horse back ride, go see some waterfalls nearby, relax at the pool or in the hot tub, workout, or just sit back and marvel at God's awsome beauty He created. The only complaint I would have is that the food at main restaurant, with dinner plates at $33, was not so good. It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the $33. I would recommend taking some extra things to eat, like for breakfast of lunch, which you can store in the refrigerator that is in the room, if your tring to not eat out three times a day for a high price. There are only 2 stores in town to get food and they are limited in what they carry. Overall, this hotel was one of the nicest resorts I've ever stayed in...and I've traveled all over the USA, Sri Lanka, England, Taiwan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Mexico, and Indonesia. I would highly recommend this hotel. And if you've driven the road to Hana before, I would recommend flying into the Hana airport b/c the road to Hana is nice once, but it's so curvy that it's not so exciting doing it twice. However, if you are going to Hawaii to do the super touristy stuff and party, then I'd go to the west side of the island. If you're going to relax and see a piece of paradise, I'd go here hands down.

We stayed six nights and were totally relaxed after only two. Our unit was a bungalow type room (classified as gardenview) with two rooms separated by a door(number 42-and was told this is one of the roomiest). Even though not a sea-room cottage (the premiere rooms) I would choose to stay here again after seeing the cottages and feeling they were not worth the difference in price. Sleeping became a dream-like state due to the feather-bed toppers and the softness of their organic cotton sheets. The spa facilities are for the use of all guests whether or not having treatments. The atmosphere is one of total relaxation and their amenities...like the chamomile tea dipped face-cloths covered with big chunks of ice were the ultimate in refreshment. Add the steamroom, cold dunk and outdoor shower for a real treat. Not easy to get to, either by driving (we did at night in the rain) or by intermittent Pacific Wings flights...but this seems to add to the feeling of remoteness... of really getting away. The hotel's only weak point is their meal offerings. Let me correct myself, the breakfast menu for the hotel was varied and delicious. The lunch and dinner menus left much to be desired with small portions, and high prices...not too unusual in this day and age...but when the menu lacks imagination and most importantly taste...it is literally hard to swallow! I am in hopes the management will realize the importance of having really sensational cuisine in the near future...ESPECIALLY when the alternate choices for dining are virtually limited on most nights.

There wasn't much aloha from the hotel staff. - Amenities: no A/C was definitely a problem given the number of biting insects you have to face if you have the windows open to compensate. The spa was overpriced and most of the activities are extras that you have to pay for. The hotel has the only gas station in the area and was charging $3.30 a gallon (a premium of around 60 cents at this time, compared with the rest of the island). Finally, I'd add that the east of the island receives most of the rain (I had this explained to me by the ranger at O'heo Gulch who happily explained how the island generates all its clouds in Hana).

The 2 young men who helped us from our car and directed us to the front desk were full of smiles and good cheer. As we walked in to the lobby, we were greeted by not one, but 3 lovely women who greeted us with leis, hot towels and chilled guava juice. Check-in was the easiest I've ever experienced. We were driven by golf cart to our Ocean View Jr. Suite and before the bellman put our bags away, he walked us to the terrace with a resort map and pointed out landmarks. The suite was well-equipped with 2 large storage closets, bar area with a refrigerator stocked ( at no charge) with sodas and bottled waters. There was a large in-house safe ( large enough for laptops) a desk, comfortable chairs and a huge bathroom area featuring its own private outside garden, along with seperate door entry toilet, large sunken soaking tub, and a shower so nice that we are going to have the same thing replicated at home. All of these areas were spotless and we were greeted with a nice note from Mr. Doug Chang, the General Manager along with a gift basket of breads, fruits and nuts from the area. Most of our meals during our stay were in-room, because believe it or not our terrace had a better view and it was private. I can't believe some of the complaints I've read because each meal was prepared well, and while the menu selection wasn't one you'd find at the Cheesecake Factory, it was all innovative and delicious-taking advantage of fresh catches of fish and the wonderful fruits and vegetables in the area. Room service was very quick ( less than 30 minutes) and very well done. Wine selection was excellent. I would only suggest a wider selection of appetizers and beef entrees. The Wellness area next to the large infinity swimming pool/jacuzzi's were a great place to get in some exercise. The area is well stocked with over-size thichk towels and water. Try out a hammock-they are incredible. The Bar was a fine place to wind down and someone must have listened to the fellow in an earlier review about pre-made Mai Tai's as ours were homemade at the bar and befitting of such a fine hotel and setting. There are no TV's in the rooms, nor air-conditioners. Neither is necessary or desired by this couple. What the Hana air does to your skin and very soul can't be replicated. The rooms are very well ventilated to recieve cool ocean breezes and the noise from a television would ruin the setting. We used the Honua Spa for Lomi Lomi Massage and Spa Therapy. It was superb on all counts. The Club Room near the hotel entry is a handy place to check e-mail if you care to. It has a TV but I don't know why you'd care to use one while at this place. One word on the staff. They were all so kind, cheerful and genuine. One day I was walking the grounds to go to the beach and it started to rain lightly. A hotel maid came running out of one of the bungalows with a large umbrella and a warm smile. They always went out of there way to ask how you were and if everything was suitable. There was a caring there that we have never experienced any where else. Some of the nicest things we liked were as follows: The Staff Free Valet Parking No-tipping Policy ( you can give one amount at the end) The peaceful feeling that settles over the town as the sun sets Good local soaps, shampoos and lotions for use in your suite Some things others may not like: Not a wide food selection off the hotel grounds The startling quiet of the peaceful little town of Hana Lack of Air conditioning-but you acclimate easily Last but not least there were 2 staff members, Patrick at the bell desk and Kealele at the Main Hotel Dining room who deserve awards for their professionalism and kindness towards guests.

My husband utilized their workout facility while I gazed from a hammock out to the ocean from the torch-lit pool/hot tub area (one of several). We ate breakfast every morning at the restaurant. Lunch we toggled between the Hana Ranch Restaurant and the hotel and got snacks at the local market. No complaints at either!

This is a tip from someone who lives in Hawaii, I think it's the most beautiful part of the island. We checked into a beautiful sea cottage with a hot tub and a goregous view of the ocean and the horses. I can honestly say it was the most beautiful, relaxing vacation I've ever had. You must go with an open mind and heart, the pace in Hana is slow, the service is friendly and helpful but don't be in a rush. The natural beauty is spectacular, the grounds of the hotel breathtaking. Taking walks around the property is romantic and serene. The infinity pool is goregous. Some of the reviews have mentioned that there is no air conditioning. That's true, and the first day it did take some getting used to but sleeping with the sliding glass door open gave us a chance to feel the breeze and to hear the ocean. Might be wise not to schedule a trip during August if you are worried about being too hot. Some other complaints I've read: the restaurant. Breakfasts are yummy, but dinner is merely okay. It's not a food destination. There is a little restaurant just off property that is a nice change, very casual and reasonably priced. If you dont want to walk to the dining room on property, call and have them pick you up in a golf cart, we did that when it rained one night. Overall, staying here is a chance to relax, leave television behind, and experience breath taking beauty. I left here feeling like I had been away for a month, not 3 days. It's that relxaing and beautiful.

What a wonderful peacful paradise it is there. It spoils you to anything else. We wer met with tropical drinks where we checked in and take by golf cart by our very informative and friendly bellman. The cottage was very serence aand beautiful with vaulted ceiling and a HUGE bathroom. The furniture was beautiful and we had a huge deck. Our cottage was right next to the pasture where the hotel kept theri horses and is was so peasful to watch them graze. I walked over to take pictures and a cople of them saw me adn gallaped over thinking I had food to give them. They both nozed me and let me pet them it was so cool. The view to the front was the beautiful ocean. Tehre is quite a bit of room between cottrage so you feel seculded and it is so quiet with no TV or radios. That evening we went over to play in the beautiful infinity pool and hot tub after dark. we had it all to ourselves and it was soooo romantic. Until it started to rain that is. At first it was just a light rain which was cool but it got harder and harder until the bootom fell out. But we were already wet any way to so we laughted all the way back to our cottage with wet towls and robes :-) The next morning we went on the shuttle down to Hamoa beach which is wonderful with soft soft grey sand and there was only one other couple there so it was like a private beach. I wish we could have stayed longer and next time we will. It is a world away from the other side of Maui.

The resort itself has a sprawling layout with the most amazing hot tub and pool on a hilltop that overlooks the water. Resteraunt and rooms were somewhat pricey, but way worth it.

It won't be for every traveller, but for a couple hoping to enjoy sleeping to the sound of the crashing surf; stretching out poolside with frozen drinks, a book, and suntan lotion; and simply spending quiet time together... well, this is your place. We stayed four nights even though we had been told two was plenty of time (and three was supposedly more-than-enough). We're glad we didn't listen to the others, though, because we never felt like we were rushed... and who wants to rush their way to relaxation? A four-hour drive direct from the airport (filled with plenty of stops and sites along the way); then a couple of days to sit at the pool, get massages, and relax at the beach; and finally a couple of days to explore the hiking trails and Ohe'o Gulch at our own pace.Lunch was brought to our poolside lounge chairs, frozen drinks were delivered after a smile towards the pool attendant, and dinner was served with champagne in our sea-ranch cottage every night. I've read reviews that indicated sub-quality service, but it's just a matter of expectations -- we certainly didn't mind when the pool-attendant took a break for lunch too, particularly since he came over to ask us if there was anything we needed before he did. While some people apparently don't like that type of behavior, we thought it was a very human touch that made the glitzy places without it seem dehumanizing. (Yes, we are actually from NYC and are able to say that.)We bought breakfast food at the local store and had breakfasts on our deck while watching the sun rise (we were still on NYC-time, so we got to sleep in and still see the sun rise). The lunches were standard fare, and we're grateful that the staff suggested we take a box lunch for our drive back to Wailea -- one less thing to worry about. We particularly loved the in-room dinners, with the lights turned low and the sliding doors opened overlooking the sea!If you're looking for a slick, glitzy, chain-hotel style of vacation in Maui, stay at the Four Seasons.

Upon our arrival we were greeted with leis, guava juice (or was it papaya? delicious in any event) and cool towels. We thought that was a really nice touch. And we were immediately impressed with the breathtaking campus and design of the resort. Very natural, serene, beautifully kept. We felt incredibly relaxed just lounging on our terrace listening to the waves lap against the shore (we got a one bedroom cottage right by the sea with our own hot tub). The beautifully designed wellness pool makes you feel like floating away. And we both got wonderful massages on our terrace. But for $600 a night, you kind of expect things to run really smoothly, and they just didn't. We'd have to give the service a low rating, particularly compared to a place like Four Seaons, where our rooms were nearly half as expensive (and included a breakfast buffet to boot). The menu at Hana Maui was very limited and pricey and the food was just average. It took around 45 minutes to get breakfast in the morning. They lost our picnic lunches on our first day and we had to wait in the lobby for a half hour while they tried to track them down for us (I finally just suggested they make new ones, which they did). We arrived at the pool one day to find the person giving out the towels was off somewhere and wouldn't be back for a while, so no towels. Our complimentary champagne was missing when we got there and when it arrived the next day, it was rancid. Some of the staffpeople were very nice, but others were downright chilly. In other words, in general, the operation felt quite a bit less polished than one would expect for those prices. You might overlook at it at a $200-a-night place but not at $600 a day. All in all, I would recommend it if you really want to stay in Hana, have plenty of money to blow and a very laid-back disposition. But plan to buy food and keep it in the refrigerator in your room.
