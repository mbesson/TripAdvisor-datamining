Total, la sensacion de claustrofobia brutal..teniamos que dormir con la puerta de la habitacion medio abierta!! aun me pregunto por que no me fui corriendo de ahi el primer dia... tonto de mi.

We had a mouse living and pooping under our beds! Dirty room, dirty shower, dirty toilet (which are both across the hall!) The wallpaper was peeling off, sink leaked, window didnt open properly. We put our bags on the table so they didnt have to touch the floor and we had to constantly wear shoes or our socks would go brown with dirt. This is the worst hotel ever.

We stayed 2 nights in a double room in this so called hotel. Our room had a sweat nauseous odour which was probably cannabis from the previous occupants. We paid 65 Euros a night and you can find much better accomodation in Amsterdam in this prize range. We shared bathroom and toilet with a group consisting of 10 British teenage boys who came home at 4 o'clock in the morning and ran yelling up and down the corridor. They also played Manneken Pis from the balcony next to our window... This has of course nothing to do with the staff, but you should be aware of that this place is really noisy and shabby.

The best you can say is it had two beds in a small basic room and a wash basin. Showers and toilet were along the corridor. Payment was required up front and then 5% added for payment by Plastic. The first morning I went for breakfast which was included in the room price. For the rest of the stay I didnt bother. The coffee was only coffee by name and it was a lite brown mixture that tasted of nothing. A half a loaf of sliced bread lay on the small table together with a few slices of cheese and some curled up process meat product.
