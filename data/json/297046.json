Took a bit of finding and is definitely further from the city centre than the websites claim! Nonetheless, the room was incredibly spacious, bed very comfortable. Metal shutters on the windows for those of us unfortunate enough to be unaccustomed to sunlight. A corridor between door of room and door of bedroom, so two doors to block out noise. And the area was very quiet. The staff were friendly (in that faintly amused Roman way, which usually annoys me). The breakfasts were poor at best, but I would think they were standard fare for a 2-star. Outside the main door of the hotel were a few metal tables and chairs, and wonderful flowering bushes and trees. It was really pleasant to sit there at night, sip a beer and read a book. It is a stone's throw from the Villa Porpora, and perhaps a 20 minute walk from the Via Veneto. There is a bus stop just around the corner. Extremely good value, and I would go back any time!", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West London", "Title": "\u201cCheap n Cheerful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4966486", "Content": "Booked four day stay quite pleasant. Breakfast not too bad if you like ice-coated crossiants! A bit surprised by the lack of spoken english, especially for such a major city in the world. So make sure you have a map on your travels as the one given by this hotel is pretty unless, because the hotel doesn't even appear on it! However, once you do get a map, it's pretty easy to get around and if like us you enjoy museums/galleries, then you are in the right spot.

Panic? you ain't seen nothing! So apart from our other review on the very cool PAISIELLO PARIOLI we ain't got nothing to say on our booked hotel!

We'd read some negative reviews, but hadn't been expecting much more than basic in the first place. We were pleasantly surprised! Yes, the building is old-fashioned (this is part of its charm!) but the staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful, and the rooms very clean. They are decorated in old mismatched furniture, but this is a small price to pay for cleaners who do their job thoroughly and provide fresh towels daily (whether you need them or not). Our room also overlooked the lovely shared courtyard below. The hotel is located in a quiet, surburban area only minutes walk from the fantastic Borghese Gardens. Staff were very helpful in providing details of bus routes, where to buy tickets, maps etc. though we walked everywhere anyway. You can walk from the hotel through the park into the Piazza del Popollo in 30-40 mins. I might also add that on emailing the hotel, they were happy to arrange a private taxi to collect us from the airport. This worked out cheaper than getting a licensed cab and despite the flight being delayed, the driver was waiting for us when we arrived to take us straight there. For anyone looking for clean, friendly, budget accommodation, who is happy to either use their legs or take public transport, I definitely recommend this hotel. If you want to pay more for the sake of being right in the thick of the city, then this isn't for you!", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "TYNE AND WEAR", "Title": "\u201cCheap n Cheerful\u201d", "Author": "SALLYSLAPCABBAGE", "ReviewID": "UR3792839", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in Aug 05...It is in a nice area, we felt safe walking around at night.

Lovely sitting out area for breakfast too which was fine, off a pretty road and with a unique bar, old style decor but that's what I loved about it, it was different, don't go away to look at 'travel lodge' decor that's so boring. 8/10 for a 2 star.", "Date": "July 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cA great 2 star base\u201d", "Author": "gary4463", "ReviewID": "UR3634577", "Content": "After reading other reviews about this hotel, I was a little concerned about going here.
