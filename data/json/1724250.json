My king room was small but very clean, much cleaner than the average Courtyard. Noise levels were worse than average. First, the windows are single paned glass with the old wood frames that don't shut tightly. I was on the 4th floor facing Cherry Street and the traffic noise was significant. (Somehow they ignored my Gold rewards profile request for a quiet room on a high floor.) Walls are thin and room to room noise was poor as well. Even with my room fan on high, I could hear my neighbor talking, and his phone alarm going off in the morning. Rooms on Cherry Street face a tall office building across the street. During working hours, people in the offices can see directly into the hotel rooms. No privacy at all. Or views. Or natural light. Breakfast in the hotel's Bistro restaurant was good and reasonably priced, but it wasn't open when I arrived at 11 pm the night before. There didn't seem to be much in the way of restaurants or night life close by.

The hotel is an easy walk to each of these, as well as some great neighborhood bars and restaurants. The remodel was tastefully done, and the addition to the rear of the building for newer rooms was also done appropriately for a historic building. The basement features a nice pool, but note that there is not a lot of lounge space around the pool so its best used for a workout rather than a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hangout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spot. The exercise room is huge and impressively equipped. I had a King room with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bay view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was on the tenth floor, putting me just high enough to see the water over the building across the street. The views are impressive and certainly worth an upgrade. While the room is not large it is intelligently designed with furniture whose flexibility allows you to make it what you need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a desk that can be pulled out and moved if you need a larger table, a small ottoman that works both as a table and seating space, etc. It was very well done. The bathroom was large enough to feel spacious without sacrificing square footage in the room itself. We had no problems with noise, even given that it was New Years Eve when we stayed. My only real complaints about the room were trivial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than properly strip the woodwork and repaint they saved money by just repainting on top of the old (which I suppose is better than ripping out the original features entirely!) There was also a long hair left on the side of our tub which grosses me out more than it probably should, but there you go. The hotel had friendly service, and is firmly in the 21st century with convenient electronic terminals set up for guests in the lobby to print boarding passes, valet service that takes a text message when you need to order your car, and free wi-fi that worked very well. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember what we paid for valet, but given the dearth of available parking in downtown Seattle I found the fee worth the unlimited access to my car. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try breakfast, but enjoyed a late night snack at the comfortable bar while watching the world go by out the floor-to-ceiling windows on the street. All in all this is a great option for the Pioneer Square area, especially if you are a Marriott member or prefer familiar corporate chains (and their lower prices) to the smaller boutique options nearby.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLarge and stylish king room\u201d", "Author": "Orange-Boven", "ReviewID": "UR122830402", "Content": "Really nice hotel.

This is a 15-story hotel, so it's not typical of a suburban Marriott Courtyard but it uses the urban model of a high rise, limited amenity hotel. The location is terrific. It's a block from Pioneer Square and a block from a light-rail stop that takes you to/from Sea-Tac Airport in 37 minutes for $2.75. The staff is terrific. I cannot recall a more engaged, friendlier staff at any Marriott property I've ever patronized. The rooms are pretty good. This hotel has been installed in a former office building called the Alaska Building and some of the old building shows through in the lobby where you can see mid-20th century marble and the old-style, multi-story mail chute dropping into a large brass mailbox in the lobby. You'll also see some of the old buildings in the windows, which use the old casings equipped with new double glazing. Our very large room had a terrific view of Seattle's sourthern downtown. Two flys in the ointment for us: 1. The room chair (an adjustable desk chair) was uncomfortable due to its design. This is the first such chair I've encountered at a Marriott Courtyard and I hope it's not the new \"official\" desk chair. 2. The credit-card room keys just didn't work well and we had a second set made (done cheerfully, of course). We had to try 3, 4, or six times before the door would open. We had similar problems with using the key in the elevator to access our floor from the lobby (a good security feature in any case). From this hotel, we walked to the ferry terminal for an inexpensive ride to Bainbridge Island (free return!), to the famous Pike Market to see fish tossed around by loud fishmongers, to the Underground Seattle tour (highly recommended), and to the light rail stop for a return to the airport. This area is well served by the Seattle mass transit system. The hotel has a restaurant and bar called The Bistro and we ate three meals there. Frankly, the food was good twice and mediocre once but the service was always spectacular. Note that this restaurant has a somewhat limited menu (hence the name), but you should be able to find something to dull your hunger. They serve Starbuck's coffee, in case you're an addict. Otherwise, there's a Seattle's Best coffee shop across the street. There was a ballroom located on our floor (14th) and we snuck in to take a peek. It was set up conference style and could accommodate about 50 people at tables set up in a chevron pattern. I'd certainly locate a conference there given the opportunity.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Outside DC", "Title": "\u201cSolid Choice\u201d", "Author": "benfbrown", "ReviewID": "UR122313996", "Content": "Despite having an excellent stay in another property the last time we were in Seattle, we decided to stay here this time around. For >$100 per night less, we had a similar sized room (1 BR, 650 Sq, Ft) that was every bit as nice. Granted, the bathroom in this hotel isn't as nice as the other property but the hotel does feel almost (but not quite) as upscale. As another reviewer mentioned, this property seems more like a Renessaince than a Courtyard. The hotel is located in the Pioneer Square District which could be viewed as a strength (proximity to tours, market, etc) and a weakness (number of homeless in the area). As someone else noted, the windows in the rooms do not seem to be the type that reduce noise and we did have a lot of street noise even though we were on the 12th floor. This doesn't really bother us but if you are the type who needs quiet when you sleep, you should be aware of this issue. All in all, we thought this hotel was a good, solid choice. When price is considered, we thought it was a bargain for Seattle and we don't regret our decision to stay there in the least.

I asked for a high floor, but was told that the rooms up high were smaller, and they recommended a lower floor. I believe I ended up on the 4th floor. The room was great - it reminded me of a modern room I stayed at once in Tokyo. And it was very clean. It was fairly quiet from within the hotel, although I did hear a siren or two outside. The fitness center was great! It was fairly large, had a number of treadmills, a couple bikes, and a couple ellipticals, along with weights. Everything was in great shape, and it included towels and wipes for the machines. The pool appeared to be a typical hotel pool - nothing you'd attempt to do laps in. There's a restaurant in the hotel where you can buy breakfast (and lunch & dinner, I believe). The breakfast was delicious and reasonably healthy, but I thought it was expensive. Regarding the downtown, it seemed like most of the restaurants closed early, leaving only the more fancy places open for dinner.

My main reason for booking this hotel was its proximity to the football stadium. I was arriving in the afternoon for a 5:30pm game and wanted somewhere close so I wouldn't have to worry about getting to/from the game after a cross-continent flight that day. Rooms: A little on the small side, but nothing to complain about. There was limited closet space and very little space to walk around the room. There was a small sofa which was rather uncomfortable to sit on for any time. Good HDTV on a swivel so you could watch it from the bed or the sofa. My room was on the 7th floor overlooking 2nd Ave. It was quite noisy with sirens and buses outside. I'd recommend trying to find a room not facing that street. Overall, the room was a pretty standard Courtyard room (which is a good thing). One thing I found very unfortunate was the level of soundproofing between rooms. You could listen in on normal conversations in the rooms on either side. It made getting to sleep a bit difficult one evening through no fault of the people in the other room. Amenities: Excellent fast and free wi-fi. Free papers available each day. There was a small selection of snacks and beverages for sale by the reception desk. I did not have a chance to try any food or drink from the onsite bar/cafe. Location: This could be a strength or weakness depending on what you're planning to do in Seattle. For a football, soccer or baseball game, it's outstanding (10-15 minute walk to the stadiums). If you plan to use light rail/buses to get around Seattle, it's about a block and a half walk to the Pioneer Square transit station. If you're walking to Pike Place or that area, it's about a 10-15 minute walk. In the evenings, the area right around the hotel is pretty dead. I would have preferred a place with a bit more evening activity in the area (but made the conscious decision to stay here to make travel to the football game easier).

The location of this hotel is perfect! You are within walking distance of the baseball and football stadiums as well as the water, pikes place market and Westlake Shopping Center. If you don't want to walk you can also take the Light Rail. We took the light rail from the airport to the hotel. It was $5.50 total for 2 people. It dropped us off 1 block from our hotel and was perfect. The lobby is easy to get in and out and doesn't feel like most hotel lobby's. It has a touch screen large TV attached to the wall that you can use to help find info on shopping, dining etc . Every employee that we encountered was friendly and helpful. We even received a call from the Manager asking us if the charges from the Restaurant were indeed ours as they thought it was fraudulent. Now that never happens! The room we stayed in was a bit on the small side but I think that is only because we used our Marriott points to book it. Having said that the bathroom was large which I LOVED and the windows opened slightly so you could let the fresh air in. Their TV's in the room let you pull up your folio at any time and check your balance. The wifi was free and easy to access with good speeds. The restaurant has happy hour so we went downstairs and had a few apps and drinks. They were priced well and tasted very good. We also used the workout room which has plenty of machines with personal TV's. We didn't use the pool but it looked OK however I never did see the hot tub. We were going to the Seahawks game so this location was a perfect for us as we could walk straight to the game and not worry about a cab. We will be back in Seattle again and we will absolutely stay here. One bit of advice I would give.... If you can try and take the light rail or cabs I would.

If you are arriving, via AMTRAK, this is the property for you. A short 5min walk from King Street Union Station to the property. Also, both SAFECO Field and the Seahawk Stadium are a short walking distance from the property. ROOMS: I had a King Rm, 10th FLR, view of Cherry St. Typical room size for a Downtown Hotel in a large city. Bed extremely comfortable, and bathroom very roomy. FACILITIES: Pool and fitness center were very nice (in the basement). Self-serve laundry also in the basement. Breakfast is not included----as there are several options nearby (but, there is also a eatery in the Hotel). NEARBY: One block east, at the corner of Cherry and 4th St, is the Columbia Tower (x-Bank of America BLDG). For $5 bucks, you get access to the Observation Deck---on the 73rd floor---which is higher than the Space Needle....and, MUCH cheaper. I had the entire deck to myself when I visited. Views are spectacular (as long as the weather cooperates). Tower is less than 5min from the Hotel.....much closer/cheaper/less crowded than Space Needle. Pacific Palace shopping on Pike St is a 7-10min walk (mind you, some of the streets are STEEP). Ferry terminal is 2 blocks west of Hotel.....less than a 5min walk. STAFF: All the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. Brittney on the evening staff was helpful in arranging a late check-out and offered to hold my luggage behind the desk, no charge, until later in the afternoon when my train departed (very nice of her).

When I first checked in at 10 pm, the valet was friendly and it was welcoming. I didn't ask what floor my room was because I'm on a marriott associate rate and therefore not picky about anything. I had requested a king bed and high floor room, which is exactly what I got. I was on the 13th floor (there are only 15 floors) and it was a king. Perfect! I never expect too much due to the rates that I get at Marriott's but they treated me like any other regular rate customer. As for the room, it was really nice. The walk from the elevator to the room was very close. Everything looked brand new and no smelly hotel scent. The lights were dim but I was with my boyfriend and it was a nice atmosphere. I wasn't expecting a fridge but after some looking around, there was a mini fridge in the corner hidden next to the closet. I really like fridges because whenever I go out to eat, I always come back with leftovers and it works better when I dont have to use my portable cooler. The internet is also free! There's wifi (great reception even on the 13th floor) or you can plug it in like I did. Very convenient. The desk was nice to work on and the chair is a comfortable ergonomic one. Out of all the things about this hotel, I actually felt like my luggage and valuables were secure. I never feel secure usually. The HUGE difference between this and marriott waterfront was the safety issue. I had to store my bags and laptop after I checked out at courtyard. The front desk clerk made sure my laptop was safe in the safe deposit box (you get a key and the clerk gets a key, you need both keys to open that box) and she tagged all my bags not with a cheap sticky tag, but one with a string tag. She said that the storage area is video monitored and very safe. It was behind the counter in a room where I saw management staff walking around and that's what I really liked about it. The marriott waterfront's storage is actually right at the front entrance at the valet room and everyone walking into the hotel has a full view of all the bags. It was an awful feeling knowing that a stranger could easily go in and grab something. I wasn't even able to get a safe deposit box there and I felt bad using up the front desk clerks time because there were 7 other people behind me in line at the waterfront (understaffed obviously).....anyways enough about that, that's for another review. I didn't worry one bit about my bags at courtyard. To wrap it up, I loved it here. Valet wasn't an arm and a leg and you can't beat the associate rate at this hotel.

When we checked out and asked for a taxi to take us to the airport, while waiting for the taxi outside the valet guy tried to convince us to go with in his \"uncle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\" car (who would charge us the same as the taxi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c $40).

We were staying in Seattle for the March 25th weekend. Upon arrival at the hotel late Friday (Mar 25) evening the gentleman (an undeserved label) at the front desk checked us in quite promptly and had checked us into a room on the 11th or 12th floor. I asked him what we can do for parking (the website states $26 parking available) and he quickly told me \"There is no parking. You can park anywhere on the street from 6pm to 8am, after 8am it's pay parking.\" Being dismissed rather abruptly, I didn't question him. We took our baggage to the room which was very nice and very clean. The only problem was that it was a room with a bed and a small armchair. This indeed was not the king bed and sofa bed that I had reserved and seeing that we're three grown men, the single bed was not going to cut it. I went back to the front desk and informed him that the room was not as described. He quickly responded with a rude and short \"That's all we have!\" Refraining from speaking the foul language that I wanted to yell at this young man, I told him that there were three of us and I had reserved the room specifically to accommodate that. He rolled his eyes, took the keys back, and went into his secret computer of rooms. He then rudely asks, \"Did you guys mess up the room.\" Uhhh yes, we went into the room for 30 seconds, had an all out party fest in the room, and then came quickly down the stairs and asked for a new room. The nerve of this young man was uncalled for and he was lucky i didn't jump over the desk and strangle him. This is NOT the way you would like to be treated after driving for 2.5 hours on a friday night. The stay for the most part was good, the rooms were nice and clean. We did have another mishap with staff on the saturday. One of the hotel staff (concierge or door person) was walking down the hall past our room. We asked if there were any after hours places we could check out as it was getting quite late. He was short with us and quickly says \"No. You Asked an easy question, you get a quick answer.\" I couldn't believe how rude some of the staff were at this hotel. When we finally checked out on the friday, i took a look at the final invoice and what do you know. They charged me a $26 valet parking fee plus taxes for each night!!! This was laughable as I had to wake up each morning before 8am and move my vehicle because the Front desk guy told me there was no parking. I was fuming by this point. On a bright note, the lady who checked us out was very, very helpful. She took the parking charges off and helped us find our way to SAouthcenter which was our final destination on this trip. If we hadn't come across her, i probably would have given the service rating a one! If you book here, expect a relatively nice hotel for the price, but don't expect customer service or feeling like they'll bend over backwards because you'll be disappointed.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olympia, WA", "Title": "\u201cMediocre hotel, could have stayed at many other better locations in SEA.\u201d", "Author": "greener_007", "ReviewID": "UR103534813", "Content": "I chose this Marriott for its location and supposedly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness-friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 features during a recent business/leisure trip to Seattle. Overall, this hotel is just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcokay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If you want to stay close to Pioneer Square for the Mariners/Seahawks/Sounders, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably not bad. However, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the Courtyard concept to live up to it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness-friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 marketing in reality. First, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historic building, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like the roadside motels you would normally associate with Marriott Courtyards. The rooms were very small. So small, my bed was less than two feet from the window. A chair facing the North wall occupied most of the width. The wardrobe/desk combination was very awkward and not ergonomically friendly. I just worked from the bed using the WiFi. I honestly felt claustrophobic in the room, something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never felt before in a hotel room. I was disappointed, especially since I was entitled to a room upgrade as a Marriott rewards Gold member. The beds are comfortable, though not outstanding. The bathroom was very basic, no thrills, no additional amenities. In the elevator, the hotel had posters announcing that they now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproudly served Starbucks coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Courtyards. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great, except this one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve Starbucks, or SBC. It was the worst coffee I ever had. They have plenty of it downstairs for you, and some in your room too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embarrassing to advertise something you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have, but by weird quirk of fate, is the closest Marriott in the world to the Starbucks global headquarters\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have made such a faux pas! In Seattle! Valet was troublesome. Friendly chaps, but when you arrive at night, sometimes they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re inside chatting with the staff, not outside the hotel. I had to park illegally on 1st avenue for the night and go inside and ask for the valet. Also, you have to text for your car, which costs you the hotel user some change. Granted, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re parking valet, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in for a penny, in for a pound, but a phone call on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dime would be classier. The business center consisted of three all-in-one desktops with a proprietary Windows 7 interface. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t access Win 7, just a browser and the three main office programs (Word, PowerPoint, Excel). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awkward, and it times out at times. No tabs or multiple windows on your browser. I was in desperate need of a scanner and fax, with none to be found. Only a printer. It was a sub-par business center. Upon checkout, I told the desk that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfied, and she apologized, and said I should have been offered better service and accommodations based on my loyalty membership level, and said cheerfully, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnext time!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a next time for me, thank you.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay.\u201d", "Author": "andyhg", "ReviewID": "UR101969612", "Content": "We have stayed in Seattle many times and this was our first here as it's new.

For openers DON'T DRIVE or rent a car. There is NO parking in Seattle anyway and the new mayor is promising that all street parking will be eliminated. Traffic, especially on I-5, is a 24 hour nightmare anywhere in the city. Why bother? Seattle has a perfectly good train which takes you from the airport right to the back door of this hotel! $2.50. 30 minutes. It will take you more than 30 minutes to drive from SeaTac to downtown almost any time of the day, and money to park IF you can find a spot to park at all. Why? The public transportation system is extraordinary, and FREE all through downtown. Just hop on a bus anywhere! Walk down the hills and take the bus back up them. Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, the waterfront, Bellevue, Georgetown? The bus, train, monorail or trolly will get you there faster than driving. Okay - the hotel. The Pioneer Square bus & rail station entrance is almost underneath the hotel. Walking from the airport train, with luggage, will take 2 minutes. It's in the \"old\" section of Seattle so places look \"old\" on the outside, but there are dozens of fine restaurants within 5 or so blocks and many more very good smaller places. The hotel is a converted office building. The rooms are cozy, but pleasant and clean. Security is good. The lobby is small. There is a coffee shop directly across the street from the front door and 5 or 10 more within 2 blocks. Caution: If you are staying a Friday or Saturday night, do NOT choose a room on an upper floor. The band & party noise from the 14th & 15th floors rolls down the outside walls as if all the windows were open. Stay BELOW the 10th floor. It's an old building. The lower floors have more traffic noise, but there is little traffic in that part of Seattle in the mornings on the weekends. Check your room after housekeeping leaves. Housekeeping's sketchy occasionally. You might find there are no drinking glasses, or the coffee perc wasn't refreshed, or, you might be missing soap or shampoo.

The James Street entrance had only one escalator ..... up to the street from the rail. My first room #804 was noisy due to its location in the historic front side of the hotel facing 2nd Avenue. Rm. #804 was a King room with a sofa bed and was on the small side with a coffee table and hassock in the middle of the room taking up space. This room was noisy due to general street traffic out front. I heard every car and truck drive by. I live in Manhattan on a busy corner. I experience urban noise everyday and found this room noisy. This Courtyard needs to sound proof the hotel windows on the front of the building. Rachel, at the front desk, offered a quieter room in the back of the building. I took up the offer. Since I was there only one night, I was upgraded to Studio Room #1020 in the back of the \"newer\" building. Much better, spacious and very quiet. Rooms above the eighth floor in the back of the building have an open view facing the office building area. I was very satisfied by the remedy and promptness of service by the front desk at 10PM. The Bistro restaurant had a nice crowd, decent food selection, especially for breakfast, and newspapers. At night, The Bistro was a practical feature because there was not much nearby. The fitness room was very nice and a good size with all new equipment. The property was very clean and tidy and the staff was enthusiastic. This Courtyard worked for my one night stopover and its convenience to the Sea-Tac Airport light rail station. For a longer stay, I would choose a property closer to the shopping and market area so I could walk around in the evening by myself and feel comfortable.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smyrna, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cYes, it's really a Courtyard!\u201d", "Author": "GeorgiaTraveler4020", "ReviewID": "UR79805103", "Content": "What a pleasant surprise!

I had chosen this property due to its proximity to the AMTRAK station as I left for Vancouver the following morning. It was perfect for that as it was a short walk from the station. The bistro on the property was very nice and there are several coffeeshops nearby. I asked about milk in the small \"store\" in the lobby and they were out.

Friendly front desk staff, stylish \"wired\" Bistro with outlets and TVs in the booths, top-quality cardio machines in their 24-hour-access fitness room. We had one issue with the room, an annoying flashing LED light from the sprinkler that gave the effect of waking up after passing out in a disco (Okay, I made that up). We mentioned it, and by that night there was some duct tape covering the light. That's service! My only issue was that their wireless speed is pretty slow, so I went over to the excellent Seattle Public Library (about 8 blocks away). But the hotel wireless was free, and it worked well enough for email and basic browsing, so not really a big issue.

The building, being completely renovated, is pristine and new on the inside.

The rooms are very quiet at night- you will hear typical big city street noise during the day but did not hear the neighboring rooms at all. Great black out curtains too! We had a corner room which give you lots of lot and appear to be on the larger size. I would be a little cautious if you receive a room on the back side of the hotel below the 8th floor. Your view will be of a brick wall or alley - these are room #01-02 and 17-21. The back half of the hotel is brand new and added to the bulding. If you can be on floor 9 or above you will have no issues. The other rooms will have a street view regardless of the floor you are on.
