Typically, the host hotel for a car show is ok, but not this nice. We strode in wearing our tees and shorts, which was really apparent not the standard attire at this hotel. So I fully expected to be treated by the staff according to our attire. I could not have been more wrong. The front desk person that checked me in was my favorite type of professional - polite, but not stuffy at all. He laughed, joked and smiled, ma'amed when it fit naturally, but up with my stupid questions. His co-worker joined in and there seemed to be a nice camaraderie. The calls to address the little issues during our stay were addressed immediately and a follow up call was made to make sure everything was now resolved. There is secure parking, which was terrific for our situation. The breakfast buffet was the only meal we had, it was very well maintained by staff. There was not a lot of variety, but was offered was really simple, but quite good. I did not miss the array of things typically offered at these things that most do not want to eat. The proximity to the airport may be an issue for some, the airport is in the hotel's back yard. But we were not bothered by it. I am looking for excuses to stay here again.

I enjoyed my stay there the first two nights. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Originally, I had only booked two nights, not knowing my stay would be extended an additional two more days. When I went to the front desk to pay for the additional days, I was told by the \"acting front desk manager\" that since I booked the room through a third party (Hotwire), that I would have to go back on the internet and re-book the additional days. I just stood there dumb-founded. First of all, I was already in the room as a guest and second of all, they had my card information already on file and I was paying cash for the extended stay! WHY, did I have to book the additional nights on the internet (which by the way I did not have a lap-top on me) and I was standing there with cash in my hands?!!! I would have understood if I had just walked off the streets requesting a room and the hotel was INTIRELY BOOKED, but this was not the case. If anyone from managment is reading this Brian Dunn should NOT be interacting with ANY of your customers!! His customers service skills are HORRIBLE!! As I stood there in a panick not knowing where I was going to stay, another front desk reservationist by the name of Robert helped me to secure my room. I asked him if this could have been done in the begining, what was all the extra bulls#@t for? Robert was very helpful and apologized for any inconvience. I told him I would not refer anyone I knew to that hotel and everyone I knew would hear about my bad experience while there. I did ask for the number to corporate and was directed to the hotel manager Kim Cartaino. She did phone me back but did not offer any managerial solutions that would have made me feel better about the entire experience. I am STILL researching how to contact corporate as the information is not made easily available on their website. I am going to make a valid complaint with the head honchos! Does this hotel treat all of their customers like this and no one is complaining? I paid ALOT of money to stay at this hotel for the four days I was there and this isn't even a 5-star hotel!!

The only drawbacks were the fact that there is nothing of real interest within walking distance, and you have to pay $10/night for parking, which seems excessive, since the parking isn't really secure. However, with a room rate of approx. $125/night, it's still a good deal overall. If you do have access to a car, the bus/metro station is within a short driving distance.

Well.............\u201d", "Author": "Djinnphiz", "ReviewID": "UR124961948", "Content": "If you are an aviation fanatic and don't mind being on the edge of Van Nuys airport \u2013 with the attendant over-flight of some quite noisy planes and helicopters, then this place is not \"too bad\". (NOT that there is an amazing amount of alternative choices available locally...) Patently, there is an \"old\" part and a \"new part\" to this establishment \u2013 and whilst the new part is as neutral and sterile as any similar hotel of this class, the older part is definitely in severe need of a \"freshening\". The staff are OK - mostly. In general, they were both helpful and welcoming: then again I had a couple if contacts that lacked both warmth, welcome and empathy. Perhaps I'm overly critical. Everyone is entitled to an \"off\" day... EXCEPT in the hospitality industry. I guess that \u2013 as a Manager \u2013 you get what you pay for, and for sure there was no-one overtly and obviously destined to greater things within the possibilities of some other better class of (internationally-reaching) establishment. The bar-fare is typically carbo-heavy USA-style. With a touch of Mexican influence. The service here was proficient if not other than neutral in character. Which \u2013 again \u2013 is OK. One doesn't always want one's Barman to be one's \"best friend\" either... The buffet breakfast was more-or-less correct for this kind of hotel \u2013 and it was finally good to find some fresh vegetables and even fruit. The bacon was D-licious \u2013 but the omellette majorly sucked. As with most other places of this kind that I've experienced in the US, the coffee and tea was indifferent and typically devoid of any class or style: being of the simple, passe-partout blends that reflect economic considerations and a culinary ignorance born out of commercial pragmatism. I was in the New Wing and the accommodation was equivalent to my expectations \u2013 a decent sized room, clean, efficient AC and with functional but indifferent furniture. The TV offered what it was supposed to offer as entertainment, the bathroom was as it should be and everything that I could see was as clean as one might expect: but this is not the kind of establishment where I would necessarily be overtly looking under the bed... The mattress was OK \u2013 as were the pillows. All-in-all, a very standard, and honest, room with no unpleasant surprises. There is a \"kind-of\" coffee shop in the entrance that offers a limited assortment of seemingly not very fresh, and obviously commercially-derived buns, cakes and other typical American stomach-stuffers. The coffee could almost have been a kind or ersatz \u2013 so very ordinary was it in taste. Not impressed either by the styrofoam cups... The swimming pool is a strange \"L\" shape and, unfortunately, due to it's steps at both ends \u2013 along with rounded corners \u2013 it's impossible to really do any laps, if so inclined... The surroundings are soulless, and the usual easy-maintenance but characterless, concrete, sunbathing area, was furnished with some equally banal plastic lounges, some of which were broken and needed maintenance. The only interesting detail about this hotel are some of the pictures that are displayed on the corridor walls and which depict the quite interesting pictorial devolution of the airport from its foundation days. Indeed, with the aircraft hanging from the ceiling in the entrance lobby \u2013 that provides some kind of focus of interest \u2013 the place very much rests on its laurels as an erstwhile welcomer of aeronautically-interested fans. I guess at the start of the airport in those early days, there wasn't very much choice at all for accommodation locally... It seems to have survived and modestly thrived through being a useful conference facility serving the environs. Quite who its clients are in this area I was not able to discern. But \u2013 Hey! \u2013 why not...? I wouldn't see it personally as having a particular \"retreat attraction factor\", but for that day-long meeting serving the needs of provincial businessmen, its facilities are more than adequate. No doubt it also serves well for local marriage, and other celebratory functions. All of which is good... I don't know what it is in the 'States - as opposed to Europe or Australasia. Maybe because \u2013 as a statistical fact \u2013 so few Americans actually have passports and travel abroad \u2013 (and so are not able to educate themselves as to other traveller's standards) \u2013 but it would seem that there are really only three categories of hotels. The VERY good \u2013 amongst which could also be classified the \"boutique\" establishments; the pretentiously \"good\" \u2013 but which are, by international standards, actually rather ordinary; and then there are the \"in-and-out\"-category \u2013 what I personally think-of as \"service\" hotels: such as the Motel Chains and the small, privately-run places along the highways \u2013 or on the outskirts of the town. This hotel would sit at the bottom end of the middle category: essentially a trifle more pretentious than it really ought to be and living off a \u2013 perhaps \u2013 once past, \"local reknown\". Cast aside this pretentiousness and all other things considered, therefore, I would rate this hotel as entirely \"pedestrian\" and of \"limited merit' \u2013 its sole, and main, attractive point being that for anyone flying out of Van Nuys \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 it is convenient. Other than that, it really is no better than most any other hotel of the same genre and only differentiates itself from a Motel-Chain quality of establishment through \u2013 precisely \u2013 its pretensions to be more than it isn't, and will never be.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201csmells like my grandparents' basement\u201d", "Author": "barefeetchick", "ReviewID": "UR124621525", "Content": "The pictures may look like it has been updated, but unfortunately, even if new furniture were added, the place hasn't actually been cleaned in I don't know how long.

Alma was by far the best though. Friendly and very professional, with amazing ideas and very understanding of the stress of planning a wedding. All the staff was pretty amazing during the planning and the day of the wedding. They even did some things for us that would have costed us money and they threw them in for free. The food is sooooo good! They did a great job in decorating, attending to our guests.they were open to following a recipe I created for a signature drink, and they served it. The banquet room was awesome. Our guests have reported that during the cocktail hour while we were taking pictures, they never ran out of appetizers and that they were very good. We got to stay in a terrace spa suite for our wedding night, wow! so pretty, huge terrace right in front of the runway. Some people may not like it though because of the noise,, but we loved it! We didn't have any problems checking in or out, and apparently no other family members had any issues. We had like 30 rooms rented and things went pretty smoothly. We have been back for dinner and lunch, and still, food is great. Hotel and rooms are older, but this hotel in the middle of Van Nuys, not such a great area, is pretty cute and has a special charm. So far, we have had good experiences with them, we have been back just to have dinner and lunch at their restaurant, Landings, and again very very good experience, food is great. We are definitely going back this month and staying there for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for Airplane Lovers\u201d", "Author": "idahosandy", "ReviewID": "UR116941538", "Content": "Situated on the east side of the parallel runways (16L and 16R) at the famous Van Nuys airport you have a great view of the busy airport.

Firstly, the Airtel is located in Van Nuys. For those of you not familiar, Van Nuys is a working class neighborhood and the Airtel is located next to one of the runways of the Van Nuys airport. Check in was smooth but they do charge $12 for parking. The parking lot is not secure and I did notice some broken glass in the parking lot. We stayed in the newer tower but the room was just ok. Some members of our family complained the room had a certain odor. The new tower rooms are located near their convention center/ballroom. The first evening we were there, someone was having a Quincea\u00f1era (party). The front desk did offer to move us (but Im not sure why they would put us so close since the music was quite loud to begin with). One thing that bothered me was that the entry into the hotel was NOT secured. So anyone could gain access to the hotel. The newer tower is away from the front desk so I would keep this in mind if you decide to stay here. We had breakfast in the buffet and it was typical with fruits, breads, eggs, etc. Pool was ok.

The room I stayed in was comfortable and had basic amenities. There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. I didn't care for the decor, nor the style of the bed (ugly headboard). The room and bathroom were very clean, and everything functioned. Being at the Van Nuys airport the hotel lobby naturally has an airplane motif: Pan Am posters and other nostalgia everywhere. Very nice to look at! I really liked the large, articulated model of a Boeing 747 hanging from the ceiling. Other miscellaneous items: breakfast was not provided, and parking was $9. I'm told charging for parking is \"normal\" for the area, but there are certain levels of hospitality I expect. Charging someone to stay in the hotel, then charging them to park their vehicle, is a little low in my book. The bottom line is: I've paid less and received more at other places.

I had work in the valley and this was a central location. Plus, there really is nothing else in the valley that would be better. The room was adequate, nothing special. Bed was decent. Everything was clean and the sheets and towels were of good quality. As a pilot I kind of appreciated the 'Airplane theme' and the proximity to the Van Nuys Airport, its out the back door. The kids will love it. I never noticed the plane noise, but was in a room facing away from the runways. The cleaning staff was hit or miss. The first day I had a newspaper and the room was cleaned well. The second day, no paper and the bed was half made. No big deal, but not great service. There is free WiFi in the entire hotel which is cool and the parking was $9/day. Reasonable by LA standards, but annoying when you are paying $150/night for a room. The restaurant is decent but a bit overpriced, basically hotel prices. There are several restaurants about 3 miles away on Ventura Blvd. Chilis, Buca, Sushi and others. Nothing real close to the hotel except for Subway, McD's and Jack in the Box. There are a few Starbucks in the area but the cafe in the lobby has excellent coffee so I just bought it there. All in all a decent hotel, nothing to write home about, but nothing horrible.

Totally convenient to all areas. It's sits next to the Van Nuys airport, where small private jets and planes can be seen landing often. Despite it's location, the airplane noise is minimal on the airport side, and non existent on the opposite side. The rooms are spacious and clean, with large televisions and complete web access. The food is great, and they've updated their bar Clipper Club (named for the aircraft.) It now has a sleek Asian-esque theme to it. The decor makes me feel like I am in Hong Kong or Singapore, with this awesome rickshaw and palm trees. The low lighting sets a nice atmosphere, and the many places to it allows for great conversation.They make killer drinks, and you never feel like they underpour. They are stocked with top shelf liquors and have a wide array to choose from. The appetizers are tasty and always are fresh. I've never eaten anything there that seems to have sit, an unfortunate experience I've had elsewhere. I love the margaritas and long islands! The gym has all the things you'd need for a good workout after a meeting or long trip, and the big pool and hot tub are at a comfortable temperature. You can request rooms in different towers. I got their number of the airtelplaza dot com site and called them for such a request. One of the best attributes I have found at The Airtel Plaza is the friendly, courteous, and accommodating staff. There are too few individuals in the \"Service\" industry who have any idea what service is. The staff here does, and really bends over backward to help make your stay more pleasurable and comfortable.

It was nice to have a warm pool and a HOT tub to soak in. The pool area it self was a little tacky, and the hallways were very dirty and stained. It didn't look like anyone had vacuumed them in over a week. The area around the hotel was dirty and seemed very unsafe. We got a little lost and ended up in an ally 2 blocks from the hotel, and there were old matresses, old couches, trash, broken down cars all over the place. We were trying to get out of the area around Hollywood, and stay somewhere a little nicer. Not. Having to pay to park was irritating. If there was some sort of security walking around all the time it probably wouldn't have been as irritating, but I saw no one- other than the attendant in the little box at the entrance. I suppose this hotel got it's three stars due to the expensive restaraunt in the lobby, and the fitness/pool area. Better place for business travelers - not families. We paid a ridiculous $99/night off priceline. I would maybe spend $60 a night but not much more if I hadn't been stuck with it through priceline. It says it's a three star hotel. I give it two. there isn't anyplace close to eat, or clean for that matter. We ended up driving all the way to Sherman Oaks trying to find someplace that looked clean.
