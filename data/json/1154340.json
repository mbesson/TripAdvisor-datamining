{"Reviews": [{"Content": "poinciana is amazing! If you're up for pure relaxation, mouth watering food, being surrounded by kind locals and amazing scenery, then Poinciana is the place for you as it was for me.My friend and I stayed at Poinciana on two different occasions throughout our stay in Bali. The first visit was for 3 nights.After our short stay we headed back to Kuta for shopping and the night life for a week, but got over being among the crowd and chaos, so we decided to go back up to Poinciana resort for the rest our holiday in Bali.We ate delicious food, drank, swam, relaxed, indulged in massages, went snorkeling, went water skiing, (or should I say attempted), and simply had a great time.It is a beautiful place and suits anyone, any age. My friend and I were both 17 at the time and immensely enjoyed it.Thank you for an amazing holiday!!!", "Date": "Dec 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394188381", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Rookus"}, {"Content": "Brilliant Poinciana!

In the natural beauty of the north of Bali, where there are much fewer tourists than the south, the real Bali is still alive and well. And, in our opinion, the Poinciana is the most beautiful property on the coast and extremely reasonable. Located directly on the Bali Sea, this small, intimate resort of seven villas (which accommodate from 2 to 6 people each) was, in every way, perfect. The villas are situated around a beautiful infinity pool, located right in front of the (black lava) beach. The wonderful restaurant, Jepun Bali (Plumeria) serves mouth-watering Balinese, Indonesian and Western dishes, as well as great breakfasts, lunches and the most delicious fresh fruit drinks. The lush gardens and coco palms on the beach convey a tropical paradise, and the owner (Nyoman) and the resort's friendly and courteous staff are always ready to fulfill their guests desires (massages, driving tours, etc.) Fantastic place!!!! Our favorite spot in Bali!www.poincianaresortbali.com", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR846044509", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lup"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608498-d1154340-r23028700-Poinciana_Resort-Tembok_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1154340", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
