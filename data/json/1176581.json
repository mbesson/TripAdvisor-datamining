When their flight left Nashville, I flew into action and called the hotel. I explained the nightmare my wife was living through, and was reassured by the staff that they would take care of my family. I asked for ridiculous things (diapers, bottle, milk, bathroom supplies, a crib in the room, etc). AND THEY DELIVERED!

I can't express my appreciation and satisfaction enough to this amazing crew.

However, the reviews on Tripadvisor do not do it justice. This hotel is truly a little gem in a huge city such as Phoenix. The impressive service started at the airport where our shuttle driver offered us cold water from a cooler. It went down very well considering we had arrived in the early evening and temps were still hovering around 100F. On arrival, the evening desk clerk was extremely welcoming and friendly, even throwing in a free breakfast buffet when we asked. Warm freshly-baked cookies were also offered as well. The room was a decent size, and nicely decorated with an extremely comfortable bed. The only downside is when we arrived to our room, there were dirty dishes and trays from breakfast on the hallway floor right at our door. When we mentioned it to the clerk, they were taken away promptly with apologies. Location-wise, it is in a deserted area maybe bordering on seedy. However, it is very safe walking around the area, albeit a bit deserted. Other reviewers noted there is an In and Out Burger \"right across the street\" when in reality, it is 5 miles away. There is really nothing nearby food-wise within walking distance, except for a Bill Johnson's Big Apple a short walk away, which offers decent diner food with good service. We didn't try the hotel restaurant other than the buffet breakfast in the morning.

From check-in to check-out, the staff at this hotel can't do enough for you, always smiling, pleasant and professional.

This time I couldn't get a room there so opted for this one which is north of the airport. The rates are slightly higher, but that is because the hotel is in much better condition. Service was excellent from the front desk to the restaurant. The room seemed so new and comfortable. Free internet throughout the hotel although a bit slow (0.5Mbps down and 0.1Mbps up). Great selection of TV channels. Comfy bed. Nice bathroom with walk in shower. Business center to print off boarding passes. The restaurant seems to have good dinner selections, but limited vegetarian dishes. That would be my only complaint. I did see the pool which is in an awkward location. Right on the front side of the hotel where people on the street can see into the pool area. I didn't have time to use it, but I doubt I'd be comfortable in the cramped area visible from the parking lot and street. The pool at the Airport South location was way better if you are looking for a nice pool.

Definitely the best customer service I have ever had from a hotel. The beds were amazing. They were so soft you just sunk into them. There were plenty of blankets on the bed and a free breakfast. The towels were huge.

Stayed two nights, they gave me exactly the room I had requested (ask for mountain view!). Quiet location, you will need a rental car to get around in Phoenix/Scottsdale (but anyone I know gets a rental here). Or use their airport shuttle. I was impressed by the modern and clean room, fast internet, modern flat screen TV, great shower, comfortable bed - and the overall friendlyness of the staff. Kudos to the breakfast service and the cook who makes exellent omelettes to order. Great choice of breakfast items. Fast elevators.

This Hilton fitted the bill very well. The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. For instance the shuttle bus driver insisted on unloading and moving our numerous bags (we were camping) but disappeared to help someone else before we could tip him. The barman was similarly friendly and chatty. And the barfood was good quality comfort food, Rooms big and clean as might be expected, and the shuttle runs to the airport every 30mins (call on landing to find out where to meet it). It was quite pricy despite booking six months in advance (180 USD) but otherwise perfect if like us you prefer to pick-up your hire car the morning after arrival.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat for What it Is!\u201d", "Author": "turtle040", "ReviewID": "UR28815693", "Content": "We paid an advance internet price, and for what you pay you really get a lot.
