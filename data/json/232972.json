{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't stay here. Four women from the USA stayed at the Olimpia Hotel on the Plaza de Republic and I must say that the staff were the most offensive that we encountered in our five weeks in Europe. I asked the assistant manager if we had somehow offended him as he was extremely rude to us during our stay. He denied and said it was a language problem. Not so. Our room wouldn't lock and when we brought this to his attention he raised his voice and yelled that It's not possible for our door not to lock. At last he followed me to the room and amazingly the door didn't lock. The bathroom was a disaster with the shower head coming out of the wall, soaking the bathroom with every shower. Beds were impossible. The only saving grace was its location. I would never encourage anyone to stay at this hote unless you enjoy being mistreated.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR186388640", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kdixon"}, {"Content": "No way...not ever again! I stayed here with some friends for 2 nights in June. TheONLY thing going for this 2 Star hotel is the fantasticlocation...right on the Piazza Republica. Our room wasvery musty and the old fan did not work. Thankfully, theevenings were fairly cool, but in deep summer, it would bea problem. The included breakfast was just so-so...with,as the previous reviewer mentioned, terrible coffee. Thelittle bar below the hotel had fantastic coffee, though.The shower was something to behold...and be sure to takeeverything out of the room....towels, toilet paper etc. asthey will get soaked. The main problem was in discoveringthat our door did not lock. When we talked to the managerabout this, he became very angry and did not believe us.Upon showing him, he then became angrier and felt likewe had somehow broken the lock. He attempted to fixthe problem, but it could still be shoved open if you reallytried...this did not make us very comfortable leaving ourthings in the room the last day.

We were thrilled to come into our airy and cool room at the Olimpia.What other guests have said is true. The bathroom shower is less than ideal and the elevator is small and old, but for the price (70 Euro a night for two) it was an excellent buy.We didn't really mind the shower or elevator as we had expected them from reading other reviews and many times we just took the stairs as the hotel was only on the 3rd floor. All in all we felt that the whole atmosphere was charming and fun.The room was very comfortable if a little stark. The tile floors felt great on our feet after walking in the hot sun all day and the little balcony that looked onto the road below was wonderful. We could see the top of the duomo and a renaissance or medieval (can't remember) church was right across the road. The breakfast area looks over the Piazza Della Republica and we watched the early morning sunlight bath the surrounding buildings and the top of the duomo while we ate breakfast. The coffee was fresh and delicious and we throughly enjoyed the breakfast. (Although we are both cereal and croissant type breakfast eaters and that's pretty much what there was.)It truly was a great location. The Uffizi is only about three blocks away and the Duomo is only down the street maybe a block away. Every site we visited (except San Miniato on the hillside and maybe the Palazzo Pitti) was easily accessible by foot in about ten minutes or less. I can not stress enough how great this was. We never had to worry about cabs. We even walked (with our luggage) from the train station and didn't have a problem. (Though I must say that we are both in our early twenties, though not athletic at all. Still, for older travelers this may not be the case.) There was also a tasty and convenient little gilato and snack shop called Mio Bar right under the hotel, which was perfect for picking up sandwiches or cold pizza to take with us on our travels during the day and for getting gelato when we were hot and tired on our return trip.The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Though they spoke broken english they made their best effort to get through any minor language barriers and were always nice.We are a young couple on a tight budget so we needed something relatively cheap and we felt like we got a bargain. We would stay there again in a heartbeat, even if we weren't on such a tight budget.

This is a quirky little place, more like a 2 star back-packer hotel. First off, it's located in a no parking zone, so access is a problem if you have a car anyway. Plus, a garage has to come get your car and you pay 25E/night for that (typical in Italy). The driving directions were a little hard to follow as well. Then, once you found the building, you took a (service?) elevator up to the fourth floor or so, which is where the hotel lobby is located. In the rooms, the shower was not separated from the rest of the bathroom, so you could do your business and shower at the same time if you wanted to -- I'm not sure whether that's a positive or negative!OK, but once you are THERE, the location is right ON the Piazza del Republica, and that is definitely where you want to be in Florence (Ask for one of the rooms looking down on the piazza). You are within a ten minute walk to just about anywhere (David, Uffizi, Duomo, train station, Ponte Vecchio), and the night life (street performers, restaurants, etc.) in the piazza is great. We didn't spend a nickel any night for entertainment (OK, except for multitudinous gelatos), and had a great time.The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful, although the second shift guys weren't too English proficient (but we always got whatever we needed). The continental breakfast was also weaker than most the 3-4 star hotels we stayed in.
