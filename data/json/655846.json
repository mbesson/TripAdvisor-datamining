The free shuttle service could bring you to and from the airport every 30 minutes, from the airport you can take the train to the cities you need to go to. Would not stay here if Amsterdam is where you want to visit every day. This is the only hotel we have stayed in Netherlands which allow 2pm late check out. Well done! Most hotels want you out by 10am, some 12noon without allowing for late check out. The front office and cleaning staffs are very friendly. The standard room is not spacious but enough for one night or two. There is no view or anything fancy.

Upon entrance, it appears very modern, functional and pleasant but the feeling you get is somewhat cold and distant so for a 5 country - europe trip that we did, while this hotel did not fare badly at all, it was not too memorable either. Asked for a double but they could only give a twin over here. Some hotels would have tried to mitigate the gap but putting 2 layers of it across the 2 beds to make the in between line less uncomfortable but they did not. Free Wifi was available at the lobby and in the room, it was only through the cable. However if it's really a business hotel, i think they should upgrade it to wireless internet in the rooms too, otherwise with ipads, you can't use the cable unless you have a laptop. Coffee/tea making facilities were available. Bathroom was modern with a wide sink and hairdryer plus the soft lighting was nice. No bathtub in this room but it's fine with me. A bit of trouble for me to turn the shower on as it's a bit different from the usual H for Hot and C for Cold adjustments. Would have preferred the complimentary shampoo/soap to come in take-away bottles instead of just a large multi-purpose pump bottle. Something about the layout that i didn't feel too good about -- if someone is sitting at the desk surfing on their laptops and you just came out from the shower, you couldn't really pass through from the shower to get to the bedroom without the person moving from the desk/chair. Lastly, we stayed for 1 night and had not yet checked out as it was only around 7.50am so we did not appreciate that the cleaning lady had already knocked on our doors and opened them up to ask to clean the room.

Due to a conference taking place in town, rooms were hard to come by in the city center, so we opted for the Park Plaza as it was only a \"20 min tram ride\" into the city. However this does not include the 22 min walk to the nearest tram station (or 15 min if you walk briskly). This distance is just far enough to make a taxi seem like a waste of money, and walking to feel like a waste of time. A 90 minute roundtrip to the city is not great if you're here as a tourist. The hotel itself is also overpriced (approx $400 / night), but this could just be due to the conference that was running that week. I booked a double room, and it came with two twin beds pushed together. The rooms were functional, but do not plan on doing anything but sleeping and taking a shower. The room has a safe, 22\" LCD tv, and both European and UK power sockets. Everywhere in the hotel was clean and tidy - rooms and public spaces. The hotel staff was excellent - professional, but not unfriendly. While I like to speak different languages when I travel in Europe, it was a nice break that everyone speaks English here. Breakfast was not great. Buffet-style: cereals, fruit, pastries, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, baked beans, mushrooms, tomatoes. So everything was there, but the flavors were off somehow (e.g. extra-salty bacon, watery coffee). Also the juices weren't re-filled for quite some time.... not sure what was going on there.

Breakfast was basic and the cooked items I tried (beans sausage and poor bacon) were only luke warm.

It is certainly not a 4* hotel by any recognised international standard (I have stayed in better serviced and maintained 2* hotels). The airport transfer service is unreliable (waited for nearly an hour in the rain for it to arrive at Schiphol), and the staff in check-in are painfully slow (the comments below about long waits for check-in despite being the only person there sound familiar). Check out was worse, with ill trained staff who clearly had no idea what they were doing taking nearly 5 minutes to check a single guest out leading to long queues of extremely irate guests. While at first glance the room looked good, I soon found that appearances can be deceptive. The rooms aren't cleaned properly (I found rubbish from previous guests left in drawers and cupboards in the room) and there was damage to several appliances in the room which had not been attended to (in one instance, pieces had been swept under the sofa). The gym is pitiful (six old machines in an ill ventilated room, with a limit of 5 people at any time in it) which would explain the lack of signposting to it and the reluctance of the check-in staff to grant access to it. Overall, the combination of rotten customer service, high prices and terrible location (the website says ten minutes from the airport, but fails to mention it is ten minutes at 120kph down a motorway) really make this a dreadful place to stay. Probably okay for a one night stay when passing through the airport if theres nowhere else available, anything longer than that and you would be better to find somewhere decent.

We were starving as hadn't eaten in ages and were told there was no food available as kitchen shut at 11pm. This is a 5 star hotel! Surely to be 5 star there would be 24 hour room service at the very least! They told us our only option was to use the vending machine which I must say was pretty much empty! Finally, to top it all off, we took our hunger to the bar for peanuts and a few quite drinks. It was supposed to be open till 1pm, the barman obviously had other ideas and wanted an early mark! He was rude and disrespectful, switching lights off around us, not serving us for ages between each drink, and talking to colleagues at the other end of the bar. We weren't the only people drinking at the bar! Finally the free internet is only available in a small area at reception.

The beds would slip apart quite often (we lost the remoted three times in the crack). When trying to get to the airport, definitely check with the front desk and get put on the 'list'. We did not do this and we were not made aware that we needed to do this and so when we went to leave for the airport, we were told it was full and that we could take the train in (20 min walk to station) or call a taxi on our dime. I was a bit upset by this news as one reason we booked this hotel was for the free shuttle. The hotel manager on duty however, decided to take care of the taxi bill for us.

Now that I am looking for a new deal, I can not find one and shoudl pay almost double for 1 night plus park and fly option. That is too expensive for this hotel! First: it is not too close to the airport. The hotel looks nice though, businessstyle and the room is sufficiently big, an okay bathroom, maybe a bit too modern design, but everything clean. The location is in a business district, and because they have a shuttlebus to Schiphol airport, they can call it an airport hotel. With a good deal this is a good option, better than Ibis (and with the deal I mentioned before, this was cheaper than Ibis... but now it is 30 euro more... not a good option!) This used to be the Holiday Inn (same hotel, different name). So you know what quality to expect. All in all: an okay sleepexperience. A few points of criticism. There are two spots to park a car. Upstairs at the entrance, in front of the lobby. Where your car can be seen and where you can enter the entrance. Or downstairs, where there is few light in the evening, where the door to the entrance is locked in the evening (so you can NOT enter, what a joke!) and where it basically feels very unsafe. There you would not want to park your car for several weeks! But if there is no space upstairs, you might have to. We luckilly had the space upstairs. All in all, when you come in the evening and there is only parking downstairs, you probably feel very bad for choosing this hotel. Going outside and up with all your suitcases, duh! The wordt point for us though: when I came back the shuttle bus on Schiphol airport left me standing 2 times. Yes, 2 times. First time I just missed it but ran and waived... no response, could be bad luck. Second time, the bus stood in a completely different spot parked and when I noticed and waived in front, it completely ignored me (female busdriver) and drove without stopping, I also ran behind it... nothing. If they would come by every 20 minutes, it would be a bit okay, but they don't. So all in all: a good deal but not a very good experience.

The one restaurant had a dinner menu with 4 entrees, none of which were very appealing. I ordered the \"Tom Yam\" which is supposed to be a mixed seafood dinner. Twenty-five euros will get you one mussel, one shrimp, and two tiny pieces of fish, in a tangy sauce. Looked nice, and tasted ok, but it would have left a bird hungry. My wife had a \"seared\" tuna appetizer on greens, which was three small, too well cooked pieces of tuna on sweet pickle slices. I saw later there was a bar menu, of which I was not aware.

One of the reasons for choosing this hotel was the free Internet access in rooms that is specifically advertised on their web site. When I logged in I was asked to pay 22 euros for 24 hours of access. I asked at the front desk and the clerk told me that free access was only available in public areas. I got the code for that, logged on and then went back to the front desk with the hotel's web page stating room access was free on my screen.
