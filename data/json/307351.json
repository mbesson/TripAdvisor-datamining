{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Choice in Tokyo We have just returned from a 4 night stay at te Edmont hotel and were very impressed. Its not ideally situated for tourists being a few miles outside away from any of the main areas but is a 5min walk from both the Idibashi Metro line and the Idibashi JR Line so is accessible to most of the city in a very short space of time courtesy of the extremely efficient Tokyo transportation network (it took us nearly 2 days to get our head round this vast network of lines).But back to the hotel.Reception and bell staff were great and all spoke excellent english.Rooms were all lovely and kept to a high standard by the housekeeping.Breakfasts were buffet style which suited us, and both a continental and japanesse style were available. Couldnt find fault at all with this.The hotel seems to cater largely for business people but we found it excellent for tourists as well. If you want to be right bang in the middle of things then you are prob better off in Shinjuku or Ropponggi, but if you are happy do all your sight seeing during te day and to have a bit of a quieter life later on (we were shattered after being on the go all day) and dont mind getting your using the subway lines then the Edmont is an excellent choice", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR529923482", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "King_Henrik"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, Great Location Great Hotel, in a central location, excellent staff and facilities.Easy to get around Tokyo, as the Subway and JR line are only 5 mins walk from the Hotel.Rooms are comfortable, and have alll the mod cons.Recommend the hotel for business trips and weekend getaways into Tokyo.Close to shopping, Tokyo Dome  a lot of dining options are availble both at the Hotel and just 5 mins from the Hotel.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR166137035", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ScottRotorua"}, {"Content": "business and pleasure I stayed at this hotel in 2004 on business with my husband and two small children.
