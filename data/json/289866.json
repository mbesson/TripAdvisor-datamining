My review centers on the booking process, Hotel Stella\u2019s web site and their \u201cBest Rate Guarantee.\u201d I usually try to book via hotel web sites for budget hotels, recognizing that it\u2019s better for a budget hotel, not to have to pay a commission to booking engines. Because Hotel Stella also offered a \u201cBest Rate Guarantee\u201d I made my reservation with confidence. Misguided! I made a reservation for 3 nights, the first night I accepted a triple room because a single was not available; the other two nights I booked a single room. On their reservation page I requested a single room for the first night, should one become available. Later I checked Booking.com and found that they offered a single room for all three nights and at a lower rate then Hotel Stella\u2019s web site. When I checked in I asked the receptionist about the \u201cBest Rate Guarantee\u201d and he told me that it only applied to reservations made by telephone, although this is not indicated on their web site. He also said that they must pay their web site money for each booking, thus the reason why it only applies to telephone reservations. I asked if they had changed my booking as requested to a single room on the first night, but they had not, even though a room had become available, but was no longer available upon my arrival. When I checked out I asked Rodice, the receptionist, again about the Best Rate Guarantee and what it means. She couldn\u2019t tell me and basically said that other published rates might be better, but there is no recourse. I asked if they would adjust the rate of my triple room to a single room and she refused. Thus I would not recommend booking via their web site, until you check out a few booking engines. The triple room I had for the first night was on the 6th floor, which looked entirely different from the hotel, giving me the impression that they were private apartments. There are no numbers on the doors and I had to return to reception to find out which room I was in and request assistance opening the door because there are two sets of locks and one key. Both the triple room and the single room were very clean. The single room bed was very uncomfortable. The \u201crich continental breakfast\u201d does not have cold cuts as advertised on their web site and the cheese is processed cheese in individual wrappers. Not the best breakfast especially if you are staying a few days, but certainly not the worst I have had either! The internet site pictures of the rooms seem professional staged and don\u2019t reflect the current status of the rooms, which isn\u2019t bad, just a bit more \u201cused\u201d looking. The current picture showing a brown sofa tucked in the left hand corner, lots of glass windows and a vast reception area IS NOT the Hotel Stella. Free internet available, good secure storage and a bathroom for use after checkout. Overall the rooms are functional and very clean; my main disappointment was in the booking process, honesty and lack of costumer care by reception. There is definitely room for improvement!", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cWords to the wise...\u201d", "Author": "andybest82", "ReviewID": "UR121769881", "Content": "Most of the things, one is to expect from a 3 star hotel. They therefore did not influence my rating. Others one does not always expect which can be either good or bad. These did influence my rating. I start by saying I would recommend this place if you want a little bit more \"leisure\" then you would expect from a 3 start hotel but mainly use the hotel to sleep in, because your aim is to work, or travel around Rome all day, like I did. The positives; - cheap price - location well connected by Metro (Termini - line A and B, Costro Pretorio - line B, Republica - line A). Nevertheless, beware of Termini after 7pm - some rather dodgy characters turn up. You should be fine if in a group and/or highly aware of your surroundings. _ exceptionally clean place. Bathroom always cleaned spotless and bed always tidied wrinkeless. Except the last night where the room smelled slightly like the maid had eaten a tuna sandwich. I would not recommend the place to a germophobe due to the fitted carpet which though vacuumed is definitely not going to be dust and germ free. - tv with good (non-crap) channels - as long as you understand Italian. I barely stayed at the hotel but sleeping to a good film on a nice 32 inch flat screen was a nice touch. - personnel was helpful. Any question I had, they answered properly. - after check out you can leave luggage in a safe place until it's time for you to leave - the free internet point, recently installed, is definitely a value added. The internet point is really just an internet enabled PC. The PC was more tired than I was after 5 days of non-stop walking, but just for the fact a PC was even available this point does not effect my rating. The personnel were also kind enough to allow me to print all the the tickets I had bought online at no extra cost. The negatives; - breakfast was very limited as one would expect from a 3 star hotel. However I have been in a 2.5 star hotel in prague with a LOT more choice and quality of food. - late check out not allowed - Despite being helpful, personnel were arguably not that friendly - it's hard to see a smile even if you make them smile. I was told this is common place in Rome however I found many places (restaurants, etc) with a better attitude towards the customer. - the hotel itself does not have a restaurant. for me this was not a big issue because I would rather eat all round Rome. If you need a restaurant close by, this is not a problem as the surroundings are littered with restaurants, osterias and bars. However quality is pretty low or/and expensive, with only a few exceptions. - the worst thing about the hotel (but not sure if this is common to most of Rome - many forums seems to hint at this) is the noise. No double glazed glass, no sound insulation in the walls and ceilings/floors. You can hear people walking by your door (unless it's just because all the heavily obese and hyper people came out to party in the corridors between 11pm and 9 am), TVs, maids, people in the room above moving furnature every night (possibly in preparation for the hyper-obese party?), people going down the stairs, and finally drilling and other works going on within the shaft which my room window overlooked", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRome in a weekend\u201d", "Author": "Sam H", "ReviewID": "UR121695363", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend from 9-12 December 2011. In bullet point format: -Room is basic but perfectly adequate. We had no complaints. -Breakfast. Continental. It is small compared to a fry up that's for sure but after the initial shock of not having a 5* hot breakfast the atmosphere has a relaxed ambiance about it....something we appreciated in Rome the more we stayed. Its a roll each, croissant each, tea, coffee, and that funny choice of pomegranate or purple juice! Comes with spreadable cheese, jam, honey all in mini packets, that sort of thing. I grew to like this as the start to the day. -Location. Fantastic. Right near the Termini station. From here you can get the metro (two simple lines, A and B so easy to follow), bus, coach, open top tours. Makes life easy if you are there to explore, which we most definitely did. Other tips: -Airport to hotel. If you arrive anytime between 5am and 11pm you will find it easy to get from the airport to the Roma Termini. Bus, coach (simplest and \u00a34-\u00a36), taxi (\u00a350 but share as we did and this drops). Be prepared to be rushed by taxis when you leave, just be patient, calm and make a choice if you prefer taxi for comfort, or coach for cost. If you arrive, as we did, after 11pm, signs may say a coach is available to 1am or later but they are not easy to find. So we found another couple, and shared a taxi with them. A lot of people head towards the Roma Termini, get here and your hotel is moments away. Rome- You can not fully explore the ins and outs of Rome in 3 days but it was just right for us. You will easily cover the main tourist sights with a little time to check out the not so common places. Roma Pass - we got one and it saved hassle more than anything. It gets you on all transport (but not to airport) so just on a bus, or the metro or tram and its free. Cost wise, we broke about even and it does save a queue into the Colosseo. You get free entry into two attractions plus discounts thereon, as least try to use the two free ones (Colosseo being one). Cost - Its not that expensive. Food is reasonable, drinks..especially wine, is \u00a35-\u00a37 for .5 litre of house wine. Not forgetting that's 2/3rds of a bottle and considering that comes with a view of the Colosseo or Pantheon, it's very reasonable. If you want expensive try Brussels where a beer in central areas is \u00a35+ a half pint (standard measure). Food, we never paid more than \u00a350 / euro (rate pretty much even) and that included wine and a nice meal. We planned on \u00a3100 each a day but came back with plenty of change. Vatican - We paid for one of the many tours on offer. It gets you in without queuing which is vital, if you are there for 3 days you have not got the time to queue. We paid \u00a340/euro each which included the \u00a325 of entry fees. Nice to have someone explaining what it is you are looking at and it lasted over 3 hours. Don\u2019t miss the Pope at mid-day Sundays, all in Italian but very good experience. Borghese - Book it. Cant be booked Sundays (although open), closed Mondays. This was our only mistake as we missed what we think would have been a good part of the break. The hotel will book for you. Language: Learn just the most basic of words to get a good response from staff at the hotel / restaurants. Bonjourno, Arividerchi, Chow (spelling\u2026???) is enough, it really helps. Other reviews: Try to take some of the reviews with a pinch of salt. Some of the negatives (like breakfast) easily become positives with a positive frame of mind.

The staff in reception were rude and unhelpful except for the young signore who was on shift at night. The rooms are basic and I mean basic.

We had booked 4 nights at this hotel originally and had to change after one night. SERVICE When we arrived, the friendly hotel staff gave us a key on a one pound keychain for room 307 and gave us directions. The keychain was very dense. They also didn't even give us a city map, we had to ask for it. All the other hotels in Italy provided that and explained all the directions to the major sites clearly. ELEVATOR We were on the third floor so had to take our luggage in the little elevator slated for 2 people. You had to close the cage with a door that had a staplegun for a handle (well, it looked like it) THE ROOM The room was pretty spacious however that was as good as it got. The view from our window looked out into the back alley where there were dumpsters. The room did not come with any amenities for hot water for tea/coffee. We ignored that, as some places don't provide that anyways, and we understood it was 2 star. At one point we came back to the room and it smelled of cigarette smoke. Hopefully coming from outside but we weren't sure as it seemed to be locallized to our room. At night it was quiet but in the morning you could clearly hear the echo of people as the breakfast room was directly below us. WASHROOM The washroom was terrible. They gave us J-cloth towels to use but it was mostly thrown on the floor as the shower kept leaking the entire time. We had brought small ones from home to use instead just in case of this.. The sliding doors on the shower would not close properly and I think there was mildew on the bottom edge of the doors. Their shower head connected directly to the wall, so there was no snake tube thing to make it easy to direct the flow of water. The hot water took forever to come on and when it did, it was limited. WATER My fiance went downstairs to ask for a bottle of water (usually they have a vending machine or room service or something). Apparently the reception man just pulled out 2 bottles from his personal rucksack and we paid 2euro for them. They were the first warm bottles of water we've ever purchased in all of our Greece/Italy trip. BREAKFAST We decided to give this hotel one more chance and at least see what the breakfast was like in the morning. We went downstairs to the 2nd floor following the murmur sound of people. The \"buffet\" was one of condiments and cereal. They gave everyone each one chunk of bread and a wrapped sweetbread that smelled like chemicals when you opened it. The cereal was served with warm milk. That was our last straw. INTERNET This hotel does not have WIFI. They give you an old computer from the 90s that each guest has a limit of 1 free hour a day to use. We used our one hour that next morning to look up other hotels on trip advisor in this area. Finding no bookings available we decided to just walk around and see what the reception desks all say. RELOCATING I fully recommend during the off season like this month to come without hotel reservations. It was worth our while to walk around from hotel to hotel asking for prices. We finally settled on a good one called Astoria Garden, down the street and checked out before Stella could charge us for another night. They gave us a great room, great price with all amenities, and threw in WIFI and it was 3 star which happened to be less expensive than Stella's 2 star.

If it breaks down, you may have a hard time getting to your room. (2) If you are BIG and round, you may want to reconsider.

We found the staff at the reception desk very friendly, spoke English and very helpful with all the queries we had. There is a free computer with broadband available 24 hours at the lobby which was very useful to transfer photos and browse the net. Even though the check-in time is 13:30, when we arrived at the hotel at 11:00am, the room was ready and we were allowed to go straight into our room. Even if the room wasn't available there was an option to leave the luggage with the hotel. After checking out on the last day, we were allowed to leave the luggage with the hotel and that made the last day of the holiday more enjoyable as we didn't have to worry about dragging the luggage all the way to the Termini station. Termini station is just around the corner. So easy to get back to the hotel, especially when tired after a full morning of site seeing to have a rest before starting the evening schedule. There is a supermarket CONARD around the corner (at Piazza Independenza) which is less than a minute's walk from the hotel. There is a taxi stand at this place which is so convenient to get back to the airport with the luggage. Barberni, Spanish steps all within 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel (via XX Setembre).

The hotel is a basic 2 star hotel, with few refinements but doing the essential things well. First, on the less-good side, the entrance is just a door, the hotel reception is very small, and the rooms are basic. There are no public rooms except the breakfast room. Furniture brown, and my single room was quite small, doubles looked better. But it had the essentials, and if coming to visit Rome, who wants to spend time swinging cats in a hotel room....?? On the 'good' side, the rooms are very well cleaned, and all towels changed every day (these are the napkin type towels, not big and fluffy.. but they work very well!). No smell of smoke, excellent (small) shower, TV worked fine, no noise from outside, area seems quiet, and breakfast perfectly acceptable (2 breads, cereal, fruit juices, jams, cheese, decent coffee) in a pleasant room. The location is very convenient - a few minutes walk from Termini for trains coming from airport, close to a main bus interchange there, and also to 2 Metro stations . Travelling in Rome is very cheap -1Euro per journey by any mode and however long, so you can travel right across Rome by Metro for just 1 euro! The hotel staff were fine for us - helpful when needed - they had our bookings correct and helped order 2 minibuses to get us all back to the airport. There is a good little restaurant outside - turn right leaving the hotel and its on the opposite side about 150 metres away, very friendly, good food, and very good value. Also several more up to the left. We found eating out cost probably much the same as UK on balance (and food often better quality), but if you eat or drink in the main tourist spots then there you will PAY - eg. 8 Euros for a beer outside the Pantheon!! In such places, also look carefully at your bill to check it is correct. Overall, a very nice little hotel, with some character, and in a good location. If you want modern rooms with all the bits and pieces that you might find in a 4* on the Med, then look elsewhere. This is good value and we loved it. PS.

Reception said it was NOT broken but difficult to use, lots of people had difficulty with it. My suggestion that they get it fixed was met with a shrug. The coffee at breakfast is instant - incredible in Rome and you get a basket dumped on your table with one roll and one croissant. We asked to use the internet to check in for our flights and were asked to return in 10 minutes.

I decided to give the Stella a try for my 4-night mid-Nov. stay through a very good European hotel website. And, to even my surprise, I was 100% satisfied. True, the street in front of Termini is rather seedy with Gypsy panhandlers and the like, but once you walk a mere two blocks toward the hotel the area improves greatly --thus, no problem since I've easily been through much scarier areas in large American cities. This paled in comparison. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was met by a SEEMINGLY nice desk person (more on this strange dude, below) who I asked to assign me a room above the 2nd floor due to the allegedly \"loud\" bar on the ground level. He gladly gave me the key to a perfectly immaculate single room (queen size bed) on the 5th floor which was identical to the photos on the website. If anything, my room, 509, often was a little too warm, but the water pressure and hotness of the bathroom & shower water were fantastic. The linens were crispy and white, the bed sufficiently comfortable, floor perfectly vacuumed, and the only noises from the street were the constant motor scooters ubiquitous in Rome. Cleanliness, simplicity, and a funcional private bathroom are really all I require in foreign hotels, especially at a rate of only 50 euros. However, my stay at the Stella was slightly tarnished because of my experience during check out: I had a 6:30am flight and needed to check out by 4 am, which, for some reason, made the same \"nice\" desk guy (above) go absolutely ballistic. He huffed and puffed and rolled his eyes as he threw the ink pen at me and gruffingly growled \"that'll be 200 euros, and why do you check out this early and disturb our guests this morning?!\" I explained about my early flight, but informed him that it shouldn't matter anyway, because this was a part of his job. Upon my trying to sign the credit card receipt, the inkpen that was thrown at me wasn't working. I turned the receipt over and started scribbling to get the ink flowing. Boy, that REALLY sent him in a rage as he shouted, \"what are you doing!...what's wrong with you!!...this is an important document!...you make me wake up right now to play games...what's the matter with you?!\" After a few more \"kind\" words, I left with my credit card, the receipt, my luggage, and a casual giggle over how much of a basket case this guy really is.
