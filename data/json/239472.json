When we finally found Hotel Al Vagon from the instructions and directions that we were given, it was quite late at night (past midnight). I think we would have found the hotel quicker if we were in daylight, but after being dropped at the Rialtto Bridge it took a few wrong turnings before we finally found our way there. The hotel was open and someone was waiting for us to show us to our room, which was across the street and up two flights of stairs. The room was amazing. High ceilings, nice decor, large sash windows, comfy bed, spacious, large bathroom with shower cubicle. The only thing that the hotel did not have was a kettle to make drinks and as the hotel did not offer these, it would be advisable if you were staying here to mabye pack your own. As we visited during Winter, the hotel's restaurant along the canal was not open. However, we found a little cafe is a small Piazza opposite that we made full use of especially in the mornings for coffee and breakfast and a snack for mid morning. They did a lovely hot coffee and my favourite breakfast from there was pancakes with bananas and nuttella. The location was a good location, it was fairly central to most attractions in Venice, including the train station, Rialtto Bridge, St Marks Square, etc. I would definitely recommend this hotel as we found the owner to be very friendly and able to answer all our queries, assist us to find places etc.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, value for money, nice location\u201d", "Author": "Nishbarni", "ReviewID": "UR119856877", "Content": "Hi We stayed at Hotel Al Vagon in the Month of July for two days.

We arrived in Venice with the address and we had a little bit of difficulty to get there and had to stop to check online for a map. We thought we could walk but it is really worth taking the boat bus. When we arrived we were surprised by the quality of the room and the cleanliness. Plus, we had a room with a window to one of the canals which was awesome! Unfortunately we had a major discussion with the owner of the beat down dinner right by the hotel over a very stupid issue. The owner was EXTREMELY rude and wanted to kick us out and threatened us. When the owner of the hotel heard of this, he went over to talk to the owner of the restaurant and understand why he had been such an idiot and told us that the guy is the problem in the neighborhood. He was very kind to us and helped us resolve the issue.

Myself and my boyfriend were travelling with friends and had booked 1 night at the Hotel Al Vagon in Venice. We arrived at the hotel ready for our 2pm check- in. When we approached the reception of the hotel we were greeted by a very unfriendly man who proceded to tell us our booking had been cancelled due to a pre- authorised card error even though we were going to be paying by cash! He then said he had given our rooms away and that was how things worked in his hotel. As you can imagine I was extremally upset by this as we had been travelling for most of the day from Lake Garda and were looking forward to a relaxing afternoon in Venice. I asked the man why he had not contacted us about this error and he said it was not his problem. At this point I asked him if he had any other rooms and he said he had 1- the more expensive superior room which I thought was convenient! I asked about our friends- at this point he got very nasty and said he was unwilling to help us as I was rude and not a 'good' person. Whilst I was talking to the rude man another guest staying in the hotel passed a card to us saying to call them as it was details for a friendlier, cheaper hotel- the man said he would be 'having words with her later'! He seemed very aggressive and I didn't feel at all comfortable being in this situation. My boyfriend tried to calm the situation and the man said he could get a room for our friends in another hotel although we would need to sign and pay for this 100 euro room first. I said I wanted to see the other hotel first as we were away with our friends and it didn't seem right to be split up if we were going to be miles apart in different hotels. He told us to leave our cases whilst he showed us- we said we would prefer to keep them with us for safety. He snapped at us for thinking 'his' hotel was unsafe! We followed him to the other 'hotel' which was situated down an dirty back alley way, through a huge gate to a random door. I felt quite scared at this point as there were no other people around and we had no idea where he had led us. He rang the bell and at that point I thought this seemed odd as there was no hotel sign and the door wasn't free to open. We said that we were not willing to have this hotel. He shouted something in Italian at us and stormed off. All in all this was a nightmare start to our trip away.

On the last night, when we went to check out, the front desk man refused to give us the VAT receipt, stating that it was included in the price and could not be broken down. My mother then went on to ask to use the \"wheelchair\" lift to get up the 20+ stairs (there is no elevator) in which the man asked rudely why she waited until the last night to ask to use the machine. He also stated that he would have to look for the remote and he was not going to do that. Therefore, my mother, highly embarrassed, with her bad knees, had to walk up the stairs with no sympathy from the staff.

The window of our room looked on the yard but this was specially OK because because of the silence, (Room 30). Though the room and the bathroom was little they were very very clean. It was perfectly satisfying for the requirements of a tourist (having a bath and sleeping) after a long day of sight seing. We have received a very quick and precise answer on our enquiry E-mail before the trvelling. Everithing is very near to the Hotel, just some minutes of walk. The locality of the Hotel is EXCELLENT. Even the breakfast was OK for there were several nearby places where we could drink tasty fresh coffee (coffee with milk) with thousand kinds of bakery products.

I stayed there in November 2008 for 7 nights and then again in December for 2 additional nights. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is outstanding\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6on the main drag between the train station and Rialto, but at the same time it is very easy to get away from the crowds and explore a less traveled Venice (look for Santa Maria dei Miracoli). The hotel is just a couple minutes from the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Ora vaporetto stop, and the traghetto stop to San Polo and the Rialto Fish Market is even closer. Love the traghetti \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are cheap, convenient, and you get the experience of being on a gondola in the water for a few precious minutes. While getting lost in Venice is both rewarding and completely frustrating, those yellow signs leading to Rialto and/or the train station make it much easier to find your way back to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I found this very helpful. My first stay at Hotel Al Vagon was in a smaller room with two single beds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c basic and cozy but perfectly fine, especially for the great price (off season and a 5% cash discount). The room was clean, the shower was always hot, and happily, there was very good water pressure. The room might be a bit small for two people, but there was a full size wardrobe and a desk which kept things organized. I kept the window cracked open to hear the Santi Apostoli church bells, but overnight watch out for the mosquitoes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in the winter one sneaky little guy found his way in and had a nice meal at my expense \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it was worth it. For my second stay I was joined by my sister; we booked a double room with a canal view. We were upgraded to a superior double in the annex around the corner and the room was great! The high ceilings and the huge windows with a view over the canal made us very, very happy! The room was clean, pretty, and quite comfortable for two people and a little dog. And again, the shower was always hot with very good water pressure. We were given keys to the room and the outside door, so it actually felt more like being in an apartment than a hotel, something we both appreciated. Note there was no elevator and steep stairs to the room (just one flight up) but there was a fixed chair lift if one needed it. The weather was cold during both of my stays, but I was impressed that the hotel was nicely (and not overly) heated. Al Vagon doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer a breakfast, but no worries, there are many caffes and bakeries (try El Forner de Canton on the Strada Nova) all around the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have your breakfast like a local for a couple of euro and try something new each day. The owner of the hotel, and his staff, were wonderful! I always felt comfortable, safe, and welcomed, especially as a single female traveler. I travel independently and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much hand holding in regards to sites and food, but things do come up. For instance, when I asked to leave a small bag at the hotel (for three weeks) until my next stay, the owner, Maurizio, immediately accommodated the request. And, for my second stay, we arrived at the beginning of an Aqua Alta, with another scheduled for the next morning. Maurizio had rain boots ready for us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and we definitely needed them! My boots were lime green with hot pink trim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c silly, but I loved them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough so that when I asked Maurizio if I could take them home, he said yes! They were one of the best things I brought home with me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a true reminder of Venice!

We were supposed to stay here 3 nights, but walked out after 2. Here's what happened - We reached the hotel following the directions from the hotel website - which was accurate. Got our standard room with canal view (not that great) which was in the main building. The room was probably the worst one we've stayed in so far. It had a weird smell and seemed really old, dirty and sub-standard. Anyway, we checked in at around 9 pm - freshened up, got a map of Venice and headed out. The location of the hotel is good - just 3-4 mins to Rialto bridge. We dined at one of the fancy restaurants by the bridge, since it was both our birthdays. Anyhow, we got back around 10:30 pm and were told that we would need to move to another rooom the next day due to some \"maintenance\" work. We had an early morning tour booking and said we wouldn't be there to move our stuff, etc. The guy told us to pack our stuff and keep it ready and they would move it for us. Anyhow, the next day we got up real early, got ready, packed and left at 8. We got back at 2 pm, and were greeted by a lady at the front desk who had no clue what room we were supposed to be in. After explaining for a few mins (handactions mainly, since she didn't understand English) - she took was to our room - which was a Double Superior in another building. This room was great and much better than the one we had previously. We stopped by the room for sometime, and then headed off to St. Marks again. Got back later that night, and the same front desk guy from the previous night told us that we could settle the bill tomorrow after 9 am(though we still had 2 more nights to go) since no one would be available at the hotel front desk - weird. This guy seemed odd, creepy and made us feel really uncomfortable. Well, we decided to settle the bill with him that night since we had an early morning tour again the next day. We went to the front desk at 10 pm - paid him for 3 nights, took our bill, thanked him for the new room and left for dinner. We got back to our room at 11 pm. For some strange reason, the same guy at the front desk called our room 3-4 times AFTER 11:30 pm. We were half asleep and didn't realise what was going on. Finally, my husband picked up the phone at 11:30 pm (since he called 4 times non-stop, and we probably thought it was an emergency - READ: Immediate evacuations?!!) He starts by telling my husband that we wanted to talk to us - so could he come to our room???? Can you even imagine that? We have stayed at 100+ hotels so far, and never has anyone from the front desk bothered us this late with a request to drop by our room at midnight! My husband was rightfully pissed off, and asked him why the hell was he is disturbing us at midnight! The guy then started mumbling, that he wanted to give us a 5% discount. Can you believe that? My husband got really angry and just hung up. He then called again - and went on to say - that he wanted to give us a discount since we belonged to the same country (India) and that I had apparently asked him about his wife and kids (I don't remember doing that - since I'm not a social, talk to strangers type of person!) My husband was stumped and went on to say that obviously, since we could afford a trip to Italy, a discount of 10 Euros being offered at midnight, would make no difference to our finances. Anyway, whatever this guy mumbled, didn't seem true at all - and totally messed us up. I am not sure what his motives were, but we felt extremely unsafe. My husband asked to be checked out and refunded for the 3rd night, but this guy went on to say that he was \"leaving\" for the night, and that we need to talk to the owner (Marcus?). This was absurd and another lie, since he didn't really go home. We stayed up all night, packed and waited for dawn. We left first thing in the morning at 7 am. We walked to the front desk - and as expected he was there. Without uttering a single word, all he did was return our money for the 3rd night, gave us a new bill - that's it. My guess is that he didn't want us to talk to his owner about this, and that's why refunded our 3rd night so quickly. We had thought of coming back and talking to the owner later that day - telling him about how his staff had treated us, the incovenience and disturbance caused the previous night, but were in no mood to come anywhere close to this hotel and ruin our mood again.

The view was just as good. Both rooms have air con and very good sound proofing. Both rooms had ensuite which was clean and functional if not inspired - I think larger shower cubicles would be a good idea - I mean Venice is a Romantic place - it was slightly annoying for 2 of us to try and squash in a small shower cubicle. Also power showers would be good. This did not spoil it though.

The hotel was not a traditional one - it was more like renting a room - we then had keys to a seperate entrance located next to the Al Vagon restaurant so it felt like you were almost living there - I liked that a great deal, but I guess some people might want a traditional style hotel with porters, lifts, etc... All in all I thought this place was great value - it's smack bang in the middle of Venice and the best room was \u00c2\u00a380. The smaller room was great and at \u00c2\u00a355 for central venice I thought it was great. The staff were friendly and helpful and responded quickly to my email enquiries. I would definitly stay here again - I wandered most of Venice and the location is definitly one of if not the best. We walked around nearly the whole of central Venice and did all of that by foot so the hotel is very central wherever you wish to go.

The bathroom was very nice, or at least I didnt notice any problems, maybe the shower was a bit small, but thats true of most of the hotels I stayed in on our trip and wasnt really an issue. We had a very nice canal view and noise wasnt a problem, which is saying something as I am a very light sleeper. I would have liked to be better informed that there wouldnt be any air conditioning in our room, but it came with a fan and we were provided with a second one as well when we asked. That worked pretty well for me. If I had any issues it may have been with the bed, which wasnt excellent as it seems to have been a bit old, but as I said, Im a very light sleeper and I slept reasonably well, so it didnt really affect my view of the hotel. Our room wasnt much like those pictured on the site, then again we had a standard 3 person room, and the pictures seem to be of a superior rate room.

Happily the directions on the hotel website were quite accurate even in the dark of the night and with fog-reduced visibility. We found the hotel entrance in the small square and the porter quickly let us in and showed us to our room, which was in another building around the corner. Needless to say, we saw little that night. Next morning, when we opened the shutters, we had a wonderful view of the canal with a nice bridge and gondolas passing by (I had requested a canal view at time of booking). The room itself was fine (Double Standard with Canal View), the furniture quaint, the bathroom modern and spacious. No complaints. The location is excellent, maybe 5-10 to minutes walk to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, less to Rialto. Everywhere is accessable on foot along small narrow streets and if you wish to see further afield, the waterbuses go to places such as Murano (glass-making island).

We were departing from Treviso, so again it was quite easy to get a waterbus from the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oro stop to Piazzale Roma. (Note you must buy the bus ticket from the ticket office, they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell them from the bus at that time).

Located just a five minute walk north of the Rialto Bridge, the Al Vagon is in a great location for exploring the city. My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon in mid October 2007. We booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd double room with a private bath and a canal view. When we arrived, the owner was efficient but friendly and showed us to our room located in the annex, which is in the same building but around back from the reception desk and above the canal-side Al Vagon restaurant. All of the rooms in the annex are on the second floor, which does require you to climb a set of steep stairs. There was an elevator chair available for those with disabilities. We were in room #4, which was decent-sized with high ceilings, tiled floor, and two tall windows overlooking a canal. The walls had a number of scratches and dings from luggage, but those were purely aesthetic blemishes. The double bed was, in typical European fashion, really just two twin beds pushed together with a queen-size headboard. The bed was a bit hard, which was fine for me because of some back problems I had been having, but for my wife was a little rough. Still, it was comfortable enough that we both slept fine. The room had a small TV with several international stations (including CNN) and a safe. The view of the canal was nice, but because of the thick walls of the building, did require one to lean out of the window a bit to get a good view. There was air conditioning and an in-room thermostat, but as we came in October, it was not available and certainly not needed. However, it was chilly at night, and the heating also was not yet available due to government regulations. The en suite bathroom included toilet, sink, shower, and hair dryer, but the bidet had been removed (not that we missed it.) The shower was not enclosed\u00e2\u20ac\u201drather, it was simply a low spot in the floor with a drain and shower head, which meant that after using it, the entire bathroom was quite wet. However, the water pressure was good and hot water primed quickly. The hair dryer, according to my wife, was awkword and mostly ineffective. The room was very clean when we arrived and was cleaned daily. At night, it was mostly quiet, but being above the canal meant some noise from the occasional passing motorboat. Also, being over the restaurant meant some crowd noise until about 10:30 each night. But overall, with the windows closed, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too terribly noisy and as we are heavy sleepers, it certainly did not disturb our sleep, but a light sleeper may have some difficulty. The most noise actually came from the neighboring room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water pipes. The hotel does not serve breakfast, but we enjoyed finding breakfast at the little bakery/coffee shops on our way to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sightseeing.

We booked a superior room and it was lovely, clean and central,the only issue was no breakfast. You can get that no problem locally. The restaurant Al Vagon wasn't a great experience but maybe its better in the summer with more atmo. The place is cheap and pretty with a great central location(we were alone on Rialto Bridge next to it in the eerie Venitian fog our first night).It felt totally safe. Go to Venice in December, it was gorgeous in low season. By the way, we are married seventeen years, so did have realistic expectations! The Al Vagon is value for money and a handy spot.", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "infolondon", "ReviewID": "UR7300510", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location (once I found it), within easy walking distance of Rialto Bridge and St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square. Many eating places are nearby and the hotel overlooks a small canal on one side. I rung and managed to obtain a standard room with a canal view. The room was quite small, with en-suite toilet and shower, but was perfectly adequate for our needs. The shower was quite powerful, which was certainly a plus. The view from our room of the canal is slightly restricted due to the window blinds / doors, and how they opened, but it was still a good view, and worth the money we paid. The man at the hotel speaks good English, whereas another lady at reception didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. But both were friendly and helpful. I have no complaints in regards to cleanliness. One problem I did have is that it can be pretty noisy. On the first evening we were kept awake by a nearby bar playing music (A Friday evening), but the same noise didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occur on the Saturday or Sunday night of our stay. Also due to its location, it is just generally noisy outside, so light sleepers be aware.
