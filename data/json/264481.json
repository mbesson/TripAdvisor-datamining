Breakfast was cold but edible if a little limited selection (although more than you get on the Continent!) While I would not stay there with Wife/Family for a leisure break it is OK if you just want somewhere to catch a couple of hours sleep while passing through London (on the way to Paris from St Pancras) of if you have an early morning meeting and dont want to pay the high train fare to get you into London before 10am.

Location good and generally the experience is ok for a hotel on a budget. The staff were friendly and helpful at the reception desk and we were told where our room was - on the top floor. The corridors are tiny as are the staircases. There is no lift. The room was tiny with two small single beds. However, for a place to put your head down it was clean and basic. The shower has low pressure and be very careful about the water as it is easily scalding hot. The TV was old but it worked. For somewhere to rest my head it was adequate and not as bad as some of the reviews I had read. Pictures on their information leaflets do not match all of the rooms. I am sure that one or two have been done up - but not ours! The main problem is at breakfast. There were some staff (not enough) and nobody seemed to have a specific job. You help yourself to the tables (not a good idea when it is busy) and find that those from cultures that are not used to queing will simply push you out of the way if you are not careful. It took ages to find someone to clear the table from the previous guest. The food was adequate but no great choice. The sausage was a sausage in appearance but not when you eat it. The rest of the food tasted fine but it is bacon, egg, sausage, beans, tomatoes, toast, museli and that is it. The orange juice is very watered down. At one point they ran out of plates, and then cutlery. When asked they did wash some - but only knives and forks for four people (and I took two sets). Generally the breakfast was ok but the process of getting breakfast was not the greatest. They need to be organised. Someone needs to manage the dining area making sure that guests are looked after. The dark haired waitress needs to realise that a place like this needs a little speed - she glided across the floor as if there was nothing important to do. I have never seen anyone clear a table so slowly! To summarise - if you want a no frill (and I mean no frills) place to rest your head in the centre of London this place is ideal. There is no room to swing a cat but it is extremely clean and the staff are friendly. If you want a little comfort then this is not the place for you.

We (two grandparents, two parents plus one four-month-old baby) had a weekend in London for a nephew's wedding, and stayed two nights, having chosen this place because of its proximity to St Pancras where we arrived by train, and also to the wedding reception venue just round the corner at the Canal Museum. We paid \u00c2\u00a385 per night for each twin room, and ended up with two on the ground floor just along the corridor, one with a comfy large cot and a bit more space, both on the back so quite quiet, narrow but perfectly OK beds, all quite clean, a bath as well as a shower, a bit hot when we arrived as the sun was shining right in, but overnight with the window open at the bottom we all slept fine. We hope the baby didn't disturb others, but most of the time she behaved beautifully. The lovely Roumanian receptionist who was on duty all weekend couldn't do enough to help us, and remembered us from when we first entered the hotel. The breakfast room in the basement is rather noisy because of the stone floors and scraping chairs and people's voices getting louder and louder with the echo, so breakfast isn't a quiet affair if the hotel is busy. As other people have said, it's mostly a substantial basic hot breakfast plus some cereal and toast. The staff down there were prompt to serve tea and coffee. There is a high chair but our baby isn't quite big enough for this. However we managed fine between us. They were fitting new carpets in the corridors while we were there, so perhaps it's undergoing a general makeover and will look a bit less scruffy in time.

The rooms are very small. I stayed in room 202 with two other friends. It was one single bed and one double bed. The double bed had a double-quilt. This is not OK when you stay with friends. We requested an extra quilt and got it the next day. We had a hard time sleeping becuase there was not enough oxygen flow in the room. Even when we opened the window as much as we could, we felt a bit sufficated. The reson was a large ventilation \"chimney\" outside our window. In the morning, the smell of fried food came in to our room. The bathroom was a plus. It was freshly renewed. The ventilator in the bathroom was noisy and didn't have much effect. Therefore, there were a bit of fungus in the ceiling above the shower/bathtub. The first couple of days there was no bars of soap in the bathroom, but we got one two days before we left. There was soap in the shower, but that was hard to reach when you stood outside the shower. The room could need a coat of paint. It was cleaned almost every day, and we got new towles. The bathroom (and the room) lacked a place to hang our towels, so we ended up handing it up over our bathroom \"door\" and over the double closet. The English breakfast was OK. The staff was mostly friendly. When we asked for a cab, the receptionist called a minicab who couldn't find the way to where we were going. It was more expencive than the night tax of the London Cab, too. We got free wireless internet access when we asked for it, which was a huge plus! In the \"lobby\" og lounge room, there was also a comuter. \u00c2\u00a31 for 20 minutes.The Internet was a bit \"on-again, off-again, but that was OK). The hotel had a small backyard with some chairs and tables. I cannot remember how many floors the hotel had (3 or 4, I believe), but there was no elevator. This was impractical when we came and left with a lot of luggage. Because we were on a school trip, we needed inexpensive rooms. Hotel California is quite inexpensive, and a totally OK hotel. Some of our fellow students had ants in their room, and some had strange bathroom solutions (they had to go inside their closet and down a staircase to get to their tiny bathroom). There was also found larvas in a towel (but that could be a coinsidence). One teacher had a single-room, and she was freezing all four nights. If you are only going to sleep in your hotel and you want to live quite central for little oney, I will recomend Hotel California (mostly because it is so close to the King's Cross subway).

The way they represent themselves as a hidden treasure at Kings Cross is not quite accurate. I am president of Christin Fellowship Churches Inc. and we went there with the intention of finding a place to send ten ministry couples every six months for sabbaticals. I even told the manager this and what they gave us was the best they can do? I think the basic that should be expected isn't new but clean rooms, sheets, and hot showers. I know London is an expensive city and rooms are small but as a person that travels two weeks of the month for the corporation in this capacity I can say with some experience this is a one star hotel with a three star breakfast. This is the truth and I warn travelers. Yes you get what you pay for but this is not what we thought we were paying for or represented as. This is not a place for reconnection and intimacy between couples. I didn't expect an five, four or three star hotel but clean and hot water isn't too much to ask. I was just going to let it go but it wouldn't be right. I think the management should contact me and make some kind of amends for other travelers and restitution. This is not a Mom and Pop business. This is owned by the Moreno four star hotel just around the corner. These are professionals and we should be able to expect more from them. I don't mean to be harsh I just think there should be a change.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cDon't bother\u201d", "Author": "mia_and_pup", "ReviewID": "UR25863977", "Content": "Booked a long weekend here with my partner after having being well looked after on numerous occasions at the California's sister hotel, the Montana Excel. What a disappointment! The rooms were basic with an en-suite, as expected. However, our rooms were not cleaned at all during our stay other than the bed linen being subtly re-arranged and the shower head was appallingly filthy. Refreshment sundries were not replenished and the lack of a bath mat meant there were quite a few close calls getting out of the shower. The temperamental heating, poor TV reception, non-functioning clock radio and the staff's disbelief at us asking for an ironing board (which never materialised) only further added to our irritation. Breakfast fayre was standard but in three days we were only asked if we wanted drinks on one occasion- the rest of the time we had to attempt to find a member of staff, which was no mean feat. To top it off the staff were either rude or mute at best, we were charged an extra 15GBP on top of the price quoted at booking which they would not back down on and we didn't even get a thank you or goodbye at any point during our stay! So, to sum up: over-priced, scabby rooms in a tired hotel that's seen better days and where the staff do not appear to understand the concept of good customer service. The only good thing about the place is the proximity to the Tube stop.

I had a single room and I was travelling with 3 friends, one of them had a single room and the other 2 had a double. Location - Excellent, it is directly across the road from Kings Cross tube station. There are cash machines, a post office, various shops and eateries round about the area. Staff - Were fairly friendly, I didn't interact with them all that much aside from checking in and out and handing in my key and getting it back when we were going out for the day. They weren't chatty or anything, just done their jobs really. Foyer/Lobby area - Very clean and nice appearance. There is a computer terminal with internet access but it was out of order during our entire stay. It is possible to get coffee here and they also have a little back garden area. There is also a stand with lots of leaflets for London attractions, check them out because some have discounts on them which is handy. Getting to the room - this involved climbing up stairs in fairly narrow staircases. This was no problem to me but if stairs are a problem to you I'd see about asking for a room on the lower down floors. My room - My room was utterly tiny but it wasn't like I was planning on spending a great deal of time there so that was no big deal..The width of the room fit a single bed pushed against a wall with about a 2 foot space from the side of the bed to the other wall. The length of the room was from the top of the single bed to the bottom with about another 2 foot gap at the bottom. The 2 foot gap at the bottom had a built in wardrobe/dresser/mirror where there was space for a suitcase, clothes to hang, plenty of hangers, tea and coffee making facilities, a tv and a safe. There were no instructions for use of the safe but I went down to ask and they showed me how to do it. The side of the room that the bed was pushed against there was a radiator and a window which could be opened easily. Next to the bed there was a little shelf which held an alarm clock that had seen better days and a lamp. My room was located at the front of the hotel and whilst this is the side nearest to the main road I can't say the noise of traffic bothered me in the slightest. The bathroom - The bathroom was pretty small but adequate. It has a small bath with a shower, a toilet and a sink. There was extra toilet paper, 2 little bars of soap and one towel. The towel was the size of a hand towel so if you prefer a bigger towel either check if they can provide this or bring your own. Water pressure for the shower was fine and the temperature was good unlike some hotels I've been in. Cleanliness - General cleanliness of the room seemed ok, the bathroom was clean apart from the bottom door frame where it looked like coffee had splashed on there at some point. The room carpet looked like it could maybe do with a clean. The curtains smelled a bit foosty and the window was in dire need of a wash. Otherwise the sheets of the bed appeared to be clean and the surfaces were dust free. Friends single room - he was on the 4th floor above my room and he said his room was ok, his was a little bit larger than mine but his shower room wasn't so great. His shower consisted of walking into a small toilet cubicle with a shower head sticking out of the ceiling meaning everything in the toilet gets soaked. It was a pretty small cramped space too. Although we were aware that this could be the case from reading previous reviews on here. Friends double room - they say it was small, clean and basic. They were kept awake by some guests who were making noise out the back of the hotel in the early hours of the morning but that was the guests and isn't the hotels fault. In their bathroom the toilet handle fell off but they told the people in reception and it was fixed when we got back later that day and worked better than it had before. Breakfast - My friends went for breakfast but I didn't go near it as I don't like full english breakfasts but my two friends went and I was told it was very greasy but adequate. I'm told breakfast consisted of cereal, toast, sausages, bacon, eggs, tomatos, tea and coffee. Price - for a single room I was told \u00c2\u00a350 a night via email and that is how much it cost. However, it does say on the website that a room with a single bed is \u00c2\u00a345 and it's one with a double bed that is \u00c2\u00a350 so they've got a bit of a web discrepancy going on there. The prices displayed in the hotel match with the \u00c2\u00a350 a night price though. The double room was \u00c2\u00a370 per night. What isn't included - shampoo, hairdryer (but you can borrow one from the desk), telephone, instructions for the safe (but you can go ask how to use it). What would make it better - the rooms are painted in a nice yellow colour but the curtains, bedspread and carpet are patterned and a bit dowdy looking. It was also terribly hot in my room even with the window open a little fan or some kind of air conditioning would be good. A breakfast with lots of fresh fruit. Overall impression - I think this hotel made a good base for exploring London and for the money you can't really go wrong. The location was very good, we didn't explore the area very much but it's great for the tube. Yes the rooms were small but if all you need it for is a place to sleep and get washed then it's fine. It makes a good base and I would go back to the hotel.", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cvery basic and good value for money!!\u201d", "Author": "Connie18", "ReviewID": "UR7960836", "Content": "Just got back from a wonderful four day break from London and i have to say i was a bit wary before we went after reading some of the earlier reviews about this hotel, my worries were unfounded as the staff at this hotel were very freindly, the room was very clean and basic, not the ritz i must add but if its only a base you need while your out everyday then this is the place to stay, with the underground just around the corner you cant go wrong, oh and the breakfast was very nice as well.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bari", "Title": "\u201cNice surprise\u201d", "Author": "ItalianBari", "ReviewID": "UR7715834", "Content": "I spent five day on this hotel and considering the London standards and the relatively low rate they asked me I was very worried about it but it turned out to be a nice surprise. The room was very small and so was the ensuite facility but everything was clean and the room was serviced every day. Breakfast was in a nice room painted in pastel colours and there was plenty of food each morning. The staff was very polite and helpful. In addition the hotel is just a few steps away one of the King's Cross station entrances from which you can go everywhere you like in London. So if you are looking for a cheap but nice accommodation in a strategic location and you are not the Ritz type I definitively recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cworst hotel\u201d", "Author": "grannymo", "ReviewID": "UR7416174", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel recently, the worst in my world travels, first - the room was not serviced, I mean the beds were not dressed, the towels were not changed or the bin emptied. There were no handtowels,or bath mat, no shampoo, soaps that had been used by others, and a safe that did not work, but worst of all no telephone, so I had to go all the way down the stairs to complain. There was no manager present. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I must say that the staff at breakfast were really nice and friendly, and the breakfast was adequate for me but no choice.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridgeshire", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than I imagined!\u201d", "Author": "Jase_Cambs", "ReviewID": "UR7394796", "Content": "I stayed here for 5 nights while on a course in London. The hotel was booked by my company and I wasn't expecting much as: 1. They are a bit stingy 2. The hotel is in Kings Cross The hotel is about 200m from the train station, i'll let you decide if thats a good thing, but apparently KX is on the way up, and is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I was pleasantly surprised to be honest, the outside of the hotel is well presented and the front desk staff were very helpful. I was in a twin with a double bed and a single bed, a decent sized bathroom with a bath and shower over. The room was cleaned every morning and the towels replaced. There was a safe in the room along with a wardrobe. There is free wifi which was a life saver! One thing to note is that other than soap there was no shampoo or shower gel etc (I travel prepared so was ok) From what I can work out the rooms are all being done up as there were some matresses and bed frames around. My room is one to still be done, it looked a bit tired, but was clean, which was the main thing! The lounge was nice, tastefully decorated, leading out to a well kept terrace area and there is a pc there for those without laptops. Breakfast is between 7-9 and is buffet style with mountains of toast, bacon, sausages as well as poached eggs, beans and tomatoes. There was some cerial as well and juice, tea and coffee. The room where breakfast is served is really nice and bright and with plenty of room. Overall I was pretty impressed with my stop here, it would have been nice to be in one of the newer rooms, but I imagine in a year or so once everything is finished it will be a really good hotel. The owner is really trying to make an effort with the hotel, and being in Kings Cross there is every type of food available close by.", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel California", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d264481-Reviews-Hotel_California-London_England.html", "Price": "$111 - $159*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4-8 Belgrove Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kings Cross</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WC1H 8AB</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "264481", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bc/56/bc567ea007693c4fa3e4087eafc64c985large.jpg"}}
