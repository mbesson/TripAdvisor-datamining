Istiklal Caddesi, which is a shopping, only walking with a tram, street with a lot of restaurants and bars/clubs is just around the corner. Location 4/10: This hotel is a bit of, if you want to be able to walk to anything that is worth seeing in Istanbul. Yes, taxis are quite cheap, but its also nice be able to sometimes just walk around a hotel, to get to know the neighbourhood and the local atmosphere. Istiklal Caddesi is just behind the hotel and it starts there and then you can walk your way up to Taxim Square. From there, you can take the train or a taxi. There is also a small tram to take along Istiklal, which is not that long. It takes approsimately 15 min up to Taxim. There were never any difficulties to find a taxi outside the hotel, nor for the taxi drivers to find this hotel neither. Just opposite is a very famous hotel from Agatha Chrisite and where she lived for a short while \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Pera Palas. There are also two famous restaurants just around the corner that Swedish/Turkish chef; Memet G\u00c3\u00bcrs owns, and they are among the top rated restaurants in Istanbul. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the names, but ask in the lobby. Lobby/Check-in 7/10: Big lobby area with a long disk. Kind service and they spoke very good English, no problems what so ever. Not a lot of places to take a seat while you waited, but nothing major to complain about, just standard. Room 4/10: I have stayed here a few times, but this time was a bit of a disappointment and I could notice that the hotel had aged and that quality of the furniture is that that good. Had a view of house and the pool on the roof, which it did not look that they use that much and it could be nice to lay and sunbath there. The carpet was torn a bit in places with stains. It was cold in the room, which I commented on and they tried to fix it, but could not properly, but we did not bother to complain, it was just for a short time. The cleanliness was not the best, with hair left from either poor cleaning or from the maid. A very small TV, old style. Overall, not very good, but for the money; ok. Restaurants 6/10: Only had the breakfast buf\u00c3\u00a9, which is very good. There are anything and everything you would want for breakfast, cold as hot, vegetables and fruits, and there were some Turkish specialties as well. The best part of the hotel.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "BeaStockholm", "ReviewID": "UR19589502", "Content": "I stayed during a long visit in this hotel. It is a modern, fresh and clean hotel. The room and bathroom were wonderful and felt luxurious. There was a bath robe placed on the bed, and slippers in the wardrobe. There was also television, AC and refrigerator in the room. However if you took something from the mini-bar you had to pay extra (not free of charge), and chocolates and other things had a remarkable high price. An electric water boiler made it possible to make tea or coffee in the room (of free use). The bed in the room was very comfortable and soft. Rooms were of different kinds, either king size bed, two beds next to eachother, or two beds in a \"straight\" line. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. The breakfast room was large, and a number of foods to choose from: warm and cold dishes, fruits, several kinds of breads, yoghurt, salads and vegetables, cheeses, jams... The staff generally speaks good English and behaved correctly, although I experienced a slight tone of negligence both in the reception/front desk and by the waiters in the breakfast room. However I will definately stay in this hotel again, my overall experience was excellent. Also the hotel is very close to Istiklal.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mow", "Title": "\u201cLittle things make the stay more pleasant\u201d", "Author": "ayut", "ReviewID": "UR13904214", "Content": "I believe that little things distinguish a good hotel from a fine one... A smile from the staff, an occasional question about your stay, a human touch are those little things... Well, Yenisehir didn't score well there... Room ambience is average... Lobby area is a okay, but i think it could've been organized better, since reception desk occupies too much space... Insulation is not sufficient... It's pretty noisy if your room faces the road... On the bright side, location is perfect, you get to enjoy strolling around istiklal cad., take a tramway and you are standing in front of Hagia Sophia and Blue mosque... Wherever you stay I am sure you will enjoy Istanbul...
