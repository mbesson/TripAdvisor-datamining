Tricky to find as its in a little alleyway, but it is a lovely hotel for a 2-3 star. The staff were very helpful, and we had been upgraded to a room with a Jacuzzi bath. The room was decorated in a traditional Florentine style - very charming and was lovely and clean and though the bathroom was tiny - it did have the jacuzzi!The rest of the hotel is nice - a lovely light breakfast room and drawing room and a fab rooftop garden with great views.Location fantastic as you are next to the Ponte Vecchio, 2mins walk to the Uffizi and 5 mins to the Duomo.The only downside would be for drivers - the garage came to collect our car and dropped it off again for us, but it costs a lot of money - it was about \u9227?0 for 2 nights parking!

Overall, the hotel was charming and reasonably priced. It's strongest suit is indeed its location -- a half a block from the Ponte Vecchio and another half block from the Ufitzi. The Duomo is a five minute walk away. The Hermitage's staff was also quite friendly, offering to make us reservations and other assistance at any time. The breakfast isn't bad (standard continental) and the roof-top terrace is a lovely bonus.A couple of complaints. When we first checked in, we were taken to a 4th floor room in which the prior guests had clearly been smoking. The lingering acrid scent of the smoke was unmistakable from the first moment we opened the door. The front desk said that the prior guests shouldn't have been smoking in the room, but it's unclear how the staff could have overlooked the odor. (Notably, there was a wall partially, but significantly, obstructing the view from the 4th floor room to the river.)Appropriately, though, the hotel offered us two alternatives -- an interior room on a high floor (without a river view) or a first floor room with a river view, adjacent to the street traffic. We opted for the first-floor room. It wasn't bad, albeit a big run down. The bathroom was clean and functional. The noise from the street was bearable, and the view (not obstructed) was fantastic.Our more serious complaint was that the bed in the room was not a true double bed. Two singles had been pushed together, leaving a noticdable and uncomfortable gap. We are generally heavy sleepers, but after the first night, we placed the extra blankets in the room under the sheets to bridge the gap a little more. It made the bed bearable, but plainly it was not comparable to a proper double bed.Would we return? Probably, but we would insist on a true double bed and a room with an unobstructed view of the river.

Small hotel, which we prefer.Location is superb -- steps from the action, but with a delightful rooftop garden for breakfast and drinks. Feels homey (although a few too many Americans) and great to dive into for rests when on the gallop.Staff attentive and helpful.Only snag was AC went out in one room for two days! but they offered a room change and did fix it.We travel a LOT and recommend this small, mid-range hotel.", "Date": "May 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR319257194", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Well, I don't know       Additional views from window", "Date": "Mar 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR365605032", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "i hate to give out my secret great little hotel--unbelievable location--very nice and clean in the italian style--real pleasure--eager to return", "Date": "Feb 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR201901864", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Can't Wait to Go Back! We ended up at the Hermitage after a mix up at another hotel left us without a room for the night. We liked the hotel so much that we extended our stay an additional two nights. Admittedly the room was small, even by European standards, but it was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern and spacious. The public rooms, i.e., the breakfast room, rooftop garden and lounge were cozy and beautifully decorated. The staff were the nicest and most helpful I have encountered in my many travels.Despite what other reviewers have said, we loved the location. The Ponte Vecchio is so beautiful and located near restaurants, museums and shopping. We weren't bothered by noise at all. In fact my favorite memory is falling asleep at night with the window open being serenaded by a flutist who was playing hauntingly beautiful music on the bridge. In the morning we woke up to the sound of churchbells ringing.

We found this hotel to be a hidden gem, with friendly staff, in an amazing location, at a great value. In addition, we visited Florence during an amazing heat wave, and the Hotel Hermitage is Air Conditioned. Much of Florence is not! It was so hot during our stay that we would return to our room every afternoon to cool off before venturing out into the heat again. The breakfast up on the terrace was charming, with beautiful views. My only suggestion would be for staff to work on discouraging the flock of birds who tend to swoop down on tables. The building itself is very old, but so is Florence, and that is half the reason to visit. We found the room to be simple but full of old world charm, and the bathroom was actually quite large and very modern.

The staff was very helpful and they do offer a breakfast (you pay about $10 a person extra for it, like most everything in Europe) that looked good, though we opted to find a street cafe instead. They also have a beautiful rooftop garden that was flowering and green, even in December. A wonderful find and not too pricey for Florence.
