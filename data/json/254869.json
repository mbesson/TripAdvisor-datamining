My room was quite spacious, bed comfortable with a good bathroom. The hotel was clean throughout, breakfast was a good quality and a glass of wine at the bar was reasonably priced. Ok the public areas are not extensive or luxurious, reception is not huge (I wouldn't like to be checking in or out if busy) and the presence of a security guard rather than a concierge could either be reassuring or vaguely unsettling depending on your point of view. Location in a mixed business and residential district is handy for many of the offices in the vicinity and within a 10 minute walk of two metro stations. The residential streets and Poblenou area are charming with a local feel and its about a kilometer to the beach. This is not the tourist end of town (a good thing IMHO) but the gothic old town is only a few metro stops away.

There was one guy working the front desk. It took about 25 minutes to check in; slightly irritating when you've been flying all night and you'd like to sleep. My rate included breakfast. The breakfast buffet was decent--probably worth 10-15 Euros. The buffet doesn't start until 7AM, which is a little late to be a business hotel. Platinum status with Starwood earned free internet and no different room than any of my non-platinum co-workers. You get \"upgraded\" to a higher floor but the rooms were identical. I will admit, the internet was fast. I think the hotel has 15 rooms on each floor. 11 floors total. The hotel hadn't \"turned their air conditioner on yet\" so I was only able to open a window. If you turn your AC on, a fan only blows--opening a window then turns your AC off. I think it's ridiculous that a hotel doesn't allow guests to use a functioning air conditioner in April. Contsruction lasted for probably four hours through the morning. Staff told us they were working on the top floor or roof. Sounded like a drill bit on brick. The room itself was basic but very clean. Normal layout where you enter the room with the bathroom near the entrance. The queen sized bed was very comfortable--moreso than many European hotels. The area around hotel has very cheap food and drink options. The closer you get to \"los ramblas\" (the tourist area where all the action is) prices go up. A coffee and a croissant around the hotel was only 2-3 Euros. Four Points is nowhere near los ramblas--probably a 40 minute walk. There's a beautiful W on the water. I may try that next time. All said and done the Four Points isn't that bad. I'll give it 3 out of 5 stars--even though the construction and lack of a cool AC kept me awake.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConnor and Blenks Vacation Get Away\u201d", "Author": "Joanne C", "ReviewID": "UR127245849", "Content": "Hotel was immaculate, rooms spacious, bathroom trendy, clean and way above adequate, location very good.

When we checked in we were told by the person at the reception desk that Barcelona would be quiet before on New Year\u2019s Eve, things shut down by afternoon and that we should be prepared etc. We were quite discouraged and even considered flying back to our home country earlier. However we later met with a very helpful staff at the reception (Mr Alvariez) who was very helpful in assisting us to explore the city and giving excellent tips on getting around Barcelona and restaurants. The hotel is located near the Glories mall (a good place for shopping) and has some nice restaurants of different cuisines within walking distance. There is also a super market nearby. The tour bus pick up point is also near the Glories mall. We purchased tickets for the tour bus from the hotel. We also purchased tickets for the flamenco dance from the concierge. It\u2019s been less than 6 months since the hotel is part of the Sheraton group. As a result you can see the integration to the Sheraton standard happening slowly (almost there) .The breakfast is decent, though I wished they could have more local fare included. Housekeeping could improve - I found tangled hair on the hair dryer (ugh!) when we checked-in to the room and the bed would be made differently every day. Hope the hotel can pay more attention to such details. But other than these, overall we had a good experience staying at the hotel, thanks to the polite and helpful staff.
