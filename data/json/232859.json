As you enter the building, there ARE 5 steps to go up until you reach the small elevator to the 3rd floor. As you enter the Residenza door, you are greeted by lovely classical music, a brightly lit hallway with a wide corridor, flowers and a spacious feeling, very untypical of such establishments.The double room I got (6), was at the end of the hall, and very quiet.It had an EXCELLENT bed, good lighting, a minibar, in which I could keep food I needed,WONDERFUL, FLUFFY TOWELS, AND EVEN A RADIO (which unfortunately didn't give me classical music). There were two little welcome dishes with chocolates and amaretti, yet one more nice touch to make you feel welcome. The staff- particularly Margie and Robert- were all very helpful and kind, and were able to assist even with the computer I couldn't manage.The breakfast was pretty standard, but nicely presented.I requested to have whole wheat rolls and a milk alternative , and the next morning everything was available for me. Perhaps the most remarkable thing was a gesture by the owner, Barbara de Paolis, who did something of such integrity, that it is hard to match: I had been given a special price that had been advertised on the internet. On the evening before I left I went out for dinner with friends, and upon my return I found an envelope addressed to me in my room. It was from Barbara who wrote me a wonderful note (I am fluent in Italian, so no problem there) and she said that she had left a note at the desk saying that since I was using a double room as a single, I was to have gotten another 10 euro off the price, but the note had been overlooked. I had never known about this arrangement, and she could just as well never have told me. But she did, and returned the difference in price , in cash, in the envelope. I think that such behavior is truly remarkable, and is to be commended.That alone is a reason to go back and send others. But also the fact that they made me breakfast at 5.40 in the morning when I had to leave for an early flight says a lot about a place. I did have some small criticisms, which I hope will be taken care of by the owners: 1) there are no hooks in the bathroom on which to hang anything, like a robe, etc.That needs to be done.2)There should be a pad and pen in every room, and that is even more important than the sweets! 3) The shower is VERY SLIPPERY and as a result very dangerous. There should be a mat in it. These are small things which can easily be fixed, and I hope they will be.

As the name implies, it is not a hotel in the sense that they do not occupy a building onto themselves, but rather 2 floors of a multi-purpose building (other companies on the other floors). That being said, we felt completely at home at the Residenza !! We were very impressed with all of the personnel as they welcomed us warmly and always responded positively to any of our requests. It is a 5 minute walk from Termini main train station to the Residenza, which is very convenient for getting to and from the airport, and there is close access to the subway lines. We had reserved 2 Junior Suites (located on the 3rd floor which is also the Reception area); the rooms were nicely decorated, very clean, and had individually controlled air conditioning which was greatly appreciated as the days averaged 33 degrees! We were quite surprised that although the Residenza is located 1 street away from a major thoroughfare (Via Nazionale) the rooms were quiet. Breakfast, included in the price of the rooms, was served in a small breakfast room on the 3rd floor. On the 5th floor there is a little covered balcony with chairs (no real view) which gives guests the opportunity to get a bit of fresh air, read, etc. as there is no real lounge area inside. Near the Reception guests have access to an internet terminal (free) which came in very handy. There are several restaurants in the area; we dined 4 times at La Taverna dei Monti which was a 5 minute walk away.

The building is off on a side street so a bit quieter in the evening and not as hectic as hotels on the main drags. The room was elegant, nice furnishings and large windows in bathroom and bedroom that you can open to let in the sounds and smells of Italy. Good heavy drapes to shut it all out when you are ready to sleep! The bed was large and comfortable and there were fresh flowers throughout the hotel. Our very spacious room came with a daybed giving you room to spread out, nice when you\u2019re traveling a long time. We had a Jacuzzi tub with a shower, a relaxing break to soak the sore muscles and feet after site seeing all day. There was plenty of closet space for my husband and I to unpack everything since we were staying in Rome for 7 days. There were two sitting chairs, a table and a mini fridge, convenient for when you pickup things at the deli for a light meal. The building is occupied by a couple of nice hotels on the various floors it also has a cool old wood elevator that is one of those unique items that will make the trip memorable. Like the elevators you've seen in the old movies, there is a stairway too. Every day breakfast was served in a room near the front desk area. They put out a generous spread of Italian cheeses, meats, pastries along with cereals fruits and yogurts...you won't be hungry. The staff is super attentive to your needs and can help you with questions about Rome, getting around, site seeing and are a real pleasure to talk to. You control your own AC, which was very comfortable when we needed it. WiFi worked well in our room, which was nice for the iPad we brought along. We were pleasantly surprised upon returning to the hotel one afternoon by the desk clerk who said the owner wanted us to enjoy a bottle of wine up on the roof terrace at our convenience in appreciation for our long stay with Residenza Cellini. Of course we couldn't pass up that opportunity! We thought that was a very lovely gesture by the owner Barbara and want to thank her.

We enjoyed our stay and received excellent service and accommodations. Our triple room was good sized by the standards in European cities and the bathroom was large and well appointed. The room and common areas were very clean and welcoming. There was a wonderful, covered terrace on the 5th floor on which to unwind -high enough to catch cool breezes on hot days. Barbara, the owner, and Robert were very gracious and helpful in meeting our requests. The hotel is actually located in portions of two floors of this building, which is shared with other hotels and residence suites. We also stayed at a separate, very average hotel in the same building and we much preferred Cellini. We would definitely stay at Residenza Cellini again. Positives: Well appointed room, large by the standards of European central cities, very clean and well organized, very secure interior, wonderful terrace, excellent bathroom by European standards, superior service. The hotel is only a mile walk, bus or Metro ride from the central sites such as the Forum, Colloseum, etc. Nearby Via Nazionale and Piazza della Republica are very busy and full of shops and some restaurants. The Metro station is a short, safe two block walk and will lead you to the Spanish Steps and Vatican City without transfer and the Colosseum and Forum with only once transfer. The large Termini train station is only five blocks away and many bus lines connect within a block or two. There's a small, quirky elevator that may not accommodate your full party and luggage, but it's worth making the two trips - this is a common experience at small and mid-sized hotels in Europe where any elevator is often a plus. Negatives: Very few. One thing you should know going in is that the quiet street is one step above an alley by American standards, and nearby businesses sometimes leave their trash on the sidewalk down the street (common in Rome from our observations). This street location is actually a plus because you avoid most of the noise and traffic of the nearby Via Nazionale, but at first glance you may wonder. I walked the neighorhood late into the night with my wife and young son without any worries. If you can get past any expectations of a grand entrance - it's a nearly unmarked door , you will enjoy your experience. Most travel guides will tell you that you need to be flexible when traveling abroad and quite honestly, any negatives listed here will probably not detract from your experience and may add to it.

We were given a \"late winter\" rate of 180 euros per night for a junior suite with breadfast , service and taxes included. After hearing all the stories about \"european sized rooms\", I was worried about the size of the room. It was quite spacious, and my wife, college-aged son and I had plenty of elbow room. I had also heard about standards of cleanliness in Europe being different from those in the U.S. Not so here. The room was as as clean as any I have ever stayed in at home or abroad. We very much liked the fact that the hotel combines great rooms with excellent service. Barbara de Paolis and her staff were happy to make reservations for us both before our arrival and after our stay. The staff was also considerate about numerous small gestures that made our stay so memorable. Ice for drinks before dinner was swiftly delivered. When my wife wanted to take breakfast in her room, the staff saw me carrying a plate and graciously got me a tray and took it to the room. The staff was happy to store our luggage while we were in Florence, and thoughtfully placed the bag back in our room when we arrived. We were given a bottle of prosecco with peanuts and salty snacks on our last night due to the length of our stay. There are no public rooms; you basically have your room, a terrace on the fifth floor we didn't visit due to the weather; and a computer in the breakfast room. We didn't find this to be a problem at all. We also read a review that cautioned against the third floor due to noise. Our room was quiet (except for sirens, we heard no street noise). The location is a little distant from places like Trastevere and Piazza Navona. On the other hand, the Metro was close, and Termini an easy walk. The neighborhood is great. There is a wonderful bakery, restaurant, sandwich shop (Dagnino) a couple of blocks away that we frequented when we did not want to go out to a big dinner. There is a grocery store and pharmacy within a block or two. You are near some interesting sites, including the church housing the \"Ecstasy of St. Terese\", the National Museum of Rome, and an historic church built on the Baths of Diocletian. The Vatican, Colloseum, Piazza Bernini, and Spanish Steps are easily assessible by Metro. We bought the Rome pass (25 euros), and used it quite a bit. If you have more than three people in your party, take advantage of the car service (55 euros). Somewhat more expensive than the trains, but worth it if you arrive tired in a new city. Finally, Residenza Cellini went out of its way to let us check in early, a godsend if you have an overnight flight.

We chose Residenza Cellini because of all of its good reviews on Tripadvisor and the reviews were right! Upon arrival at the airport, the hotel arranged a shuttle to pick us up. They took us to the hotel. The hotel is on the third floor in the building. We took an old fashioned lift up to the third floor. The lobby is small but beautiful. All of the staff members were awesome. We arrived at 11am and our room was not quite ready because check in was not until 1pm and our room was still being prepared. Even though we were early, they let us enjoy their buffet breakfast and let us store all of our luggage so we could go sightseeing. By reading the reviews and info on the website, I didn't realize how conveniently located Residenza Cellini is. The staff gave us very helpful, clear instructions and gave us a map that made it very easy for us to see how to get around on the bus system. For only $4 euro per person you can ride the buses all day long and the buses stop right near all the main attractions. You could actually walk everything as well-the hotel was close to everything. After about 10 hours sightseeing, we went back to our hotel and found that the junior suite room we reserved was very nice, large and clean. Real hardwood floors & tall ceilings. The bathroom had an awesome 5 jet jacuzzi tub that was absolutely perfect after the long work out my legs had sightseeing. The front desk directed us to a local pizzeria/restaurant for dinner and the food was very good. In the morning, the breakfast buffet was great. Lots of options, good food and although the breakfast room was a little on the smaller side, it was never a problem as there were never more than 3-4 couples in the room eating at once. At check out they quickly arranged a taxi to take us to the train station.

First the positive: This hotel is in a fantastic location, in the town centre, in a quite road just off Via Nazionale, close to all the major attractions and Termini station. The actual property is very small, they must have about 7 or 8 rooms in total located across the 3rd and the 5th floor of an old building (on the other floors there are other hotels/businesses). The rooms are beautifully decorated with qualifty finishes such as marble floors and bathroom worktops, quality tiles, shower jets, luxurious soft furnishings, comfortable beds etc. It seems as if it had been decorated very recently as it all looks very fresh. The breakfast room is nice and cosy and offers a selection of sweet pastries, biscuits brioche, 1 type of bread rolls, cooked meat, 2 types of cheese, salami, 1 type of cereal, yogurts and almond tart. The service is excellent, their staff very friendly, nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. Now the negative: The lift is a very old fashioned one that involves having to manually open and close two sets of doors. One of the doors have a spring that makes them close all the time, so when you are coming in and out you have to use all your available limbs prop them open so that they will not be closing on you. This is particularly difficult if you have, bags, luggage and are large or heavily pregnant (such as me). If your room happens to be on the 5th floor, this is a nuisance since, the reception and breakfast room are located on the 3rd floor so you have to endure those lift doors several times a day. Another problem of staying on the 5th floor is that you have to double lock not only your own room but a sort of 'front room' so this added to the lift becomes a right pain on the backside after a while. The room I was given was a good size (not huge but not small either), the only problem is that the end of the bed was too close to the wall, and on top of that the TV was mounted on the wall, so, to get to that side of the bed I had to make some sort of contorsion which wasn't easy being heavily pregnant and I suppose the problem would be the same for someone large. Whilst the breakfast selection was good, it's not what I would award 5*. There was not enough variety of bread (no brown) or cereal. There was no cooked breakfast choice or eggs of any kind and I asked for some decaf coffee and got instant!! But overall, I'd say it's an excellent choice for the money paid, specially compared to the general standard of accommodation in Rome.

It is up 4 flights of stairs, which made me giddy with happiness as I had eaten my way through the Italian countryside! There is an elevator, it is just so tiny and slow, that a quick jog up the stairs was great. Residenza Cellini has a fabulous location near Termini station and many must-see attractions. And the metro station and ATM were just steps around the corner. As a matter of fact, we walked there from the station, as there had been a demonstation earlier in the day, and the cab drivers were using that as an excuse to charge 25EU to drive us a couple city blocks. Really, no big deal. Hard on the luggage wheels, but almost too close for the taxi at all! (of course, taxis in Rome are another story all together!) It is a TINY hotel, I think 24 rooms. Our room had a king-size bed (quite unusual for Italy) and was really spacious. Nice clean bathroom. Everything very clean and comfortable. But it was the staff, wow, what a staff! They were VERY helpful with our thousands of questions. They must have used up 10 maps drawing out walking/driving/metro directions for us! But they were always there to help. As a matter of fact, when we departed for the airport, VERY early in the morning, they asked if we would like coffee prior to leaving. Um, YES! Not only did they have coffee ready at 5:45 am, they had a whole breakfast spread ready. Now that is above and beyond service! Our room rate was outstanding (remember, cash IS king) so don't be shy to ask, prior to booking. If I had any gripe at all (and it is really not a fair gripe as it did not reflect badly on the hotel) was they had beautiful fresh lilies in vases. I hate the smell of lilies (they have that funeral smell) but, hey, the were beautiful, fresh-cut flowers! Oh, and can't remember names, but if you do stay at Residenza Cellini, on that same street, to the left, there is a little indoor mall. There is a pastry shop in there to die for!

Wonderful welcome when we arrived and Barbara ran through the best places to try on our first visit to Rome.

Most of what needs to be said about this hotel has already been said by other reviewers, so I thought I would just mention the things that for me were most appreciated and most lacking. The location is great (15 mins walk to many landmarks and near to the train station and Metro), the staff is efficient and friendly and our room was large and comfortable with great air-con. Our room was very nicely furnished with quality furnishings and a comfortable bed. Our bathroom was also of high quality with marble fixtures. The hotel is quiet and characterful (reception and breakfast room on 3rd floor, our room and terrace on the 5th) and is serviced by a lovely, but quite tiny old lift. We also made use of the free, but rather erratic wifi. The breakfast appears to be a matter of slight contention with Tripadvisors, so for those interested I have uploaded some photos. For us, the breakfast was good \u2013 we enjoyed the freshly made cappuccinos and the pastries especially. Otherwise we could have had yoghurts, cheese, ham, rolls, a Special K type cereal, fruit, biscuits and those hard, little toast things with a selection of jams. Fairly basic fare, but good stuff all round. There are only a couple of negatives I would mention: there was no tourist information in the room which would have been useful and our room was slightly dark and without a view to speak of. I suspect, though, that all these negatives may be applicable to almost all Rome hotels.

It was not a problem in itself, just odd to go up in the elevator seeing all these assorted \"hotels\" on each floor. We joked that we were in a bordello! But that is not my complaint. Our room must have been the smallest one in the house, not what I would remotely call a \" double superior\" room and nothing like any of the pictures that they show in their website. When I asked if all \"Double superior\" were this size I was told \"yes\". However, the other few rooms I saw as they were being cleaned looked significantly bigger. The bathroom was equally small, specially the shower which was a joke. How do overweight people deal with that? My husband and I are thin and had trouble with it. The small shower enclosure is made even smaller by an added strip of \"jacuzzi\" jets. Ridiculous. The breakfast room is minimal. The tables were so close together that I felt I could hear what other people were thinking. Coffee was almost undrinkable. Some of the people that were at the front desk were very odd, and any request for basic things such as a blanket or how to adjust the A/C in the room, was met by a stare, like we were asking for something unheard of. As a matter of fact, we were told that we couldn't keep the room at a lower temp because it would blow a fuse. The temperature they kept adjusting it to the minute we left the room was barely acceptable for the hot temps in Rome. On the positive I will say that it was very clean and the decor was nice.

Based on reviews we read on Trip Advisor we contacted Hotel Residenza Cellini but they did not have any \"quads\" available. However, they suggested we would be much more comfortable and it would be more affordable if we reserved an apartment that was managed by the Hotel rather than reserve 2 rooms at the hotel. They were right. And as we discovered, the apartment had a better location closer to the historical areas like the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon than did the hotel. Upon our arrival we were met by Gaetano who showed us around the 3 bedroom apartment we rented on the 4th floor at Via M. Dionigi, #17. He also spent a lot of time with us to show us where we were located and where we could go nearby for dinners out. The hotel front desk could be called from the apartment for any questions or even to assist with dinner reservations. We stayed 5 nights and the apartment was cleaned once with fresh towels provided during our stay, which was sufficient. The master bedroom was very large and spacious and contained an in-wall safe, air conditioner, phone, and TV. The 2nd bedroom contained 2 twin beds and was also amply sized. The 3rd bedroom was very small and suitable only for one person and one small bed. The apartment was tastefully decorated, clean and very large. Although not luxurious, it was a very comfortable and quite place for us to stay. The main bathroom was plenty large and had an excellent shower and there was also a dining room off of the kitchen that was stocked with cooking hardware, refrigerator, and some breakfast basics like juice, croissants, toast, bread, jam, and milk. The neighborhood was quiet and safe and had several good places to dine in the evening if we didn't want to cross the river to walk to the historical site seeing areas. If we did decide to take a walk for dinner or shopping we could get to many places within about a half a mile. We were also very close to a bus stop that makes it easy to get over to the Coloseum and Forum, which are too far to walk to. We were a little weary of choosing an apartment rental over a full service hotel but in the end it worked out great for us. Unless you must have total luxury and full service amenities, we would highly recommend this apartment to families traveling as it definitely is more comfortable and more affordable than most other options. In our minds there is no comparison of the location versus the Residenza Cellini, which is further away from the historical sites and is also located on an upper level floor of a building.

Every once in awhile a hotel comes along that is superior in every way and RC is that and more for the following reasons: Service: Truly the gold standard in this area-from the minute we walked in we were made to feel welcome and nurtured. When we would come home each evening and take the charming vintage elevator up to reception to pick up our room key, someone at the desk would be right there at the elevator door to hand us our key so we didn't even have to get off. In addition Georges and the rest of the staff answered our endless questions with patience, enthusiasm and good humor. Rooms: We felt so fortunate to stay in Rm 503 on the 5th floor which was cozy and sparkling clean, beautiful decor and we loved the state of the art bathroom! And we had our own private terrace which was enclosed in the larger 5th floor terrace that many other reviewers have referenced-absolutely lovely to sit out on with a cold drink after a long day of sightseeing. We took full advantage! It was extremely hot in Rome and when we returned to our room each day our A/C was turned on which was so lovely and refreshing. The A/C is controlled by remote so you are able to adjust at all times to personal preference-a big plus! Overall ambiance of hotel: Just lovely-we felt like we were staying in a very elegant home. The roooms and hallways are beautifully decorated and sparkle throughout. The breakfast room is very nice and was a great place to start each day. Breakfast: For us, the continental breakfast buffet was perfect. Pastries, breads, cereals, meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, etc. And then of course the best part, your coffee preference (Expresso, cappucino, American coffee, etc) brought steaming hot to your table. We throughly enjoyed meeting others and sharing experiences, tips, etc. Location: We loved the location!! Easy access to Termini, metro and bus and we enjoyed the surrounding area very much-great restaurants, very clean, nice to stroll. It was a bit of a walk to the major sites but we liked being out of the 'hub' a bit. The front desk made it easy to navigate the area and all of the sites with their large stack of maps that they would mark for us each time we went out. In conclusion, we have travelled extensively and have enjoyed many, many different types of accomodations from motels to B&Bs to 5 star hotels/resorts and we can honestly give Residenza Cellini the highest recommendation with great enthusiasm.

This is where we spent 5 of 8 days, for our leisure portion. Once our patient cab driver made his way from the airport through the blocked off streets (massive political rallies in the city that day), we found ourselves at this charming little boutique hotel, consisting of about a dozen rooms on two floors in a quaint \"Belle Epoque\" building near the Piazza della Repubblica- complete with tiny, cranky, luggage-challenged elevator cage, just like you see in the movies. You would actually walk right by it if you didn't know it was there. Certainly no grand facade or pretentions on the outside. There are 5 or 6 floors to the building, with each floor accommodating a few rooms as part of several small hotels within. Opt for the 5th floor, with outside terraces off the hallway and one of the rooms. Rooms are actually quite small, but very well-appointed, elegant and comfortable. Beds a bit on the hard side, but generous in size. Stunning, if small, bathrooms. TV service is about what you'd expect - once you figure out the \"code\" you can bring in more than just Italian-language programming. But who stays in Rome to watch TV?! If you stay more than 2 days, and pay cash, you get a reduced rate. Still a bit pricey, but given that you are a 5 minute walk from the \"Republicca\" metro station, or a 15 minute walk from some of the major sites (incl the Colosseum, the Tiber River, etc), it's worth it. Excellent restaurants within minutes' walking, and the accommodating staff are quite happy to make recommendations and reservations. Breakfast is included in the price; nothing special - standard continental fare of coffee/tea, juice, bread and pastries, meat and cheese trays, fresh fruit, yogurt and cereal, but enough to get you going. Some decent, affordable shopping just around the corner along Via Nationale. Charming, relaxed, old fashioned service in the heart of one of the most exciting cities in the world.

There were 5 of us in total. There were three bedrooms- one with a single bed and two with a double bed. They also added another single bed at our request. We had 2 1/2 baths, a kitchen and a dining room- a very big apartment. They cleaned halfway through our trip as well. When we arrived our kitchen was stocked with milk, juice, and breakfast foods. That made our vacation much easier as we did not have to worry about breakfast. Also, we went on two day trips while we were in Rome and the front desk helped us with directions both times.

We originally contacted the hotel directly as a result of TripAdvisor reviews 18 months ago. We had to postpone our trip until now but when we recontacted the hotel, again they offered us a special rate. You get the best rate if you pay cash. Also, our stay was in low season, and we were staying more than 4 night, we were also offered a bottle of complimentary spumante. To describe the level of service at Residenza Cellini: Most hotels would just plonk your bottle of fizz in your room. We were asked what time we wanted ours served and where - either in the small beakfast area or in our room. At the appointed time we got a call just to check we were ready for our drink, then it was served on a silver tray, the bottle in a silver bucket of ice, with flutes, a selection of savoury nibbles, napkins and a stopper. Once we had drunk half the bottle, we felt we had had enough as we planned to have a bottle of wine with our dinner shortly. The staff were more than happy to suggest that they would keep the stoppered bottle in their fridge and all we needed to do was ask for it again. We had a repeat performance the next night! There is always somebody at the front desk and that person always has a welcoming smile, speak good English and is courteous, polite, helpful and willing. From the warm welcome on arrival, with a helpful briefing of how to get the best of Rome, the key transport options for the major sites from the doorstep and some suggestions of neighbourhood eateries, to our departure with a wave and plea to return one day, we could not fault the service. Our room was plenty large enough for our needs, with old fashioned furniture which suited the age and style of the building well. The bed was firm and comfortable, the lighting excellent for Italy and there was enough storage for our layers, this being winter. The bathroom was compact but again brightly lit and the sanitary ware modern and spotless. We had a minor problem with the toilet flush, but this was rectified immediately. The only complaint perhaps was that the room was always too hot for our liking for sleep, but this was easily remedied by turning the heating off and opening a window. We would make two comments of warning: The hotel is really more of a style B&B, housed in a large apartment in a large, old building. It is on the 3rd floor, and it is not easy to see the sign for it at the entrance door. Between the hours of 7.30pm and 9.00am roughly, the doors are locked when the building concierge is off duty. You then have to find and ring the doorbell to gain entry to the building. Also, owing to the narrow inset door, several steps before the door and more once inside before you reach the lift/elevator, which is very small, old fashioned and extremely awkward to get in and out of, the hotel is not the ideal choice of anybody with small children in buggies/strollers or with mobility restrictions.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC metro area", "Title": "\u201cOur room was beautiful, staff helpful and respectful, central location.\u201d", "Author": "Exploringworks", "ReviewID": "UR55600902", "Content": "This was a return visit to Residenza Cellini.

I have had the pleasure of staying in some of the best 4 and 5 star hotels in the world and I am delighted to share a wonderful find in the heart of Rome. We recently traveled to Italy with our family of eight. Our stay was two weeks so we hopped cities a good bit. Each night required 3 rooms. We found a bed and breakfast in the heart of Rome and booked our three rooms for the final leg of our trip. I was absolutely delighted with the place! The rooms were quite spacious, spotless and decorated beautifully. Breakfast each day was lovely as well. The kids were thrilled because they offered wi-fi in the rooms at no additional charge. But the best part of Residenza Cellini was a concierge named George. What a delight he was! This dear man did more than anyone anywhere has ever done in trying to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Whenever we approached with another question about restaurants, taxis, museums, or shopping he acted as if we were the only guests in the hotel. He was pleasant, smart, and so very helpful. Even when we did not need reservations we would arrive at a restaurant and find that George had called ahead to secure our table and even made sure there was a baby seat waiting for us. A few days before our departure he asked if we would need transportation to the airport. I had forgotten to line that up. Again, since we were such a large party with lots of luggage, he needed some advance notice to secure a large vehicle. We were unable to print our boarding passes and George brought something from home to allow us to print on the hotel's computer. Again, he spent most of an hour working with my husband to do that. Breakfast was served daily at 7:30 and we were slated to leave at 7:15 so I assumed we would eat when we got to the airport. The night before our departure George told us breakfast would be ready at 6:45 for us. He thought of absolutely everything! The last night there I asked for the owner's contact information so I could commend his service and he turned red and said there was no need for that. So self-effacing! And never without a smile! I would recommend Residenza Cellini at Via Modena, 5 Roma. www.residanzacellini.it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Rome.

I worked with Francesca and Georges to plan our hotel stay. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner hotel with impeccable service that was within walking distance to many attractions. It was 5 minutes to the train station and about 7 minutes to the bus station. It far exceeded our expectations. I can't say enough about the staff and the service. Anything we wanted or needed was taken care of including reservations to museums, restaurants or just plain directions. I felt like I was in a movie with the shinning marble floors and draperies from ceiling to floor. The next street over from the Residenza is the main road Nationale Republic which has lots of shopping, restaurants and a great little bar we found where the people were very friendly. That was relaxing at the end of our long day of touring. One thing I must say is that we left some items in the room when we departed and by the time we arrived home in the US we had a message from the Hotel about our items. They were immediately sent to us and some included dollars. I was really impressed but based on the people we interfaced with I wasn't surprised. They have very high standards.

I searched by areas within the historical part of Rome and compared prices and ratings and finally located about six hotels to contact for availability and prices for our four night stay. Several of my choices offered online booking, but we contacted Residenza Cellini directly via email. Within 24 hours, the hotel responded with their offer based on a final payment of cash or travelers checks. We guaranteed our stay with a credit card and faxed that number to them. We could have called the hotel with the information, but were deterred by the time difference between CA and Rome. The hotel\u2019s excellent service began immediately with prompt responses to our few questions about specific sightseeing recommendations and transfer options from the cruise terminal into the city. We appreciated the hotel's quiet location, one block north of Via Nationale, near Piazza Republica. The hotel\u2019s sign on the building is smaller than expected, so we had a little trouble locating the building initially, but our Google map printed from home before departure came to the rescue. As first time visitors to Italy and Rome, we had no familiarity with the \u201cresidenza\u201d lodging category, which seems to be a cross between a small hotel and a B & B. The reception area and some rooms are located on the third floor; our attractive and generous-sized room was located on the fifth floor across the hall from a lovely covered terrace where we ate our take away snacks. Our room and bathroom were spotless and very well maintained each day. The shower enclosure, about the size of a cruise ship shower, offered a variety of sprays and the wonderful water pressure was something I\u2019d forgotten existed. The bed was firm, but because we walked a lot each day and returned exhausted in the evening, we had no trouble sleeping. The new flat screen TV offered a clear, sharp picture and a large selection of program options. The breakfast choices were ample with fresh cold meats and cheeses, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruits and juices, coffee, tea, assorted rolls, Danish, and cookies. Best of all were the suggestions and recommendations of the staff in response to our questions regarding sightseeing, transportation and places to eat. They graciously volunteered to make reservations for the Borghese museum and our transfer from the hotel to the airport.

Residenza is a few minutes walk to bus and subway. Particularly if you are going cross town to the Vatican the subway is a 1 euro bargin and gets you there in 10 minutes. Also, the security is better than in many hotels, You have to be buzzed in or use your key. At night you also have to be buzzed in at the front outside door.

It also won an award in 2009 from Tripadvisor for its service. We are not in agreement with them on the service issue. This 11-room hotel is located near Termini and is within 20-25 minutes walking distance of tourist attractions. Actually, Rome is much smaller and walkable than I anticipated. We reserved junior suites at 210 euros (cash payment) per room, per night, for three nights. They are actually regular rooms, not what I would call suites, but huge by European standards, maybe even by American standards. I certainly could not complain about the size or decor of the room. Both rooms (us on the fifth floor with the other ladies on the third floor) were in very quiet locations. Our Romeo and Juliet balcony overlooked an inner courtyard (not an attractive courtyard, but a quiet one). My travel companions on the third floor even had a live orchid plant in their room. The outdoor terrace is lovely and we sat out there one evening. My only (minor) complaints about the room are the coarse linens and the (whirlpool) bathtub was very slippery. The breakfast room is small as some on Tripadvisor mentioned, but we seemed to be the only ones in there each morning. They kept a bowl of fresh fruit in the breakfast room all day and I enjoyed that. Regarding the service issues, I emailed them several weeks in advance asking them to call the Galleria Borghese for me with a question. They responded back quickly to tell me they would call and get right back with me. I never heard from them. After waiting several days, I worked out my answer on my own. Also, my travel companion had an early morning flight and asked the woman at the front desk one evening to look on the internet for train information for the Leonardo Express. It was over an hour with no answer \u2013 the woman said she was still trying to locate the requested information. I came back to the room to learn this, and it took me less than 60 seconds to get the information on the (free) internet access they provide in the breakfast room. I expected better service than this. BTW, the computer is removed from the breakfast room during the breakfast service, so be sure to use it in the evening if you want information for the next morning.

Don't expect big or traditional entrance etc. Cellini occupies part of the 3rd and 5th floors of a 6 or 7 floor building and entrance (shared with other building occupants) is one lovely huge timber door but don't let it put you off. Not easy to find as Cellini sign not that big at door. My advice is to get to top of Via Modena ('T' junction with large building facing you) where the Target Restaurant is located on R. H. corner then walk back down street approx. 20 paces and look at side of large wooden door on left for Cellini sign/buzzer or if usin taxi then they should know where street is and 'possibly' Cellini. I booked transfer from Fiumincino airport via net with Italycab Marco at [--] and off www.transfer-airport-rome.com site. They cost 85 euros return (same cost apparently for other airport with most companies?) and were there waiting at airport and collected bang on time at hotel with some decent commentary on way. Transfer time was approx, 25 mins but depends on traffic and your driver. Ours had been driving in and around Rome for 28 years (so knew how not to get stuck in traffic!). We found the location ideal for touring the city as approx. 300m from metro/inderground station. Easy to use metro (and we only use underground probably once every 2-3 years) and basically only couple of lines that can get you close to most locations of interest. Our room was on 5th floor (reception, breakfast room and other rooms on 3rd floor but they are moving all to 5th floor apparently where have nice outside covered terrace for breakfasts etc) and we never heard any noise whatsoever. Cellini staff very attentive and obliging and nothing seemed to much trouble. Room spotless and nicely fitted out but a bit small compared to some other rooms stayed in but not one that I would complain about. En-suite spotless with quality fittings/furniture, hot water within seconds and powershower but again a bit on small side but did not bother us. Room and en-suite 4 star quality. Breakfast is typical continental with reasonable choice, but if you like a nice big fried/cooked breakfast or lots of choice of cereals etc. then you may find it dissapointing. Again staff very attentive and obliging. Mini bar in room only stocks soft drinks and some snacks so if you fancy a little tipple before going out then bring/buy your own wine/beer. We ate in 3 different restaurants all within 5 minutes walking from Cellini and very good. The best (and cheapest of 3) was the Restaurant Target which is literally 15 paces from Cellini door and on the corner of block. Good traditional food with variety. We only ate here on last evening as passed this every day and thought it a 'touristy' place to serve quick food at high cost but not the case. We booked the Vatican City, Roman Forum, Colisseum and Palatine Hill tours via 'Through Eternity' Tours (www.througheternity.com) via their website and found them well worth the money. They may be a bit more expensive than some others but we booked online before travelling and got 20% reduction off normal rates. Their passion about the subjects and the detail and way in their delivery is excellent. I am not an arty person by any means and the initial thought of a 5 hour tour of the Vatican museum and St. Peter's Basilica and Sistine Chapel and Raphael rooms didn't quite give me a throb beforehand as I was more interested in the historical Roman achitecture and culture etc. BUT I can honestly say the tour was very very interesting with the way it was presented with their researched theories and opinions had me looking at the paintings with a different attitude. They only have a maximum of 15 in a tour and our tours were 10 maximum so if you had a question everyone could here it and the answer (not easy if you are at the back of one of the 20- 30+ tour groups we constantly saw walking around).", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place, great location, great staff.\u201d", "Author": "NellieCT", "ReviewID": "UR27886020", "Content": "While the Residenza Cellini itself was unavailable when I made our reservation, I was offered their \"apartment\".

We found the breakfast well above average, with a nod to the excellent capuccino and espresso. And of course, the location is excellent -- a block to the Repubblica subway station and just a few more to the huge Termini station, and a reasonable walk to many of Rome's other attractions, including the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. But the highlight here is the attentive service. Any time we showed even a hint of a need for anything -- be it extra towels, restaurant recommendations or whatnot -- they were only too eager to help. Moreover, the responses were always warm and genuine, and they never lost patience answering question after question (as this was our first trip to Rome).

The hotel is in a great location right by Repubblica Metro Service (Linea A) which links to Termini - which has links to the airport in just 35 mins, and Linea B. The metro service forms a big X. We did also notice that a Linea C was being built. Most of the major tourist attractions are within walking distance, such as the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and the Colloseum. Those that aren't you can easily reach by Metro or Bus. I would strongly recommend taking the 110 Bus tour so that you can see just how close you are to everything. From the hotel you will notice that access west of the river is not as easy and will involve buses as there are limited metro's to the west. This meant that we saw very little of the Giancolo Hill and Travestere region (which is where all the best shops/restaurants are supposed to be). That said we ate in some lovely restaurants (always try the backstreets for the best and much cheaper prices). The 'hotel' is in an apartment building on the 3rd floor with a very old lift. There are a number of hotels within the building so do not expect a grand entrance at 5 via modena for Residenza Cellini as all you will find is a buzzer for the property. This is not clear from the website at all and was a bit of a surprse. However that said the staff are incredibly helpful and I'm surprised by the reviews that said otherwise. The rooms are basic but clean, the bigger rooms have a jaccuzzi bath although we had a lot of limescale come out of ours - not nice! The beds are very firm and unfortunately there is a lot of noise during the night either from other floors or the street, not much that they can do about that. Breakfast is very basic and continental so don't expect a hot buffet and I agree with other reviews that the breakfast room is very small and the food on offer is in short supply.

We booked this hotel based on the reviews here on TA as well as the Rick Steve's book. We booked the \"marvelous Junior Suite\" as described by the hotel itself for our family of 4. While the size of the room was suffiecient, it was by no means a suite, but rather a single room with a king-sized bed, a twin bed and a twin-sized cot bed - all of which were extremely hard and uncomfortable. The room was clean as was the bathroom which was roomy enough and we did have clean towels replenished each day, though soap was provided only the first day of 5. The sheets were clean and decent. The only big problem was the NOISE. Our room was directly on via Modena which seems to be a very small street, but street noise was ongoing and started very, very early in the morning and it was extremely difficult to sleep. The breakfast which was provided was OK, but not great. There was just one choice of cereal with a pitcher of warm milk, hard rolls and just very few croissants each day (no matter how early we arrived), some warm cheese and meat (also minimal) and a daily plate of cookies which would have been more welcome as a late afternoon snack. Two small pitchers of juice were also provided along with room temperature yogurts. There was a bowl of fruit on 3 out of the 5 days we were there and hot beverages were offered on some mornings to us only. The breakfast room is VERY small and can only accomodate a few people. Some mornings we were welcomed and others we were just stared at - depending upon the staff member on duty. We were never told of the 5th floor terrace by any staff member and only read about it on review here upon our return home. We did receive a very nice bottle of sparkling wine upon arrival and did recieve some directions when asked, but the staff generally had no recomendations for restaurants close by which was surprising. They also did not know what was open on Christmas and the surrounding days. They did keep some of our luggage while we went to Florence for 2 nights which was a really big help and most appreciated. But on our last night we requested a wake-up call for the next day as we had an early flight home - we got no wake up call and woke up and hour late (there are no clocks in the room) with only 1/2 hour for four people to shower. That was most unhelpful. There is one laptop with free internet service which were were able to use which was great. The location of the hotel is close to the train station (termini) which is good if you are utilizing that, but otherwise all sites are quite a hike away.

We were told the area was safe to walk around at night and we never had any problems doing this. On the last night we were offered a lovely chilled bottle of bubbly for us to enjoy as a thank you for our visit. My wife and I like to visit different cities once or twice a year. It is our philosophy never to go back to the same city again, as there are always new ones to visit with new sights to see. However, if we did decide to go back to Rome we would have no hesitation at all in booking the Residenza Cellini again. Other recommendations for your stay: Get a taxi to the hotel when you arrive at the airport. The hotel is situated on a little back-street and even the taxi diver with sat-nav had difficulty finding it. If we had arrived by train to the local terminal and had to drag our suit cases looking for the hotel it would have been very hard work. However once you get your bearings, making your own way back to the airport is very easy. Footware: Make sure you have good footware as you will most likely walk alot. The pavements and roads are generally of the cobbled variety and can be very hard going on the feet. Vatican: By chance we happened on a good way to see all the attractions at the Vatican. We arrived early in the morning (8:30am) to see the Vatican museums. There was hardly a queue. After spending a few hours in the museums we headed to the square to see St Peter's Basillica and its Treasure museum. The queue was so long it stretched right aroung the square. Estimated queuing time was aroung 1:30 - 2:00 hours. So we decided to come back again the next morning, which we did, and again arrived early (9:00) and there was no queue at all! So, if you have the time to go on two separate half-days, that definately is the way to do it. P.S. the Treasure museum in St. Peter's was just amazing!! For a day out from Rome: Visit Tivolli! On a sunny day the gardens with their many waterfalls are just out of this world. Finally, may I ask all Trip-Advisors...if possible allow yourselves to be contacted.

There was also an armoire that had an easy to use safe where we stored our passports. The bathroom was small compared to North American standards and we did not have a tub. However, the shower was very nice with good pressure and lots of hot water. My husband found the shower to be a bit cramped but he is 6'7\"tall so that wasn't a big surprise and I had no trouble with the size at all. We did peek into a suite and found it to be quite large with a gorgeous whirlpool tub and a shower set up in the tub. We would probably stay in a suite next time - its worth the extra cost, if you want extra space and a bath!! We found the area around the hotel to be safe and quiet - it is just behind the Via Nationale so the location was great - easy to access transportation and the sites we wanted to see, but not noisy as it was just off this main road. We could walk the length of Via Nationale in about 10 - 15 minutes and could reach the Pantheon in about 15 minutes. We bought a metro pass and found the buses and subway easy to get to and efficient. We were able to get to the Colosseum in about 5 minutes on the subway. There was a grocery store on the Via Nationale, about a five minute walk away from the hotel, and we stocked up there on affordable snacks, pop, and sandwich supplies. We were able to take things out of our minibar fridge and store our purchases in there, which was great. Our email correspondence to Francesca was always answered promptly and she was always friendly and efficient. We did use the service of the driver that the hotel arranged to get us to and from the airport and that was very helpful especially when we were jetlagged. As has been mentioned already, the staff of this hotel are amazing. They were always friendly, helpful, and available and all went above and beyond the call of duty. For example, on one day our tour started at 7 am. Breakfast runs from 7 - 10 am so the staff arranged for breakfast to be set up early so that we would be able to still have breakfast at the hotel prior to our tour departure. Also, we had a rainy day trip to Pompeii. When we returned to our room the staff had given us a bottle of red wine and chocolates as they knew we'd be wet and tired - what a great surprise!!

You could walk to certain sights but it would take at least a realistic 20 minutes, and that would be the closest sight. You are better off taking the Metro which was very easy and cheap. Look into the RomaPass. If you don't mind taking public transportation instead of walking, then this place is for you. As much as I like the hotel I prefer something closer to the action.

The communication from the outset was excellent and I booked the airport limo service which I did not regret. The air conditioned Mercedes dropped us at the entrance to the Cellini which is on a narrow street, Via Modena, which runs parallel to the larger and much busier Via Nazionale. The Hotel is a five minute walk away from the Plaza de Republica and the train, bus stations at the Termini. The open top tour buses commence here and the \u2018110 Open\u2019 leaves the square every ten minutes. A great \u2018hop on / off\u2019 way to see the city. Like every other city, the areas around the bus & railway stations attract the undesirables. The reception to the hotel is on the 3rd floor of the building and access to it is via the \u2018old style\u2019 cage lift or the stairs. The lift is rather restrictive and two people with suitcases are about the maximum. The check in was hassle free and the staff most helpful. Our room was on the 5th floor, so it was back to the lift. Our bags were taken care of and we were shown to the room and given the \u2018guided tour\u2019. The breakfast room was very small and found behind reception and the terrace was directly opposite our 5th floor room. The marble flooring added to the ambience. The room was not the biggest but spacious enough for our 5 night stay. It was immaculately clean, modern and had air con, mini bar fridge & room safe. The bathroom was modern with a \u2018massaging\u2019 shower that was a tight fit to squeeze into. There was a range of toiletries and also a hair dryer. The soft towels were replaced every day. The view from the room was of an interior courtyard below and was very quiet at night. On saying that, the noise from the air con was far too loud. The roof terrace was easily accessible but building work was taking place as the plans are to re locate the reception to the 5th floor and serve breakfast on the terrace. Breakfast was served in the small room at reception and there was ample choice of cereals, fruit, breads, hams, cheeses, yoghurts, fruit juices, tea & coffee. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with booking restaurants, directions and the loan of maps & guide books. Nothing is too much for them. The Target restaurant on the corner of Via Modena is worthy of a visit. It was explained that 'August' is the month that tourists visit Rome and most of the restaurants close as a result. The Cellini is about a 20 minute walk from Vittoria Emanuel and the roads to the Forum & Coliseum. The route is directly down Via Nazionale.

The people on the desk were all helpful, but the one there when we arrived was particularly helpful. He spoke excellent English and took about a half hour to map out all of the attractions for us, including giving us bus numbers to get there, plus recommendations for other sights and restaurants. We went to a restaurant on Isolo Tibernia that was excellent, with a view of the remains of a 4th century B.C. bridge. We also ate at Terazza Barberieni, which is about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and we also enjoyed that one.

It was a nice start to our trip and overall a pleasant stay. More importantly, we felt it was a good value for the money spent. Though you should not expect some of the luxury amenities that you might receive at a Ritz Carlton (luggage service, room service, etc.), you are not paying Ritz Carlton prices, and we feel the personal touch and feeling of someone \u201chosting\u201d us compensated for any shortcomings in amenities. The driver (that the hotel arranged for us) picked us up at the airport and took us to the hotel. We would recommend arranging this if you are flying in (even though it costs 55 Euros plus tip and he\u2019ll likely drive extremely fast), as after a long flight you do not want to have to wait for a taxi. The hotel is on a narrow street in a small building with several other businesses and hotels. There is only a small sign for Residenza Cellini out front (along with signs for other tenants), and the building at first does not look all that nice. The street only has one lane, and other cars cannot easily get by (and they will honk) and it may not be possible to pull over far enough, so be prepared to unload your bags quickly and without assistance except for the driver, as the hotel does not really have anyone to assist with luggage (same when you depart). To get to the hotel reception, you can either take the stairs or the elevator (like most European elevators, it is incredibly small and will likely take several trips to transport you and your luggage). The elevator looks scary, but we found it charming by the end. Once you step into the hotel, you\u2019ll find that the d\u00e9cor is much nicer, with marble floors and fresh flowers. It presents well and is quite clean. Though we were not able to check in upon arrival in mid-morning, we were able to leave our luggage and head out to explore Rome. We would have preferred to store our luggage in a secure room instead of in the hall next to the reception desk, but it appeared that it was adequately monitored by the desk attendant. I was able to store my laptop behind the reception desk upon request, which made me more comfortable. One of the best aspects of our stay was the assistance we received prior to our arrival from Francesca and Georges at the reception desk, who made reservations for us at the Coliseum as well as several restaurants (their favorite, del Giglio, was closed for August, but we very much enjoyed and would recommend the nearby Terrazza Barberini, Target, and also Osteria Ponte Sisto which is a bit further away but worthwhile). They also helped us book a tour of the Vatican with Carrani, a local tour operator, and gave us directions to other spots in the city, such as the catacombs. We would strongly recommend making reservations for the main attractions ahead of time (Francesca and Georges speak excellent English and are very responsive on e-mail), as the lines for those who did not do so looked unbearable (especially the Vatican\u2026wow). It is worth noting that the hotel is at least a 15-20 minute walk from most of the major sites. We were able to walk it without trouble, but older guests and those sensitive to heat should consider having the hotel call you a taxi. They arrive in 5 minutes, and be ready to go because they start charging you from the time they are called! When we returned in the early afternoon from sightseeing, our room was ready and our luggage was in it. The air conditioning was good, and the room, though on the smaller side and with no view of note, was clean and certainly adequate. We would definitely recommend booking a junior suite, as it is not much more expensive and still not a very large room (the less expensive rooms must be quite small). The TV is small and does get CNN, but you probably won\u2019t watch it much anyway. The bed is hard as a rock, but we found that to be the case at the other Italian hotels at which we stayed. There is an iron available free upon request, but all guests share it so don\u2019t count on keeping it in the room. Free wireless internet and a laptop available for guest use was a nice touch. The bathroom was clean and fairly spacious, but water from the shower (at least in ours) reached part of the sink area, so do not leave anything there while showering. Water pressure was excellent and there was enough hot water. My wife reports that the hair dryer was not particularly good compared to those at other Italian hotels. One thing we weren\u2019t wild about was that our room was located right in the main hallway just around the corner from the reception desk and breakfast room. As a result, we heard more foot traffic outside our room than we would have liked. The walls also were not terribly thick, but we only heard a few noises that were not terribly disruptive. We did not hear any noise from the outside. The free breakfast in the breakfast room next to the reception desk was nice, though small and with few choices (hard to criticize it when it is free). We were curious why they weren\u2019t hosting it in the outdoor area a few floors up (a wonderful under-utilized area that we would not have even known about had we not read about it on this site). At check-out, they were flexible with giving us a few extra minutes which was greatly appreciated. They also accepted traveler\u2019s checks without a fee, also appreciated. We had a pleasant stay at the Residenza Cellini and felt it was a good value for the money spent.

Many hotels we stayed in advertise this feature but some just don't work well or others ( Paris Hilton ) shut it off at midnight. It's really hot now in Rome so be warned. Bring lots of cool clothes. If you go to the Vatican,ladies need their shoulders covered. The staff, Barbara,Francesca,Georges,Donatello are the best. The breakfast buffet is super and they make coffees and beverages to order.

We walked everywhere to the Spanish steps, Trevi fountains, Pantheon, Colosseum. We did use the underground train several times. Very safe, modern,clean, and cheap to get around. We never waited more than 3 minutes for a train. They have air conditioning to. Restaurants we went to included La del Giglio, ( 5 mins walk ), Squisito, ( just across from the US embassy ). Other restaurants that were recommended but we didn't go to were Il Cabriello and Hostaria Romana. They were all recommended by Georges. We went to 2 that were great. He only works 2 days a week so you might miss him. Sunday night is hard to find a restaurant since many are closed. If you go the the Pantheon in the evening there is a bunch of restaurants sitting around a small fountain. We ate at a couple for lunch and dinner and they were OK. Go to the La Griffe hotel on Via Nazionale on your last night. 5 mins walk. Go to the roof top restaurant on the 10 th floor. Beautiful view to the Vatican city. Amazing views and nice and cool. I would go before and book a table of your choice. They have a great corner table for 2 (the only 1 ) to see the view. Remember all the diners start arriving between 9-10 pm so go before 9 pm to get seated. We arranged for the hotel to get a limo pick up at Rome airport. 55 Euros and worth every penny.

Also have bad reputations for fraudulent practices of deliberately taking you the long way to drive up the fare. If you go to the Colosseum get your entry ticket in advance. We waited in line for 1 hour or more. The hotel staff will tell you where to get it. Take your tickets and walk past the lineups on the left hand side.

My first piece of advice for anyone reading this review is read plenty of reviews of this hotel on tripadvisor!! What this isn\u2019t is a glitzy 300 bedroom hotel with restaurants and bars aplenty. What it is , is a boutique 3rd floor residence where personal service, quality and cleanliness mean everything. The entrance, via a side street intercom, is not the Ritz but from the moment of arrival we were made to feel very welcome. Francesca gave us a very good map of Rome and gave us some helpful advice to get around this wonderful city. We were shown to our room which was large, very comfortable and spotlessly clean, complete with aircon and minibar (soft drinks only). We hate public transport and were happy to travel everywhere on foot. The Trevi Fountain is 12 minutes away, Spanish steps (and designer shopping) 15 minutes, Pantheon 20 minutes, Roman Forum 20 minutes, Colliseum 25 minutes, St. Peters 35 minutes \u2013 and that was at a pretty leisurely pace.

The Cellini were fantastic in arranging an emergency doctor (in the middle of the night) and rearranging flights with Alitalia for an early return.

Firstly get it straight - it's not a hotel, it's a residenzia, so, no pool, no bar, no concierge etc. but, what you do get is the most helpful and friendly staff you could want, beautiful thoughtfully designed and coordinated public areas, and a very nice room. My room had a little balcony that overlooked this inner courtyard (not accessible), with a wonderful modern bathroom and a tiredness defeating jacuzzi bathtub. OK the little room used for breakfast can get crowded, but when the roof terrace is completed the breakfasts and any daytime drinks will be taken there, and it's a lovely place, high above the bustle of the street below. One reviewer stating that breakfast was bread and yoghurt seems to have overlooked the cooked meats, cheeses, pastries, biscuits, cereals, the wonderful coffees and teas, juices and fruit, in fact the only thing not available here that you'd get in a snobby 5 star hotel is the scrambled eggs and frankfurters. Now the location, well, it's less than 5 minutes to the nearest metro station, less than 3 minutes to the bus stop, and i think i walkded to the trevi fountain in about 20 minutes (not recommended - take the metro. use the metro to get to the colesseum, vatican, pantheon etc etc, at 11 euros for a 3 day pass (which includes bus, tram, metro) what a bargain.

I do think it has been made a little over rated by this site though. Firstly location is not so great yes its walkable to most things but so is most of Rome wherever you stay, The Homeless people sleeping on the doorsteps at night certainly dont make you think you are staying in the most desirable of neighbour hoods. We booked our transfer with a seperate company (Rome Cabs) as they were cheeper then what was quoted by the hotel. On arrival we had a very warm welcome and were given a map of Rome and a few resturant recomendations which proved to be very good, particular mention goes to Il Gabriello, just off the spanish steps, also the gentleman pointed out a few things for us to visit, even though we had planned out what we were going to do i must admit helped us alot and perhaps changed our plans for the better. Our room was beautifull, lovely furnishings and fresh flowers, we had been appointed room 2 which is just across from the breakfast room and facing the street, however the noise wasnt to bad at all, yes we could hear people but i havent stayed in a single hotel where i couldnt here people walking around on occasion. Our only gripe(s) with the rooms were the bathroom, firstly we had ants in the bathroom but only on one occasion, which we think may have come through the window when it was open and also the jacuzzi bath, yes it was lovely and great when my feet were tired but unfortunatly the jets were dirty and i think very unpleasently the previous occupant had been shaving before hand and used the jacuzzi as you can imagine not particularly nice, apart from that very comfortable homely rooms. Apart frrom reception & the breakfast rooms there isnt much else to the place, it certainly doesnt come under the Hotel catagory. The lift i found great fun, cartinely an experience, but top tip dont ever leave the metal gate open as not only does it stop someone else calling the lift but you will get shouted at by a very angry Italian man. Breakfast was simple mainly bread products and yogurt definatly improvment needs to be made there. There was no problem in getting them to call a taxi which would arrive in seconds, i will admit to mainly using the taxi in rome as its relativley cheap and the bus just once was not a plesent experience, however i was suprised by the tube and how clean they are. Overall i loved Rome,we managed to pack most of the sites in in 2 1/2 days, we particuarly enjoyed the cat sanctuary (sounds odd i know but worth a visit). Trevi fountain is crowded all day long, Spanish steps we found was fairly quiet in the mornings. We toured Colleseum and Roman Forum (do the forum first at about 9 its so quiet then compared to the crowd later on). The Vatican was really quiet when we went at 12:00 no Q's for Vatican Museum at all. We were really suprised how compact rome is we expected sites to be a long way away from where we were then all of a sudden they were in front of you.

He dropped us off in what looked like an alley to us Canadians, but nope just a narrow street. Lighting was very poor and there was no sign of a Hotel of what we know in sight. We figured we were getting robbed. The guy I was with started being rather abrupt...asking what he was doing...he didn't speak english well, and snapped back.. residenze cellini. He went to this door that would be off alice in wonderland - half size and rand the doorbell. The door is so samll with no hotel markings on it at all. This was surprising to me because the hotel website looks like a nice corner building. Anyway the cab driver says something in Italian and the door never opens. He throws up his hands and gets back into the cab. Needless to say they were reliable because he brought back the camera that I left in the back seat, so fortunate for me. So we stood outside this door while a street person, who lied there each night, was there to greet us. I was so creeped out I said do you want to walk and find a different hotel? Oh my, all the reviews were so good! Which when we borrowed the laptop inside it had an internet history of going to this site many times..? Maybe vacationers. Anyway after ringing three times, finally someone answered gain sounded angry and we said Hi we're staying at the hotel..the door buzzed to what seemed like an apartment. The quaint lift was just big enough for us and our luggage piled on top of each other. We had no idea what floor so we went one by one. Nothing was signed, until we hit the first hotel looking place, we got off, and he directed us up a few floors to the residenza cellini. The hotel is more like a bed and breakfast to us Canadians. It is not a hotel or resort by any means. It was clean and bright and had a huge bouquet of flowers on the desk. Marble floors. We were let down a large hall which also for heels on marble was quite loud. Everday we could hear peoples conversations and everyone who walked down this large marble hallway, it echoed but was quite quiet when no one was around. We heard one night office guy hacking coughing all night long and water run down the pipes outside. We couldn't sleep very well, and the pillows reminded me of cinder blocks, the beds as hard as rocks. They also had no idea what a facecloth is. They handed me bathtowels every time I tried to motion to wash my face. Regardless of this, the staff and owner tried to serve us whatever we needed and the gentleman was very excellent with ideas and helpfulness in getting around was also useful. It is quaint, their breakfast nook, seats about 4 tables, so you ate with similar people in a small room, which was a tad uncomfortable at first, but got easier as the people were all very friendly, and the breakfast was a minimal continental breakfast but fresh. I have only stayed in luxury resorts and hotels but tried this one. The only other downfall, is that they claimed they never receieved my fax that our flight was rescheduled, and asked me if I brought the fax confirmation number..they said no fax came through so they charged me for that extra night with no negotiating and the cab they ordered for us. So that also was a bit distasteful I thought, and since we stayed there 4 more days and paid cash, I'd think there's something that could have been done there to make me a happy customer.

So many had negative comments. That was until I found the Residenza Cellini. Having booked a similar property ( no bar or restaurant ) in Venice and being suitably impressed ( If you can't find a bar or restaurant in Rome / Venice then you need serious help ) I contacted the hotel. From our first contact to our departure the whole experience was a delight. The hotel now covers the third and fifth floor of a multi occupancy building, having just opened five rooms and a roof terrace on the fifth floor, with access by stairs for the fit or a 'quaint' lift that holds three. We were on the fifth floor. The room was beautifully furnished, the bathroom too was quality although, to be fair, a bit long and narrow. Our friends had a square bathroom which was a better shape. But you can only use the space that you have to the best advantage. The hotel supplied us, on request, with a bottle or two of wine each evening which we drank on the terrace. Although it is not yet complete it did not detract from the pleasant experience. What is more, and this applied to the mini bar items, they charged very reasonable prices. Not out to fleece the punters as many hotels try to do. The breakfast was more than adequate to set you up for the day although now the hotel has doubled it's accommodation, from 6 rooms to 11, we could see potential problems if all the guests descended at once but It didn't happen to us. Our bed linen, cool and fresh, was changed after two nights. All the staff were delightful and out to please without being overbearing. As mentioned the hotel is in a multi occupancy building, Via Modena being just off the Via Nazionale and close to most major attractions. We walked either to or from most, using the Red tour bus to hop on and off ( you will need the right change as they will not give you any if you don't tender the right amount ) or taxis which we found very reasonable. I can't post any photos as I had my camera lifted from my shoulder bag as we arrived. To be fair I had left it by the lift on the gound floor but when it was returned, some ten minutes later, it was minus the camera. Can't blame the hotel for that, my own stupidity but it did make us aware throughout our visit of the possibilities. Everyone is entitled to a viewpoint but I feel saddened at the review by SeattleTravelDiva. I can understand being upset and marking the hotel down in a particular area but to be negative and not acknowledge all the good things about this hotel is just not cricket as we Brits say.

The bedrooms are very traditional although large but the stylish bathrooms very up-to-date with bidet and Jacuzzi, everywhere was exceptionally clean. The room had a new flat screen TV with sky box with english speaking stations such as CNN and sky news available. Of an evening a laptop connected to broadband internet was made readily available in the dining room at no charge which was invaluable for checking in our return flights and my daughter keeping in touch via msn (could they survive without MSN?) fruit and sweets were always on offer in the hall. Breakfast was open from 6:30 to 11:00 for late risers with a good selection of freshly squeezed juices, rolls, meats, cheeses and pastries, we ate around 10'ish and found this was sufficient until our evening meal, suplemented by a coffee or two throughout the day. The hotel is well situated, we walked to the vatican, colosseum, trevi fountain, spanish steps etc, only taking a bus to the catacombes which are too far. Walking is really advised, the streets are narrow and behind every turn is a treasure, there seems to be no restrictions at each venue and no problems taking photos, many venues are free. Don't miss visiting the 17th century church Chiesa di Santa Maria della Concezzione in the street Via Vittoria just a few streets from the hotel, take the main stairs to the right to the crypt (no charge but make a donation) the Capuchin monks used the bones from 4,000 of their departed brothers to decorate the walls, why didn't t they bury them very bizarre, loved to have been at that brain storming session!! Recommend you take guided tours wherever possible we did'nt for the vatican and missed out, however we did for the coloseum and the catacombes, we used Roamaround tours who are located at the exit to the coloseum (they hold up blue signs), Elaine in particular was amazing for the catacombe tour, not just a guide but she is studying roman archaeology and added so much more than we could have got from a guide book, we have no experience of other tours so can't compare. Restaraunts are reasonably basic we never found a particularly good one, we found the portions very variable from generous to meagre, advise if you find a good one then stick with it. The hotel staff are fantastic, accomodating without being overpowering, and speak english well, always happy to give directions, make reccomendations or arrangements. Unfortunatly they could only accomodate us for four days of our six day holiday and for the remaining two days we stayed at another hotel which was \u00a3100 per night more expensive, but no better in any respect, this hotel really does represent very good value for money.

We could not find anything to fault about our room, the staff or the location of this hotel. It could be described as bed and breakfast accommodation rather than a hotel however it is more like staying with close friends who cannot do enough for you. I have been very fortunate in having the opportunity to stay in hotels all over the world from luxury in Barbados to not quite so luxurious in London, and the staff in the Residenza Cellini have to rate as the most pleasant I have ever met. The hotel is located about 10 mins walk from Termini station and a few hundred yards from the metro. We got a shuttle bus there on our first day which took approximately 25mins from Ciampino Airport and cost 30euro for the two of us. (I would advise not to join the long queue for the TerraVision Bus recommended by EasyJet. If you leave through the main arrivals door and turn left you will see another bus stop with slightly cheaper direct services to Termini.) We arrived at the hotel at 1pm and received excellent information from George on reception as to where we should go for lunch. He rang ahead to make a reservation for us which meant we were treated to free glasses of champagne on arrival!! The food was also delicious \u2013 there are lots of other places near at hand to eat although we only ate at restaurants recommended by the Cellini staff. The hotel is ideally placed for sightseeing. You can either get the metro to local sites or do as we did and walk everywhere. We are not usually so energetic but the weather was really nice and it was just lovely to walk through Rome with nothing else to do but sightsee and haggle with the on-street traders. As stated by another reviewer, it was great to come back and relax in the Jacuzzi bath \u2013 pure heaven. The room did not have tea or coffee making facilities however George told us that he wouldn\u2019t mind making this for us anytime we wanted it. The hotel is entirely on the third floor of the building and is unbelievably quiet considering its location; we were neither disturbed by guests inside or people and traffic outside. It was our wedding anniversary when we were there and we were surprised when we were presented with a lovely bottle of Asti served on a silver tray with accompanying ice bucket and lovely glasses. Our daughter told us on our return that she had asked the hotel to organise this for us and that they had insisted they would do so free of charge! Breakfast in the morning was continental and included cereal, juices, croissants, Danish and other types of pastry, different breads, cold meats, cheeses and fruit. While it is served in the breakfast room, my husband encountered no difficulties whatsoever obtaining a tray to bring me breakfast in bed on a particularly lazy morning. The cappuccino was also delicious! We booked the hotel directly with them and received a special rate as we were willing to pay in cash rather than credit card. Other \u201ccheap\u201d booking sites had said that there was no availability at the time of booking so it is worthwhile contacting the hotel directly and the rate was in fact cheaper than that offered elsewhere.

The rooms are anice size but are two twin beds pushed together and my husband and I got got tired of that crease.... The bathrooms ar enice..Towel warmers broken but the offered us a free bottle of champagne... It was Martini and Ross.. WHich was nice with some almond cookies I hated.. But it was a nice gesture.. There is no view from the room and a little bit hard to find on our own... The front desk which is Georges and two girls were nice but the would not always communicate with each other about our needs for the reservations to certain museums and as a result we did not get to the Accademia Galleria and another... You need to make sure you check up on them because they change shifts and different museums are closed on weird days and although they will make the reservation for you... You need to make sure that the days you are there do not overlap with the days they are open.... The room was cleaned daily and there was a really nice LCD television but he decor was tasteful and the room was immaculately clean... The breakfast was the same as all the other hotels we went to in italy, some emat and cheeses with breab, juices, coffee, and cereal... We got tired of that by then and just went out because it was our seven day in Italy...All the hotels we stayyed in supplied breakfasts... Overall well priced....for the area your are in..there is lots of shooping nearby.... The best Gelato was at Gellateria....We tried some thing in the RIck Steves book that the front desk let us borrow..they weren't all winners....", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Res.

We were not disappointed. At first it is a little unusual as the property is actually on the 3rd floor of 5 via Modena. It is accessed via the large door on the street level. The street is a 'back street' which runs parallel with Via National' and the street isn\u2019t the nicest you've ever seen, but it is down town in a 2000 year old city! You ring up to Cellini via an intercom and by virtue of the fact that it is on level 3 there is no one at the front door so to speak. However once you travel up to level 3 via the tiny wee elevator which has been inserted in the stair well, the welcome could not be warmer. In a word 'awesome'. We stayed in room 5 or 6 (I think?) It was a junior suite. Special cash rate was offered and was a very fair price for the room. The room was really large for accommodation in Rome. The standard of cleanliness was excellent. The room was equipped with lovely classic furniture and was very well presented. The bathroom was large and included a Jacuzzi bathtub. Towels were white, fluffy and fresh. TV was great with full cable and a plethora of channels including bbc and cnn as well as sports channels. The room had excellent A/C and a mini bar and a small safe for valuables etc. It was really quiet too. The people who own the business and those who worked there all had great people skills and a real sense of pride about their place, and so they should. From what we have seen in 5 trips to Europe it is one of the best if not the best place we have stayed in terms of value, friendliness, proximity and cleanliness. The staff were so lovely and helpful, they could not have made my wife and I feel more at home and welcome. Peter and George are both really generous souls. They were so accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. We certainly felt that they were totally trustworthy. The family who run the business were fantastic with care and attention to every detail and were more than happy to chat about life in general, travel etc, etc. I really love Rome as a city to visit as it is so vibrant and there is a coolness about Romans and 2000 years of history which you can touch and see. We will be back for sure and Cellini will be where we will stay. It is the perfect home away from home and oasis. A word of warning - get an official taxi if you come via the Termini (train station).

I spent 5 nights there, returning on 6th May and had a really great time. Being very critical, I would say that rooms 1,2 & 3 suffer from street noise (lots of road sweepers, bin men and quite a lot of traffic sound (one night it sounded like a disco!)) and 1 & 2 can hear the reception clearly and the breakfast room. I'm a light sleeper and if I hadn't had ear plugs and been tired, I would have struggled to sleep. I would ask for rooms 5 or 6 if this bothers you. I also thought it was quite expensive to be honest and the breakfast got repetitive. Also the jacuzzi bath is a standard size and although it CAN fit two, its not the most comfortable thing :). Oh and it had no tea making facilities which might be normal in Italy, but seemed odd. That said, the service was terrific, they even gave us ice buckets and glasses when we brought some chilled wine back from a walk, with some little cakes because we had to wait a couple of minutes. The coffee was probably the best I had in Rome and their restaurant recommendations were great (and like I say, I'm very picky). The place was a little hard to find at first (its by the \"hotel\" light, but the name of another hotel is far clearer on the door) but its location was very good. We walked everywhere and could be at the vatican in 40 minutes. The jacuzzi was great to restore flagging muscles. So overall, fantastic service, some nice guests staying, very clean etc rooms, a bit pricey, a little (imho) noisey and I got sick of the \"samey\" breakfast after a while. Next time I'll find a quiet and far cheaper b&b, but it was a nice memory.

If you are looking for a quiet, clean, elegantly furnished, comfortable and spacious room (even by American standards) with very well appointed private bathroom, then look no farther.

The English speaking Owners (family) and staff of this wonderful 6 room hotel are extremely attentive, courteous and informative. Whether asking for directions, restaurants, sightseeing, trains, buses, drivers, scheduled events, or perhaps just a simple cup of coffee; Barbara, Donato, Gaetano (the owners) and Pietro are patient and insistent that you be well taken care of. A European breakfast awaits you each morning. Meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, cereal, yogurt, fruit and juices are delightful and very substantial. The coffee is made to your individual taste. The location is excellent, one block off the Plaza Republic on a quite side street (Via Modena) near the Ministry of Defense. Well within walking distance to public transportation, trains, churches, museums, restaurants and most of the major attractions.
