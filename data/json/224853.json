First, the room rate is less than what you pay on the strip, sometimes alot less, depending on how you book your room. Second, the rooms are all huge. They have either a king or two doubles, a large sitting area with a pull-out couch, an easy chair, and a coffee table. There is plenty of room for entertaining. Finally, there is a little kitchen area with a refrigerator, a sink, and a table. One of our group requested and received a microwave. There is also a safe (don't forget your combination!). The bathroom has a tub and a separate shower stall and two sinks. They are in the process of refreshing the rooms. Ours was freshly painted, and we saw the staff doing other rooms (new paint, carpet, and furniture). The only disappointment was the TV- it was an old CRT type and the channel selection was sparse. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem since I do not go to Vegas to watch TV, but we were there for the basketball tournament. The property is laid out as a number of separate buildings. Each is all smoking or non-smoking. There is a nice pool area (not huge). One of the things we really enjoyed about this hotel is there are plenty of places to site outside in peace. It is not as hectic as other Vegas hotels. If you want hectic, you are a good walk from the center of the strip. We walked down and back many times. If you want to take a cab, its less than ten dolars. There are three restaurants-Marilyn's Cafe, good diner type food. nothing special, but consistently dependable, and relatively cheap. The Cantina-Mexican fare- not good, don't eat there. Tuscany Gardens- Dinner Restaurant with an Italian theme. We all enjoyed it. If you are a foodie and in Vegas, there are obviously better choices, but food here is well prepared and presented. I recommend the Antipasto appetizer (enough for two) and the chicken and eggplant dish. Entrees run mostly from twenty to thirty-five dollars. Join the Players club and get the discount. Now for the gambling: The good- the table games offer low minimums, even during peak times. The Craps table had a three dollar minimum during the day, and five in the evening. Blackjck was almost always five dollars- and it still pays 3 to 2 for blackjack. It is now 6 to 5 on the strip. There are plenty of slots with a good selection, video poker with average payouts, and a sportsbook. The bad- one craps table, three blackjack tables and one roulette wheel. We couldn't get a seat at times. Its not the Bellagio or Aria, but is a good value.

The pool area is very nice and peaceful, no swim up bars, or party crowd. It is not as opulent as some of the more popular places on the Strip, but it is a good, quality hotel for a reasonable price. My only complaints - in the \"kitchenette\" area - there was no microwave or way to reheat food, and there was a coffeemaker, but no pot (??).

Breakfasts huge choice in Marilyns cafe not to mention portion size too, and the ribs were immense at supper time, best sauce ever, our waiter James was a darling, he has the unenviable job of working 11pm till 6 yet I think hes kept busy, this place never sleeps, well it is part of the casino after all. We didnt get to try the Italian so must return for that, also highly recommended. If its your first time visiting Vegas you probably want to stay on the strip, I did but never again, this was our 3rd visit to Vegas and it just gets better, this place is one of the reasons why and its less than 10mins stroll to Ballys where you can get the shutlle, this currently costs $5 for a single trip we went up to MGM and spent a few hours in the surrounding area, when we decided to come back we went to the door at the MGM and got ourselves a taxi, right back to the door of the Tuscany $6.70 so maybe better deal sometimes to travel by taxi, or even limo, the Tuscany has a limo so just negotiate with the driver a price, we paid $20 to the Bellagio. Opposite the hotel is Lawrys a very good steak house, not cheap. Further down Flamingo if you go in the other direction there are plently other places of interest to eat, we liked the Brazilian place Bahama Breeze, also there is a PF Chang and the Hard Rock Hotel is also a 10 min stroll, no hustle like on the strip if you feel like a bit of peace.

We asked if they could waive the fee for internet use in our room and they said that they could not. Interestingly, they told us that any hotel with a casino on the property had to charge the fee. This was due to some contract agreement with the local internet service provider who had a monopoly over ISP in Las Vegas. I don\u2019t know if this is true, but when I have stayed at a hotel that did not have a casino on the premises, I received free WiFi in my room. The exercise room is very spacious and has six treadmills, extensive universal and free weights and an outdoor lap pool. The food at Marilyn\u2019s Cafe (on-site 24 hour restaurant) is inexpensive (especially if you use the coupons) and very good. We had several of our best meals there. On the weekend we stayed, a live band was playing at the bar and it was packed with many people dancing. Looked like fun. The crowd was older (40+) and the hotel does cater to a mature clientele, which contributes to the low noise level at the hotel. We didn\u2019t play much at their casino, but never had any real luck there. We did hit it big on a slot machine, but that was about 5 years ago. The strip is about 2 \u00bd blocks away. We rented a car because we wanted to visit downtown and other off-the-strip casinos. Overall, it is hard to think of a reason not to return to the Tuscany Hotel, even though we have received offers for free rooms from other hotels. The rooms are quiet, comfortable, clean and spacious, it is great to park your car close to your hotel room and not walk miles to your room and there is a great restaurant within walking distance.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "tepaea07", "Title": "\u201cGreat escape\u201d", "Author": "tepaea07", "ReviewID": "UR125428041", "Content": "Me and a friend staued here for 9 nights and we found the room to be quite spacious and tidy.

The hotel is not so large and is made up of several 3-story buldings located in very attractive landscaping. This gives the hotel a sense of calmness in almost a rural atmosphere. The main lobby is separated from the casino, so one could stay here without even approaching the girating noise of the casino. The room was extremely large and my building was a 3-5minute walk from the main building housing the restaurants. It had a sofa bed and armchair in the sitting area and a small kitchenette. But the latter was not very practical since, although they provide a electric cooker there are no cooking utensils! I mentioned this drawback to the reception and they will provide a microwave on request. However, there is really no need to bother with self catering. Marilyn's restaurant serves an expansive choice of menues 24 hrs. But I did find the ambience of this restaurant rather downbeat and more like a cafeteria/canteen. The Italian restaurant is open evenings and I found that very good, in quiet and sophisticated surroundings. There is a good fitness center with an exercise pool. Unfortunately the main pool and garden were closed for maintenance works. But this would be a delightful spot when it reopens. I found the ubiquitous 'resort fee' a bit unnecessary - just a way of these hotels making an extra buck but prividing little for it. They did say that it goes towards the provision of the fitness center and free wifi in the public areas of the hotel (lobby, Piazza Lounge, cafe, upstairs banqueting areas).

We wanted someplace specifically off the strip for 2 nights over Thanksgiving, as we were just in Las Vegas before heading to Death Valley and didn't want to deal with holiday crowds on the strip. The hotel is in a converted apartment complex, so there are a few buildings with the hotel rooms scattered about the property. They are all connected via sidewalks. The main complex has the casino, check in, a bar/lounge, an Italian restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a coffee shop, and a small coffee bar and small gift shop. The rooms are good sized. We just had one of the basic rooms, and it had a kitchenette with a mini-fridge, a coffee maker, a table and chairs, a kitchen sink. There was not a microwave, nor any type of dishes. These are not advertised as being in the room, so not a problem - just letting people know what is / is not there. There was a couch, chair, and coffee table. A dresser with a TV that could be swivelled towards the sitting area or the bed. We had a king room. The bathroom was good sized, but a little dark. There's a tub and separate walk in shower. The shower did not have a light, and looked like it may have been built into what was once a closet, so it was a bit dark in the shower. I did not find the walk from the casino to the hotel rooms to be bad. It only took a few minutes. If you have any mobility issues - you may want to ask for a building close to the casino. However, you can park right outside your building, which is nice. The casino is decent sized - not huge, but large enough, with a good selection of table games, slots, and video poker. The walk up Flamingo to the strip, while not far, seems a bit dicey, so I would not recommend that, especially at night. We did not use the fitness center or the pool, but took a look for reference. The fitness center is pretty nice. It was roomy and had good quality machines. There is also an exercise pool for swimming laps separate from the recreational pool. The hotel does charge a service fee, in addition to the room rate. The fee included (among other things) coupons $20 off the Italian restaurant, and a buy one-get one free for the Mexican restaurant or coffee shop. If you use these, it compensates for the service fee. The Italian restaurant (Think it was called Tuscany Gardens) was really good. We stayed here because we just wanted somewhere inexpensive, as we flew in Wednesday before Thanksgiving, did a Turkey Trot 14K run on Thursday, then left early Friday to go to Death Valley. It met the needs for that perfectly. If your vacation is meant to center around the strip and casino hopping - I would not choose to stay here. But, if you are in town for some other purpose, but want to have a casino resort type place to stay - it was definately good for that.

I love the off strip location and the convenience of a nice hotel with easy in/out access. Tuscany is a great alternative to the mega-resorts in LV and the rooms are very very big. Getting on/off the strip, well, you can face gridlock real fast. If you plan to remain at your hotel the whole time, go ahead & stay on the strip. Otherwise, if you like to get out of the hotel zone and see other things, you'll appreciate the freedom being off-strip. Or, if you're staying in LV on business carrying items to and from the convention center, for example, its hard to beat. Strip is a stones throw away. This time I wanted to focus on Tuscany's upkeep of the property. On the first morning at 6:30 am, I saw three painters waiting outside my building. This property is definately being maintained well, its still in great shape. Tuscany deserves some credit for this. Compared to last year's stay there, I think my room had new carpet too. Otherwise, my room was very clean, I even wiped some of the ledges and such, no dust. Each day, my room was maintained very well, they get 5 stars here. Otherwise, my group ate at Tuscany Gardens 2 out of the 4 nights. Tuscany Gardens restaurant is a gem. Seriously, over the past 7 years, I've had the Sea Bass there probably 6 times, incredible, melts in your mouth. This visit, I had a piece of Halibut, might have been the best Halibut I've ever had. I don't know if the typical guest just walks past this restaurant, but if they do, their missing a great meal. In this area, Tuscany deserves more credit. In my group, we have the same 4 people returning there, every November. We all agreed that Tuscany Gardens is a fantastic restaurant and they deserve credit for maintaining the integrity of the dishes and service. In the casino, I hate to say, the table games seem very difficult. If you're a gambler, I don't know what's going on there, but I've never had good luck. After so many years staying/gambling, the dealers/pit boss' seem crabby, so we like to go elsewhere most of the time. Lastly, I usually give 4 stars to Tuscany because of the value, great convenience off/strip, good condition of the property and good food. But I can't this time because my assistant saw a bug in her room. In the 10 or 11 times I've stayed here, I've never seen a bug. And Tuscany is maintaining the property very well. So, I think if there was ever a problem, they would take care of it. Anyways, these days I will reserve 5 stars for the truly luxurious and incredible properties. I would give 4, but have to ding them for the bug. Tuscany over the long haul always has great rates, in my book they're a consistent 4 star.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of the Tuscany based on the VERY inexpensive price per night. I honestly thought it might be a dive. I was very pleasantly surprised when I checked in. Friendly lobby staff, great location and my room was super clean and very large with a small kitchenette, sofa and comfortable king-sized bed. I stayed in building \"L\" which is one of the furthest from the casino and restaurants. I couldn't believe I was in Las Vegas - the entire place is very quiet overall (noisy upstairs neighbor one night) and I enjoyed the walk to the strip which about 10-12 minutes away. There are two gas stations nearby which were perfect for picking up inexpensive snacks and bottles of soda and water - something that's hard to come by when you stay on the strip. I did travel by myself that trip and I was a LITTLE bit uncomfortable making the walk from the strip back to the Tuscany after dark. I recommend taking a cab from the strip after dark. The only drawback of the Tuscany was the fact that cabs are not always sitting out front - the bell captain often has to call one which can take some time. I stayed there again this month - this time I happily booked it and was rewarded with an upgraded newly renovated room that overlooked the pool. Furnishings were all new including a perfectly sized flat screen TV and a very comfortable sofa and chair. I was a happy camper. The casino is small but adequate. The restaurants are great - Marilyn's Cafe is open 24/7 and food is served quickly. They have daily breakfast specials ($6.99 for a steak/egg/pancake/home fries or $3.99 for unlimited pancakes) and nightly dinner specials that were pretty decent. The Italian restaurant was also pretty good but a little more expensive. If you're up for something a little more upscale, Lawry's Steakhouse is right across the street - a 2 minute walk. Tip: Use your coupons that they give you at check-in. I saved quite a bit of money on already well-priced food.

It is a huge place. With lots of buildings, and lots of plants and small gardens. The main building \u2013 hotel lobby, restaurants and Casino with outside gardens and fountains is built along Flamingo Road. Behind these buildings are the hotel buildings, 3 floors high and with inside corridors. It is a bit difficult in the dark, when you just arrived, to find the right building, the map I got was a bit confusing for me. They have valet parking and self parking in front of the hotel for casino and hotel guests. And there is spacious parking behind the main building for the hotel guests as well, closer to their rooms. If you are looking for a quiet room, ask for 3rd floor rooms, in the middle of the corridor, cause on the one side is the elevator and on the other the stairs with door, that might be slammed. Right in the middle it was perfect. The Suites-room is spacious, no dividing walls. When you walk in you have the kitchen right on the one side of the entrance door. In my room I had a fridge but nothing else, no oven or microwave. Perhaps you have to rent it extra? There is a big dining table and 4 chairs. Adjacent to a huge sofa and sofachair. TV was no flat one. Kingbed was very comfortable with good matrasses and down blanket. Besides the bed is a built-in-cabinet for the clothes, with a safe inside. And a big mirror. In the bathroom shower and tub is extra, toilet is in an extra room. You will find fine italian toiletries provide, and lots of towels. 3 of 4 days my telephoneline was dead... I mentioned that the phones (you get 2 per room) were dead right when I arrived. Staff promised to repair it the next day, but it took a longer time to get it fixed. This should make me take one star off the review... The pool area of Tuscany Hotel is beautiful nice garden setting, with heated pool and deckchairs, and a jaccuzzi of course. Right beside the pool is the back entrance to the lobby and a cafe. You can sit outside when the weather is permitting, and sip your coffee. This area around the pool was very inviting and I liked that part of the hotel so much. Internet is not free in the rooms, but in the lobby. Though it was a bit weak it worked out ok. In the hotel you find 2 very good restaurants. An italian and a mexican one. You even receive 2 for one entree coupons when you arrive. The casino is spacious though not too big. The whole place is not that hectic as hotels on the Strip. Check in had been very fast, you can do self-check-out over the TV. The staff at front desk \u2013 especially Greg \u2013 was very nice and helpful. But even they did not manage that my phones in the room worked. I will make this place number 1 for my future stays in Vegas. Depending on the rates of course. I had got a very low rate through a booking web site, it was cheaper than the hotels web site. You will find a daily resort fee to be paid, which is around 15 dollars a day extra. It includes some coupons, free local calls.

Not so here. I researched this property, based on the guidelines for a group. All information provided ahead of time was right on. Individually and collectively all our group members were very favorably pleased with our stay. I arrived mid/late evening and was warmly greeted and checked in without any problems. I knew in advance about the \"security deposit\" that would be held - either by cc or cash - for the duration of my stay. I was aware of the \"resorts fee\" added per night and the additional fee's for wifi. Always ask.... \"what else should I know about this (any) property, that I don't know about now? Will there be any unexpected surprises? Informed as a traveller to be enables you to assess whether or not the property is a good match for you. My room was on the ground floor, facing into the pool area, with a small patio, and at the end of the building. The room was spacious, clean, without strange smells, odors, or coverup perfumes. Full closet, with hangers, iron and a small safe - which in order to use requires a $25.00 deposit. It is located near the floor, so anyone with physical constraints or unflexible mobility, will grumble to use if they need it. Bathroom, clean, and appointed with all the right ammenities. Wonderful shampoo here too! There are numerous lamps and wall lighting throughout the room. My room was missing a couple lightbulbs - probably not replaced in a while- but I didn't spend lots of time in my room reading either - so really wouldn't have missed them if I hadn't looked. The a/c unit was louder than I prefer, but certainly worked well and I would have been unhappy without it on those 90 + days. A small bar sink, refrig and coffeemaker also made the room a great bargain. All coffee services provided these days at mid range ish priced properties are awful - a pitiful packet of coffee etc... I plan accordingly and bring my own! Coffee, filters, and sugar and with a refrig, milk or half/half etc. Suits me well and I don't have to race anywhere for my first cup! I was pleased at the relative quietness of the room given its proximity to the pool. I did hear outside noises, but minimal and not invasive. If I left the door/window open - facing the pool area I could certainly hear all the pool activity. Acceptable, even with kids. the layout of the buildings - numerous, 3 level garden style buildings - allows for pleasant walking throughout the property. Parking for cars is convenient too. The public areas, lobby, walkways to restuarants etc were also clean, and well lit. Nothing extravagant, nor shabby either. Upon my arrival, several of us noticed a very pungent unpleasant smell - outside a section of our (G) building and slightly behind the restuarant - it disappeared within a day or so, either the trash not being picked up issue, or perhaps a lawn/plant feeding emulsion..... otherwise the exterior grounds were very nice and well attended. The bar area was lively in the evening, with a decent band and plenty of activity. The restuarants were busy, and the food and service as expected. Pricing seems to be in line with other similar types of locations and the coupons - given at check in from the hotel - allowed for some pricing discounts that we managed to take advantage of and were appreciated. In addition to the large pool area - a smaller lap pool was available thru the fitness center. Clean, towels provided and quiet and tucked away from the road as well. The finess center had numerous machines and equipment just awaiting use. It was also staffed and had a small massage facility. This building also appeared clean, without unwelcome odors. Room key cards required for controlled access. About a 10 -15 minute walk from the strip - depending on the time of day and traffic to cross the streets. IF I have any negative comments here - here they are - the sidewalks as you walk to/from the strip are narrow for 3 or more abreast to walk. The sidewalks and streets are filthy, littered with an amazing assortment of trash and broken glass - and yet when you get adjacent to the strip - clean and almost pristine. Numerous types of folk walking or waiting for the bus along this section, but I walked it in a group during the day and even alone late at night - without personal trepidation or fear. Perhaps this will be addressed by the city - I'm not certain the hotel can specifically do much about it for now. On a closing note, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again - if I were returning to 'vegas: the staff was friendly and helpful and not intrusive. Since I researched the location ahead of time I had the opportunity to talk with hotel personnel, and they too were pleasant and helpful. Others in my group were pleased with their \"casino\" experience at the hotel. I fully appreciated the quiet and low key atmosphere of the property day and night. There were guests of all ages and with kids, so the appeal for this type of property, close to the strip but not in the midst of it all is a welcome change - even if not especially in Las Vegas!

The value for this hotel was excellent and as we wanted to avoid the \"walk of shame\" back to our rooms through a casino hotel on the Strip this was the perfect option. Tuscany is a large property made up of over 6 buildings with multiple parking lots so you're never parked far from your building. The location of the hotel is convenient to the Strip, though you're not on it; it would take about 10 minutes to walk to the Strip. It's a very clean, well maintained property, so much so that you'll be surprised at the relatively low rates. On site there is a small market that's got a great variety of products including snacks, drinks, collectibles and toiletries. I was really impressed with the gym and lap pool. There are also laundry facilities on site so you don't have to deal with exorbitant hotel laundry charges. The rooms are large. After all, they are suites. If you request it at check-in they will provide you with a microwave free of charge. As some have mentioned, the TVs are the old large boxes (CRTs). In the bathroom you get both a stand-up shower and a bathtub. Just 2 negative comments to make. Wifi in the room is expensive at $14 per day; I just got a prepaid microsim for my iPad from AT&T, which will cost you $15 or $25 for 1 month.

Overall, I think the Tuscany is extremely good value for money. It's very clean, the rooms are massive, the beds are comfortable. In addition, due to its off strip location the attached casino is very well priced - drinks are less than half the price they are on the strip, food is cheaper and table minimums are less. If you plonk yourself at the bar and put a small amount of cash into the video poker machine and make a token effort to play, your drinks get comped down to $1.25 each or less - try getting that deal in the Bellagio. Very nice pool, very nice gym (including a separate lap pool). Nice well kept grounds - there really is a lot to like about this place. Downsides - my room was next to the elevator and you can hear a hum when it goes up and down. Not obnoxiously so, but still, I'd advise asking for a room away from the elevator....this being Vegas the thing is up and down all hours of the night. Other slight downside as mentioned by many is that the staff are generally a grumpy old bunch, both in the casino and the front desk. Again nothing to really get hung up about considering the value of the place. I see in these reviews some complaints about the resort fee. It is pretty well advertised on the website, so really people ought to know about it before they go. Even with the fee the room rate is still very competitive. All the big fancy hotels also have resort fees, often much than the $14 here. Another complaint I can see reading these reviews is that some people are complaining about the distance from the strip.....c'mon, really? In this day of google maps you should know exactly how far it is and if you are too lazy/disorganized to walk/use the bus, they pay 4x the price and stay on the strip. A tip - if you walk briskly, it takes about 5 minutes to get to Ballys, you can then go inside and walk rest of the way to the strip inside the casino (i.e. out of the hot sun, in the the air con and with the moving walkways etc).", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "PatriciaBec", "ReviewID": "UR118572361", "Content": "We booked our room directly 1/2 hour before arrival.

There's a safe in the room. A coffee maker (no decaf for those who don't like to get wired, though). Wi-Fi only available for free in lobby, otherwise is $13.99/day (insane). There is a fitness center which is quite large but doesn't use much of the space. There are weights up to 50 pounds, a \"lap pool\" which is only about the size of one lane (outdoors), and some machines that are decent. Only one treadmill works of the two they have, so you may not be able to get your run in during the summer when you want to run indoors, unless you wait a bit. (4/5) Service: The set-up for check-in is a bit cumbersome. The area is small and this place can get quite busy, so you end up standing in an area that is inundated with people and their luggage. (4/5) Value: This place is a tremendous value and is highly suggested to all. Short trip to the Strip if you want to go there, but this place has it all.

I needed an inexpensive, large place for my family with a pool. We had already been in Vegas for 3 days earlier in our trip, so we we fine being off the strip. This place was fine for our needs. The front desk staff was good. The lobby was pretty, but filled with smokers (I hate smoke, and have allergies and asthma, and I realize Vegas is not smoke free...) The room was huge, but the furniture was a bit dated (the wood looked like it should have been in a cabin). No sofa bed, no free breakfast. Clean carpet. The bathroom was also huge, clean and new. Very nice. The kitchen is more of a wet bar. Sink and mini fridge and that's it. (We had earlier stayed at the Desert Rose, which had a fully stocked kitchen with a stove, full sized fridge, dishwasher and dinner ware, etc. They also have a big free breakfast). The casino is really depressing (we don't gamble). It's attached to at least 1 of the restaurants and the smoke wafts into the dining area. The food is ok, eating there once with the pizza coupom (BOGO), was fine. The waitress was horrible. The pool is nice and very clean. They provide plenty of towels. A waitress comes by to take drink and food orders. Lots of drinking going on but no one was obnoxious. For me, the crowd was a bit odd in that 80% of the group were smokers and covered in tattoos. I heard one person at the pool say \"I've never seen so many people smoking in a pool\" that about sums it up. For one night, I'd have been ok with the place. But we soon found out that our flight was cancelled due to Irene. Long story short, we ended up staying until Tuesday, which was not in our plans or budget. We were able to get additional nights on Hotwire for $30 a night, plus the $13 resort fee. A great deal for a huge room and pool access. But... as I got to spend more time here, I got a weird vibe. The place seems abandoned in some way. The lobby is dead. The place has no atmosphere, althought the lobby, pool area, patios, and plantings are beautiful. They have a bar and a band, but again, dead. I think people stay there for the rate, and that's it. There place has no personality. That just struck me as odd.

Unfortunately the homecoming got off to a bit of a rocky start when my lady, who arrived a couple days early this time, found the bed to sag considerably on one side. After I arrived, we called housekeeping who replaced the bed with a brand new mattress and box spring. A later request to install an optional microwave was handled with enthusiasm if not quite efficiency as it turned out the first micro they brought in did not work. The only other complaint I would have about the room involves the AC unit. When it was on, it took off like a jet as it drowned out the TV and any easy conversation. When it stopped, the cooling effect seemed to disappear almost as quickly as the previous noise. However, we didn\u2019t bring up our concern until the end as we liked our location and figured our options to move during a busy convention would be few. Other than that, the customer service of which we had grown fond continued to be good, especially in the restaurants. The manager at Marilyn\u2019s Caf\u00e9 seemed to take a special interest, stopping by each patron\u2019s table to ask how they were enjoying the meal. Our two meals at the Tuscany Gardens were enjoyable and filling. We wish we stopped by the Cantina earlier than our last night as we had *way* too many leftovers! The pool area, while small by Vegas standards, continued to work for us although I think their system might have been overwhelmed by the number of convention guests. It seemed hard to keep the by-product of suntan lotion and such filtered through. It also seemed easy for pools of water to develop along the cement walkway which was a bit of a concern. The servers were friendly. The new cabana is a relatively affordable option although they might do better to add a couple more so it doesn\u2019t stand out as much. We didn\u2019t spend much time in the casino although on one occasion, after receiving $10 in free slot play, my lady spent $5 before winning over $100. As her \u201caccountant\u201d, I advised her to cash out immediately! LOL There are certainly more extravagant, lively and convenient hotels in Vegas.

I really wasn't looking to \"party\" on the Strip, and the reviews of the Tuscany saying it was quiet, etc., sounded appealing. Check in was a breeze. Granted I checked in late at night (11pm) but there was no line and I walked right up to the counter and was treated wonderfully by Juan. Found my room OK in the dark (it's a big resort) and was amazed when I walked in. HUGE ROOM! Bigger than my first studio apt in Chicago. Great kitchenette (that I never used but would be great for extended stay). Comfy King bed. Chair and sofa (that may have been a sleeper). AC worked great (though a bit loud, my only minor gripe). Great big, modern bathroom. CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN. Super quiet--thought I was the only person in that building until I actually saw people on the 2nd day in the elevator. Didn't have a car but there was ample parking. Toiletries provided (but no body soap). Alarm clock. Great pool area. Casino was fun and had good staff. Only ate at the cafe and it was good. Poolside drink service from Cheryl was great. Price was great. THE WALK-literally only 10-15 mins to the Strip. Actually took me more time to get from Bally's to the Venetian than it did to get from The Tuscany to Bally's. Safe walk, lots of traffic, other people walking to the hotel, etc. Being \"off-strip\" was not at all a hinderance to me as it is so close. Free wi-fi in the lobby and business center-had to pay $3 to use their comp to print my boarding pass. When I went to check out there was a HUGE line, but I only waited about 5-10 mins (I'm the most impatient person with this stuff, and it didn't bug me in the least). An aside about front-desk service-I happened to be using the wi-fi in the lobby when an awful, belligerant man was giving the woman a hard time, and thought she handled it magnificently (Tracy maybe?) Bellmen kept my bag until I left for the airport and then got me a cab. Oh--yes, there is a $13/day resort fee. If you somehow missed this when booking the hotel, that is your own fault as it was made very clear numerous times. They charge this at check-out. And for the TV complainers, it's not a flat screen LCD, but if you care about this when you're traveling, I'm not sure what to say. Good service all around, awesome hotel, gorgeous pool area.

The crowd here is not your typical vacationing families or couples. I will just say that this isn't an \"educated\" crowd or a demographic that is known for safety.

Located a short distance off the Las Vegas strip, the hotel has a small (compared to Las Vegas standards) casino equipped with slots, table games, and a poker room. I do not gamble, so my experience is only with the features of the hotel. The hotel offers both valet and self parking. Upon arrival, the check in counter is located immediately to your left as you walk in. For some inexplicable reason, it is only a few feet from the Piazza Lounge. Both the hotel clerk and I had to shout to each other to be heard over the band playing in the lounge. This appeared to be a common occurrance when checking in at night. An earlier reviewer commented about additional \"resort fees.\" I have found this to be a fairly common practice in Las Vegas hotels and casinos. It was approximately 15 dollars per night. I had asked for a room with a king bed but they only had a room with two double beds. After the first night, I requested to change rooms and they accomodated my request. The grounds of the hotel are broken into several buildings. The main building houses the lobby, the Piazza Lounge, the gift shop, the Tuscany Gardens restaurant, and the casino. The other buildings comprise the hotel rooms. The buildings are labeled by a letter of the alphabet (A, B, C, etc.). My room was in building B, which is towards the front of the property. There is also a fitness center in the rear of the property. It had two treadmills, some elliptical machines, some other exercise equipment, and a few free weights. The same building also housed the hotel spa. Behind it was a smaller lap pool. There was a larger recreational pool behind the main building. The building I was staying in would've been nicer if the hotel had been more vigilant in repairs and cleaning. The elevator had a broken panel held on with duct tape. Several of the rooms had trashed piled outside the doors, but the cleaning crews did not pick them up until mid-afternoon the next day. The room was nice enough. It had a comfortable bed, an old picture tube television, a pull out sofa, and a bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The dining area of the room had a sink, a refrigerator, and a dining table. Although there were several cabinets and drawers, there were no utensils. They were strictly for people who brought their own supplies. There was no microwave in my room. The one dresser in the room was barely adequate for one person, and would be completely useless to two or more people. There was a steep fee to use the wireless internet in the room, but free wireless internet access was available in the lobby and pool area of the main building.

Our room was very clean. It smelled a little bit like beach when we walked in, but that's not a bad thing. Everything was very clean. Unfortunately, they didn't clean our room the entire time we were there. They take the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign seriously, and if it's on your door at 9am they aren't coming back to clean your room, even if the sign is gone at 10am. My bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows, and the bathrooms were cleaned and well supplied. My only complaint was there was only one bar of soap, so you constantly had to get the soap to sower or wash your hands. The pool area is very nice. We had no trouble getting a lounge chair when we went out in the morning. The worst problem is that the pool area has no shade and it is far too hot to be out there mid-day. We were back in our room by noon each day because of the heat. They have very nice cocktail waitresses in the pool area and the drinks come quickly and are reasonably priced. The hotel was about a 10 minute walk from the strip. There was a dicey area between the hotel and Bally's, where we saw a homeless encampment, a drunk driver jump the curve and take out a lamppost, and a couple of working girls. If you are going to walk, take the side entrance into Bally's to cut some time off your walk and increase your safety. The casino was fine for killing time. The cocktail waitress at night was VERY slow, to the point where I ordered a drink and she disappeared for so long that I finally just left. I know they are supposed to be slow to keep you gambling while you wait, but this was off the charts ridiculous. Service at Marilyn's cafe was also very slow. We waited a long time for our breakfast to come out, although the food was good when it arrived. The food at the Cantina was very good, and reasonably priced. The portions were HUGE!!!

My husband used the fitness center to workout and had no complaints. All in all, I would definitely stay again.

Tuscany built new buildings recently, building D is brand new, smells of new carpet inside, and the hallways smell great too! Anyone who stays here will be so happy, and next time they will stay again. I still cant believe they are only charging $25.00 a night when they can easily get $75.00 during the week, this is one of the best properties to stay in Vegas. Family owned really matters, all the staff love their job, they tell me that their employers take good care of them, this is why the staff is so happy and helpful, they love their job and their employer. Thats the secret, keep staff happy and they will do a great job for you, everyone wants to help you at this hotel, your not going to get someone at the front such as a Circus Circus or Excalibur person whom doesnt care at all about you. People are comming for fun and entertainment, and vacation, its really a bummer when hotel staff makes you miserable, do your self a favor and take advice from trip advisor people with good reviews, stay at the Tuscany and I promise you will be very happy. Same thing on the phone, try calling a Flamingo or Tropicana, see how you get treated, then call Tuscany and see the difference, you can tell everything over the phone about the facility, never stay anywhere if you have a bad experience over the phone. Some of these hotels do not know how important customer service is, they have recordings and long waits, then when someone does answer she sounds like she doesnt want to help you, or just takes your reservation and thats it, not further help.

Circus Circus ( all the staff are real tired and upset because of the noise and kids all over, this staff does speak a bit english though ) 2. Riviera Hotel ( what a shame, this was the Wynn back in the 70's and 80's, now its the 2nd worst hotel and service on the strip ) This hotel is just plain old and about go out just like the Sahara. 3. Excalibur ( Just a busy low cost hotel, they do not have time for you, get your room key and kiss everything else goodbye ) 4. Imperial Palace ( really bad service, really bad rooms ) however the location is to die for! Have fun here, get drunk and you wont care!

The improvements have been with the pool and casino. The first time I stayed here way back in 2002 or so, the casino was still under construction and the pool was basically a hole in the ground with some lawn chairs thrown out for good measure. The casino now looks nice and is very clean and spacious. Same with the pool. The landscaping, loungers and pool itself are nice enough that you wouldn't mind laying out in the baking sun for a few hours. I also like that there is another small pool hidden away towards the rear or the property. While it's not as nice as the one closest to the casino and restaurants, there are less people there and you can still relax. The rooms themselves are okay but not as nice as before. The couches still seem like the same ones that were there when I visited 9 years ago and are bit lumpy and run down. The room itself was mostly clean and luckily for us, we didn't run across a nasty bathroom. The biggest disappointment was the bed. While king size, it was in extreme disrepair and the sheets barely covered the mattress. Speaking of the sheets, there was not much to protect you from the mattress and whatever is living in it. Between threadbare sheets coming off the mattress and springs poking through the mattress, I really did not have one good night sleep. Like others have mentioned, the kitchenette does not have much other than a coffee maker, sink and mini frige. Our neighbors had a microwave delivered to their room, so if you need one, I'm sure you could ask. Additionally, the tv is the same one that was there in 2002. It's still an old school tube kind. I personally don't care about those things because I don't spend much time in the room anyway. As long as the thing worked while I needed it, it didn't bother me. We got our room for $28 a night (not including resort fee) for a total of $42 a night or so. Really, it's not a bad place if you can get it for that cheap. Since we had a car, not only could we walk to the strip but we could drive to other places in LV and this is a very convenient location. If you're expecting Bellagio or the Wynn, you will be sorely disappointed, but if you keep an open mind and don't spend a lot of time in your room, you'll be fine.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cStill a quality hotel, but overall it just doesn't justify their very pricey resort fees.\u201d", "Author": "NYYNO1", "ReviewID": "UR111396317", "Content": "Stayed for few nights as part of my week-long solo trip to Vegas. I always stay at Tuscany for its nice and quiet environment, away from the bustling strip scene. I also like their small but very nice pool area. I was expecting my stay here would be very peaceful as usual, and it didn't disappoint. Maybe it was too quiet to the point that most of the time while I was here, I felt like I was the only person staying at this property. There were probably only 5 rooms occupied in my building that has 60 rooms, during my entire stay - didn't see anybody, didn't hear anything, dead silent. The room is huge, but the \"kitchen\" is useless since it only has a sink and no gas or microwave to actually cook anything. The refrigerator is nice though. The bathroom is large with the shower and the tub separated. The toilet is separated as well. The problem is that the bathroom fan is very, very noisy, which makes it ironic since the rest of the property is so dead quiet. The casino is fairly large, and they have blackjack, craps, and roulette tables along with good number of slot machines. But the casino was almost completely empty as well. It was so dead it was depressing. The pool has very nice layout, heated and all, and they also have a hot tub. Since it was so unseasonably cold in Vegas when I was there, I wasn't able to enjoy the pool unfortunately, though the last day I was there the weather warmed up and lots of people came out to the pool. The first time I saw THAT many people while I was at the property.... They really should try to do something to attract more people, like reducing or completely taking out their very pricey \"resort fee\", perhaps? Or they really need to upgrade or remodel the entire property, especially the rooms (fixing the noisy toilet fan, installing a real kitchen, etc.) to justify the resort fee. In any case, I would still say that the base price of $30 - $40/night is still a decent deal for a good quality hotel like Tuscany, certainly better than some of the overpriced strip hotels. I'd stay again, of course, but from now on I'd probably choose to stay elsewhere if it's not the pool season, since I believe the pool is the only thing at this property that may justify their resort fees.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel within 10 minutes (walking) from Las Vegas Boulevard\u201d", "Author": "TubaRJ", "ReviewID": "UR111335755", "Content": "The presentation is excellent.

Front desk staff was friendly and very efficient, no issues with them... check in took about 5 minutes and we were quickly on our way to our room. We were advised by the travel agency that there was a resort charge when we booked our trip, it was also stated on expedia.. At check in, the front desk also confirmed the amount and what the charge covered. Considering what we paid for the trip, we had no issues with this additional charge. The room was huge, our beds were quite comfortable, no complaints from either of us. There was a table/chairs also a fridge and empty cupboards. A microwave would of been great, We had brought drinks from the bar, so we had glasses, which we rinsed and reused... I had brought mugs for our coffee, after reading reviews that had stressed there were no dishes. The bathroom is separated into 3 compartments, one being the toilet area, one the shower (glass door) and the other sink and bathtub. If you want extra coffee or towels ... etc... request it and within 15 minutes and your requested items will be delivered to you. We were just steps away from the lap pool, we went out every morning to sunbathe... jump into the jacuzzi / pool... the pool area only closes at 10:00 pm .. so if you want to use the pool after a long day on the strip, it is still open which was great. When we did eat at the hotel, we ate at Marilyn's and the food was fine... prices were unbelievably cheap... The only complaint that we would of had, was the noise overhead, it started about 11:30 pm... sounded like someone who had a stroller and was trying to put their child to sleep... it was unbelievably loud and there was absolutely no way you could sleep... after about an hour of listening to this, we called the front desk...shortly after, the noise stopped ... this only happened 2 nights... so it was not too much of an annoyance.(2nd night only about 15 minutes) We took a taxi a few nights back from Bally's, the cost was $7.00 plus tip... We did get the 24 hr bus pass... cost $7.00... took the strip bus .to go to old las vegas. and a trip to the north outlet mall.... we wanted to do this so that we could see all the different hotels .. did the express bus back and needless to say it was alot faster... Ask at the front desk and they will explain how/where you can either take the strip bus or the express bus (Howard Hughes street... 5 minute walk from the hotel.. 20 minutes from the outlet mall back to the hotel.) Overall.. If I ever go back to Vegas.. i will stay at the Tuscany... I liked the size of the hotel.. compared to the mega hotels on the strip... I enjoyed returning each night.. to Tuscany... to the quietness and not being part of a mob.. that we found at the mega hotels... If you can live with a clean.. comfortable rooms that could use some updating... Book this hotel..... If you want top of the line rooms/furniture..you will need to go someplace else and pay about triple(Plus) the price .. It is all in what you want to pay and expect.

I have stayed at many hotels both on and off the strip over the years and would consider the Tuscany the best 3* value option if you don't need to be right on the strip. I have organized the review by topic for ease of reference. Location - 15 minute walk east of the strip on Flamingo in the centre of the strip. If you drive in, there is plenty of parking and you can park in close proximity to your room which is great since this is a sprawling property. Check-in - Checked in after 8:00 P.M., but it was easy and painless. Price - Booked through Expedia and got a great online deal at under $20 per night (due to an online promotion Expedia had saving an additional $10 per night) excluding the dreaded $13 + tax resort fee, which many others have already commented on. While most hotels both on and off the strip now charge the resort fee ($1 at the Palms, to $25 at the Wynn for example), the biggest disappointment for me is that it does not include in-room internet (public areas and restaurants are free), which you must pay seperately directly to Cox business services. As others have mentioned, it can cost up to $13.99 per day, but is slightly cheaper if you need it for at least 3 or 5 days at $11 and change per day. The best revenge on the resort fees is to make use of the facilities (pool and fitness areas are great) as well as the various coupons you get at check-in including the free drinks and the discounts towards the restaurants. Room Quality - Very large rooms. They are more than 50% bigger than most at 625 s.f. and come with a king-sized or two double beds, sitting areas and dining tables, old school televisions, coffee makers, refrigerators, in-room safes and hairdryers. The bathrooms are also large with the standard of a separate tub and shower, although the tubs are nothing special. Service Quality - Good. They have room service and concierge, plus limited business facilities. The Casino: Table Games - Blackjack, craps, roulette. The pit is fairly small and has nothing to recommend it over one closer to where you're staying, or where you want to be. The craps table always appears to be a bit dead. Bet Minimums - blackjack and card games have a $5 minimum, while craps can be $3 with decent 5x odds. The double-zero roulette is usually $1 per chip and $4 minimum per spin. Machines -. There are a ton of penny machines here, and a good selection of nickels and quarters. There is some full-pay video poker machines at the quarter level. Cocktails - Good cocktail service. If you choose to buy your drinks at the bar, its $2.50 for a standard Budweiser. Who Gets Comps? It's a pretty good club for the slot and VP player. There are many decent promotions like double points and rooms. The Food: Marilyn's Cafe - Typical American coffee shop fare with a few decent specials throughout the day and during graveyard. If your there during the week, there is a very good Steak and Eggs special for $6.99 until 11:00 A.M. The Cantina - Standard if uninspired Mexican fare including a range of Tacos, Enchilada's and Burritos. That is, you can get Mexican food like this just about anywhere. Prices are pretty good though, and they have a range of lunch specials. Tuscany Gardens - Tuscany is the upscale Italian restaurant and is the best of the bunch. They have a range of dishes, including seafood, steak and pastas. Prices are reasonable and can be further reduced by using the $20 off coupon you receive with your welcome kit. For even more savings you casn order select appetizers in the Piazza lounge for half price during Happy Hours between 5:00 to 7:00 P.M. Open only for dinner. Overall, the Tuscany more than fits the bill and when considered against other supposed 3* properties on the strip such as Excalibur, Circus Circus and Imperial Palace, the Tuscany is a real diamond.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHands down best value for money in Vegas.\u201d", "Author": "emilygraceUK", "ReviewID": "UR98312769", "Content": "Wow. First of all, a huge thanks to all your tripadvisors for your reviews. My parents (in their 50s) flew over to California from the UK to visit me (early 20s) for a couple of weeks, and during this time we wanted to visit Vegas and the Grand Canyon. I avidly read tons of reviews before booking this trip as I wanted to make it perfect for them. I am SO glad I trusted tripadvisor! Tuscany was absolutely wonderful - everything I'd hoped for and read about, and more. My fave things about this hotel: - Big hotel without feeling big - no endless elevator rides or miles of corridors because the hotel is made up of mulitple low rise buildings, there are 15 3 story hotel room buildings, plus a few more buildings for the casino, lobby, restaurants, health club etc. Doesn't have the huge, impersonal feeling that other Vegas hotels have. - We paid $22 per room, but have seen them for as cheap as $14! Even adding the $13 \"resort fee\", that's still ridiculously cheap! - SO close to the strip. It's just over a block behind Bally's and Bill's Gamblin' Hall, so a very quick and easy walk up to the Bellagio fountain (our favourite!) and all the action. - HUGE rooms. Huge. Little kitchen area, full size fridge, sink, coffee maker, my room even had a little stove top (my parents' room didn't). Lovely big bathroom, seperate tub and shower and seperate toilet. - Very clean. - We had a yummy and reasonably priced breakfast at Marilyns Cafe. When you check in you get a little booklet with some vouchers for the hotel restaurants too which is really nice. - When booking through expedia I requested 2 King rooms close to each other, non smoking and that's exactly what we got! I think that particular building was non-smoking because it didn't smell at all like smoke. - It's quiet, because it's off the strip. The whole place feels like a little village. The only reason I gave the rooms a 4 is because they could do with more modern bedding. People on here have mentioned the \"dated\" decor - and I can see why although this didn't bother me. The televisions are \"old school\" (although in my opinion if you want to stay in watching TV then why are you in Vegas?!). I seriously think if the beds had big fluffy comforters it'd give the whole room a much more up to date feel. But that's me being reeeeeally picky. Over all, if you're umming and aahing about whether to pick this hotel like I was at first - go for it. If you want a 5 star, book a 5 star. But if you want somewhere lovely, clean, comfortable, great location, friendly, quiet and great value for money, then Tuscany is the place for you. I will most definitely be returning, everytime I hit up Vegas from now on.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201c18 hours from h_ _ _\u201d", "Author": "jjaylandj", "ReviewID": "UR97206161", "Content": "I like many TripAdvisor users had done plenty of research prior to reserving rooms for this 4 night (2 different hotels) trip and felt pretty comfortable with my selections...WRONG. Now let me preface this review by acknowledging that ALL businesses can have a lapse in service, circumstances that cannot be foreseen or avoided,.Yes we have all experienced these shortcomings...it is how an establishment and management handles these unforeseen situations (especially important in the Hospitality industry) that indicate professionalism and dedication to their guests. This is where my greatest frustration and disappointment with my stay at and the management of Tuscany Suites lies and where I feel the \"most attention\" is warranted. Ok...on to the 18 hours from h_ _ _ Upon check in (I was quite early 1:00 pm) I was informed that \"they were still on early check in fee...$12.00. After 2:00 pm I could check-in\" Let us keep in mind that it is a Wed. in Feb. (not overflowing by any stretch) OK, no big deal, I was prepared for this as I had read a previous reviewer mention the \"early check-in fee\". I walked around the property (very nice), played some Blackjack (very limited 3-4 tables) and basically got familiar with the surroundings. 2:00 pm....18 hours in h_ _ _ begins! Into room, though nice it smells unusual, like \"new building syndrome\"? Should have been a RED FLAG! After much deliberation I decided on dinner at the Mexican cantina. I ordered an entree and an appetizer that I wanted to go as it was almost closing time for the cantina (9:00pm). I attempted to use my hotel provided coupon but was informed that it could not be honored on \"to go\" orders?? Ok, again..no big deal. As I waited for my order, I played the slots which were within eye/ear shot of the hostess and cash register. After the advised time (15 mins) I returned to pick up my order and after some hectic scrambling by the hostess I was informed that my order had been given to someone else...ugh! After discussion and wishing for my money to be returned and cancel the order the hostess convinced me to allow them to prepare my order...\"less than 10 mins.\" Ok, I still needed to eat and it was now 9:00 pm. I sat at the cantina so as not to lose my order again...10 mins, it was up, I thanked everyone and returned to my room to relax and indulge in my great diinner...WHAT THE...?? WRONG ORDER...UGH %$#@. Back to the cantina I trudge with an entree that was NOT MINE. Cantina is now darkened, CLOSED sign greats me. I show the nice hostess the \"wrong\" entree (my entree was correct, the app was missing) and she again convinces me that \"5 mins...give us 5 mins\". I am SO HAPPY that I did as the app that I had ordered (bacon wrapped prawns) was the best part of the 18 hours from h_ _ _. Chow down and off to ZZZzzzzzzz...ugh. At 5:30 am I awaken and \"feel\" something down at my feet...I raise the sheets to find a SOCK....and it is NOT MY SOCK! Yes...not mine and it is now painfully clear that I have slept in a bed that was unchanged from the previous guest...UGH!!!!! I went to the front desk and spoke with the hotel Operations Manager and explained the \"bed partner\" I had just discovered as well as the \"grab bag dinner\" experience of the previous night. I was met with a \"glassy eyed\" response of \"do you want us to come change the sheets\" (remember it is now 6:30 am...NO), an offer to deduct the resort fee ($10) and we apologize. With that I informed the Operations Mgr. that I would be checking out early (I was reserved for the following night as well) and to please refund my card for the prepaid night...agreed. After clearing out of the room, checking out and driving away from the property (9:30 am), I was contacted on my cell phone by the Operations Mgr. and told that they would comp a room for tonight. I informed her that had this offer been made at 6:30 am during our initial discussion I would never have left the property. She then offered a comp meal..again I had already LEFT the property, headed to a the hotel that I stayed the first 2 nights at, and though I appreciated the offer...I was GONE. After all of this...3 hours since initial contact regarding the issues, numerous conversations and contact with the Ops. Mgr. at the front desk during checkout, it was not until I was already driving away from the property was a reasonable offer made \"to compensate for the inconveniences\" (Tuscany Suites term). Since returning home I have exchanged emails with the Administrative Asst., though they are \"sorry for the inconveniences , they feel that my concerns were addressed and proper compensation was offered\". My overall impression...though it is a \"nice\" property, the feel is unwelcoming, the sevice appears to be forced and not genuine. Further compounding this unfortunate experience was managements obvious efforts to employ the \"CMA\" tactics. As I stated in the opening...I understand that difficulties arise in all aspects of life...it is how one accepts responsibility and ownership of issues that is the true measuring stick.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cBEST DEAL IN VEGAS\u201d", "Author": "pikap272", "ReviewID": "UR97101347", "Content": "Went to MAGIC fashion convention and was looking for a place to stay.

It was an Expedia package. I travel alot on business and I'm not fussy when it come to hotels. In reality, they are a bed, a TV and a www link home. I seldom travel for pleasure unless my wife needs a getaway. So this review is based on the cost coming out of my own pocket. In that regard, I judge hotels by quality to value. Any hotel charging + $250 does not deserve to be rated highly as it should be by default that your stay would be perfect. For me, good value hides in the lower end gems to be found in any city or town. The Tuscany is not a gem but nor is it a dump. The immediate outstanding feature is the size of the rooms. They are huge! Now...is that a good thing? I guess it is in our bigger is better consumer crazy lifestyles. But I stood in the center of the room one morning wondering what I was supposed to do with the space. Aerobics classes? Model airplane flying? Invite Cirque de Soleil in for a private performance? You almost could. But we were in the room basically only to sleep. Hmmm, I dunno. It's nice... I guess. Also as I stood in the room, I looked around to try to figure out why the place looked so...well, spartan. All the furniture is average and in decent shape. The bed covering were also average. The bathroom was clean, nicely tiled and as big to match the main room. There was a safe, an ironing board, laundry service, fridge and small kitchen sink. It has all the stuff of any decent hotel room. So why did it seem so vanilla plain? Maybe it was the industrial grade carpet or the stark white semi gloss paint. I dunno. Toning down the hospital white walls with Tuscany style tan shades found on the public spaces of the hotel would go a long way. One thing that was great was the quiet setting away from the zoo that is the strip. It was a wonderful reprive to be back a the hotel at night. The walk to the strip is not that bad. But after walking the strip all day, those two blocks back to the hotel seem to have grown. If you're fat and out of shape, do yourself a favor and stay here to get some excercise. Or kill yourself by staying on the strip with only an elevator ride to the buffet. There is lots to see away from the strip as well. So rent a car from the net (Enterprise, Jan 2011, $13 a day, full size Mitsubishi Galant) and drive around. Do not rent by walking into the storefront as the rates are waaay higher. Book on the net. The Tuscany has lots of parking with bicycle play police patrolling. But it's a rental car. Don't worry. Take your stuff out, lock it and walk away. There is free parking and easy access to all the casino self parkades. So after all this rambling, what do I think about the Tuscany? Um. It's ok. Not dissapointing, sort of forgettable. Would I stay again? No. Not because the place is bad but just because I'd like to have another hotel experince in LV. If you are headed for LV to have a memorable resort experience and you don't mind spending a few hundred bucks more for bragging rights to stay in a name brand LV stirp hotel...stay on the strip. If you are looking for value, a quiet spot away from the strip zoo and maybe a private Cirque show in your own room, stay at the Tuscany.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big Rock, IL", "Title": "\u201cNot bad!\u201d", "Author": "agilipuppy", "ReviewID": "UR91726480", "Content": "I would stay here again.

You can find car rentals cheaper than that and parking is always free on the casinos.

It\u2019s not that it is too long it\u2019s just not very pleasant. There are a few empty lots that have lots of broken bottles and such thrown into them.

Honestly - I didn't want to come home. It couldn't be better situated - It's walking distance from both the Strip and Paradise Road. There are good restaurants very close by, the casino is well equipped and the pina coladas are nice and toxic! The swimming pools take some getting used to - i.e. they're quite salty! Our room seemed huge, the bed was massive and extremely comfy - Probably too comfy, truth be told, as I never wanted to leave it. Obviously, nothing is perfect, so my only criticisms are that the pictures show a kitchen - We thought \"Great, we can eat in\" but it's only really possible if you take your own crockery, cutlery, pans etc. as none of it is supplied! We did raise the issue with reception - Just on the off chance you had to ask for such things and the woman wasn't very helpful, she just said \"Well, some of the rooms don't even have a kitchen at all\" - Yeh, cos that make sense! For the $10 a day resort fee that you're expected to pay at the end of your stay, you get use of the pools, maid service & tea & coffee. They are a bit tight with the tea & coffee though! The $14 for 24 hours of internet in your room is only really worth it if you need to use Skype, otherwise it's best to just sit by the main pool and use the free public access internet - There are power outlets down there too, so you can plug in. Marilyn's Restaurant at the Tuscany Suites is, to be perfectly honest, a bit naff. The service is hit and miss and the food is bordering on poor. Maybe it's because I'm English, but I kind of expect some vegetables with my dinner that aren't fried or coated in a sickly glaze. It's not very vegetarian friendly! The Cantina however, is fantastic and the staff are wonderful! We had a meal there for my partners birthday and even though we'd only mentioned it in passing, they brought out a complimentary cake, complete with candle! There is a handy gas station/convenience store at the end of the block which is open 24 hours, and round the corner of Koval is our greatest discovery of the trip - Ellis Island Casino & Brewery - The breakfasts are cheap and amazing, they brew their own beer - The best in Vegas! It's cheap too - $6 for 4 pints. I can't rave enough about the place really! All in all, if you want value for money, no screaming kids, a pool that isn't heaving with people and want a relaxing vacation with easy access to the Strip. Go here.

Marilyn's Cafe is 24 hours and pretty decent, especially the Sunday T-bone special for $8.99, you can't beat it...delicous. There always seems to be little maintenance issues with the rooms. But the rooms are large and clean, beds are pretty good. I've had both luxury bedding and crummy old bedding, never know what you'll get I guess. Prices are very reasonable especially on Sunday - Thursday. Keep in mind though that they are going to add a $10 \"resort fee\" to the rate. Wish they'd just be up front and tell you what the whole price is going to be.

Every other hotel in Vegas was over $90 per night. I read other reviews about the Tuscany Suites hotel and have exactly all of the same things to say. First, the rooms are cheap- $47.04 for one night with a king bed after casino fee with tax. Second, the rooms are BIG- they are all suites and are about 600 square feet with bed(s), dresser, television, sofa with pull-out bed, chair with ottoman, coffee table, desk, kitchen table and chairs, refrigerator, coffee maker, kitchen cabinets, countertop, and sink, bathroom with separate toilet room and bath tub with separate tiled shower (great water pressure, too), large vanity with large mirrors and medicine cabinet. The room was quiet, and we didn't pay for a \"pool view\", still got a courtyard view close to the lap pool (and they have a standard pool, too- but they close at 10pm). The location is about three LONG block away from Ceasar's, which is the start of the strip (two of those three blocks is Bally's). We really only stayed at this hotel during a month-long road/camping trip, not really expecting a nice hotel for that price. We had no time to test other amenities, the restaurants, or the casinos in the hotel (sorry). But if you need a place to crash, this place is awesome. NOTE: this hotel, like all others in Vegas, charge \"Resort Fees\" (I don't understand why) at $10.00 per night as well as a $100 credit/debit card or $200 cash \"incidental deposit\".

We really are not into the Vegas \"thing\" so we always stayed at properies out in the Summerlin area. Well, I was looking for a \"deal\" this time and found the Tuscany on a few sites. The reviews were all above average so I called them to book direct and was offered even lower rates than I found on sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc. 19 bucks for Sun thru Thur and 50 bucks for Fri and Sat The rooms are wonderful!! EXTREMELY large (over 600 sq ft) with a wet bar, dining table with four chairs and a sitting area that includes a sofa, chair, end tables and coffe tables. The beds are very comfortable with pillow top mattresses. The bathroom is huge with a large counter with sink, bath tub and separate shower. The toilet itself is in a separate room within the bathroom. Just so you know that this is an impartial review, I'll throw in some negatives. The soap dish in the shower is too small to hold a bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner. There is only one towel rack in the bathroom so the towels get folded and left on the counter. Internet is only available for free in the public areas (there is a ten dollar per night \"resort fee\" that does not include internet in your room) so the public areas are full of people on their laptops. I paid 35 bucks for 3 days of room internet and it was blazing fast. Let's see, another complaint is there is no microwave in the wet bar but then, I never asked for one so they might be available.

I read almost all the reviews prior to staying there, good and bad. Listen, for the money, this is the best kept secret in Las Vegas. I can't even rent a low budget under construction hotel at home for this price. The rooms are pretty spacious and they have a separate tub and shower. Choice of 3 restaurants inside, one Mexican, one fine dining Italian, and one that serves just about anything all the time. They also have another small place that serves pizza. I ate at two of the three and found them to be great. The casino is a pretty good size, but not overly done. Plenty of machines for entertainment though. The bar has beers for $3, which for Vegas is pretty good considering most places are $6. The strip is just a few blocks up and you can be on it walking in less than 10 minutes. A cab fare for us back to the hotel was about $8 from the Luxor. They gave us a coupon book when we checked in with 2 free drinks in the casino, 2- buy 1 get 1 free meal coupons for one of their restaurants and a pizza discount voucher. I don't know if this was because we were there on business, or if everyone got those. Listen, I have reviewed hotels, airplanes, cruises, etc., and no matter what you can take 100 people to the same place and get half that they it was great and another half that hates it. If you are a pretty easy going person you will enjoy this hotel. Obviously this is not the MGM or Caesars Palace,so if you want those upscale amenities, then that is where you should book. If you want a very nice hotel with everything there that you need, just a couple blocks from the stip in a pretty good location that is safe and convenient, this is the best value for your buck.

Had a nice couch to lay out on with a tv don't really remember how many channels it had we didn't come to las vegas to watch tv.

There are 15 buildings, and this one is totally smoke free although I did smell smoke by the 3rd floor elevator once. Some idiots must think only their room was non smoking. The room was huge with 2 double beds, a tv with remote, a sofa (not a sofa bed), a chair and table along with a work desk. There was a dining table with 4 chairs, a small refrigerator (not a mini bar ripoff either), a microwave, coffee pot with supplies, a sink, and two stovetop burners. There was a closet with hangers and a safe which worked perfectly. The bathroom was great with a separate room with the toilet and privacy door. There was a shower and a separate tub across the bathroom and a large sink area with great amenities provided 3 our of 4 days. There was a loose tile once you walked in bathroom, and I noted this on my room survey card. One of the curtains didn't block out light so it could wake you up in the morning. The alarm clock went off 3 out of 4 mornings so I think the maid listened to the radio while cleaning. The beds were very comfortable with sheets and blanket but no duvet. All in all, a comfortable room with lots of space. We were almost as far as possible from the front desk/casino which was a plus in my opinion. Room M-320 would be the furthest from the casino. There was a $10 daily resort fee which I looked at as providing a safe. relaxing environment. Security was biking or driving around constantly. The fitness center was next to the small pool and looked inviting although we didn't use. The larger pool was very nice with a large hottub and towels and chairs. We just walked through. Another negaive: the resort fee should include free wifi in the room not just in the common areas. Back in December 2008. I walked here from the Paris to dine at Marilyn's which is in the Delta Dining guide so I receive SkyMiles. I did the same thing on my 2 visits in 2009 from the Imperial Palace and Flamingos. On the third visit in December 2009 I joined the Tuscany rewards program and received a special offer which I used for this stay. I am glad I did. It was so much better than staying at the mega hotels on the strip. It's also a better deal on the taxi ride to/from the airport. I did walk down and take advantage of the Harrah's group 24 hour buffet special (price increased from $29.95 to $34.95 the day before my arrival) but I got 2 dinner buffets, 1 breakfast, and 1 lunch with the deal. Caesar's was the best buffet; the others weren't much better than Golden Corral. I really like Marilyn's and ate there for my other 3 breakfasts, 1 pizza to go order, and a late dinner on our arrival at 11 pm. They provided some coupons which were useful. Tuscany Gardens wasn't that great, but I got $20 off wth coupon. I wish I had gone to the Mexican place instead. The Beachfront Cafe only does coffee and such now so you get your pizza at Marilyn's. I am not a big gambler so I don't expect to win or lose much. I lost about $80 a day but had a good time and drank lots of $1 (as my tip) beer. I would win and then lose but I just enjoy playing. I am not a gambler so the table games make me too nervous although I did roll two times at roulette with the coupons provided. I would have won $10 for a $5 even odds bet, but wouldn't you know, I lost both times. but it's just for fun anyway. The check in and check out staff were very friendly. I was worried about not getting a non smoking room so I called earlier on arrival day and was told it was first come first served, but I got a nonsmoking room so it all worked out. I would not have been happy in a stale smoky room so they should change that policy and let people reserve a room based on smoking preference. All in all, a great entertaining stay in a safe, comfortable environment. I hope they send me another special for this fall since I have 3 European trips planned between now and Labor Day and won't be albe to return until late 2010. Thanks to everyone at Tuscany for a great experience.

While this isn't the worst place I've stayed it is close. First, the good: As mentioned in most reviews the rooms are big, they do have working refrigerators, a fairly comfortable couch and chair and the bed was okay. There is a decent work desk and a \"kitchen table\" with three chairs. There is also a good sized chest of drawers if you are staying for a few days. There is a lot of free parking. The soaps and lotions and shampoo were nice, and the towels weren't bad. The in-between: It did seem fairly safe, but I'm a fairly good sized guy who was traveling alone, if I had kids or my wife with me I'm not sure how I would have felt because there were a few somewhat questionable types hanging around and there were quite a few very obvious \"Ladies of the Night\" in the casino after about 10:00 p.m. It's not all that close to the strip, but it isn't all that far either. The hotel's casino is a dive, and while the bartenders I had were friendly, they weren't in a hurry to pour any free drinks either, and I always tip liberally and always play video poker. I ate breakfast in the coffee shop, it was okay, the service was okay. I ate all my other meals off the property. Now, the bad: My first impression was that the place stinks and I had a general feeling that it wasn't clean. I had a non-smoking room but it hasn't always been so, it smelled of stale smoke and had other, unidentifiable, odors as well. Also, on different days at different times of the day or night you are greeted by a variety of unpleasant odors when you enter the room; you do get used to it, I never was sickened or anything, but it is still unpleasant. The bedspread was not clean, it felt gritty and dirty, thankfully I didn't need it to keep me warm at night. The halls are filthy, it didn't look like anyone had run a vacuum down them in recent memory and there was a lot of litter in the hallways, stairwells and elevators; there are no garbage cans by the elevators or stairwells or exterior doors, however, which probably explains this. There was a safe in the room but it did not work. There are only a few channels on the old, small television, no ESPN2 and no movie channels. If you want the light on in the bathroom the fan is always on (maybe they're trying to get rid of the stink!), and the fans (there are two of them, again, trying to get rid of the stink I guess), are LOUD! The lighting is very dim, if you like to read in bed forget it. One of the most annoying things is the \"high speed\" internet is slow, sometimes non-existent, and they nick you for $12-to-$15 bucks a day for it, depending on the package you select (daily or multiple day packages are available). The free internet around the pool and in the lobby is slow and sporadic as well. Oh, and speaking of the pool, the one day I had the chance to log a little pool time it was semi-closed at 3:00 p.m. for a party that was being held there later that evening -- you could swim anywhere in the pool but half of the pool-deck area was closed off (the area in the sun) so it was a pretty lame experience at the pool for me. Whew!!

It is exactly a 10 minute walk to the strip, coming out on the corner of the Bally\u2019s Hotel, which also means you are only 10 minutes away from the monorail at the Bally\u2019s. Going in the opposite direction you have a large Target supermarket less than a 15 minutes walks (behind Target a wee bit up the road you also have a decent sized Shopping Mall, with J C Penny\u2019s and Macy\u2019s on either end of it. Taxis are available 24/7 and their prices start at about $4 upwards (to the shopping mall it was about $9). The hotel complex itself is large, and very green which is lovely, there is plenty of parking too. My tip would be to ask for a building away from the pool, as they do have bands on at the weekends, and they obviously have children playing and and around the pool (very loudly). I was on the perimeter of the complex and it was just right. Unlike most of the other hotels in Vegas you do not have to walk through the casino to get to the reception or your room, infact you don\u2019t have to step in the casino at all, it is on the side, and whilst a lot of fun it is very discreet compared to others. The several food outlets are all very good (tried them all). Marilyn\u2019s Caf\u00e9, makes a mean stack of pancakes. The two Pools are wonderful. There is a coin operated laundrette, which is very handy \u2013 so keep those quarters (you can buy the soap from the wee gift shop). Check-in was quick and simple, the staff were very polite and helpful. Every member of staff I came in contact with throughout my stay was helpful, and if there was a problem they seemed to deal with it without a fuss once it was brought to their attention. I think it is easy to complain about things that are wrong on here after you get home, but unless you mention it to the staff whilst you are there, how do they know, it is no good to them or you, if the first they learn of problems is on Trip advisor etc! At the end of the day it should be their actions that get to be put on this type of site I think, surely that would be more helpful to fellow travellers. The room was huge and well equipped for all my needs. It was very clean and serviced each day. The wee kitchen space was handy, especially for the fridge. There is a Soda Machine and Ice Machine on the ground floor of each block next to entrance. (also if you ask reception, they will send a microwave up if you want one for free). The Beds were very comfortable, the blackout curtains did their job well, as did the air con. Towels were nice and fluffy and the toiletries were very nice. There is a free safe in the large wardrobe and also in there is an Iron and Ironing board. TV Channels were enough to entertain \u2013 pay on demand channels though were a bit pricey. Now here is the only \u2018let down\u2019 for the Tuscany for me; their FREE WIFI is only free in common area rooms such as reception, caf\u00e9, casino etc (very misleading on most Travel sites). You have to pay if you want it in your room, and it ain\u2019t cheap \u2013 something like $11 per day on one laptop only. This is a shame, as people will remember this mostly about their stay here if they are having to hike over to reception to check their emails out (after all it is the 21st Century and most people either have a laptop or a Smartphone with them these days), There is a daily resort fee of $10 at the Tuscany, which seems to be a standard in all Vegas hotels now, but I think personally if they added the WiFi into this, they would get tons of praise instead of people grumbling in the reception area \u2013 just a thought. Just around the corner from Tuscany is Ellis Island Casino, please visit this place for their BBQ Rib\u2019s the best I have ever tasted, you can sit out side and watch them been cooked the smell is lovely. The is a free bus from outside Bally\u2019s reception (10 minutes away) to Liberace Museum which is fun. (also near a big Walmart store!) Freemont Street is a $25 taxi ride away, but well worth it, especially at night. There is a bus, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, as it takes over an hour to cover one mile. As for Las Vegas, I just love it! The only thing to let it down is those annoying people trying give you flyers for girls on every corner \u2013 they become very tiresome \u2013 give it up people!!! One last thing, if you want to treat you yourself on your last day. I got a stretched limo at reception to the Airport for $15 (it is $12 in a normal taxi) I didn\u2019t even have to haggle the doorman found him for me. Oh and the doorman will happily look after your luggage all day for you when you check out for free (well obviously for tips).

Then there is a separate $20./night fee for an extra guest. And I checked in slightly before 3 PM and was charged an extra $12. fee. The hotel had not gotten my seven night reservation correct - they had to call Travelocity to confirm that I had paid for all seven nights (even though I carried the hard copy from Travelocity!). They seemed annoyed that they could not charge me another $50. booking fee for the seventh night. I've stayed in many strip hotels, but found Tuscany to be more relaxing and easy going than most. The property is spread out and none of it's buildings is over three stories high. It is clean and neat - the lawns are trimmed nicely and the walkways continually swept.

Being that I was a Las Vegas regular, having stayed at many different hotels, I had very little trouble finding this Hotel. I will say that unless you have your own rental car getting to and from the strip can be a little but of a walk. I did have my own car so this wasnt an issue. Upon first arrival I had no wait in link to check in. There was a fellow being checked in beside me at the same time and the guy behind the counter was very courteous and informative to that person to the point to even ask if they wanted to pick which biuilding to stay in. For those interested bulding \"J\" is the closest to the parking area. The lady who checked me in did not ask me any questions, and checked me into a building on the far edge of the property. When I asked to be placed in a building closer to the parking area it seemed as if I really inconvenienced her. But got what I wanted. The Room: Getting to the room was very easy because my car was parked so close. I will note that elevator in the building is really odd. Its door is basically tucked away inside a regular door and is vewry small and SLOW! The room is extremely large by vegas standards and to be honest was a nice change. The room was very well made up and didnt have any nasty smells that alot of the lower star hotels tend to have. The bathroom was nice and big as well. The only knock against it was that it seemed that the shower stall door does not do a good job at keeping the water in the shower. As I always had water on the floor outside folowing my showers. The only issue I had during my entire stay was that for some reason they put double sheets on my king sized bed which needless to say didnt fit, They left the bottom 10 inched of the bed without any covering. I didnt complain as with the size of the bed I didnt really need it. I did raise it as a point at checkout and they didn't do anything for me or really seem to care. The bed was decently comfortable but was fairly old. Notes: - If you dont have a rental car stay away from the self park areas as they have some very loud inconsiderate drivers that dont care what times of the night they are playing their stereos or reveing their engines. -If you like busy vegas feel to your casinos this isnt the place for you. The most people I ever saw playing blackjack at one time is 2. Its a very small unpopulated casino. I actually didnt gamble here much as when signing up for the club card they didnt even ask for amy of my info, thereby saying to me that I will never receive any deals on staying there again. -If you do stay here, do youself a favor and request a 3rd story room. Because the bathrooms are tiled floors and when you get heavy walkers in the room above you you can hear every step in the bathrooms above you. Myself I prefer the vegas style hotels where you have to avoid teh masses of people, this hotel is for sure not that kind of enviroment.

I called housekeeping to get the room made up and waited by the pool area. At 4:45pm we returned and found the room was done. When we went out on Sunday morning at 11:30am and I called Housekeeping to ask that the room be done by 2:00pm and they said OK it wold be done. When we returned at 2:30pm, the maids cart was outside the room. I went to the front desk to speak with the hotel manager. After waiting 10 minutes in line (only 3 people ahead of me) I asked to speak with the Hotel Manager, she was busy on the phone. Once I got a hold of the Hotel Customer Service Manager, Tara Kiper, (after 15 minutes) I explained how I had to call housekeeping the day before and how I requested the room be make up by 2:00pm today. I said I wanted some compensation for the problems I was having. She went in the back for some time came out and said they had till 5:00pm to make up the rooms.

I was standing right by the door when this happened, and I yelled we were not ready when they said it was housekeeping and tried to come in. NO RESPECT FOR GUESTS and their privacy.

Also they are strict about 3:00 check in. If you come early around 1:00 like we did there is an extra fee to check-in. Of course after hearing that we checked our luggage and went to eat until 3 because I refuse to pay. I've stayed in many hotels in different parts of the world and have never been refused or charged an early check-in as long as the room was ready, and i'm talking about strolling in hotels as early as 9 am in some places! Despite the above I actually really enjoyed my stay. The rooms are extremely spacious suites that had a kitchen area, living area with couch, table and two double beds along with a separate bath tub and shower. One could easily fit a large group in the room if they chose and save money by cooking themselves. Got a coupon booklet with some great offers for free slot play, discount offers on restaurants on the property, free drinks etc. We ate at the Cantina restaurant which was pretty good and inexpensive. Didn't get to try the pool but it looked pretty decent. Also the area being off strip is quiet and peaceful which is good if you want to relax and get away from the action. Would I stay here again? yes if the price was right. I hear they recently started charging $10/nt resort fee to patrons, so i'd have to take that into consideration.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta area", "Title": "\u201cLarge rooms with fridge, great for kids\u201d", "Author": "BBHJ", "ReviewID": "UR52389698", "Content": "We stayed here from 12/26 - 12/30/09 and had two rooms overlooking the pool. My parents are in their 70's and our kids are ages 6 and 8. This was a GREAT hotel for us, we got it through orbitz for $35/night, but the hotel charges a separate $10/night per room fee for coffee/pool (outdoor only - too cold for us to use)/internet (which is only available in the lobby) so I guess it ends up being a $45 room. Pros: The rooms were huge with a kitchenette area with sink and mini-fridge, we asked for a microwave which we got at no extra charge. There are no utensils or plates, so you'll have to bring your own paper plates, etc if using a microwave. The bathroom was also large with a separate bath and shower, and a water closet. There was a 24-hour restaurant and several other dining options. Parking was never a problem. (I almost forgot, I thought the beds were very comfortable) Cons: We stayed on the second floor and could hear people walking around upstairs (all the buildings are 3-stories). This did not last too long, I suppose the upstairs guests were not often in their room. On Sat and Sun nights, we could hear the live band in the lobby (we were in building H facing the pool and back of the lobby) they started at 10:30 pm and played well into the early hours, we turned on the bathroom fan and this adequately covered the noise. Location: with the kids and seniors in our group, we drove everywhere (all casinos have free parking) but the hotel was only a few blocks off the main strip, and was centrally located on Flamingo Rd. There was a tram station between the hotel and the strip, also. Finally, the hotel itself had a free shuttle to three other areas along the strip, we never used this, but it ran from around 10:30 am to 10:30 pm so it seems it would have been really useful.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cI am very disappointed with their customer service\u201d", "Author": "yy15", "ReviewID": "UR52323182", "Content": "I stayed at the Tuscany Suite with my husband for six days around Christmas.

The service was rather poor. There was an incident that I returned to the hotel at night and found my door open with the deadbolt on (which kept the door open). I called the hotel security and it took him 20 minutes to get to the room. Since we didn't miss anything, he concluded \"people can forget to close the door behind them\" and left. He could at least do a card scan to see if there are anyone else entered the room other than my husband and I! I asked him to file a report so that if anything is missing I can file for insurance. He refused and said his shft is about to end and I should probably talk to a hotel mananger instead. So I waited at the front desk for almost 30 minutes until the manager came out. His attitude was slightly better than the security guard but not much better. There was no apology what so ever. He just handed me the form and told me that the doors to the rooms automatically puts down the deadbolt when they are not closed properly.

Did I mention that it has to be clean? :-) Tuscany Suites is all those things and more. The room - they call it a suite, but technically it isn't - is very large, complete with a kitchenette and a sofa and love seat. The bathroom was REALLY a cut above, complete with a separate shower and bathtub, and a door between the toilet and the rest of the bathroom. The whole bathroom was done in attractive ceramic tile. The whole complex is very large (and a bit confusing) and well-kept. It looks more like a modern apartment complex than a hotel. Each building has three floors. One positive thing about this hotel is you don't park in a giant garage like you do on the Strip or Downtown; rather, you park pretty much near the building where your room is located. Whether or not you like the location is dependent on your perspective. It's almost exactly a half-mile between Tuscany and Bally's, which is right at the heart of the Strip. I have no problem walking that, but many people might. Driving is always an option (really a necessity for Vegas in general), but note that the traffic between Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd. can be maddening, even for that half mile. And there was construction on Flamingo when I was there, making it worse. Much has been said in other reviews of about the $10 a night (over $11 after taxes) resort fee, and those people have a legitimate point. My guess is that Vegas hotel competition is so fierce - especially in these tough times - that hotels have to do whatever is possible to make them - on the surface - appear to be the cheapest. It's a cheap shot for sure, but keep in mind you get some \"free\" goodies when you check in: a two-for-one coupon at the coffee shop and a coupon for $20 off their Italian restaurant. Does this make up for the resort fee? No, but it lessens the sting. Even with the fee, this place is a bargain, especially when compared to the big boys on the Strip. I booked my hotel as part of a package, but I think the cost came down to something like $70 for three nights. Let's call it $100 with the resort fee. For three nights at a place like this?

I'm glad we didn't pay to be there (except the manditory \"resort fee\"), and especially glad we didn't sign on for the time share! The good - the room was HUGE. There are two pools, so we never had a problem with overcrowding, and the place was quiet. The bad - we arrived well after check in time, and then went for dinner. When we arrived back at the hotel with our very, very tired three-year-old child, we realized that the sofa bed hadn't been made up. We called to the front desk, and were told that they never make up a bed until they know someone's going to be sleeping in it. I explained that the booking was for three people, and she replied, \"Yes, but we don't make up the bed until we know it will be used.\" (I guess what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas). I paused long enough for her to realize what she was saying then said politely, \"She's three.\" She muttered but then said she'd send somebody to make up the bed. When the guy finally showed up with bedding, he shoved it at my husband, who indicated the sofa bed, thinking the guy would make up the bed. Instead, he walked over and dumped the bedding on the sofa bed & left. The whole \"threesome\" incident gave us a good giggle, but seriously... When we finally got settled, the air conditioner was so noisy when it was shutting off (which happens every 5-10 minutes) that it would wake us all up. This also gave us the giggles because it sounded like it was REALLY enjoying itself - very loud banging that got faster and faster until it ended with a sigh. The other downsides - the casino is old and shabby and stinks of cigarette smoke (I guess their air conditioning is old and shabby too) - fortunately, we don't gamble, so this didn't worry us too much, but it may be a problem for others.

Walked to the strip every day, the walk took about 10 mintues - in some places the sidewalk was a bit narrow and traffic goes pretty fast. We found walking on the opposite side of the street, same side at Bill's Gambling Hall, was a bit safer because of wider sidewalks. There are three restaurants at Tuscany and we were given BOGO coupons at check-in. Marilyn's Cafe and Tuscany Gardens were good but The Cantina was by far our favorite, the food, service and portions were excellent. There are also several nice restaurants, Lawry's, Morton's, PF Changs, etc in walking distance. The only negative we experienced was in the pool/hot tub area. We were looking forward to enjoying the hot tub. The pool area is lovely and on the first night, we swam in the pool and relaxed in the hot tub...apparently, the chemicals in the hot tub were so strong that it burned our skin (which lasted for several days) and ruined our swimsuits...completely bleached out all the color and they were not cheap suits. The chemicals didn't smell overly stong at the time. We showered off after using the hot tub but the burn started showing up about 30 mintues after we were back in our room and was very intense by the next morning.

Unless there is a special occasion warranting a better hotel, this is the only place I stay when I go to Vegas. The property is nice and the the rooms are huge, clean, relatively nice, and cheap. My only real complaint is with the separate $10 nightly resort fee they tack on once you check in. It covers free wi-fi in the public areas, pool and gym use, and parking. They should just include that fee in the rate like other hotels do (even if they have to bump the rate up) or make it optional for those who don't need to use those amenities. Seems kinda bait and switchy to me. Anyway, more good-to-know stuff: - If you join their free members club, they mail you coupons, which this time got us a $25 nightly rate at Thanksgiving as opposed to the $59 rate otherwise. Still had to pay the resort fee though! - The walls are thin. The first 2 times we stayed here, the people walking in the room above us kept us awake at night. Since then we have requested the top floor and noise hasn't been a problem. - Marilyn's Cafe is good. You have to walk through the small, smoke-filled casino to get to it though. The little pizza/hot dog place is decent, too. - The kitchen area has a sink, stove, and fridge. But without pots and pans, what good is a stove? They should provide microwaves instead. - Parking can be a challenge at night. You might have to park far away and walk through the dimly lit lot and/or pathways to get to your building (it never felt unsafe though). - Don't expect perfection. The old school televisions in the rooms have been slightly fuzzy every time we've stayed there. There has always been some manner of patchwork in the bathroom, like a poorly fixed tile, visible screws holding the vanity together, a loud vent, etc. This last time, we remarked on the lack of padding in the carpet (seriously, it was like walking on cement) and took offense to the sign in the bathroom warning us that we would be charged for taking towels (kinda low rent and tacky in my opinion). This may just be my thing, too, but the box springs looked like they had seen better days...and lots of travelers! - The rooms are laid out like a big open box.

We exited our unit and stood outside with the other guests. Turns out it was a false alarm. We tried to fall back asleep, but it was a bit difficult after waking up under those circumstances and also the people in the unit over us sounded like they were coming through the ceiling.

As others have said, the rooms are huge with a separate kitchen area and bathrooms with a separate water closet. The furnishings are functional and nothing fancy. My wife described them as \"something you might find in a cottage.\" The TV was a standard screen with limited channels, but did you really come to Las Vegas to watch TV? My biggest room surprise was that this is the only Vegas hotel I've ever been in where you could open the windows all the way! Since it was in the low to mid 70's we kept the windows open the whole time we were there and didn't have to fuss with the AC. We had a king bed that was firm and comfortable. Unlike the high rise towers that dominate Vegas, Tuscany is made up of a compound of 16 three story buildings. The curvy pathways between are nicely landscaped so it's even fun to walk to the pool, casino, fitness center, etc. It's so peaceful that you could forget you're in Las Vegas until you look up and see the Strip hotels towering over you. Speaking of pools, there are two. The main one is a free form with a large jacuzzi. The second is a lap pool also with a jacuzzi. Both were very well maintained. In most other locations this property would likely be considered a 3-1/2 star place. Becuase it has to compete with likes of Wynn, Venetian, Mandalay Bay et al. it's tough to get that kind of rating. The casino is small and comfortably quiet. It had all the usual slots and table games. Drink service was very good and most of the staff was friendly. The one exception was the bartender who worked during the Monday Night Football party. He seemed to cater to his friends and ignore the rest of the bar. We didn't bother going to the lounge after that. We ate at the 24 hour coffe shop (Marilyn's Cafe) twice and the Mexican restaurant (Cantina) once. The staff was extremely pleasant and went out of their way to make sure everything was okay. The food was very good in both. There is also an upscale Italian restaurant which we didn't try. On check in we recieved a coupon book for BOGO at the restaurants along with a slot card incentive, free drink coupons and a few other goodies. Considering the extremely reasonble price of the rooms, the couplon book turned a good value into a great value. The Good: great location - 2 blocks from the strip Windows that open all the way Good water pressure in shower Pretty in a peaceful way. Free internet in the common areas. Mostly friendly staff The Not So Good - Our room in Building L overlooked a vacant lot.. Ambient noise from the street. (but I guess that's the . price you pay for leaving the windows open.)

The property is fairly new and, unlike many Vegas headliner hotels, is on the small side. It's conveniently located just east of The Strip on Flamingo, behind the Paris, Planet Hollywood and next to the Platinum, all of which loom over it. One of the Tuscany's draws for me was that its Casino is in a separate, but adjoining building. Therefore one is spared the cacaphonous ringing racket of slot machines, etc. encountered at most Vegas properties. There is a \"main\" building where one registers and finds several meeting rooms, a bar, and a high-end Italian restaurant of fairly good quality (the osso bucco was enormous and tasty as were the accompanying appetizers, bread, etc.). The rooms themselves are in 15 smaller, outlying buildings of 2-3 floors each identified by a letter. Herein lies the rub. The signage at the hotel is not particularly helpful, nor is the front desk staff because they are obviously familiar with the lay-out of the place and give superficial, fast directions. The xeroxed map is of little help either. For a first-timer, it can be confusing and vexing to find not only your building but the entrance closest to its elevator. The rooms are very spacious. My bathroom had loose faux-Tuscan tiles on the floor, a separate bath and shower, and a plentitude of towels, good toiletries, etc. The room's art work was neither Tuscan nor Vegas themed. It might have been the Amalfi coast, but that's only a stab. There's a sink, 2 electric burners, a mini-fridge and some rooms have microwaves (not mine). However they are of little use since there isn't one piece of cutlery, plates, cups, nor glasses (unless you count the - groan! - flimsy plastic ones) provided. There was a couch and easy chair but both are so low that it practically takes a crane to get you out. And, as with many hotels, there is woefully inadequate lighting by which to do any work or reading after sundown. Key cards are only good for one's own building and room. Therefore, if you invite someone from another building to your room, you were obligated to meet them at the building's (correct) entrance. The housekeeping staff were exemplary. The patio outside the main building is \"misted\" and the pool is good-sized. There's a good snack shop adjacent to the pool and the Casino has an adequate 24 hour restaurant.

(See previous review.) Not much had changed in the casino, besides swapping out a few slots, or elsewhere on the common grounds. However, there were some updates in the room that left us with some mixed feelings. The sofa, chair and bedding had all been replaced which was fine. However, the kitchen area renovations were hit or miss. There was a faux marble countertop installed which was good. However, it came at the cost of the formerly full-sized refrigerator which was replaced by a smaller version that fit under the countertop. Also, the microwave that used to be there was now only available by request. Fortunately, it was not a problem to acquire one.

My brother had recommended the Tuscany Suites and Casino (TSC) to me; it's where he usually stays in Vegas, and when Expedia came up with a $22/night rate for my dates (20 to 23 July), I decided to book it. I generally prefer the glitz, glitter, and buzz of the Strip hotels, but I'm always willing to give a recommended place a try, especially at a bargain price. In this case, I'm glad I did. TSC is an excellent value, with comfortable rooms, friendly staff, user-friendly layout, and easy parking. I was given a nonsmoking king room on the second floor of the \"I\" building. The room was decent, with a separate sitting area and, as other TA reviewers have noted, a minifridge and coffee maker. I found the room to be similar to but larger than rooms I've seen at various Holiday Inns, Comfort Inns, etc. over the years. The furnishings were a bit worn and not high quality, but at $22/night, I have no real complaint. The A/C was an older-style floor unit but worked well. The bathroom was the most pleasant surprise: large, with a separate shower stall and bathtub. Fancy -- sort of. I had trouble sleeping my first night, after getting in late and hearing my upstairs neighbors thumping and bumping around -- not unusual for a motel- or garden apartment- style \"resort\". The noises resumed fairly early in the morning, and when I called the front desk to ask about a possible room change (to something on the third, or top, floor of TSC), the operator abruptly said, \"I'll have security check it out.\" Maybe 10 minutes later, I had a call, and \"Security\" said they'd visited the room above mine and found it empty (speculating, as I did, that the party had stayed up late and then checked out early). I slept for a couple more hours and then called the front desk again to ask about a room change. The woman who answered said, \"No problem; we'll hold another unit for you on the 3rd floor of the H Building.\" I went down to reception, and I received my new room keys. The new room was an improvement in several ways: newer A/C; recently renovated furnishings -- including a smart new bed treatment with a duvet and even accent pillows worthy of the MGM Grand's West Wing rooms -- and...quieter than my first room. I called the front desk to thank them again. TSC's location and parking are also strong points. It's on E. Flamingo, a few blocks from the Strip. One problem -- nothing to do with TSC per se -- is that E. Flamingo, like many of Vegas's busier roads, is undergoing major repairs, which makes access to the hotel a bit more difficult than usual, especially at night. But once at TSC, parking is free, easy, and plentiful, with no long walks to your room. The \"Beach Cafe\" -- located next to the pool and adjacent to the casino and hotel reception -- is convenient for snacks and drinks and not too expensive. Their personal pizzas are a true Vegas dining bargain, tasty and cheap -- especially the meat lover's, with more meat than one should eat, for $4.50. I didn't use the pool at the TSC -- I rarely do at Vegas hotels; too hot and crowded, and I prefer the ocean for swimming -- but it was fairly big and looked alright. The internet, as other reviewers have noted, is free in wifi form in some areas of the hotel (lobby, Beach Cafe, around the pool) but costs pretty much the same as other Vegas hotels for in-room connection via wifi or cable. Again, given the room rate I was paying, I can't complain. I used the free wifi in the available areas; it worked pretty well most but not all of the time. I gamed some in the TSC's casino; it was alright. The slots were neither the loosest nor tightest I've experienced in Vegas. If nothing else, the casino here was a good adult respite from all the kids elsewhere on the property. Conclusion: TSC is a great value, and for the most part, it's a fairly nice property. It's neither luxurious nor peaceful, but there are scores of other hotels and resorts to fill those needs. TSC is very kid- and family-friendly while at the same time providing good, solid, and reasonably quiet accommodations for solo travelers like me. I'd recommend staying here and spending the savings on wining, dining, and gambling on the Strip.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cWorst Vegas Experience Yet\u201d", "Author": "sparklesalt", "ReviewID": "UR36239006", "Content": "Upside: The rooms are very spacious.

I actually let her decide where she wanted to stay and gave her a choice of a couple big name hotels on the strip and of course the Tuscany. Having never been to Vegas before and not knowing one Hotel from the next, she chose the Tuscany because of the ambiance and homey feel of the Tuscany. We were not dissapointed. The staff was VERY helpful and friendly and the room was very spacious and comfortable. We loved the pool area and the surrounding grounds. The prices there are very affordable($40 per night) and the food was excellent quality. I was shocked when we ordered a couple of frozen drinks to celebrate her turning 21 and couldn't believe they were only $5 each- in Vegas! Of course this is an \"off-strip\" hotel and there was a short walk up to Bally's to catch the monorail to get to the rest of the strip. We decided that the walk was OK during the daylight hours but didnt feel comfortable walking back to the hotel late at night, so we just grabbed a cab from the strip for under $10. There are very few downfalls to the Tuscany except that I think they should invest in their own shuttle to take people back and forth to the strip. Also the elevator in the building that we were in was painfully slow. Other than that, I would definitely reccomend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again-especially if you're looking for a a great value and an alternative to the hustle and bustle of the strip. After all, you don't go to Vegas to spend all your time in a hotel room.

It smelled of cigarettes, because it was close to the casino,too bad it really invaded the place. Apparently not a high quality ventillation system. This is one of my biggest priorities when looking for a place. The casino had a resturaunt but I personally won't eat anywhere if there is the smell of cigarette smoke. There was another resturant outside the casino, but it was the same issue with smoke smell. The room was very large. The carpets were a little soiled, but not awful. Otherwise the room was clean . We had a fridge and could buy some things at the store. The beds and pillows could have been softer, but still I did not lose any sleep. It was very quiet. We stayed mid-week so the pool was not crowded and warm.It was nice to not have to fight for a chaise lounge. Enjoyed my time out there. The casino was not the best. We spent minimal time there. Stayed two nights. They kept spraying the room with this horrible spray after cleaning. Recommend Blueberry Hill Restaurant a short drive away on the same street for a huge breakfast variety served all day. Under $10.00 , worth the price. Excellent food , coffee and service. I'd recommend the Tuscany if you want to have some room , a fridge, and be away from the strip and just drive to it when needed.

The Tuscany had the location and the incredible prices so we all stayed there! The Tuscany is down the street from the Flamingo/Ballys-a quick ten minute walk to all of the action. This three story hotel comprises of a dozen buildings surrounding the main building. The main building includes a small casino-where the slots seem to be pretty loose-An upscale Italian restaurant, a Mexican Restaurant, a 24 restaurant, a Bar inside of the Casino, a coffee shop, a gift shop and a Lobby bar and Front Desk/Concierge. Upstairs are the conference rooms. We have stayed at this hotel before and prerequested that everyone stay in the same building-and they were able to accomodate us with that. The front lobby staff was great. We had used online websites for the best deals and that was great. I have stayed there in the past and at other hotels around the world, and the less complicated you make it, the less errors there will be. If I am splitting a room with someone I pay for it and they pay for the car or something else. (Just a traveldeva tip!) The spacious rooms have either a King or two double beds, a smallish tv on top of a dresser, a round table and four chairs, fridge and microwave and couch/Chair with table. These rooms are perfect for gathering everyone together, having a late night snack or waiting for everyone to get together. The rooms are clean, have windows that can open, have a Tuscan \"theme\" with the watercolors on the wall and the bedspread, and pale furniture. The bathroom has a shower (yes it is low, European style) as well as separate tub and toilet with a separate door. These rooms are more than functional and although not as luxurious as some hotels, this would be a Superior First class room in NYC! I would equate the rooms to be like a Country Inns and Suites or a Holiday Inn or better quality Best Western. What I love about this hotel is the ease from going from your room to the car-maybe three minutes, versus other hotels on the strip, which take a good ten minutes to get to the car park and then maneuver around the ramp to get out to the street. This is very convenient. We never ate at the Mexican or Italian restaurant, but we did eat at the 24 hour cafe, which features really reasonable prices and good solid food. This is not like eating at Mario Batali's restaurant, but the food is good and the price is great. (I am trying to set up expectations here! :)) Breakfast was tasty and one night, my brother got a chicken sandwich and he said it was tasty. The pool is not huge by any standards, but it is a pleasant pool area and we loved the coziness of it all. I never felt unsafe there, but like anywhere, in the evening, always walk outside with someone else. I did notice across the street, some homeless guys walking around. Traveling can provide false security and it is a good idea to not walk alone at night. As we had stayed in Vegas for a week, which is unusual and frankly too long, but necessary in our case, I liked that the Tuscany is away from the total Vegas insantity.

My husband has been to Las Vegas numerous times and had never heard of the Tuscany. I read some reviews here and was a little worried because we normally stay at 4 star hotels or better. But since it was free, we were going to take advantage of it. I have to say that we were both pleasantly surprised! First of all, the staff was very nice. Every time we arrived at or left the hotel, there was always someone to open the door for us. The people at the front desk were very kind and welcoming. We arrived early, so we paid $11 for early check in. Even though the lobby smelled like smoke due to the nearby bar, it was very clean and not bad looking at all. Once we left the lobby and headed outside to our room, we were surprised at how quite the outside walkways were. In fact, it was serene. It reminded me of a tropical escape. The room was very large---the largest hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen, and very clean. It was not as fancy as other hotel rooms, but the largeness of the room and the quietness made up for that. As many other people have mentioned, the little kitchen didn\u2019t have silverware but that was no big deal. The bed and pillows were on the firm side, but comfortable enough for us to sleep well. The TV only has about 7 channels--- news, Steve Wilkos was on a lot, a channel that shows the Marilyn\u2019s Cafe menu, but it didn\u2019t matter because we didn\u2019t sit in the room and watch TV all day. The bathroom was very spacious and there was plenty of room for me to set all my makeup and girly stuff on the sink. There was even a medicine cabinet behind the side wall mirror. There is a separate tub and shower. The tub is not a whirlpool or spa tub---just a regular bath tub, but we just used the shower. It had really good water pressure. When inside the shower, trying to get out, the handle was a little tough, so we just pushed on the glass door instead of using the handle. No big deal. The toilet had it\u2019s own door so I was able to take a shower or use the sink when my husband was using the bathroom. It\u2019s true that when you turn the bathroom lights on, the loud fan also comes on, but if you look at the light switch, there is also a timed light you can turn on. The light is a littler dimmer, but it has no fan. So just use that one. In the bathroom there was a good hair dryer I used every day and in the closet there was a good iron and ironing board. They also have a laundry service and a safe that you can put your own code into. The toilet paper and tissues were soft, and the towels smelled clean are were of adequate size. Each day we found clean towels nicely folded in the bathroom and the room was tidied up. I have to say how impressed I was at how quiet it was in the room and on the grounds at night and into the early morning.. After a loud and crazy day in Vegas, it was absolutely wonderful to get back to the hotel grounds where I immediately felt relaxed because it was sooooo quiet there! We ate at Marilyn\u2019s caf\u00e9 (open 24 hrs) for lunch two days in a row. It was about the equivalent of Denny\u2019s or IHOP. You have to go through the casino to get to the caf\u00e9, but it is a small casino so a short walk. Even though the caf\u00e9 smelled like smoke because of the casino, we sat in the very back and it smelled just fine. They had a huge selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, etc. The prices were normal, the service was good, and the food came out in about 10 minutes. The portions were big and both days I couldn\u2019t finish my meal. We ordered the philly cheese steak with hashed browns (you can pick your side---they have a lot to choose from), the grilled cheese with applesauce, the Marilyn\u2019s Sampler which had big mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, and cheese fries, and the beef French dip with fries. All of it was very tasty. The pool area was beautiful. There was a large outdoor heated pool and hot tub. There was a high of 60 degrees when we were there and people were still hanging out at the pool. There were lots of chairs, large trees, pool towels, music. It was really nice. In the hotel, next to the pool there was a little mini caf\u00e9 with drinks and snacks. Near that was a little gift shop with all kinds of cute things and next to that there was a concierge service. They even had an area where they sell half priced show tickets. There was a fitness center and a nice Italian restaurant, but we didn\u2019t try those. I read in some reviews that the walk from the hotel to the strip was long and scary, but I would have to disagree. When you check in, ask to stay near the front of the hotel, close to flamingo street. From the front of the hotel, you just walk 5 minutes down Flamingo directly to Bally\u2019s. It was completely safe. We walked it several times, including at night. I took pictures along the walk so everyone can see it\u2019s short and not scary. Along the walk, there were several nice high rise hotels, normal people walking, and lots of cars driving, so it\u2019s not like anything bad would happen. Once you get to Bally\u2019s you go into the sports book/shops entrance which are the first doors you see (again, only a 5 minute walk from the hotel) and once in there, you can either jump right on the monorail which will take you anywhere for $5 a person (they also have 1 day and 3 day tickets) or walk through the Bally\u2019s shops and the casino and it will put you right on the strip, or instead of walking through the Bally\u2019s casino, walk through Paris which is awesome (shops, restaurants, and the casino) and that will put you on the strip too. It\u2019s all connected so it\u2019s really simple. We mostly walked everywhere we were going except for the nights when we got dressed up for fancy dinners. On those nights, the bellman got us a taxi or nice car quickly. You have to pay for wireless internet in your room--$10 for 24hrs, but it\u2019s free in the lobby and the pool caf\u00e9. One night when we got back to the Tuscany, there was a live band playing that was pretty good in the bar area and people were dancing and having a good time. On the day we checked out of the Tuscany, we were able to check our bags with the bellman because our flight out of Vegas wasn\u2019t until several hours later. When we came back later to pick them up, the bellman retrieved out luggage from behind locked doors and put them into the taxi for us. The service at the Tuscany front door was very good. My husband and I were very pleased with the Tuscany suites. Because it was my first time to Vegas, I\u2019d probably like stay at a few hotels on the strip to see what it\u2019s like, but after that I\u2019d probably return to the Tuscany because of how quiet, relaxing, clean, convenient it is and how large the rooms were.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Tuscany\u201d", "Author": "1funsize", "ReviewID": "UR23484894", "Content": "We stayed at the Tuscany from Dec. 31 throught Jan. 4th and loved it.

All rooms are accessible as being large with grab bars. However, the grab bars and hand held shower were in th tub, which my son cannot use. They have roll in showers, but there are no grab bars in them and no hand held showers. Also, when I asked for the bath chair they said they had, I was told that they only have one and would see if it was available. They did find one, but it is not very stable so I would suggest bringing your own or renting one. Also, you have to go outside to get to your rooms and some are quite far away from the casino. So overall, if you are a disabled traveler, I would be very specific about your accomodations before booking a room. In the end, they did accomodate us with a wonderful two bedroom suite with a roll in shower. However, as I stated before, there were no grab bars or hand held shower in it, so we still had to punt.

It was great! We loved the room. You can see the from the pictures the layout. I'm going to comment on things I read in these reviews from my perspective. Our comments: The pillows, bed was super comfortable (we got a king) - but the sheets are not fitted. While this did not prove a problem to me, as I don't move around much while sleeping, my husband didn't like the sheets pulling out from the foot of the bed. The towels were nice and plush - not the cheapo white stiff variety, but plush. We got plenty of them. The bathroom had 3 lights - only one is connected to the fan - so, come on people, use the other two lights if you don't want the fan on! There is a very bright light over the sink area (which had a medicine cabinet for storage) and also a heat lamp-type light between the tub and shower area. The one thing I didn't like about the shower area is that is had no shelf space for shampoo/conditioner, etc. It only had a soap dish, but no place to store your razor etc. And the bottom was angled toward the drain in the center, so no flat area either. The shampoo was great; the conditioner was not something I could use on my long hair (I've learned to bring my own from home). The toilet paper was 2-ply quilted - so not the cheapee stuff some people complained about. Yes, the TV had 14 channels and three were casino oriented - but it also had CNN, the 4 major networks, TNT movie channel, a Spanish channel, PBS, ESPN, and two others. Not bad. The kitchen was great. We got a microwave first thing (just ask for one when you check in and it'll be delivered right away), coffeemaker, decent sized frig and two burners. Plenty of cabinet space. But, of course, you have to bring your own dishes, utensils, etc. Noone in these reviews commented on the fitness center much - I can see why because its rarely used. We used it 20 of 28 days on our trip and rarely saw anyone else in there. It also was great. It's its own separate building and has two areas - the cardio and weights. The cardio area had two treadmills, two or three bikes and one stairstepper. The TV and one stairstepper machine were broken. In the other area, there were three leg machines (curl, press and extension) and 5 other upper body machines plus an ab cruncher machine. In addition, there were two benches and free weights (no bars). Dumbbells started at 5' and went to 50'. Alas, the common weights, the 15', 20' and one 40' were missing. It provided us with great workouts. I took some photos and plan to download them to here, so look for those soon. There is a lap pool and a regular pool. plus two jacuzzis. Too cool to swim in Nov/dec, but we had 72-77 degree weather, so hung out and read there. Oh, they provide a complimentary USA Today newspaper at the front desk. Just get there before 9:30am, otherwise the supply is gone. Restaurants were okay. We mainly ate at Marilyns - they have a $3.99 steak and eggs b'fast from 12-5am - and it was massive, but the steaks were marginal. Other food was okay. Nothing great. Ate at the Mex restaurant twice - had these fish tacos which were fabulous. Also a steak burrito that was just okay. Never ate at the Italian restaurant. Looked rather pricey to me. The walk - yes, its about a 10 min walk to the Strip. We did it numerous times. One block off the Strip up and down it, you find trash, the low-life, beggars, racks of girlie magazines, etc. So, this area is no exception. So, if you don't mind the hike (bring good shoes) - you get to the real heart of the Strip in 10 min. I just wouldn't do it alone. We had a car - and this was both a plus and minus. You got wheels so can travel, but oftentimes the traffic is so thick and drivers are so crazy, that you could almost walk faster and prefer not to go anywhere because the driving is so hazardous. Vegas is laid out well, but each light takes so long to get thru because you have to wait for each set of turn lanes to go. Anyways, after midnight the roads are good. and better between 9am and 3pm. If you are into dancing and are of the 40+ crowd or would rather not stand around in a 20+ crowd listening to ear-deafening rap and hiphop or have to buy $400 bottle-service VIP areas, write me and I'll give you some good locations to go. Overall, we'd definately stay there again. We loved not having to eat out all the time, having our car right outside our door, and having a short walk to our room. Also, you never had to set foot in a smokey casino if you didn't want to.

Myself and my long term partner got married while we were there, we didn't use tuscanny chapel all though it did look beautiful, we used little chapel of the flowers it was brilliant, We had the most fantastic holiday ,also there was some of my family with us, they all loved Tuscanny suites and we all loved Las vegas", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rohnert Park, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place!\u201d", "Author": "melfarinha", "ReviewID": "UR19677978", "Content": "This hotel was great!

This place may have once been an apartment complex or a timeshare. There were many buildings with walkways (3 stories high with elevators). The room was incredibly enormous and clean and the king bed was extremely comfortable. Our safe and hairdryer were both broken, but maintenance came immediately and replaced both of them. The A/C worked just fine. The bathroom was HUGE and also very clean. There was a large room with a vanity/sink area, separate shower stall and separate bathtub..then another door where the toilet was. Our room was at the end of the hallway.. right near the doorway of the building and also the elevator, but it was still very quiet there even though the hotel was full. We had a fridge and a microwave, which came in handy when we brought home some leftovers from our meals. We were in Building O which was a very short walk to the main pool and casino and main building. What we liked best was the size of the room, comfortable bed, cleanliness and the fact that it was nice and quiet (away from all the hustle and bustle of the strip). It is located right behind Bally's about two blocks down (may be a little bit of a walk for some to get to the strip, but it could be done easily for others). We needed handicap parking, but sometimes those spots were taken some times, and we had to park a little further away from our building, but still not very far. Having a car rental was great because we could go anywhere..and used many of the side streets and back roads to get to the main hotels on the strip..many of which do have a back entrance. We didn't eat there, but we did like Terribles..one block down, which had great deals on their buffets ($4.99 breakfast..$9.99 or 12.99 for dinner). There's also tons of other places to eat on this street (Flamingo Road) and in walking distance to the hotel. Pool area was lovely and also very quiet and met up with some nice poeple. There were plenty of towels and lounge chairs..and also plenty of palm trees with shade if the sun was too much (temps were 103 degrees). Also, we booked via their website and received great deal for under $50/night plus tax. We couldn't figure out what all the negativity on this place was about..

We booked through tripres.com. Not sure I'd use them again. Would probably go right through hotel. The hotel puts a $60- deposit on each room on your credit card for incidentals, etc. We did get it all back later. This hotel is located on Flamingo Rd about 1- 1/2 blocks from the strip. Tuscany is an all Suites hotel. But when you book, make sure and tell them exactly what you want. If you want a king size bed, or two doubles. Also specify if you need a microwave/cook top or not. I believe each room comes with a coffee maker and small refrigerator though. We had two double suites. I wanted a kind and a double, but apparently they are not located near one another, so I settled for doubles. I was told by (tripres) that 6 people could fit into suite. This is only correct if you get a king suite with a pull out couch and order for an additional fee a roll away. Roll-aways are not allowed in rooms that have 2 beds per NV law (?) Check in/out was rather quick as the desk has several agents working. Your room key gets you into the buildings and the pool area. Towels are provided. The rooms were both clean and contained 2 double beds, small breakfast table, refrigerator, sink, coffee maker. The toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom. The bathroom has stand up shower. Soaking tub. (nothing fancy, just a normal tub by itself. ) Nice size sink and vanity combo. Suite is somewhere around 500 sq feet. We were in bldg D the closest to strip. Parking was a breeze and not far to walk from your vehicle unlike many Las Vegas hotels. The pool was any easy walk and by the way was open until 10pm. I have been told that most LV hotel pools are only open until 7pm. You can only enter from Flamingo Rd, so do not try and get in from the street behind as you will be able to squeeze in between fence if you are walking. There is a nice little casino here as well as 3 restaurants. We signed up for the players club. We spent very little honestly, but were able to get most of it back in either restaurant or gift shop comps! The kids ate pizza from the pizza restaurant. They weren't impressed, but I think it was more of a thin Italian style pizza than what they were used to. Check out is btwn 11am-12 unless prior arrangements are made. We ended up getting stuck at a time share presentation, but had left our teen age kids the credit card and all keys. Sadly, they had to wait over 2 hrs in the lobby, but were able to check out with no problems. This hotel is the perfect location for checking out all sorts of locations around the town. Caesars and the Flamingo are within 10 minutes. There is both a AM /PM and 7/11 right around the block. Another sleeper of a casino just a little further up Flamingo is Terrible 's Casino. Sign up for their players card. It's a good deal! Had both the breakfast and dinner buffets there. Not bad at all. General tips about travel here. Bring bottled water. The hottest it got was 121 deg. It was 90deg at 0700. Stopped at a shop in Cesar's for bottled water (2 water +1 Gatorade= $14.50) NO I did not pay such a price. Went to McDonald's and got one there. You can also buy from the locals for $1 bottle. Fremont area gift shops you can get for up to 3 for a buck! Don't try and see everything in one day/night. Space it out. Most of the strip hotels you can park in the valet parking and just tip a couple/few dollars. So much easier than 'self parking'! Wish we would have tried this sooner in the trip! Time shares: We did two. first one got 6 tickets to the Secret Garden and $20 match play at Tropicana. Not bad. Second place got $200. Was quite a bit longer than the first and more of a hard sell. Everywhere you see free info on tours, discounted tours, etc, read timeshare! This is fine if you have the time and either could possibly be interested in timeshares or just want the gifts. Haggle with them for better stuff. And when they say it's just a few blocks away, just laugh. They will all be way down past the airport, \"which will some day be the center of the strip\"!

Large with sitting area and small dining room table. It had a small dorm fridge and coffee maker. I had heard that they had stovetops and/or microwaves. We had neither but when I asked at the desk for a microwave, I had one when we got back from dinner. Be advised, that this is not a condo.,,I t does NOT have plates, silverware, pots or ANY type of cooking utensils. We did a quick trip to superWalmart down on Boulder Highway. I bought a toaster for $6, and a blender for $13 along with paper plates,plastic silverware and food. We saved a tremendous amount of money by having breakfast and some lunches by the pool. Housekeeping was spotty, We always had our beds made and towels. But weekday housekeeping staff cleaned up more than the weekend staff. No matter, it was clean. We had a first floor room, I had read that the ceiling/floors were not soundproof. Yes, we heard the people above us, but we werent in the room long enough for it to be an issue. Limited TV stations, maybe 10-13 or so,,,but had all the basic channels, but no premium ones, not a problem for us, We were out every night anyhow. The doors were a bit weird. The handles worked better pulling them up instead of pushing down. Had to wiggle the cards a few times to get it to unlock, and they demagnetized very easy. Had to have ours replaced once, others had theirs replaced a dozen times. Slots were tight, didnt see many people winning but with the slow economic times, I figured they wouldnt be loose anyway. They could have had more chairs around the pool. Our group had 800+ people, maybe only less than 100 chairs. The mexican restaurant was great, Large portions,Good food! Marilyns Cafe,,,not good.

Another time we went there with friends, I got the meatloaf, It was inediblle. Others liked the wings and pancakes, we didnt give them another chance. We had a car so we could leave hotel for dinner.

I noticed the mixed reviews ahead of time, and in general I agree with the accuracy of remarks, both good and bad. I accompanied my husband to a 3 day convention here. The hotel would not allow coffee urns in the meeting rooms; they wanted people to leave (therefore missing part of) their workshops to go elsewhere to buy coffees. Tuscan Gardens restaurant is okay, and pricey: no modest sized side salads included; we had to pay about 7 bucks a la carte for an unnecessarily generous salad to accompany our platters. We stayed in Building L. Upon arriving we got maintenance to come immediately to replace the smoke detector battery, which was chirping. He also did something right away about the stall shower door, which kept popping ajar. Near the end of our 5 night stay, it was popping open again. We did not rest well. We could hear people \"stomping\" around on the 3rd floor above us early in the morning and also late at night. The bed was soft and saggy, made up with thin bed sheets. After awhile I got used to the sound of the jet planes taking off from the airport, but if I woke up too early, between the saggy bed, foot-stomping coming from above, and the jets taking off every few minutes, I couldn't fall back to sleep. Our a/c unit was quiet enough, but when walking outside we noticed another unit whining away in an irritating fashion. Both our bath fans whined at a very high pitch that made us feel frazzled - the one in the water closet and the other in the main bathroom. The coarseness of our first roll of no-frills, unbleached toilet paper in our room had us making jokes about planing logs; all the public rest rooms on The Strip used a better quality. Fortunately our 2nd roll of white paper was a little bit better.

You can park near your building, which is impossible on the Strip, and nice if you're traveling with lots of gear. Nice pool area without crowds. A very friendly and helpful staff.

Wi-Fi is available only by paying an extra daily charge. These may be minor considerations to some travelers, but may be significant to others who might deliberately choose a suite hotel. LOCATION: This was very important to me. It's about a ten minute walk to the Strip and to the Monorail. And at the Strip, you're at the convergence of Bally's, Paris, Bellagio, Caesar's, and the Flamingo. A great location. You can do a lot within walking distance. Flamingo Road has a sidewalk, and pedestrian crossings, but it is basically a concrete canyon with a six-lane highway and car exhaust running through it. You may encounter a panhandler or a drunk or prostitute on your walk over to the Strip. For a big city person, this is nothing, but it may frighten someone from a more sheltered background. You can always take a cab. Not far from the airport, either. My cab to the hotel from the airport was $13.50 plus tip.

The location is fine, near the Westin and Bally's, and around the corner there's a 7-11. If you plan on gambling at the hotel, join the Player's Club, since you'll get about $5 free slot play to pass the time. There are A LOT of penny slot machines, and it seemed a pretty popular place for the older crowds. Decent selection of places to eat, including Mexican food at The Cantina. The hotel had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, which made the cost of dinner for two fajitas about $12. There's also a Lawry's directly across the street, and more restaurants eastt of the strip on Flamingo (Roy's, Morton's), which is great if you want to eat elsewhere and avoid the strip traffic.

For $115 a night EACH for four rooms...a dump. The carpet is old and thread bare. When I checked in I had two coffee makers. One didn't work at all and the other's basket didn't fit. The shower door didn't close. I called to the desk (the guest services button on the phone doesn't work) and they asked me if I wanted the shower door fixed? Well, I said, don't you?

The breakfast is usually okay but today was dreadful. Filled with convention goers, the waiter brought two of our party of five what they ordered. One person didn't get milk with their cereal. Another didn't get his cereal at all, or coffee, we kept trying to flag him back unsuccessfully, though he acknowledged the short order then spent 15 minutes waiting other tables. Oh, except the table next to us who didn't even get to order for half an hour. So the restaurant seemed to be filled with frazzled, late business people. Last year we ate at the Cantina and I've had better tv dinners. Tonight we did eat at the Italian restaurant and the food was better than average and the service was nice. I just went down to get a soda out of the machine and it wouldn't take bills. I went up to the 2nd floor and there is no machine at all.

No microwave, no pots, pans, plates, silverware. You will save no money by thinking you can cook in here. The couch and chair are uncomfortable.

The only thing that I can recommend is having the parking so close & accessible to the rooms, although the good spots usually fill up early & if you drive for a show, you will end up parking on the outside loop. I almost forgot, one night we ordered a large pizza from the pizza snack bar/pizza spot they have that services the pool, sells coffee drinks, and more and we got major diarreah after eating the pizza. We ate some meals in the Coffee Shop inside, like breakfast and late night snacks, and they were pretty good. One more comment, for families, the rooms usually have two double beds -- we think they are way too small for adults to be comfortable, and this is really unnecessary since the rooms are large enough to accomodate two Queens. This is a major complaint for us. That is why we booked the King room with the Queen sofa sleeper for the kids. They normally don't put mattress pads on the sofa bed mattresses & they are all stained up & gross. I wouldn't ever go back.

For those sensitive to traffic noise, you may want to consider another building. Being city folks, we are immune to it :-) The room was convenient and clean; I believe it was a recently renovated one. We had a small stove top and micro-wave.

Because my husband takes insulin (requiring refrigeration), we called the front desk to inquire about the settings. When informed of the problem, a maintenance man showed up immediately, and they were so kind as to completely change out the unit. The pool area remains closed for repairs right now. Not much luck playing slots, but the casino is always fun. As always, Marilyn's cafe offered decent food at reasonable prices; and the Mexican cantina offered same.

I booked directly because the various travel websites cannot guarantee me an accessible room The bathroom was roomy and had both a seperate shower (without access) and a tub with an attached flip up bath bench. No curtain on the tub but there is a handheld shower. Be aware that the bath bench is somewhat low and there is no mechanism to make it higher so if bad hips are a problem that could be too low. Sink is open at the bottom (no vanity to block a wheelchair) and the toilet is standard height but has wall bars as usual. I still needed to assist my mother to go to the bathroom but I expect that when away from home. The room itself was spacious and clean. Request a microwave on arrival and you can get some things from a grocery store (about a mile down Flamingo there is an Albertsons) to make quick breakfasts and late nite snacks! Buy water too since a bottle in the machine was 1.50. My refrigerator was missing a leg and so it rocked a little--I suppose they would have brought a new one but I did not ask. My hair dryer in the bathroom was shorting out and was replaced that day. There are no kitchen supplies except some cups so plan on getting or bringing some flatware and paper plates if you plan to eat in the room. Cups are foam and plastic (for all of you who have recently seen news reports of hotels using glass and improperly cleaning them). Coffee makers in room are 4 cuppers and the coffee pods were tasty. Beds: Comfy and clean. Mom's was a little short sheeted- maybe an inch or two but no big deal. Pillow were fluffy. The only thing I will say about the bed are is that since this was an accessible room, it would have been nice to have a rail on the wall by the bed to hold on for balance--the hanger rack was there and is not a secure device to hold onto (never is--don't try it at home either!). Service was about average. No rudeness but I didn't see anyone going out of the way for us either. Our flight was cancelled so they did give me an extra hour grace on checkout. Maids respected the do not disturb signs. Several did not speak English but we got along with hand signs and motions. Coupon wise, at check-in, you get a packet and also one when you sign up in the casino. Our free souvenir was dice. Casino was smaller but adequate and they were kind enough to wait until after midnite to keep the player club open so my niece who turned 21 could get her card. This hotel in relation to the strip is a bit long if you are disabled but if you can handle the 3 block walk it is fine. It was just a little long to do in a chair so we took the car place to place. Be aware that the hotel is actually several buildings on the land which are connected by cement paths but are outdoors. To get to the main desk and casino/restaurants, you need to go outside. Security is maintained in the indiviual buildings by use of your room card to gain access. We only sampled Marilyns Cafe for food but it was good.

Like my title says, you can do better in Vegas. The Tuscany is a so-so hotel off the strip. Fine if you have no expectations, but disappointing if you are hoping for a nice hotel. Pros: Each room is a suite, so you can sleep a family comfortably (there's also a couch). Rooms are very large; the bathroom has a separate tub and shower. There is also a kitchenette with empty fridge (no mini-bar so you can store your leftovers), microwave, and double burners. You can park close to your room as the hotel is made up of numerous small buildings, named alphabetically (A, B, C etc.), and parking is on the periphery. The hotel offers video checkout. I never felt unsafe on the property. Cons: Everything else. Hotel is off the strip (not far, but not walking distance). Hotel is loud. These rooms have the thinnest walls and floors. There are 3 floors in each building, so tell the front desk when you check in that you want a room on the third floor. Trust me, you can hear everything on the first floor, which was where we were first assigned. Let's see, what else... You get a kitchenette, but no pots, pan, plates, or silverware. Basically, you can't use it; it's just for show. Call down to the front desk and they won't provide you with anything. We asked for a fork to eat the leftovers we had brought home from their restaurant. The front desk transferred us to room service who told us they could not provide us with silverware unless we ordered room service. What's the point of providing a kitchenette if you won't let guests use it? Case in point: Our double burners were brand new. In-room coffee is terrible, it tastes like coffee-flavored water - no exaggeration! FYI: There is a Starbucks at Flamingo and Paradise. Housekeeping is also terrible. We returned the first day to find our paper cups with coffee still sitting out on the table, coffee maker unemptied, etc. Hotel restaurants: We tried to have lunch on a Friday at the hotel, and their Italian restaurant, Tuscany, is only open for dinner. The sports bar was not open either. We ended up going to Marilyn's Cafe for slow service and an incompetent waitress. Food was fine but skip it if you want decent service. We tried dropping by the coffee shop, Beachfront Coffee, to grab a quick sandwich but the meats in the sandwiches were indecipherable in the display case. Not a good sign! Our deadbolt popped out and we couldn't close the door to leave. Apparently, this happens a lot, in other guestrooms too. You have to twist the handles this way or that way - try twisting both the indoor and outdoor handles at the same time (that worked for us; other people had different techniques). Our door handles were about ready to fall off too. Wake up call line doesn't work. You're put on hold forever to get to the front desk. Our phone started acting funny and all the front desk people could say was, \"Your phone isn't working, I can't hear you. I can't hear you!\" No offer to send someone to fix our phone. Just \"I can't hear you.\" On a side note, take a look at the paintings in the room. Our room had 4 paintings, 2 of which were the exact same print. Who decorated these rooms?? All in all, the hotel is adequate if you're on a budget and really don't care where you lay your head at night. We didn't see any insects and our toilet flushed fine and we had hot water, heating, and AC.

They are upgrading the rooms as we had a new sofa and chair. We seen sofa's being removed from other blocks by the dozen. During our stay the pool was closed for two days without much explanation. As a result the lap pool was overcrowded and no sun beds for us to use. We went to the Platinum Hotel next door and asked if we could use their pool, which they kindly agreed to. What a difference to see a beautiful chic pool area with a seriously heated pool which was both indoors and outdoors and the most comfortable sun beds. Anyway back to the Tuscany. The pool area was OK with small towels provided: sun beds easily available at all times of the day although busier at weekends. The pool bar has been closed down and I seen people measuring the pool area which is due to be refurbished. We had no complaints about the hotel or the restaurants. There is one bar with live music in the evening (same every night), but the female client\u00e8le at the weekends is somewhat questionable. Please note that the prices at the bars in the Tuscany were almost half the price of bars on the Strip, except if you are gambling then the drinks are free. We only walked to the Strip once as we had just missed the bus and would not recommend the walk as we felt safety was an issue late at night. We bought a 30 day unlimited pass for the CAT/Deuce buses for 40 dollars at the Moneytree on E Flamingo Road which meant that we did not have to buy a daily pass at 5 dollars. We used the concierge at the hotel 3 times and found them to be informative and helpful. On our last day when we went to shower before leaving there was no water. We contacted reception who said there had been an emergency and they had to shut off the water. They phoned back within 2 minutes and offered us another room in another block and a member of staff brought the key to us within 5 minutes. Overall we had a fantastic holiday and there are unlimited things to do in Vegas even for 2 weeks. I would recommend the Tuscany for the budget minded traveler who is prepared to stay off the Strip which is a few minutes on the bus compared to others on the South Strip which would take a long time on the Deuce to the main part of the Strip.", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "OR", "Title": "\u201cBetter Values Elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "westnw", "ReviewID": "UR8852304", "Content": "Rough around the edges, not particularly clean, front desk understaffed, unfriendly bar tenders in the casino, cold bacon and eggs for breakfast in the coffee shop after long wait for service.

What we found is the Tuscany: a GREAT place for a very good price! You don't need to go to one of these big, fat Strip-Hotels. Just a 15 min walk from the Strip on Flamingo road you find this wonderful Hotel. Firstly, the rooms: Huge, nicely set, with TV, fridge, kitchenette, closet, a couch, 2 extra tabels w/ chairs! Great! Room was clean too, beds are comfortable. In the later evening you easily can relax a little on the couch before you go to bed...nice. Bathroom was very big and very clean too! The pool area is very nice too, lots of palm trees, a pool bar, a nicely shaped pool and a jacuzzi. But the pool area is not that big. So come early for a good seat....or just trust your luck...and you still can get a good spot! Check-In was normal. But too bad you can't check-in before 3pm. Except you pay extra. But you can enjoy the town until then or hang around the pool or the Casino! There is a lot of parking lots. All around the Hotel. If you look around carefully, you could catch a shady space for you beloved car (because Nevada is hot in Summer!!!). We never really ate at the Hotel. Just one time we cought some salad and Burger in Marilyn's Restaurant in the Hotel. Salad was alright. But my Burger! Fries have been hotter than the meat. But both Burger and Fries way too soft!

My reservation was for two adults and two toddlers. I also informed the Tuscany of the number of occupants in the room when I checked in, because my sister was arriving later than me and was going to be checking in separately. o When I checked into the room, I had to request extra towels, because there were not enough towels for the room occupants. o Each day, after housekeeping serviced the room (with inadequate cleaning), we had to call the front desk to request more towels. Consistently, each day, there were not enough towels for the room occupants. o When more towels were delivered, often the gentleman would wait awkwardly for a tip. Since I consider this a basic service of the room, not an added luxury or special request, I found this to be rude. * When I checked in, I requested two cribs. The cribs were initially delivered and set-up with sheets very promptly and the sheets were put on the foam mattress so the children could sleep on the sheets. After the first day, housekeeping would strip the crib foam mattress and would not replace the sheets. This would cause us to call the front desk to request sheets for the crib each time that housekeeping visited the room and cleaned, inadequately. o When the sheets were brought to the room, I had to insist that the staff put them on the crib. This should be standard practice. Again, the staff waited for a tip. * On Wednesday the 22nd, I went to dinner at Marilyn\u2019s Caf\u00e9. The meal was good; however, when I tried to pay, the server was not able to charge my card. He informed me that I needed to pay at the front of the restaurant because his machine was down. I waited at the front of the restaurant for 30 minutes trying to pay for my meal because the staff was unable to get the machines working and didn\u2019t start charging the meals to the room for almost half an hour. This was unacceptable. The restaurant should be prepared for simple things like credit card machine malfunctions. * I checked in on Sunday the 19th and my room was not vacuumed until the following Sunday, the 26th. o I complained to the housekeeper in building C on Friday the 23th, and the room was not vacuumed. o I complained again to the housekeeper in building C on the morning of the 24th and informed her that we would be gone until the evening and requested that the room be vacuumed. When we returned at 10pm that evening; the room had not been vacuumed. o I immediately complained to Vic at the front desk. I also informed Vic about my dissatisfaction with Marilyn\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and about my further dissatisfaction with housekeeping for the towels and sheets. Vic gave me a $40 comp to return to Marilyn\u2019s and requested that I wait until the next morning to have to room vacuumed. Vic was concerned about the late hour and disturbing other guests with the noise from the vacuum. I understood his concern and agreed. Vic put in a notice to housekeeping to have the room vacuumed first thing on Sunday morning. (Vic\u2019s customer service was the best in the hotel.) o At about noon on Sunday, I informed the housekeeper in building C that I would be taking the boys to the pool and would return in approximately 2 hours. I requested that she vacuum the room while I was gone. When I returned at 2:45 pm, my room had not been vacuumed. My sister complained to Tara in the Concierge office and Tara informed her that there was nothing she could do except try to get housekeeping to vacuum. At this time, I joined my sister in Tara\u2019s office, with the boys in a stroller. When I initially attempted to talk to Tara, she rolled her eye at me as if I were just another customer trying to get a discount by complaining. Each time I tried to explain my concerns to Tara, she interrupted me. I found it extremely rude that she continued to interrupt me and both of our voices elevated during the discussion. She stated that if I didn\u2019t lower my voice she would call security because customers could hear us in the lobby. I told her it wasn\u2019t my intent to yell, but that I didn\u2019t care about the customer service for the other guests anymore, because the hotel hadn\u2019t showed any customer service for me yet. As Tara called security, she stated, \u201cWhat kind of parent would bring her child down here to complain? What kind of parenting skills are you teaching your child?\u201d I found this comment to be a personal attack on me and extremely inappropriate. My husband is currently serving on active duty in the Army and is deployed. My son stays with me, even when I travel, because I try to be the best Mom that I can be. Her comment was completely offensive to me. No manager, in any profession, should personally attack a customer or question their parenting skills as an easy way to abort a conflict. * Before I arrived at the Tuscany, I coordinate to have a package shipped to meet me at the hotel. I called ahead to the front desk before I departed for Las Vegas and the front desk said that it would not be a problem to receive and hold a package for a guest. When I checked in, I was told that the bell desk receives and holds all packages. I informed the bell desk of the pending arrival of my package and continued to call each day until my package arrived on Tuesday the 21st. On Saturday the 25th, I finally received the message that my package had arrived. When I returned from my day trip that day, the message light on the phone was blinking and when I called to get instructions on checking the voice mail, I was informed of the message for the package. Now, this incident was relatively harmless, because I was diligent about tracking my package.

My husband and I stayed for 3 nights and we'd stay here again. The upsides: The room was cheap, yet clean, large, quiet, and comfortable. The bathroom was nicely designed (very large with tub and separate shower). The restaurants were good and affordable - my husband especially liked the Mexican. The gift shop is open all hours and was very handy for forgotten toothpaste, magazines, booze, souvenirs, etc. The pool and hottub were very clean, plenty of chairs, radio music playing, open long hours (7am-10pm) and hardly any children at this time of year, thankfully. We purchased beers/coolers at a local mart (2 blocks away), kept them cold in our fridge, and brought them down to the pool area in a bag with ice. We walked to and from the closest strip hotels (3 long blocks) - to Caesar's, Flamingo, Bally's, Bellagio. We walked to and from NY, NY and MGM but I wouldn't recommend this to everyone (about 2 miles). Lawry's Steak house is across the street. Tuscany is fairly close to the Hard Rock Hotel (about 3 blocks), which has great casino/lounge/nightclub/rock memorabilia/Nobu restaurant to check out. The Planet Hollywood buffet (Spice Market Buffet) is killer and highly recommended (voted best buffet for 2007). Cab fares to Treasure Island, Wynn: $8, Fremont St. (downtown): $15, Premium outlet mall (downtown): $17. The downsides: slow check-in, no shuttle to the strip so you must be able to trek fair distances.

Located right next door to Terribles Casino, it's a short walk to the Hard Rock Casino, and an even shorter walk to one of the best museums I've ever seen, the Nuclear Testing Museum. In addition, the Suites are only about 10 mins away from the McCarran airport. This property is both comfortable and accommodating. Our room was not fancy, but very large with a kitchenette, sofabed, and sleeper chair. View was terrible, but we didn't care. We were on the bottom floor, and we weren't there for the view anyway. Front desk staff was outstanding in speed and courtesy. Check-in was smooth, directions to our suite were clear, and any further services were prompt and friendly. LOTS of parking spaces with easy access to our room. The suites are old but not unattractive. We had a run-on toilet, a light fixture hanging from the ceiling, and a TV remote that wouldn't work (all fixed as soon as we complained). The kitchenette does NOT come equipped with any supplies except the fridge, the hotplate, and the sink. Bring or buy something to cook in, utensils, and anything else you will need for your stay. Crank up the fridge coolness as soon as you arrive to ensure cold drinks. The grounds are well kept, and the pool area is attractive. The lap pool is functional, but one BIG complaint was the green slimy fungus growing on the tile in the hot tub. I mentioned this to the staff when we checked out; the front desk person seemed to take it seriously and promised to do something to correct this health issue. It was strange to see the hot tub in such bad shape since the pool and lap pool are tidy and cleaned regularly. I spoke to the pool boy who was friendly and forthcoming. He pointed out the filtering system and how it worked. I asked because of the strange salty taste in the pool water. I surmised it was water softening salts -- but that's a guess. My husband and I are not hard to please, but we are fussy about cleanliness and smells. Our room was impeccably clean and was clear of any odors. We love the casino here, too. It is small and smoky but the Players' loyalty card results in a whack of freebies. We never had to pay for a meal. The Mexican restaurant on-site is terrific. We had the Taco Burgers, the Chicken Quesdillas, and Cheese Enchilladas. All delicious, as are their fresh tortilla chips and fresh salsa served with the meals. Service is quick and friendly throughout this establishment. In addition, if you do want to do the strip, it is a short bus ride, walk, cab ride, or rental car ride up to the Strip (Flamingo runs alongside Bally's). We will stay here again in a heartbeat. We celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here and hope to celebrate many more anniversaries here in years to come. Hint #1: Get a Players Club Card immediately. You are going to probably gamble anyway, so why not earn points towards food. We did that here...and we did it down the road at Terribles. Hint #2: Go, go, go to the Atomic Testing Museum (just walk up the street). With or without kids, this is amazing. We loved the interactive stations.

The bathroom was immaculate, nicely arranged so two people could comfortably move around. separate shower, soaking tub and separate toilet was nice. This property was obviously from the looks to have once been apartments, converted to hotel rooms. Pools...they have a lap pool, which when I called was told it was the \"adult\" pool and the other was more the \"family\" pool. I ended up not using either of the pools because they both almost had families with kids in them. This is not the atmosphere I enjoy. The main pool had a cute thatched roof pool bar, and the website advertises pool side drinks brought to you, but the entire week we were there, we nary saw one person out there making or serving drinks. Casino...was nice...slight smokey smell, but we understood that the casino was non-smoking entirely, and from what I had read on this site, but we did encounter several people at slots smoking and no one said or did anything, so is it non or not? The slots paid nothing...so very little of our play was in there. we are not big gamblers anyway, so no loss there anyway. and we had the Casino waitresses walk so fast past us, we could not even get a drink while we were playing.

The walk to the STRIP took my husband and I 15 minutes which was not too bad considering we would be walking anyway. The room was a nice size and really enjoyed the separate toilet from the shower and vanity area. The casino was a nice size considering the hotel.

We found it really quiet and peaceful as long as you stayed out of the main building or the pool area which is where you want it to have action. The landscaping was so beautiful. We especially enjoyed the pool area. We didn't eat at any of the hotel's restaurants but I did visit the gift shop for snacks and it was nice that it was open late.

The Tuscany is just 2 long blocks behind the Bally's Resort on the strip...which takes about 10 minutes to walk. If you buy the deuce bus ticket it also covers the #202 line going East and West in front of the Tuscany...so we walked out front to the bus stop then over to the strip. Don't make the same mistake we made by thinking the bus going East somehow turns around and then goes West. If you're going West to the strip you need to leave the Tuscany...cross the street and get on that bus #202 going west to the strip. In other words...each bus is like a one way going in the direction you want to go. The Tuscany has a nice pool and we had an amazing Italian dinner at the nicer restaurant by the front lobby.

As a result the rooms have consistent style and are equipped with 2-ring hob, fridge/freezer, sink, coffee machine. However, crockery, cooking utensils etc are not supplied - if you wish to use the kitchenette, bring your own! Large comfortable and clean king bed, with 2 sofas and coffee table in addition to a dining table. More than big enough for two adults! Air-conditioning appears to be an after thought with a wall attached A/C unit. Although very effective, ours was very noisy - it's a fairly consistent drone, so its easy enough to sleep through overnight. Maids cleaned rooms daily making beds, replacing towels etc and arrived at a reasonable time which was nice so we weren't disturbed early! Bathroom Bath, separate shower, separate toilet were all spotless and modern. Shower was hot when required. Large bathroom with large wall mirror. Again, noisy extraction fans, but no big deal as they only come on when you turn the lights on. Location 2 blocks from the strip. Safe 10 minute walk to/from strip along busy Flamingo road. No shade makes for a hot walk during the day. Staff I get the impression that staff are friendly and approachable for \"run of the mill\" enquiries, however when asking for advice and help over and above normal duties, I encountered attitude. Not a problem as long as you stick to your guns. The concierge will help you with attractions and bookings for shows etc. We enquired about a Grand Canyon helicopter flight. My advice is use them for the information, but book direct with the company rather than through the hotel, we saved $70 on our trip. Facilities Pool large, good jaccuzi. Clean towels are provided. They seem to leave the radio on all day, which can be annoying if you are right by the speaker! Very clean and plenty of sun loungers and space. Even at \"93%\" occupancy, the pool was never busy. Seem to have good facilities for conferences, meetings and weddings. Restaurants Mexican restaurant looks good on paper, but is disappointing. Not recommended. The Tuscany Gardens Italian has a good atmosphere, food is good with good service. Use the 30% off voucher they offer on arrival and the price becomes reasonable also. Cafe does a good breakfast 24/7, with quick and friendly service. It seemed popular with gamers and guests alike. Casino We didn't visit for the casino and had no intention of gambling. Smells slightly smoky, although the whole hotel is now non smoking (apart from the bar), it was clear it wasn't always that way. Overall Cheaper, good value off-the strip hotel.

We knew we didn't want to be constantly surrounded by people and the noise of the strip, so after reading the reviews on this site we chose the Tuscany Suites. We found it was perfect for what we wanted. We could walk to the strip (about 1/2 mile, but get a taxi if you don't want to walk in the heat) and if we didn't want to eat in one of the restaurants in the complex (there were 3), we could walk across the street to Lawry's, McCormick & Schmicks, or Gordon Biersch (?); go around the corner to Ellis Island for their excellent BBQ joint; or walk a block to an old-school Italian restaurant. We arrived at 1:30 and were told checking in early would require an additional $10 fee, so we elected to wait until 3:00. The desk clerk graciously offered to pre-check us in and assign us a room and we could return at 2:30 for the keys. In the meantime we drove about a mile east to an Albertson's market and stocked up on groceries. Our room was on the 3rd floor of building C, away from the main street. It overlooked the building next door but that was OK. As mentioned before, the room was huge with king bed, a dining table, couch, chair, desk, and a small kitchen area with sink and refrigerator (no microwave but someone mentioned in an earlier post that one could be requested but we didn't ask). Our only issue with the room was that the bed was short-sheeted and I found myself remaking it every night (why don't all hotels use fitted sheets??). The bathroom was very large with a tub, separate shower, large vanity area, and the toilet was in a separate room (I loved this). There was also an ironing board and iron in the ample closet. The grounds were very pretty with lush plants and trees and the pool area was relaxing on a warm day with shade under the palm trees, and the large spa was just the right temperature. I especially loved the winding paths as I could take my early morning walks around the grounds without venturing on the street. There is also a fitness center with a lap pool and in the same building is a laundromat, which was handy since we were midtrip and I needed to wash a few things.

Although the hotel looks nice at first, the rooms have a motel feel. Check-in was easy, as we arrived late on a Friday. The complex is large with multiple buildings. We stayed at the northernmost end (D)? Clientele in this hotel mostly appeared to be 50+ years, although we did see some college/high school sports teams at the hotel. The room was on the bottom floor, and smelled slightly musty. It was large, with king size bed and scant pillows. Not the most comfortable sleep (but then who's sleeping in Vegas?) The TV had about six channels, no cable or satellite, and at least two channels dedicated to gambling or the hotel. Not much to watch. Also, there was no hotel guide in our room, so we had no idea of the amenities, closing times, or if room service existed. Bathroom: separate toilet/ sink room. Noisy ventilation & plumbing. Our toilet was plugged before we got there. The problem was fixed the next day (we didn't feel like hanging around all night). The shower was okay, but the shower head is too short for 6' tall people. Toiletries are minimal and very basic. Kitchenette: Coffee machine WOULD have been great had they actually put enough creamer packages for two people. I even left a note requesting an additional creamer, but this request was ignored. So we decided to skip the coffee the second day. Pool: big, inviting, very busy early on Saturday morning. Didn't actually swim, but plenty of other guests did. Food: Tuscany Gardens Italian: The veal with mushroom sauce was saltier than I normally like. Otherwise the food was good. Ambience was not very romantic, since right across the hall, the bar was really rocking. Beachfront Coffee has hardly anything to accompany a cup of coffee for breakfast. Go elsewhere. Location: yes, it is 2 LONG blocks from the strip. Realize that walking the strip is something that most people spend the day doing and know that you will be tired. A day pass for the monorail is useful to go back and forth. Discount coupons are in many of the Las Vegas guides you pick up. However, there will still be more walking from the station/to the station - there's always a casino you will have to go through. The walk along Flamingo from the strip is not very pretty (empty lots, a little rundown), but was safe enough. Bottom Line: We will try a hotel on the southern strip next time.

The roulette dealer was quite helpful in explaining the rules of the game to me. If you are new to gambling, definately start out in a smaller casino like this and go early in the morning. I was the only one at the table and gained valuable knowledge from this. Drinks at the casino bar are only $2.50-3.50 so it is really reasonable if you don't want to wait for the waitress to bring you one. Marilynn's Cafe is what I ate for breakfast twice. I got the contential breakfast one morning and some type of standard breakfast with fruit plate. Both were good. Decent price for breakfast in Vegas. The Tuscany Gardens was very pricey.

This is a very big room. Almost the biggest hotel room I\u2019ve ever been in. The bathroom is also very large with a separate toilet, a tub and a shower. This room also has a kitchenette. The facilities, pool, restaurants, and casino are all very good. Tuscany is very well located, just a couple of blocks away from \u201cThe Strip,\u201d on East Flamingo Road. Regretfully, if I come to Las Vegas again, I will look for another hotel. To start with, the door to the toilet room doesn\u2019t close and in fact must be held (with a knee, no less!) against the jam, if you want privacy. There is a large tile missing (6 x 6) on the baseboard. It\u2019s hard to figure how a supposedly good hotel would allow that to just slide. The shower head is placed for midgets but that\u2019s not unusual. The closet sliding door is off its track and although I put it back on to some extent, the problem is that the track is bent and loose making it unserviceable. The ice machines on all three floors of this building were not working when I arrived. Room service offered to send up ice for a charge. Guest services sent a maintenance man and sent me a plastic bag of ice. The first floor (my floor) ice maker is still not working but the second floor machine is, now. The furniture is really cheap to begin with and in my room, it is dirty and stained. I was in a friend\u2019s room and it\u2019s identical except it wasn\u2019t dirty so that I noticed. The TV is a standard 19\u201d with only 12 cable channels, and 2 more for the hotel\u2019s use. It does have pay-for-view, however. The bottom sheets are not fitted, they are flat sheets tucked in. I tend to rate a motel on this. A fitted sheet stays on the bed without shifting better but is more expensive and less versatile to the motel, only being a bottom sheet. This is really sub-par for a hotel of this supposed level. Last night\u2019s dinner in the Tuscany Gardens, the hotels main restaurant was very good. It gets busy so make reservations. This mornings Sunday Brunch Buffet in the Cantina was also very good with an accomplished omelet chef on station. A I said, I am sitting here disgruntled because I wanted a dish sent to my room from Tuscany Gardens but room service will only send food from the snack bar! That menu is exactly that \u2013 snacks! As I\u2019ve been typing this, a menu for a pizza place was shoved under my door and they do deliver! How they\u2019ll get into the building without a key is questionable but they got in to shove their menu under the door, didn\u2019t they. Disgruntled has gone to furious! I tried to call the pizza place and I can\u2019t get an outside line. It\u2019s unbelievable. The operator comes on and says she\u2019ll get me an outside line but when I try the local call, I get an error sound \u2013 NOT a busy sound. This place is down the street. I call back and tell her but she doesn\u2019t want to listen and hangs up on me! I spoke with the manager at the front desk and she offers to send a repair man to my room. Clearly, the problem isn\u2019t in my room. This is hopeless. I had to go out to my car to get my cell phone (I seldom use it). Of course it\u2019s roaming. I must be fair and admit that having once been a Marine Officer, my voice can be somewhat \u201cforceful.\u201d Still, the issues that brought me to be \u201cforceful\u201d should have never occurred. As I said, it is regretful that I cannot recommend this hotel because it could be a great facility. On a positive note, last night we took in \u201cFolies Bergere\u201d at the Tropicana.

From past experiences I confirmed our reservation days before arriving to avoid any unwanted surprises. This was my sister's first visit, and I wanted it to be really special, but at a hotel she and I would be comfortable with. Not overly priced like the strip hotels, in my opinion. Unfortunately, upon arrival we were told the room assigned to us was now occupied. Instead of the poolside one were were looking forward to, we were told only A, M and N were available. Went into N and now had further to walk, and only another building to look at which was disappointing. The first thing we noticed was the a/c and bathroom fans were extremely noisy. Good tip: Bring a flashlight so you won't wake anyone when you use it at night...very annoying! Good sized room with microwave and refrigerator which was nice. Queen beds, dishes and utensils would have been even better. Odd thing-our room was on one end of the building, and we could exit the end closest to the street and pool, but not enter and get up to our third floor on that side. So we made many back and forths the length of the building upon coming back to our room. Very slow service at Marilyn's Cafe when we ate there, with just okay food. Pizza place pizza was so-so...very cheesey, rather bland and luke warm. Gift shop necessities forgotten are expensive. AM/PM and 7-11 are also next door for odds and ends. We enjoyed the pool area immensely most every day; warm water and not too busy. Another snufoo was cocktail waitress never asked if we wanted something to drink at the pool, and we weren't sleeping with our eyes closed either! Someone else didn't do their job, because one morning the gates were still locked at the pool at 10 a.m. It took quite awhile for someone to get on it and let all of us waiting in. Sun time was on the clock for us. The grounds and parking lot at times had some trash and broken glass not picked up. Our building had a huge pile of torn out carpeting sitting for the five days we were there at the bottom of the stairs right before where we'd exit....very tacky. I always had hopes it would be picked up before we left, but it unfortunately never was. The vending machine dispensed bottled water, when we tried to get pop twice. Getting a taxi to and from the airport and to Ceasar's colliseum ran approximately $10-$15. Otherwise, we didn't find the walk to the strip overwhelming, we're use to walking when traveling, and we women luckily weren't bothered at 2 a.m. We only got asked for change and saw a homeless person sleeping once. Celine Dion's show was totally awesome, but on the pricey like most of the higher end venues. Tip: There's really not a bad seat in the house, however a typical nosebleed section for the cheaper priced seats. To sum it up I'd say the grounds are very nice and rooms easy to get to from the parking lot. The price is affortable.

As this was quite a long stay we were looking for accomodation that was not so expensive as some of the Strip hotels, and we had already stayed on the Strip for 4 previous trips and that was no longer important. plus it would give us more gambling (I mean spending money, just in case husband reads this). Read all the reviews good and bad on TA and decided to book here. What a great decision it was. We were all delighted with it. There was one small hitch, in that we had booked a room with poolview and balcony and we had no balcony. To be fair they did offer to move us to one with a balcony after 5 days, but when we saw which one it was to be we decided to stay put. The balcony was obscured by tree branches, and thought maybe it would be of no benefit. Anyway for 4 ladies to pack, move a couple of blocks and then unpack seemed to be too much of an upheaval. It took me long enough to pack my suitcase anyway! The room was great. Overlooking the pool, near to all the bars and restaurants and casino and only a short walk away from the road that takes you straight up to the Strip, which was only and 8-10 minute walk. As everyone had said before the rooms are huge! Plenty of room for all our things and still loads of space. Everything was really clean. There was a really relaxed atmosphere coming from the pool area everyday. When we were all getting ready each day we would have the windows open listening to the great music that was coming from the pool area. Relaxed around the pool only a couple of times during our stay, but that was because we had so much to do and also because it was so hot. All the staff were really friendly and it just seemed to be that much more personal than the hotels on the strip. Compared to most of the other hotels the casino was small (not tiny though) but I have to say that we did most of our winning here! So to me it is a great casino. Cocktail waitresses were really attentive and ffriendly, so were the waitresses in Marilyns Cafe, especially Maureen, she was great. All the guys on the bell desk were great, especially once they got to know us. Even though the hotel suites were running at full capacity most of the time we were there it was never crowded.

Separate toilet and bathroom is great since we have small kids and they always wanted to come in when you're there too :-)). We went to the pool almost everyday during our 1 wk stay. The pool is a nice size, plenty of laungers/chairs/tables which is a surprise----I had to tip to get a chair when I stayed at the much higher end Mandalay Bay/The Hotel. Never gambled in the hotel's casino but did take a look there. It's small but not so smokey. Pool side cafe is nice and clean with large tables. Location of the hotel is why it's much cheaper. It's about 2 blocks off the strip. We walked everywhere to the north and south of strip with no problems. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes. We stocked our fridge with beer, water, juice, yogurt, milk ... from the 7-11 store next to the corner gas station. 7-11 store's coffee is much better than the one from the hotel though, and cheaper. For food we ate at Ellis Island for 3 nights--great food at unbelievably low prices. Don't miss their $4.95 steak dinner with soup/salad every night. Their fried fish (cod filet) and fries basket is huge--enough for two for around $6.75. Ellis Island is next to the 7-11 store. these are all within a block. Free parking. For other nights we ate at: the World Buffet at Rio ($27.99/pp. $21/child), good food but a bit over priced. RedHotBlue restaurant at the Mandalay Bay is standard, don't try their baked chicken it's just too bad. Their spaghetti with meatball is excellent for about $15. Make sure you have breakfast at Mandalay's Bayside Buffet at least once--great food, large varieties, quick service, smoked salmon every day ....hmmmmmm yummy. We pretty much used the Tuscany hotel as a base and ventured out during the day, only go back to sleep at Tuscany at night. Who wants to stay in a hotel all day in Vegas anyway?

Three levels is the highest each building has. She could still climb the stairs! We weren't in the room much , but it definitly was a great roomy room, with a big bathroom. So I decided to try it again with my family (6 & 10 yr old). My husband actually liked it. The pool had plenty of lounge chairs, you didn't have to go and try and reserve one like other big hotels. Great pool side bar service, I think only on weekends. You can park your car right outside the building. Nice if you have lots to take to the room. (especially with kids) Nice big roomy gym, with a lap pool behind it. And a 5-8 min walk to strip.You are then at the corner of Ballys, Bellagio, Ceaser Palace & Flamingo Hotels. We walked to Bellagio to see \"O\" (A must SEE!) You're definitely right by everything. Across the street from the Tuscany is Lawrys Restaurant.(our favorite) And quite a few more nice restaurants that you could easily drive or take alittle walk to. I think the best thing about the Tuscany is , you just don't have the hassle of a huge hotel. (pool area, parking, casino, crowds) They have a nice Casino adjacent, but you never have to walk through it to get some where like most hotels. The only down falls is as stated before, the room is huge & they have 2 DOUBLE beds(not queens)or 1 king & they don't tell you that there are no utensils, plates or pans for the kitchenette.( I didn't notice last year) Doesn't make sense? How can you utilize the stove top?(with kids hungry all the time this is a plus) There are cups for the coffee machine & the microwave is good & a good size refrig. Plenty of cabinet space.(for food items) With a nice eating (kitchen) table. They need to inform people so they can take advantage of what's being offered.

For the price, it could be a nice stay for the budget traveler especially those with a family or looking to stay out of the casino/hotels. Free parking close to your room is a plus compared to the distance you have to walk in the large hotels. (As posted earlier - leave your stuff in the car, go check-in, then drive to the parking area near your room.) Our stay was filled with problems. First we were sent to a room that was locked or would not open - right next to the elevator. You could feel the floor rumbling as the elevator moved. We trucked all our stuff back to the lobby (thank goodness we were traveling light) and were told they would send someone up to see why we could not get in - it might take a while. I asked for another room instead of waiting - away from the elevator (I remember reading someone else's review about the noise residing next to the elevator). We were able to get in to our room (not in the same building as before but not near the elevator) but it was not made up. A call to guest services - we could either change rooms again or housekeeping would be sent. We opted for the former - housekeeping was completed within the hour. The rooms are large including the bathroom. It was nice to have a separate shower and tub. There is a kitchenette but no supplies - sort of defeats the purpose of having a stove in the room but the fridge, microwave and coffee pot ( there were no cups other than plastic cups in the bathroom) could be helpful to most travelers. Although neat, the place needs a deep cleaning and maintenance. My feet were black from walking barefoot on the carpet and things like hooks to hang towels were loose. Some of the towels were stained and had hair stuck to them -though you could tell they had been washed. The lampshades kept falling down when we touched the lamps but they were quickly righted - held on with magnets. The TV has very few channels (about 6) so traveling with kids could be a problem. We did have a non-smoking room which really was smoke-free. The walls were thin - you could here surrounding noise but luckily the buildings are small and there is not a lot of traffic in the hall or outside between the buildings. The lobby is smokey since the bar is right night to the entrance and reception desk. We did not use the restaurants, the pool or the gym. The casino was not crowded and we were able to pay a long time on the machines on the initial wagers with little money lost. I cashed out at around my initial wager from boredom after nearly 1/2-1 hour of playing on the same machine (a few times). On checkout my bill contained a charge that we did not make. The rep who initially \"helped\" me indicated it would take about 20+ minutes to sort out and did I still want to dispute it (and wait). That answer was completely unacceptable to me and I asked to speak with the manager. The supervisor quickly zeroed out my account indicating accounting would pull the receipt to match the signature and sort it out - I did not have to wait. Unknown if this will be a problem - too soon to tell. We will not be staying here again.

There is alot of unused space in the main living area and in the bathroom. If you are travelling with children or alot of luggage the space will be good. The rooms have a coffee maker, a small fridge and a microwave. But there are no utencils or glasses, just 2 plastic cups. The rooms are the linens in the room are plain, think HoJo. But for the price, it is what I expected. The pool is smaller than the picture looked. There were not enough seats or lounge chairs at the pool. I had asked the front desk for one, but they said all of them where already out. So my husband and I could not lay by the pool. There where alot of splashing children in the pool too, so we did not want to sit in it and relax. There is a bar by the pool, but it was not open, which suprised me since it was a holiday weekend. The room was fine for one night. I would not want to stay there for any extended period of time, but for a night or 2 it was OK. There was wireless internet access in the rooms, but you had to pay 9.95 for 24 hours. There is a rather large gym, which I used and a lap pool. We ate at the pizza place for lunch, and it was not very good. We gambled at the casino (Played craps) and won some money. The casino is nice in that it is cheap and not crowded. So in summary, if you need an economical and clean place to stay, this hotel is good.

The room was HUGE! The photos on the home page of this site are accurate of the room\u2019s size. As far as checking in, we arrived on a Sunday afternoon. There was no line or any problems. However, we were given a handicap accessible room. There were no signs on the door, but it had a fold-up seat and hand shower in the tub. It also had a walk-in shower. The toilet was in the open in the bathroom, not in a separate room as described by others. BUT, the room was clean and nice. We were in Building \u201cA\u201d which is the closest to the corner of the property by the roadway. Our walk to the strip took 15 minutes. That was to the corner of Flamingo & L.V. Blvd. It took 11 minutes to get to the rear doors of Bally\u2019s and walk thru their air conditioned casino. Bally\u2019s is also connected to the Paris casino and you can use their a/c to get a little further down the strip. The sidewalk between the Tuscany and Koval is closed due the construction of the Platinum, but there is space to safely walk along the roadway behind the large orange cones. We did it over & over. I missed the bus stop across the street, but there is one between Koval & Bally\u2019s coming back toward the Tuscany. The casino at the Tuscany is not recommended. The waitress service in non-existent. I had to stage a \u201csit-in\u201d at the roulette table to get a drink. I was the only one there! I told the dealer that I wasn't playing until the waitress came by and brought me a drink. The casino floor manager came over after the dealer called him, and he got a waitress from another station to bring me a drink after I threatened to cash out and go elsewhere. As others have said, don\u2019t miss the Ellis Island Casino next door on Koval. They have their own brewery and their beers are great. I liked the light beer the best; however the amber ale was very good. And, they have their own brewed Root Beer. I know, you didn\u2019t go to Vegas to drink a Root Beer, but it\u2019s good anyway. The waitresses at Ellis Island make a pass about every 5 minutes, so order a light and a root beer! Be sure to tip her! You can belly up to the bar and get the same beers for only $1 anytime. Their steak special (10 oz sirloin $4.95) is really good. We were in town 6 days and ate it 3 times! Get there before 6pm or the wait is very long. We waited 1 hour & 15 mins once, 30 mins, then went for lunch and was seated immediately. I won at their video blackjack machine every time we went there (while waiting & drinking their great beer) and basically ate free! I didn\u2019t try their BBQ, but it sure smelled good and the line was long. Others complained about the service at the Tuscany. I had to get security to come open the safe so that I could use it. It took them about 5 minutes to get to the room from the time I called. We also had a problem with the door entering the bldg. We walked to the front desk and by the time we made it back to the room, security was there resetting the door lock. I have no complaints about their service. My wife is very cold natured. We would at times turn the room a/c off to get the room to warm up. We were on the 1st floor and that may have contributed to that. We would turn it on after she was comfortable and it would cool the room down very fast. We ate the after midnight special at Marilyn\u2019s. The waitress wasn\u2019t a happy camper and was fairly grumpy. She walked up to the table and sarcastically said \u201cI guess you want the special\u201d. The food was ok. We got a 6oz steak, 2 eggs & hash browns for $2.99. We didn\u2019t make it to the workout room (HA!) so I didn\u2019t see the lap pool. We did go to the outside pool one day and it was nice. The \u201chot tub\u201d next to it had powerful jets and the water was hot. We did not eat at any of the other restaurants at the Tuscany, nor did we go to the bar, so I can't comment on them. I would probably return to the Tuscany if I go back to Vegas. It was a good stay for a great price. Mark S.

The first couple of times we had no problems since the hotel was new and they were trying to get established and develop a good reputation. This third visit was a major disappointment. Our first night's stay, after coming back from a night out in Vegas, we saw a disease infested cockroach running around in the livingroom area. We called the front desk to notify of our concerns and request to change rooms, however, only got the operator who said would relay the message to the front desk and send someone out. Never got a call back nor did anyone come to our suite. Since it was late, the front desk was a far walk from our suite and we were so tired, we decided to just wait until the morning. I took a shower the next morning and what do you know? I've got company! Another cockroach that was even bigger than the one I saw the night before. It was crawling all over my toiletries and luckily I saw it before picking it up. Ok, so now I was grossed out, upset that they have no cares about their guests, and had to complain again...My friend called the front desk 3 times to complain, spoke with the lady who would speak with the manager onsite named Juan, but each time they would have to call us back. The manager did not want to speak with us at all. No progress was being made, we're supposed to be on vacation, can't go about our day because of this issue, and 2 hours have passed. I finally called a fourth time, got Juan the manager, and he didn't seem to want to attend to our concerns. I insisted that we be compensated somehow for the inconvenience and he said he would just transfer me back to the front desk to change rooms, but instead hung up on me! That was really unprofessional and rude of him! Never even got an apology! A good reputation is very important especially when it comes to business and customer service. Tuscany has such a bad reputation now, they don't care about their customers if there are any concerns or problems and the rooms are not as clean as they used to be. They will be hearing from the department of health soon. Just read some of the past complaints and the one I've written and hope you'd reconsider about staying here. If you're on vacation, you expect at least decent service. I just takes one wrong thing to happen and if they don't even want to be of help, you're vacation is ruined! All I can say is that when I complained at check out, one of the employees, who was the only one I could really get to comprehend us, agreed with me that we should have been compensated well, most other hotels would just comp. you for the evening as well as change rooms ASAP for the inconvenience. He thinks the manager was poor in his dealings with our concerns. That tells me alot about the management there.

Upon arrival at around 7PM we were told that we had no reservation. After supplying a valid confirmation number I was told that their computers crashed the day I made the reservation and they had no record of it. They did give us a room at the group rate we had been promised, but when I made the original reservation I requested two double beds because we had four people staying. The room they gave us was a king room and had a single bed. This is when the problems started. My wife called the front desk, was told that rooms are on a first come first served basis and there were no double rooms left. Although we had reserved two double beds we had not previously been \"assigned\" a room and therefore could not have a double room. They say this is standard practice; however others in our group that came after us were given double bed rooms. My wife then requested to talk to the night manager and was transferred to his voicemail. She hung up, called the front desk again and was greeted by the same employee who was laughing and carrying on a separate conversation. She explained that she was trying to contact the night manager and had just been transferred to his voicemail. The employee laughed and told her that the manager was right there and gave the phone to him. After some pressure the night manager said he would send us a rollaway bed. We complained that one rollaway would still leave one of our daughters to sleep on the floor. After he refused to do anything else for us and hung up I walked to the front desk (we were in one of the remote buildings, it was a long walk) to talk to the manager face to face. He then told us he'd be sending a \"full size rollaway\" but could not send two; it would be against fire code. When the rollaway arrived it was a twin size bed. When I called the front desk to complain they refused to answer the phone, I left it ringing for 10 minutes and no answer. I called from my cell phone, one ring to an operator, two rings to the front desk. Apparently they didn't care to talk to us. I was told that another bed would be sent immediately and would be in our room in 15 minutes. By this time it was after 8:30PM and my children were hungry. We waited 25 minutes then went to dinner. Upon returning from dinner around 10PM we found no bed had been delivered. Again I called the front desk, no answer. I walked to the front desk and was told that the bed was requested and would be requested again. At 10:30PM we received the second bed (and apparently violated fire code for the rest of our stay). The morning we checked out I voiced my concerns to the person checking us out; she didn't seem to care and told me to fill out a comment card. She would not give me information regarding the hotel owner/operator, only the name of the front desk manager and a flyer with the address where I should send the comment card. This is a nice hotel, big spacious rooms, nice facilities and the Mexican restaurant has good food and an excellent staff. It's unfortunate that the employees at the hotel do not care to help their guests and go out of their way to cause problems.

Accommodations were very nice. Staff try and make an effort to accommodate. Can't give excellent rating since this is not a full service hotel but it is well above average expectations for an extended stay type of hotel. Thanks to reviews on Trip Advisor, we were prepared for our stay. Brought a messkit for easy cooking in the kitchen. Hopped over to the corner gas/marts for snacks and easy cook stuff. Brought own hot drink mixes and \"add water\" breakfast kits so getting a quick breakfast in the morning made things fast and easy. Got convenient bus pass ($5? buy on board) and hopped aboard across the street. I agree with other reviewers that food at the resort is not something I want to spend money on. One crusty dry dinner at $30 each person was enough money wasted. Service was excellent but it doesn't satisfy hunger. Nor can I recommend the less than average packaged lunches from the breakfast shop. First bus stop at the Flamingo down the road and Caeser's are way better food options plus they have very pretty exotic birds to look at. The Paris casino seemed most moderate and convenient for an insomniac like me to get excellent crepes and french fare at any hour. Bus passes are good for 24 hours. If you eat at their streetside restaurant, outdoor seating gets you a front row view of the Bellagio fountains which was fantastic at night. Only 2-3 repeats of the same song during the company's 4 hour french dinner. Plus the human wildlife parading past on the sidewalks once nightlife starts kicking in is fairly interesting. Enjoyed the large suite and kitchenette. Pool was fine and jacuzii had wide range of jets and plenty of room. I recommend sport towels. Pool towels were quite rough and thin. Rooms are spacious, separate bath areas convenient and well lit. Having an upstairs apt/suite was great except for some construction for the first day in the hallway. The adjacent building under construction started their workday at 4am. After the first time, attitude was if you can't beat them, join them. Hence early morning exploration of the Paris casino since sleeping was out of the question. Since many of the casinos have a virtual outdoor theme, one can always pretend to be in some other country while taking in the amusement factor. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Overheard many guests note one or two things that needed fixing which the staff took care of although some required 2-3 attempts like keys in our building. Got to know neighbors since we had to help each other get into the building when keys didn't work.:+) hahahha. Only people who were actually rude were other guests trying to market their products while I was waiting in the lobby. This is not the Ritz, it's an extended stay hotel so guests should be able to manage for themselves to a certain extent. If you have a problem, then at least let staff know how they can help you resolve the problem. Bring a mess kit $5 to $10 or a microwavable kit $2 if you want to use the kitchenette. It can always be disposed or donated to a friend at the end of your stay. Note to Newbies, never use styrofoam to heat food in the microwave. Our stay here was for business with a little time off. I'd like to return and use this as a base of exploration. There is beatiful canyon country to explore within 20-45 minutes drive, tons of virtual exploration adventures within the city and other entertainment. One place close by lets people experience parachuting without having to jump out of a plane. Basically, a guest hovers over a jet engine so it feels like falling but it's safe. If you just want to experience dizziness, take in the 3D movies (10 min) at the M&M Factory/Store Museum. Their rolling barrel of M&Ms that you walk through to get to the theater is loads of tizzy dizzy fun. There were three very more than happy ladies singing and having a great time during my visit. It was a nice stop before returning to the hotel on the bus. Next time, an internet car rental will be taken care of first. During our stay here, a city event jacked up car rentals to 300% of normal pricing. That made us change plans to explore the canyon country since car rental was not practical. The hotel has a direct line to an airport rental agency which will pick up guests. Prices changed hourly. Alternatives are to hop over to the Flamingo down the very long block and rent a car directly from them and avoid airport tax.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "ragjunk", "ReviewID": "UR4308219", "Content": "My family and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in Dec. 2005.

Not quite walking distance but a quick drive down Flamingo Drive. Pros: HUGE rooms! It was a nice suite with a eating area, a wet bar and coffee maker, sofa area to sit and read/relax, a huge bathroom with a separate tub/shower/toilet area... even a medicine cabinet next to the sink to \"hide\" your toiletries, and ample dresser, closet area. Located across the hotel is the famous Lawry's prime rib restaurant and a bunch of other fine dining places. Plenty of parking, and even many close to your room. Cons: Ok, here's the reason why I didn't give it an \"excellent\". The front desk staff was rather clueless, but found out from another staff member that their turnover rate is quite high. Most staff members stay around 1 to 2 years, then leave. So to get accurate information is a 50-50 chance. Thin walls! I was in room 103 near the front entrance. I could hear people running up and down the hall, the people upstairs walking (Sounded like they were jumping) and even the people getting ice from the machine. When people opened the door to get into the building, you can hear the door slaming. If you get a ground floor, ask for either upstairs. Lucky, I am a sound sleeper. Even though the suite had a \"kitchen\" area, the cupboards were bare. If you wanted a plate or cutlery, stop at the market and buy some disposable ones. It was a waste to give such a big kitchen cabinet but nothing to offer but 2 foam cups and 2 water cups, and a bucket for ice. The fridge was nice to store things but again, no utensils to eat with, so if you had \"Take out\" food, you could store it but not heat or eat it. Misc: Housekeeping: We were in the room when the maid knocked; NOrmally if they see you in the room, they'd come back. NOt this girl. She walked in and started cleaning, as we were trying to escape. I dont think she noticed we were in the room! Bathroom: They provided a medley of towels but they are tiny. Mind the tile in the morning... brrr! They are cold to walk on.

I made quite a fit, and they somehow found a vacant room, the exact size I wanted (even though they kept emphasizing that they had no rooms)! The service (if you can call it that) was horrible -- the staff were SO unfriendly and SO unprofessional and very indifferent about what they were doing to me!

It is almost Christmas right now, so over 6 months since my horrible Vegas hotel experience, and they just placed a $370.00 fraudulent charge on my card.

For those who have never been, The Tuscany is a very clean, manageable, hotel that is situated on a property with a 'main' building that features registration and a bar / restaurant area, and several straight-line two-story guestroom buildings that are efficient albeit not very spectacular. The advantage with this lay-out is not having a ten mile walk from your room to the lobby as is the case in most Vegas properties. The Tuscany features clean and spacious rooms and one can still smell fresh paint and new carpeting. There is a lot to like about the Tuscany. I have stayed there before and probably would stay there again, but . . . What I DISLIKE about The Tuscany: At no point during your stay will you feel like you are in Las Vegas!! The Tuscany is as boring as it is efficient. Aside from the army barrack-styled guest buildings, Tuscany features the most unimaginitive casino I have ever been to outside of an Indian reservation. It is really like a rectangular white-walled gymnasium that has been carpeted and filled with slot machines. Tuscany does not - however - force you to walk across the casino floor to get to your room: a Vegas first for me. When my friend 'Vegas' Jenny from San Luis Obispo, CA told me she'd never heard of it, I knew I was in trouble. When you stay at Tuscany you might even forget you are in Vegas. When I was there, it felt like being at a Golf resort in Tampa or Palm Springs. A little escapism from Vegas can be a good thing after a few days though. There was one creepy thing that happened to me during my stay: I walked out of the shower in my room to see a brown roach-looking bug looking back up at me, but . . . I do not blame the hotel. There is little doubt of their cleanliness and one should not forget Vegas is in a desert! Besides, I felt bad for the bug - after seeing me naked, seeing any other nude male guests will just be a disappointment.

The kitchenette was a huge plus, especially when it came to keeping drinks cold on a hot summer day. The hotel is a few short blocks from the strip. For someone not used to walking much, it could be too far for comfort, but for us, it was perfect as the hotel was close enough to the strip to enjoy the excitment of Las Vegas but far enough away to escape the omnipresent \"ding-ding-ding\" of slot machines. We could walk directly to the unit (through secured doors) without having to walk 10-15 minutes through a typical casino just to get to the guest elevators. A little secret is that you can enter the back of Bally's and then, in the comfort of air-conditioning, walk from Bally's to Paris (they connect) to get to the Aladdin and the strip. Moreover, you can catch the monorail, conveniently located at the back of Bally's, that will quickly take you to other parts of the strip. (The monorail runs every 5 minutes.) We were very happy with our experience at the Tuscany. I have a rule that I stay at a different hotel during every visit to Las Vegas, simply for the sake of having a new experience.

They do have a casino, but I would avoid it other than the bar for a quick drink before you go out. The casino is frequented by locals, so its not very exciting. The pool area is awesome - nice, clean pool, and poolside bar service. For 3 guys on a gambling trip, this pool was a welcome distraction. Plenty of drinks, girls in bikinis, and not too many kids.

The first guy that took our bags when we arrived in a taxi didn't offer to help and was rude when we asked him to take them. The front desk was cold and didn't seem too enthused that we were there - it may have been because we were at a reduced rate but that is no reason to treat us poorly. When we tried to get our bags brought to the room (all of the rooms are in separate buildings that you have to walk outside to get to), we called the bell desk 3 times and no one answered. We finally called the front desk and received our bags about 45 minutes after we had checked in. We ate in the cafe the first evening, and although the waiter was nice, the food was anything but. But I guess that's what you can expect from a 24 hour cafe. Maid service was good, but a little pushy to get the room cleaned. Very few of the staff spoke English which made it that much more difficult to communicate with them what we needed. Also, we are pretty sure someone entered our room on the first day we were out after it had been cleaned. We had come back in the morning after it was cleaned and left a light on. When we returned in the evening the light was off and the sink was partially filled with water. It cost about $10 to take a Taxi to and from the strip (Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Wynn). No shuttle service offered and they have to call for taxis. The players club is ok. It takes a few bucks to cash in for anything (at least over $150). The free souvenier was a deck of used playing cards from the casino. The slots were NOT loose! No one that I saw was winning. The slots at the airport are the best. Overall it was just ok. At least the rooms are big and very clean. Although there is a refrigerator and a stove, there is no microwave and no pots/pans/utensils to cook with. We tried heating up leftovers in metal containers on the stove but it started to smell like it would set off the fire alarm so we ate it cold. On checkout we were charged $10 extra for Friday night because the hotel was sold out - we tried to dispute this with the front desk but they said they couldn't help and we had to call the sales department - we are working on getting it straightened out with the conference people's help. The conference is moving to the Flamingo next time - we are really looking forward to that since it is on the strip. If you have a car and want a cheap rate at a clean hotel that is good for families this will work for you.

Check-in was fast, there were about 2 ppl in front of me and 3 girls at the reception counter. We got the 3rd floor (very top floor) in a rear unit, facing away from the street. They don't have any adjoining suites, so we got ours right next to each other. The room was clean and huge. The bathroom was literally oversized..full bathtub and shower + toilet in diff. room w/ door. There was a total of 4 adults.. 2 in each room, so it was nice to have our space. I got these 2 suites thru expedia, their website indicated the rooms were sold out these dates. I requested 2 doubles in each room and got my request. I was worried they wouldn't fufill my request, but they did! The kitchnette had a mini fridge, table w/ 2 chairs, microwave, sink and plenty of cabinet space and a coffee maker w/ free coffee pouches. The TV was nice cuz we could turn it according to where we were in the room, we could watch tv from bed or from the sofa and chair/table they had. The other suite had a broken shower door, I called housekeeping and they told me to wait until a repairman showed up. We were on our way out and after waiting 10 mins, we just left. Turns out they did fix it when we got home. In our room, one of the lamps bulb's needed to be changed, but I didn't call for that since there was enough light. The AC is a bit noisy, wouldn't turn it on when we sleep, but we had it on low while we were out and about. The hotel is located about .5 miles from the strip, but I liked the location of the strip from us. we were on the end of teh strip that was closest to bellagion, caesar's, bally, wynn hotels. They are huge blocks, flat to walk on, but a trek, depending on what kind of shape you are in/heat factor. We did walk to the Wynn hotel and it took tops 25 mins. it was a good walk just to get some excercise in. across from the hotel was a Lawry's, and a japanese restaurant, Hamada of Tokyo, down the other street was PF Changs.. so they had good restaurants near by. I couldn't find a starbucks near there, but later heard there was one nearby, but kind of hidden. Oh wells, I still survived. I would definitely stay there again, since the property looked like it was no more than 3-5 yrs old. I didn't see any bugs. the parking was nice cuz you can park and walk right up to the bldg entrance, put your hotel card key in and enter. It was annoying to visit some of the casinos on the strip, but just to get 'thru' them, it would take at leaset 15-30 mins. that got old fast. Check out was 12, checked out by 11:30am. There were 3-4 ppl ahead of us, but no more than a 5 min wait. it was faster for us since we had pre-paid on the rooms. So overall, checkin-out was really fast. The casino/restaurants are in the next bldg over from the hotel. So its nice to not have that foot traffic thru the hotel. we did not eat at the hotel (thank god) We tried once to go eat there, but thought the Chinese dinner advertisement (thought it was a buffet) for $5.95 was poorly written. Instead it was $5.95 for 1 chinese entree. The staff there didn't care to explain after we had questioned the signs. I guess what you pay is what you get. So we left and went to PF Changs.

Instead of a huge tower where you have to walk miles from the parking lot, through the casino and then up elevators to the 17th floor--rather the Tuscany is spread out in many small buildings with a sprawling ground level parking lot (not a huge cement multi-level like on the strip). The rooms are clean, large, with a little kitchenette and sparsely decorated. They are certainly decent, but not elegant. Expect no marbel, granite or glitter. The sheets and towels are little better than Motel 6 quality. Prices vary wildly depending on occupancy. I have paid as little as $35.00 and as much as $135.00. All room rates in Vegas vary due to occupancy and what conventions are in town--sometimes this is a great deal. The hotel is about 2 long ugly blocks east of the main tourist attractions on the strip. The strong could walk and avoid the traffic jam, but most would feel physically or mentally more comfortable with a cheap cab ride. The casino, bar and restaurants are ok but not as glamourous as the big places on the strip. As a business traveler I like this place. I can go direct to my clean affordable room and avoid the grind that is most casinos so I keep returning.

They are as they sound, a large suite. We were able to obtain a King bed and suite has both tub and shower and rooms were clean and maintained. These are not on the strip but at least 1/4 mile from Bally's heading down Flamingo Rd. It is a long walk at the end of a day if you are walking down the strip. The blocks in Vegas are not the normal length of a city block so dont be deceived with what appears to be a short distance. By the fourth day we were taking taxi back and forth as just tired of walking everywhere. The monorail is accessible from Balley's as is the Trolley. The buses do not come off strip and do not stop at Bally's either so again a walk at end of day if you are bagged and want to just head home via transit etc. We ate only in the cafe for breakfasts as we were out and about on the strip with many awesome choices of dinner spots. The breakfast buffet is small but works. For dinners I would recommend P.F. Changs which is walking distance from Tuscany as is Battisto (Hole in Wall) Italian food. Both are wonderful venues and reasonable. All in all the staff are friendly and accomodation was good. The coffee could be better as is poor quality but with coffee shops everywhere on the strip not necessary to make in room...the cafe coffee is same. There is microwave and minifridge however as mentioned in other reviews no utensils therefore you must have your own or bring disposable if needed. If you join the Players club you receive a free gift (large souvenir mug) and booklet of useful coupons. We did not join till day before last and could not use all the coupons, but we did use the free drinks!!!! If going again I would stay there again and do the walk however would also better know the transit system and maximize all free trolley's and rides on the strip that you can. The monorail passes are worth the money and save your legs for the walk home at the end of a very hectic day. The above average rating is for the size of room and when travelling with another couple as we did the space is nice for visiting in each others rooms without feeling cramped. The option of both tub/shower is also very nice in spacious bathroom.
