At$205 a night I scored. I was on the top floor with incredible views. I entered the room and saw a little half bath...almost freaked out because it didn't have a shower. Hmmm. Further investigation proved that I had a suite...a massive suite. 2 kig size beds with an ensuite. The place was well appointed, nicely decorated, very clean and full of built ins. If this place had a kitchenette (which it didnt) it would have been one of the nicer condos I've seen. The only thing that prevented me from giving thi place 5 stars was the ventilation system. The fan ran in the little half bath non-stop (whether the light was on or not) and it sounded like a freight train. I was worried I wouldnt be able to sleep, but eventually the noise became background noise. It is very loud, though. I don't know if it was the location of the room or if all rooms had this nuance. You should also be aware that the refrigerator is empty. It's nice to have, but if you're looking for a late night snack, don't count on your fridge to have any:) Room service was good, food was ok but nothing memorable. I appreciated that despite the fact that I had opted for the 'green' option - which means no cleaning service - they came and got the food tray despite my failure to call. It was a pleasant surprise when I came back to the room after a full day and the place didnt smell like eggs/pancakes because I had forgot to call. The location across the street from an AMC, starbux, etc is nice. You have quick breakfast options outside of the room service. Also a nice icecream shop for late night:). As another poster mentioned, unless there are moviegoers, the place is dead after 6pm. I walked around alot alone and wasn't worried about crime. The gym was great for a hotel gym. Enough tereadmills that I had a one minute wait for someone to jump off. Lap pool also looked incredible.

Decent room. Mixed bag service. No prior expectation, but disappointed for the rate. Tip: USE YOUR IN-ROOM SAFE (read below to understand why...) Booked downtown Sheraton for a quick sports staycation (Dbacks Friday, Suns Saturday). Figured we stay downtown and walk or pedicab around (no designated driver needed :-)). Booked the Sheraton for it's proximity to the ballpark and arena. Also, the company has decent negotiated rates w/ Starwood. Arrived and valet'd the car. Valet staff was uber-friendly and helpful. Went inside to monstrous lobby (w/ 25+ ft ceilings)... nice. Overall, the common areas of the hotel were quite attractive. Arrived at the front desk, greeted by pleasant young lady. Check-in was smooth (even signed up for SPG program - of course, these first spam arrived on my email before we made it upstairs! :-)). So, headed up to the 19th floor... Found our room and opened the door... At first, I thought the cleaning crew hadn't been in yet. I saw a shopping bag and a box by the garbage can. Then, I looked up and saw suitcases and clothing! Oops! Luckily no one was there (or I'm sure they'd have freaked out). Feeling a bit stunned, headed back down to the front desk. The same pleasant young lady saw us coming and gave a funny look. \"Hi again, anything wrong?\"... Well, ummm, only if we're not on the room-sharing program. So we advised her of the situation, and looking awfully confused, she turned suddenly and went back to the computer... muttering something about the annoying computer system. Quickly, she put us in a room on the 18th floor, giving us some explanation that \"well, it just popped up\" (meaning in the selection on the computer system). Nicely, but a bit too efficiently, she sent us along our way and quickly turned and walk back through a door behind the front desk - no doubt to go talk to a manager... No big deal - for us anyway. Yeah, I guess a little apology for the light inconvenience would have been nice, but whatever. But, what I can only imagine what the other guy (in the room that the hotel gave us a key to!) would think. I hope they did the right thing and told them, but given the clerk's obvious discombobulation, I'd have to guess no. Knowing this, we were very happy to find an in-room safe when we got to the room :-). Speaking of which, the room was clean and nicely, if a bit spartanly, decorated. Flat screen TV was mounted on the wall, but at 32\" seemed way too small for a large wall with nothing else on it. Nice view over the north side of the city and mountains. Bathroom was clean, fairly large, and basic (about what you'd find in a Hilton Garden Inn or a Courtyard). The bed was nice, but too soft for our tastes - and we woke up feeling pretty sore. Got up next morning and ran down to get some coffee. Little coffee shop in the lobby with a starbucks menu. A couple of friendly guys working the counter. Chai and coffee, easy. A little bummed about having to wait about 2 minutes while the two employees finished listening to a story being told by a woman picking up her drink. I understand though. They were a couple young guys, and she was an attractive young woman. It happens :-). Check out was by video, but unlike some other chains, no paper copy of the folio is slipped under the door. So, stopped by the front desk to get a copy. Another pleasant young lady asked how she could help. Offered printed or email copy. Chose email. She asked where to send it. I answered to the one you have on file. Looking a bit annoyed, she says there is no email on file (weird, since my reservation showed on the SPG program site, and I had also received Starwood spam). Gave her my email again, and was told, OK, it's on it's way - not thank you, not goodbye, nope. Just done. Nice. Overall, the experience was disappointing. The hotel and room was pretty average and service was hit or miss. Seems computer systems and operating processes have some gaps.

Started right off with the bell service when we drove up. Helpful and offered information on the floors on where we needed to be for the event we were attending. Room and Beds were so comfortable. Club room had very light breakfast starting at 6am - 11am. Free water, coffee, teas and soda's all day.

One thing I will comment on because I didn't not find it any references to cost of parking, because it was not included in our room rate. Parking (This is a downtown hotel, were parking is limited) is $17/night for self parking, but what is nice it is in a secure area under the hotel.

I heard it recently was given the award of best Sheraton. I can understand based on the facilities it could get that award, but not based on its service, which has plenty of room for improvement. Indeed I would have given it a five rating if not for service that was not up to snuff. Here's where the Sheraton fell short for our family visit: - Only two people at the check-in desk when we arrived and although there was only one couple in front of us, it took at least 10 minutes for us to be helped. - We ordered food at the bar in the lobby and it took way too long for the server to bring us condiments that were requested after the food arrived. - The guest services staff were not very resourceful or proactive in helping us with information. For example, when we asked where would be a nice park to take a young child, they only came up with one option and made no effort to come up with another option when I requested it. (We ended up asking a bell hop at the DoubleTree in Scottsdale when we saw the hotel along the road and he immediately sent us to a perfect park that we highly recommend to any families with small children: http://therailroadpark.com). Another example: when we asked for directions to the car rental return, the staff member simply said she didn't know, and she only asked someone else when I asked her to. - We returned after 12 noon from a morning outing and our room still had not been cleaned, so we had to arrange to be out of the room during our daughter's nap time to get it cleaned. - The quality of the food in the Club Room is somewhat disappointing. The pizza tastes no better than frozen pizza (and may even be frozen pizza). It seems the Sheraton is being penny wise and pound foolish by offering mediocre food in the Club Room. How much more could it cost to have really good quality food there and make a really great impression on Club level customers who by definition are willing to pay more to get more? - The elevators are poorly marked. The ones that say 1-17 should say B2-17, otherwise it's not obvious which elevators should be taken to get to the underground parking levels. - The technology of card keys in the elevators needs to be improved. For example, if you are going from a Club guest room on the 29th floor to the Club Room on the 28th floor, by the time you get the card into the slot and try to push the button for 28, you'll already be on your way to the lobby and have to come back up. If you are already on a Club floor, then you shouldn't have to use your card to go to another Club floor. Unless the elevators are dumb. Which they are. - The signs at the underground self-parking gate are confusing. Too many signs with seemingly contradictory information.

You can but a placard outside your door that says that housekeeping does not to change change your sheets.As incentive for more people to do that they give $5 voucher to the hotel restaurant. So I could have racked up $30. However, if you put the placard out then housekeeping doesn't come at all. Perhaps they will change the policy.

The property itself is great - in a decent spot in downtown Phoenix, the lobby is very expansive and beautiful, and it has all of the \"bones\" of a great hotel. The gym was one of the best I have ever seen, and the pool has a lot of potential (more on this later). Most of the staff was very, very friendly and all were helpful. The room was 'ok'. I was on the 27th floor facing north. It was nothing special, but also got the job done. The desk was a good size, and the bathroom was well-lit and had plenty of room. The gift shop had a lot of \"gifty-type\" things in it, but not very much in the way of food/drink (which is to be expected I think). The staff in there was extremely friendly every time I was in there, which was a couple times a day. The elevators were a marvel of modern engineering - it seemed that no matter where I was, there was almost no wait for an elevator. I have honestly never seen anything like it before. The gym was a highlight - I believe it branded as Core Performance (or something similar), and they did a great job with it. Tons of room, lots of good equipment, and it had a wall of glass overlooking the pool area. Very nice. Now for some of the bad: * The person in the room before me has long dark hair. How do I know that? Because it was everywhere. On the bed, on the desk, on the bathroom sink, and in the shower. It was pretty obvious that it was there, so I don't know how the housekeepers missed it. * The pool area was nice - but not maintained. At all. There were used towels on a lot of the chairs and some garbage left over from previous days, the pool deck area needed to be swept, and the pool needed to be skimmed. The tables and chairs were all over the place (no order whatsoever). It was generally a mess. It was very obvious that nobody is in charge of keeping the pool area clean. Things can get busy during the day, but seeing it in this condition in the morning was a sign to me that no effort was made to clean up the mess from the day before. * The service in the pool area bar was pretty bad. I was there three days with two different bartenders/servers. The service was alright, but their attitudes were not. One day, the girl was just not friendly (no biggie). The next day, the guy seemed overworked, and gave me the impression that it was a bother to order some food and drinks. The third day, the same guy was a little rude when I asked a question about the hours. Every other person in the hotel was very, very friendly - so maybe that's why these two looked so bad. * I went to get taxis a could times, and always ended up with a car service that was way too expensive for what I needed. Oh, and how could I forget - they have no meter. So it is completely up to the driver to decide what to charge you once you get dropped off. I ended up going off the property and getting a regular taxi, and the driver said that the Sheraton does not allow regular taxis on the property, and only pushes the use of the significantly more expensive car service. This was confirmed with TWO other cabbies. They mentioned that the hotel staff is \"in on it\" and gets kickbacks for this, but obviously that can't be proven. Regardless of the background, I think it is kind of shady that they call you over a car with no meter, and pass it off as a cab. Just something to be aware of. * This isn't necessarily important to some, but I am an SPG Gold member, and was not offered a room upgrade nor a late checkout. Yes, these two perks are provided \"when available\", but there was zero hesitation to say \"no\" when I asked for either.

We didn't check out as the line up was 100 people long. the coffee shop was even more busy, but there's a Starbucks across the street. Overall, an extremely average stay...I assume all the great reviews are buisness travelers.

My room was on the 18th floor with a view to the West. The view itself stretched far beyond the Phoenix city limits to the vast deserts to the mountains, a nice setting for a deeply contemplative person. :) Ask for one of the upper floors and you will love it! Pros: The check-in process was quick and easy -- they have a great \"Green\" program where they give you $5 credit or 500 Starwood points for every night that you refuse cleaning service. Eco-friendly and rewarding! The bed was fantastic, I slept like an eight month old baby. Nice flat screen TV with many cable channels, but a bit slow to switch from the menu. The bathroom and linen were very clean, everything worked, no issues. The decor was elegant, nothing special but I was staying in a room in the Bellagio. The staff was extremely courteous, especially the welcome group outside. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable, finding you a cab or pointing you to the right place. Cannot beat the location -- Phoenix is very spread out but this is right across a huge mall with an AMC theater. Many places to eat with every kind of cuisine a short walk away. There was not really a whole lot of traffic (I'm from Boston) and I liked that the Phoenix Convention Center was right around the corner. I have stayed at this hotel and the Hyatt next door, and both are very comparable. The Sheraton arguably has the better gym but Hyatt has the better restaurant. That said, Sheraton wins because its gift shop is much much superior! Cons: I have a couple of minor quibbles. First, there is NO wireless internet in the rooms, which is surprising because this is a four star downtown hotel. Then they charge you $12.95 for the ethernet, which is a bit of a rip off (and hence I deduct one star). Also there is no concession for SPG members, which is a bit strange. In general, if you're not traveling on business, the room rates could burn a hole in your wallet! Overall, I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a hassle-free stay in an elegant hotel.

Maybe I have stayed in too many boutique-type hotels, as this hotel was HUGE, but very typical BOX style lobby, hallways and rather small room....what you would expect from any other big-name hotel. Upon check-in service was very pleasant and professional, and the room was ready at around 12pm. I thought the room rate was VERY high ($250.00 - conference rate) for the amenities offered here, and there certainly was not much to attract you to this area of Phoenix except for the Convention Center about 2-blocks away. The downtown area here appeared to be empty. The Arizona Center across the street was very sad, and just about empty of stores as well. Looks like this is the area for the sporting events, which may be why this downtown area even exists, and if that's the case surely Phoenix will build up this area to attract more people and money. The pool area was at a lower level, and the view from the pool and outside bar was of adjacent building walls....no view at all! I was hoping to see a beautiful Arizona sunset from either of these areas but no. The room was typical and my first impression was that it was rather small. The bed was wonderful, with very nice linens. The hotel and room appeared to be very clean. They are serving Starbucks coffee in the business center area with amazing pastries made right on site. The restaurant \"District\" impressed us the first night, and when we ate there again 2 days later the service was abysmal. The waiter was telling how special their garden is, with organic items served yet it appeared that the wait-staff was working their first night ever in a restaurant. At $100.00 per couple (no wine) the service and food should be impeccable. The menu was quite creative, however, and I was never served cotton-candy as a final treat when the check is delivered. Nice touch and very creative! If they obtain experienced professional wait-staff then they will truly have a special restaurant. Overall our stay was fine, but I will not stay in this area again when I return to the Phoenix area. I will stay in the Scottsdale area where there is lots to see, do, and places to eat.

I'm rating this as excellent, but I did encounter problems. While visiting a family member in the hospital, I neglected to book a hotel. This was a few days after Thanksgiving at the begining of December. Almost everywhere near, or around the hospital was booked up. I thought of the Sheraton, because I know for a fact they have 1,000 rooms, and highly doubted that all one thousand rooms would be booked. As I inquired about the rooms, Jess from the front desk was cheerful. and with a smile on her face; she says \"Sir, we have one thousand rooms here at this property. We're not even close to being half full. I have plenty of rooms available.\" I had a AAA discount, and she quickly changed her mood and said \"Oh, sorry. We're sold out of extending discounts.\" I was a little surprised at that. With not being close to half full as she says, you would figure that one would be more than happy to offer a discount to keep the customer from walking away. Not trying to squeeze every penny out of the customer. I was tired at that point. Too tired to keep searching for a place to stay, and emotionally tired giving the situation with my family memeber being in the hospital. I said \"That's fine, I got no other choice\" I told her. She could tell I was upset aside from the price, and asked what was wrong. I was in needed of unloading my problems, so I told her. She offered her sympothy, and said the standard price was $179. With the hotel I work at, we're trained to say \"The rate is ___ plus tax.\" I had flat out asked if the $179 was before or after tax, and she stood firm and said \"$179\" and wrote it on my key card. I have a friend that works for a Westin near Anaheim, but he was unable to fax over the paperwork to get me a Starwood Family/Friend Rate. I'll be honest. The lobby is warm and inviting. The lights are very low for ambiance, but it is hard to see inside, especially at the front desk. My room was small, but nice. The HVAC unit didn't work, and I did report it, but nothing was ever done about it. Jess was nice enough to send up a complementary plate of heart shaped chocolates, and wrote a nice note on it. To me, that showed she cared. The bed was very comfortable, but since I was on the 27th Floor, it did get chilly over night. On check out, I spoke with another front desk agent, and noted to her that maintence had never came by to my room to look at the HVAC unit, and she didn't seem to care. She was a blonde lady. I was hoping to get a discount for the trouble, but she said \"I'll forward this to my manager, and someone will contact you in a few days.\" No one ever did. My final bill was over $200. I said \"I was told it was $179. I had asked a few times if that rate was before or after tax, and I got the same answer '$179.' \" This desk agent said \"Well, I don't know why she didn't tell you it was $179 plus tax. I do apologize.\" I only made a fuss about my cold room, because when you take a nice hot shower, and open the bathroom door, you're greeted by the cold air in the room.

This is a superb hotel, with plenty of the amenities one would expect, but sometimes find absent elsewhere. I was prompted to offer my feedback here because of a couple extra touches, though seemingly small, I found compelling. I appreciated their \"make a green choice\" option to forgo a day's housekeeping service - saving some energy - with the inducement to consider doing so a modest $5 gift card. Made me think twice about luxuriating in fresh linens & towels every day of my stay at the price of a bit deeper carbon footprint. Nice touch. The one I ended up really appreciating, I first took as being a little silly. Upon my arrival I was greeted warmly by all of the bellmen/valets at the portico. I was a bit bemused that each of the some five or so people offered their personal welcome the first time I entered. The first time I walked out, I was also bid a cheery good day by the then 7+ portico staff. OK, I thought. They all got the friendly face of service memo and are abiding by it. It was a pleasantly whimsical that they all said something cheerful upon my return a little later. Each conveying genuine good will, not rote repetition of a script. So, over the course of my three day stay, every darn time I walked in and out to and from my conference and related engagements - genuine, personable and unique greetings and farewells came forth from each of the no less that two bellmen/valets on duty. I have gone on at some length here describing seemingly simple acts to try and convey a sense of how out of the ordinary I found it. I'm an urban guy from a leading city, I interact with greeting and assistant staff all the time. These folks made me take unique notice that every interaction did not feel formulaic and lent a sense that we were all in on the friendly game. The rest of the hotel staff were excellent, but I have never been so pleasantly struck by the staff one is both the first and last to interact with.

Location.....But Not Adjacent!\u201d", "Author": "mauiman98", "ReviewID": "UR121365999", "Content": "As I submit this review, the Sheraton Downtown has a rating on Trip Advisor of being #3 of the 176 hotels in Phoenix with 296 reviews and 4+1/2 (of 5) of the little circles filled in. That is pretty tall praise, IMO! And, after my recent stay at the Sheraton from 11-14 to 11-19-11, I am happy to pile on the praise! We booked a standard size room of 351 sq ft and it was exactly as described online only with a wonderful panoramic view of the city lights at night looking directly down the street toward the Convention Center and looking at the mountains in the distance during the daylight. Very nice! The king bed was comfy and \"heavenly\" as advertised. The bedding was comfortable too. I do not know the tread count. I did not like the pillows. Too soft for me. The bathroom was big enough to do the 3 s's that needed to be done. There was excellent lighting, good ventilation, and 5 feet of solid surface corian like countertop. We enjoyed good water pressure and hot enough water for showering every day, day or night, despite our 22nd floor location and the hotel being filled to capacity. The bathtub was equipped with a grab bar which is a great feature and a must have for all hotels who expect their guests to step over a bathtub wall to get into their shower. The stepover was 14 inches high. Yes, I measured it. The ledge of the bathtub was wide enough to hold most of the essentials for showering. I don't know if all rooms in this Sheraton are equipped with bathtubs. Do people actually use bathtubs when away on business? I'd prefer only a walk-in shower if given the choice. The shower curtain was clean and white. No mold. And I checked! The shower curtain was attached to a semicircular rod thingy which gives the showerer more space I think. I noticed a portable make-up mirror and wondered how many of those get packed up by guests during check out! The hair dryer was a powerful Conair Model 1875. The bathroom wall mirror over the vanity measured 37 inches wide and was 32 inches high! Nice! With side by sides on each side of it! This made me look thinner and made shaving easier, IMO! The wall mounted 35 inch flat screen LG brand HD TV provided vivid, sensational picture quality during the very few minutes that I spent actually watching it. I was tempted to try the pay per view movie feature but the ones I wanted to see were $19.95! Even the porn movies were priced that high! The room had no closet. Instead, there was a massive wardrobe that came equipped with 10 high quality removeable hangers that easily took care of our hanging up needs and there were a few tiny shelves inside it that were barely big enough to hold a single shoe ! The iron and ironing board were stowed away inside this. I found the bible in there too! A big plus of the room was the 5 feet of desk work space and a comfy padded desk chair. The room had plenty of light and it came equipped with a small refrigerator, a safe that was actually big enough to hold my laptop, and a single 12oz cup coffee maker with yummy bold blend Africa Kitamu (Starbuck's) coffee which was delicious and not offered in the hotel's District Restaurant or in the Internet Cafe. The coffeemaker must be a special made for Sheraton device. It was easy to fill with water and the prepackaged single cup of coffee bag . It took just a few minutes to perk. Our entire room had only 2 drawers for storage. They were located on the bottom of that huge wardrobe that I mentioned previously so they were hard to reach without deep knee bends. The carpet was a basic business hotel quality neutral color no padding carpet. It was kept clean. My feet had no tell tale black after walking around barefoot. There was a big stain on the carpet in my room from a previous spill of some kind. Sheraton management should take care of this because it is an eyesore and it gets viewed immediately as you open the door. The mountain view out the window more than compensated for this, IMO, but carpet stains leave an impression. The Sheraton Hotel is new and beautiful. The public spaces, especially the lobby, were grand with unique artwork and light fixtures everywhere you looked . Its location downtown is an easy 2 block walk to the Convention Center. It is NOT located adjacent to the Convention Center as is described in descriptions that you can find at www.sheraton.com and at www.expedia.com. It is across the street from the Arizona Center. The Arizona Center was a delightful surprise! A destination all by itself! We enjoyed dining in a different restaurant there each night of our Sheraton stay. Strolling around the shops and the courtyards and fountains was a nice get away from convention business. The 4th floor heated rooftop pool and hot tub at the Sheraton were a nice touch but I never got the chance to use either one. The 24 hour open exercise room also on the 4th floor looked to have all the right gear for working up a good sweat. I didn't use that either. I did use the bar on the 4th floor rooftop. But they served drinks there in plastic cups because of the swimming pool, so I didn't stay long. Margaritas never taste good to me served up in plastic. I did use the high speed internet accessed computers and printer that are set up for Sheraton guests in the Link Cafe located off the lobby on the ground floor. They serve beer and wine and cheese and fruit plates there. You can also use the internet access available in your hotel room, but for an additional price! I think it was $12.95 for 24 hrs, wired or wireless. If this arrangement works to save money... great. But....not having internet in the room is a big inconvenience. I had no problem using the Cafe's computers. I convinced myself that I was saving $12.95 off my room bill, but was I....really? The Sheraton Staff were impressive. They got the message about customer service. I received smiles and eye contact from everyone. Nobody was too busy to offer me help or courtesy. Maybe it has something to do with the perfect weather that downtown Phoenix enjoyed during our stay! And I do mean perfect. Sunny, clear, 70's......c'mon! You just cannot be cranky when the weather is perfect. Phoenix weather is ideal in late November. I want to give special mention to Yoel and to Maria of the Sheraton's housekeeping staff of the 22nd floor. Always smiling.....always helpful! Thank you both! I also want to thank District Restaurant bartender Jerry who let me sample some California Cabernet that he sells to unsuspecting guests for $17.00 a glass. It was delicious but well outside my price range for a casual glass of red with a burger! And to all who staffed the concierge desk during our visit. Thank you too for being always polite and always helpful. The downtown Sheraton and room 2216 met our every need for comfort and convenience during a 4 night business stay. Lack of drawer space made for a lot of clutter. This might be an issue for a businessman or woman with a need to store stuff out of sight. There was also no shelves or drawers in the bathroom so bath stuff got deposited all over the 5 feet of vanity. This made for more clutter and might be a problem for neat freaks. You know who you are! The location of the Sheraton was perfect. I never needed or wanted to drive anywhere. The Arizona Center is right across the street and provides shopping, many restaurants and eateries, and a big multiplex movie theater. Had I rented a car, parking at the Sheraton would have cost me an additional $17.00/night for self parking and $25.00 to splurge on valet. . Some tips- Take the Supershuttle Bus from the airport to save money. We paid $14.00/pp for the short, 1 way ride to the Sheraton. We had to wait 10 minutes for it. Others who were impatient jumped into a limo. They got charged $35.00 (for 2) and left a $5.00 tip. They got 2 bottles of cold water to enjoy and had their bags taken care of. And they got a restaurant tip too! For where to find the tastiest lamb kabobs in town! Well worth the extra dollars, IMO, but the restaurant turned out to be a $40.00 cab fare away (one way)!. Speaking of restaurants, here is a tip - you can save money by eating at the Wine Bar in the District Restaurant at the Sheraton. They have a nice variety of bar food. A tasty cheeseburger was priced right at $10.00 and they stay open until 2AM. BTW, the same menu served at the Wine Bar is provided for guests wanting room service, which is available for late night dining from 11PM to 6AM. A great convenience, especially for us jet lagged East Coasters. More tips- In The Arizona Center- try The Corner Bakery Cafe for both breakfast and lunch. Free wi-fi and fair prices try Mi Amigos Mexican Grill. Stays open late, which, in downtown Phoenix, means until 10PM. Try the blue margaritas which were priced at 2 for $5.00 on the night we partied there. Try the 1130 Restaurant- order an 8th Street Ale and the Citrus Tilapia entree served with a fresh orange glaze that was to die for. I begged in vain for the recipe. Try the My Big Fat Greek Restaurant-ask for a table overlooking the fountains. Beautiful at night. They will accept Restaurant dot com certificates too! Please tell Ricardo that the old Mauiman sent you!. Last tip. Look for the \"Ambassadors\" on the streets near the convention center. Usually on bicycles, they will provide ideas for restaurants and clubs in the Downtown Area and may have coupons for these places at savings of 20% off the entire bill. . I hope you enjoyed my review of the Sheraton in Downtown Phoenix. I want to return tomorrow! Thet are offering rooms for $99.00 over the Holidays. If only the airlines would cooperate. LOL! BTW, look for my post about the things that I din't do and wanted to do while visiting Phoenix on The Phoenix Forum.

Truth be told, I've never been a big fan of Phoenix because of the heat and the brown landscape (117 degrees is 117 degrees, dry heat or not) but my recent stay at the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown was by far the best. I was greeted immediately by not one but two valets when I pulled up. The friendly young man at the registration desk made a point to come out from behind the desk to greet me personally. That may have been a function of having no queue but still a class move. I was given a promotion that tripled my rewards points, told where everything was, when everything was available and how to get there (I was on an executive floor that required special access). The room was everything i expected and I was fortunate to have a good view of what I consider a pretty boring landscape; all flat, all brown and then beautiful mountains (all with unique names) jutting up out of the flatness. I gained a different appreciation for the Airzona landscape in that room. I went green and declined maid service everyday for which i was given a voucher for a discount on future stays which was new to me. I don't require fresh linens or towels as I am the only to use them and i'm not in town for long so I thought that was a very smart option to give eco-conscious travelers.

She told me where I could find funs things to do while I was in town, talked sports and laughed at my awful jokes. I would be remiss if I didn't mention her trainer, Matt (I hope that's his name) because he was great too. Cheers, Carrie and Matt :) Carrie, Matt, the rest of the staff and the world class service all amounted to a memerable stay at a classy hotel in a city for which I have a new found love. If I'm within 50 miles of Pheonix, the Sheraton Downtown is the only place I'll stay.

Seems to be a good safe location - did not see many police nor did we ever feel unsafe or worried about being out after dark. This is irrelevant for some I suppose because I do carry a gun at all times so I never feel unsafe. The good news is that AZ is open carry and concealed carry friendly for those of legal age and not licensed to carry elsewhere just note that the venues mentioned above are off-limits for guns. Food choices are limited downtown but there are a few gems within walking distance if you don't mind the $$-$$$ price range restaurants. There is a Subway, Einstein bagles, Starbucks, and Hooters right there around the hotel. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant which looked decent but pricey. Access to freeway is convenient and a short hop in a car to neighboring areas (20min) gets you any kind of food style you want. Traffic does bunch up at rush hour though so plan ahead. The hotel itself was a nice typical Sheraton.. very accomodating friendly staff with good condition bldg. Underground self-parking was slightly pricey $17/night but cheaper than east coast or west coast places and convenient. The lot is open to public so it does fill up with non-hotel visitors and can force you to park a block and a half away in an overflow lot late at night. Rooms are modern with nice HD tv setup and bathroom facilities. We did have a slightly sagging bed in a dbl room which was reported. There is only ONE water fountain in the hotel and it's on pool deck. AZ was 113F while we were there and I was shocked that such a place didn't have water fountains... therefore. rely solely on bottled water. The pool was small but good for kids and family to cool off. WiFi is ridiculously overpriced $12/24hr period... this is wrong. WiFi should ALWAYS be free for registered guests. If you want free wifi the lobby has a signal at no cost to guests but who wants to sit in the lobby and do computer work that should be free in your room? Really Sheraton? Come on!!

From the moment we drove up, the Valet was most helpful and cheerful! Then, we were surprised to see that this was a host hotel for the baseball All Star Game because the lobby was bustling with people and merchandise for sale. This made us think it might compromise our experience because we were going for a family birthday dinner. In no way did the All Star Game activities affect our dinner. We were greeted with a warm welcoming smile from the hostess, had a very friendly, fast and helpful bartender at the bar, then after we were seated, we were blown away at the most incredible service we have had in a long time. Not to mention the food was to die for! For our party of five, we sampled quite a few different menu items and everything was amazing! They even grow fresh veggies and herbs on the roof! And, you can taste the difference with those freshly picked veggies in the garden salad I had. The filet was the best I ever remember having. Our server, Ian, was so patient with us and truly seemed like he loved his job. Being in the hospitality industry myself, I think I'm a bit more critical than most when it comes to service, but The District was such a wonderful experience, I felt I had to share.

The front desk staff is nice enough, and they have the 'smile and nod' response down pat, but only when pressed do rooms appear that somehow were a minute ago booked!! On the other hand, the front desk manager didn't hesitate a moment to give me his direct cell phone number so I could contact him with any further problems. Unfortunately, I had to call him at least twice more during my 4 day stay. One evening the meal in the District restaurant was fantastic! Really really good. The next time we dined there, the service was non-existent and the restaurant manager was defensive and had a terrible attitude. The gym is fabulous! One of the best around, but there is no spa at all and the pool, even though advertised as heated, is cold and small (although the hot tub is nice). The view from my room was amazing and the bed and bedding were great, but I think that housekeeping is the real weak link in this hotel. When I first entered my room there was a used towel and robe hanging on the back of the bathroom door! Disgusting. It took several calls to get extra hangers and they were very stingey with their toiletries. The bathroom was great, very spacious, and the complementary bottled water was a nice touch. But paying for wifi is an insult, particularly since you can use computers in their 'connect lounge' for free and the wifi in the Club Lounge on the 28th floor is free. A hotel should be ashamed of itself to nickel and dime a traveler like that, especially when they look you in the eye and tell you how much they care about your comfort. The location was very convenient for us next to the convention center. The hotel does not have a complementary airport shuttle, which is outrageous since the airport is only about 3 miles away. The private van costs $12 one way and leaves the hotel every half hour.

This is matched by another oddly greenwash offering. They have the \"Make a Green Choice\" card which allows you to completely skip housekeeping service for you room if you hang the card from your door handle. They give you a $5 in house gift card (valid only at this hotel) that you can use as a credit towards drinks or food. Now this is a GREAT deal for the hotel, since they no longer need to pay the labor charge for having a maid come in and make up the room, no towels to wash, no sheets to change, no coffee and tea to restock. Yes, this is indeed the green choice, as in abundant green savings for Sheraton. Other notes: Parking is $17/day or $25/day for valet. Don't get me wrong the hotel is run very well, surely one of the best in Phoenix. Staff is great, facility is well maintained. These extra charges are unexpectedly nickle and dime annoying.

Scott and I decided to have a drink in the lounge, where we met server, Paige Kumm. She was personable, and quite the sales person. She talked Scott into trying something on the drink menu, and he loved it! After experiencing Paige's Outstanding service, we decided to take the advice of the FOM, and dine in the lounge with Paige. (I never guessed I would be dining in a lounge!-I'm not saying I haven't before. It just wasn't my intent the particular evening we stayed.) We left Paige for a short bit, spent some time in the comfortable, relaxing, oudoor whirlpool, and returned to the lounge later to dine. Scott loved his scallops which are on the daily menu, and I enjoyed the evening dinner special. Even though I enjoyed my meal, I'll most likely go with the scallops when I return.

Rooms are tiny, halls are dark and low ceilinged -- felt like I was back in the 70's once I left the lobby. Two different days, the room was not serviced by housekeeping -- which is no big deal except that we really did run out of towels (even after re-using them) and we also had to call for toilet paper because when the room was attended to, housekeeping did not notice that. These are small things, but when you are traveling for a busy convention they eat up minutes and also create a sort of hassled feeling. One day I returned from a busy day of meetings and the room still had not been freshened up by 4 p.m. I called guest services and asked that they at least come up and take out the trash/exchange the towels before we returned at 9 p.m. It was still not tended to, so as we were preparing to sleep, we had to stay up and wait for housekeeping to do what they should have done at 9 in the morning or at 4 p.m. when I asked. The poor evening housekeeping staff looked at us like we were a nuisance, but it wasn't their fault-- or ours -- it was the previous shift's. Note that at this hotel you only have the option to call \"guest services\" for everything -- no separate lines for the front desk or housekeeping. There was not one time that I called guest services and got directly to a person. You have to listen to a recording and then be put on hold when you call for help. Next, the internet access in this property is arcane and byzantine. Aside from the fact that it costs $13.00/day, it is hard to access. The front desk had blocked ours (because we were listed under more than one name, but it was all on my credit card which they had on file downstairs) and after repeated requests to get access it was repeatedly impossible to log onto the internet. This problem persisted over multiple days and shifts even though the front desk said they would fix it. This headache forced me to go across the street to work and catch up on correspondence at Starbuck's. I am flexible and experienced at travel and willing to put up with a hurdle or two, but this was just dumb. After the first or second ask someone should have just made sure I got what I needed. I did call the 800 number on the card on the desk and the line was always busy. I have to say I NEVER have this problem at Marriotts -- even the downscale properties like Fairfield Inn. There is a sort of internet cafe in the lobby with the offer of printing boarding passes free. It does work, but 9 out of 10 people get pretty confused about how to make it work -- and I am talking about sophisticated business travelers who find this property's particular log in to check in screens confusing. There is no reason for it to be confusing or for grown men and women to have to stumble around asking each other for help. I saw numbers of people decide to just leave and get their passes at the airport after being frustrated. I went to the concierge at one point to inquire about transportation for a special event. She was on the phone on what was clearly a personal call ...giggling, making small talk with a friend or lover, while several of us stood and waited and the line grew longer. And though this is an expensive convention hotel in a major downtown area, we were harrasssed by a homeless creep right in front of the property. The man followed us into the building and would've gotten into the elevator with us had we not retreated and asked the front desk to call security. Security was there in a jiffy and the fistfight did not last long. I know that this creeper was not the hotel's problem, but on the other hand I have never had to witness anything like this in any other fine hotel. Just a heads up to anyone coming down here for a convention, just because you are paying top dollar for this Sheraton doesn't mean you will be safer or more secure. Three blocks up the street on Van Buren is a Springfield Suites hotel. It costs half as much, is probably just as safe and the rooms are bigger, the beds are bigger. Breakfast is free there, the internet is free there and it works and the pool is outdoors and about the same size as this one. For your money you will get a better night's sleep there, not have to wait as long at the elevator, not have to beg to get your room made up and only walk about a block further to get to the convention center. We ate a $17 breakfast here that was not very good. It should at least be good in a property like this. No kidding, the waffles are just as good at that free buffet up the street at the SpringHill. It has been a long time since I have felt this \"had\" by a chain property. More than one guest services/desk/housekeeping person had a chance to make the impression different, but instead I was made to feel like a nuisance.

This is an enormous hotel with an unfortunate layout (4 elevators to service 400 + rooms), but it is the woefully inadequate staffing that is the real problem. There were long lines to check-in every afternoon/evening snaking through the already over crowded lobby bar area and each check-in transaction seemed to take a very long time. I experienced very long waits to place an order with room service even after 9 pm (and the hotel has no voice mail feature so a guest who gets a busy message has to call back over and over rather than leaving a message for room service to be call the guest back) and corresponding long waits for room service food. There were waits for breakfast at the single restaurant in the hotel because while there were many empty tables, they were dirty and had not been bussed. Even getting a drink in the one hotel bar area before dinner is an ordeal because of inadequate and slow wait staff. Clearly the hotel's target market are the hordes of convention-goers who are a captive market for events at the nearby convention center and the attitude is clearly to do the absolute minimum to service that crowd. The lack of service for the room price was striking, as was the ridiculously expensive wireless internet in the rooms.

I had read the corner rooms were oversized but I really don't think that is true - we did have a larger bathroom but that's it. The rooms are an OK size with a large desk and flat screen TV. I must admit the closet & clothes area was a bit on the small side. It looks like an armoire built into the wall with a small closet area sitting above 2 smallish drawers. And that was all the room offered for storage - which is just fine for a short stay but there were 2 of us there for 5 days and I had both business & play clothes so it was a bit cramped. The room was tastefully appointed and extremely quiet - I never heard a sound from outside the door. Valet parking was $25/day or self park for $19. We used the valet and the car was always ready by the time we walked out the door. The District Bar was fun place to have a drink - we ate at the restaurant and we were not at all impressed. Service was good, but I thought the menu was limited in scope and the food was only just OK. They have a Starbucks cafe for morning coffee. Housekeeping was excellent.

The WOW factor is evident in this gorgeous place. My first impression was the carefully selected staff members. From the time that I stepped out of the car to the end of my stay, I found the staff to be extremely customer service oriented. Eye contact, sincere greetings and friendliness are the norm here. It is a Starwood Group Hotel, so it is run differently than your normal Sheraton. It is very Ritz-Carlton in ambiance and the lobby is gorgeous. Modern, sleek, open, spacious, immaculate. There is a lovely cafe', lobby bar and the front desk is very European in it's vibe. The bell staff, security people and managers greet everyone and make you feel very welcome. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped. Quiet is something that I have to have when sleeping and it exceeded my expectations. Blackout curtains, fabulous bed, fridge, Starbucks coffee in the room really made my stay wonderful. The restaurant is fabulous and has a resort style breakfast buffet that will help you start your day. Again, the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating in the restaurant. If you need a PC, they have lobby PC's available free of charge for guests. All have huge plasma screens. Want an inexpensive cup of coffee and a snack? They have that in the lobby cafe'. The City of Phoenix has done a slam dunk job of rehabilitating this area and the ASU Campus is within walking distance. Across the street, you will find great restaurants, shops and an AMC 24 Theatre. You can take the Light Rail to Tempe and Mesa if necessary. The hotel will give you a walking map of the city, so that you can try some wonderful restaurants within a 3-4 block area. Go to Brick/Urban Kitchen across the street for some of the best happy hour appetizers that you will ever experience. Superb Sangrias and interesting cheese selections at moderate prices.

Then there was the pool. There was no poolside service (on a weekend in July!). We had to call for a drink...then wait. And wait. Terrible! The whole pool area was so uninviting.

Just as the other members, I was advised to stay at the Sheraton Downtown Phoenix Hotel since the meeting room and other events were scheduled there. The reservation and all payments were made through the Expedia in December. In January my credit card was charged in full and a reservation confirmation was issued. I was surprised that I was charged in full that early. Normally, hotels do it at the check-out, but I said to myself \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d. At this point at least I was absolutely sure that I am all set and can fully concentrate on my business. In the morning of February 28, lesser than 8 hours before the flight, I suddenly received an e-mail asking to immediately contact the hotel. When I called, the receptionist told me that my reservation has been cancelled. Below is approximate phone conversation, as I recall it: - Sorry Sir but your reservation has been canceled. - I made my reservation in December last year specifically far enough in advance to be sure that I\u2019m at the same hotel as the rest of my team and I have everything I need for my business! - Sir we\u2019re overloaded, and we have to cancel your reservation. We have a situation when people staying in our hotel decided to extend their stay and so we have to cancel your reservation. We can try to place you in another hotel if you wish. - No, I do not want you to place me in another hotel and I will have my room tonight! - We will try our best Sir, but we can\u2019t guarantee you a room. There are many(!) cancellations we\u2019re going through right now. Sorry\u2026 I hang up and called Expedia. They were shocked and tried to call the hotel but came back with the same result. All the conversations took total of more than 2 hours crashing all my last-minute trip preparations. Finally, somebody from the Expedia management called me and said that situation has been partially resolved \u2013 I may stay in Sheraton for 1 night. I accepted the change expressing my deepest dissatisfaction (a real anger, actually). When I arrived to the Sheraton, I was confirmed that I have one night only. I asked if my stay can be extended for the 2nd night and was informed that the chances are slim to none. Only the direct interaction of the SME top administration changed the situation and I was offered to stay for the 2nd night. As a mining engineer heaving behind my shoulders decades of traveling experience throughout the United States and abroad, I have stayed in all kind of hotels, motels and other, but I was never treated this bad. I can not recall anything even close to the situation in which an administration of a hotel literally tried to throw a guest out from the hotel. But that\u2019s exactly the case with Sheraton DT Phoenix. I\u2019m sure that a hotel should not take a reservation and full payment in advance especially if there is no guaranty that the room will be available. But if they accepted the payment and issued a confirmation, than no matter what they have to perform their duties as obligated. Follow-up A few weeks later, after I complained to the Sheraton administration, they connected me to a customer service representative who explained me why all this happened. According to those explanations everything what happened is normal, routine situation. More than that, I\u2019ve been informed that under the State of Arizona Law, hotel can not remove a guest from the room if it decided to stay longer. So, according to this law, Arizona hotels routinely cancel reservations of their upcoming guests. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably OK to throw your quest out to the street, but from the Sheraton stand-point only. Personally, I do not think so. In addition to enormous mistreat of their guests, the hotel demonstrated their 100% careless customer service.

The property itself is very nice. Rooms are modern and well decorated. It has a viable restaurant as far as Starwood Hotels go. There is a nice pool. The lobby is also very nice. The colors and decor throughout the hotel is friendly and warm, which makes this hotel a pleasant place to stay. The beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are also well done. While Sheraton is usually one of Starwood's lesser brands, this Sheraton is pretty much Westin quality as far as the rooms go. There are 3 issues though which reduce my rating: 1) Service. I have had several issues with service in this hotel and get the impression they don't really care about customer satisfaction. One is the room service dining. I have on multiple occassions tried to order chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream. They won't give me a scoop of ice cream because it isn't in the description and insist on charging an extra $8 to buy an entire pint of ice cream. However, they do serve single a single scoop of ice cream with the apple pie. This intransigence is completely ridiculous, and non service oriented. Also the doormen never offer to carry your luggage to the room unless you actually ask them. 2) Treatment of loyal guests. I used to stay at this hotel every week. However, there were a number of occassions during conferences where they were busy and charged higher prices for the rooms (which were nonetheless still available). I asked the front desk if they could give me the usual corporate rate since I am a regular guest and they refused saying they were sold out at the corporate rate. 3) Maintenance. Most of the shower heads in this hotel are clogged at the edges which means instead of getting a cone-shaped spray from the shower head, you get a narrow spray which means you need to move around a lot in the shower. This could easily be fixed, and I don't understand why they don't just do it.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moreno Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Downtown Phoenix!\u201d", "Author": "anuday05", "ReviewID": "UR59790691", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton due to my mom attending a Capella University conference being held at this hotel.

It's centrally located downtown and it's about 20 minutes from the Phoenix airport. The hotel staff was very friendly, helpful and was able to handle a large convention crowd of people checking in and out very quickly. They were efficient and got you your room key very quickly. The room key worked on the first try also. They really knew their jobs and the hotel wisely had several extra front desk clerks to handle the first day check in load. The entrance to the hotel has a large, covered valet area reminiscent of hotels in Las Vegas. There are quite a few capable valets eager to help you with your car/bags but were not overbearing, etc. There is also parking below the hotel that is accessed from this front area. The room I stayed in was your typical business room, a somewhat tight, rectangular room but comfortable and very clean. Everything appeared to be brand new and the bathroom seemed to be recently updated. I was on the 14th floor and it had a nice view of the city and the mountains in the distance. My room had two queen beds which were very comfortable with alot of different types of pillows. There was a desk area and coffee station in the room along with Wi-Fi to access the Internet. (It was provided free to us during the convention but I'm not sure if you are charged as a regular traveler) There was a closet to hang clothes and dressers/nightstands, etc. The hotel provided our convention with breakfast and lunch and the food was excellent. The convention areas are massive and are located on the 2nd and 3rd floors, the lodging rooms above that. There is bar in the lobby that has lounge chairs, etc. to mingle and other restaurants but the drink prices were high at the hotel bar. There is a small convenience store located in the lobby area as well as free Internet printing kiosks so that you can print out documents like boarding passes, etc before heading out to the airport. If you are a sports fan, you are walking distance to the Diamondback's baseball stadium and the Sun's US Airways Arena. The hotel is about 25 minutes to the Cardinal's football stadium and about 30 minutes to Scottsdale. The only downside to this hotel would be the elevators. When the place is fully loaded with a conference, there is sometimes a considerable wait to get an elevator especially if you are on an upper floor especially during break times or the end of a day. But, Phoenix is a weird town. It's a clean, safe city but there are no people walking around. It's dead both during the day and night. Even though you are \"downtown\", it doesn't seem like there's ever anything going on. The hotel is located near the Univ. of AZ downtown campus, but we didn't see that many college students. We found some restaurants didn't open until 5pm. One night, we went to a sports bar called Majerle's about a block from the US Airways Arena where a Sun's basketball game was going on. In the bar, there were only a few people there besides us and the area around the arena was a ghost town. It's almost like a Neutron bomb went off where the buildings are left standing but there are no people left. The weather was great that week in the 80s. There's very little traffic around town so getting to and from places is very easy. Overall, it's a comfortable, clean hotel for business travelers and conventioneers .

I spent a good hour chatting with Stacy and this gal is going places. I hope Leo (the gen. mgr.) is paying her well cause I told her if she can stand the snow in the winter she can have a job at our hotel. She is just bubbling with personality and you can truly tell how much she loves working there. She told me about how much her gen. mgr. does for his staff, his humble beginnings, and how much they love him. That really impressed me and I told her she embodies what we at our hotel call \"heroic hospitality\". I hope you really appreciate the asset you have, she's a gem. I also want to tell you about a housekeeper, and I hope I spell her name correctly, Shaquel. Late around 11 pm I stepped out of my room to find a snack and she happened to be right outside my door way going into their employee break room. I asked where the snack machines was and she asked what I was looking for. I replied, something like a candy bar. She said they had them in the break room and would go get me one. I asked how much, grabbed her the money, and in a flash she was back with a Snickers and then handed me a bottle of water to wash it all down. Above and beyond on service! She could easily have brushed me off and sent me down the hall or whereever they keep the snack machines for guests, but instead, took a few minutes out of her job to impress a guest. These are just two examples of the staff amongst many I encountered. I know they may feel like they are just \"doing their job\", but being a guest, instead of the general manager, inspired me to be sure these little things are not overlooked at our hotel. Leo, you have a wonderful bunch of people, and from the spotless rooms, and everything else I encountered you will do well and I have no hesitation recommending this hotel, especially if you travel on business.

The hotel is located right across from the Arizona center for shopping and eating, and just down the street from the convention center and several other restaurants. It is primely located to give you a great Phoenix experience. Request to stay on an upper floor just for the views. The elevators did a take a little while, but it's 31 floors. I never waited more than a minute or two for an elevator, when the hotel was almost full. I will say I was glad not to have to pay for anything, as the prices were a little expensive, but definitely worth it for a relaxing trip. If the food is too expensive simply walk across the street for plenty of other dining options. If you are a Sheraton preferred guest, they put you on your own floor, and on that floor, there are no charges for your water. The coffee in the room was great as well. The bed was SOOOO comfortable, and there's plenty of space to put your things. I stayed for a week, and actually wish I could've had a little more time in the room.

That was a highlight. And now the troubling part...The first night I was in the hotel, I worked late (12:30am) in my room and realized I did not pack saline solution for my contacts. Totally my oversight. The store, which is in the hotel lobby for the convenience of the guests, had closed for the evening. The staff reportedly looked around their back office to see if they could find some saline while they sent me back to my room to wait. None was found. At around 1am, I requested the manager on duty open the store and charge the saline to my room (I could see it on the shelf through the store window!), but the manager on duty refused to open the store even though he had a key. Apparently the Sheraton does not have the business sense to obtain an access agreement for the space they lease out. The manager told me there was nothing he could do and that I would have to go find an open store to buy some. So...in from out of town, in the middle of dead downtown Phoenix, $220 per night, and 1am in the morning...and \"there is nothing more I <the manager> can do.\"?? I questioned the manger's interest in providing customer service of any level, and then endured a lecture on breaking and entering and how he was not going to break the law to accomodate my request.
