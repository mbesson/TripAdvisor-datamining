I try to avoid anything mid-town these days and have opted for smaller, quieter hotels with the hope that I find something that offers the unique combination of style and comfort. When I read bout the Hotel Americano, I thought it seemed right up my alley - decent location near the Highline, from what i could tell a nice aesthetic and design. Prices seemed high but NY prices are always rather exorbitant so I assumed it was just par for the course. But please do not fall into the trap that I did by seeing this hotel on design blogs and assuming it's lovely and amazing. It's nothing of the sort - in fact, it's a Saturday Night Live-worth farce of a hotel. I checked out after only one night and wish I had asked for my money back - it easily goes onto my list of top worst hotels I've had to suffer through. I will say that the overall look and feel of the lobby was actually quite nice. It was a little sparse for my liking but I generally thought it wasn't too shabby. It smelled nice and had a good vibe. Cork stools, etc, are a bit dated but there was a general beauty to the simplicity. The hotel staff all seemed nice enough, but a bit lost and clueless. I felt like they were hired actors playing the part of hotel staff for the most part and dealing with them was extremely frustrating. You'd ask a question and they'd have mostly blank or slightly panicked stares. I chalked that up to the hotel being somewhat new. The room itself, however: Wow. You walk in and realize that the joke is most certainly on you. First off, the lights were controlled by a pen stuck into a hole in the wall. If you even barely nudged the pen, the lights and air control would go off. This grew frustrating in just a few hours when the pen would adjust on its own and you'd be left fumbling around in the dark. There was an inoperative fireplace hanging in the middle of the room, along with a ridiculous bean bag chair that was a glossy plastic that would have done well in art spaces 10 years ago. The sofa was low, too deep to relax in and hard as a rock. The \"chair\" by the ipad chained to the wall was a stool for a supermodel. The bed was frankly the nicest part of the room and even that required rolling out of the bed to get up given how low it is to the floor. Honestly, this place felt like one of those tacky Euro furniture stores where everything is overdesigned and overpriced and generally low quality. The bathroom was a complete joke - and as others have noted, it's basically just poorly constructed all around: from the preposterous length of the shower curtain, to the lack of any shelves to put toiletries, to the postage stamp-sized sink and ridiculous shower that basically was installed incorrectly, allowing people to look in but you unable to see out, to the too-short shower head that forced you to basically stand at the very front of the tub to get the full effect of the shower. Industrial design at its absolute worst. I asked for an ironing board and iron (btw, there is nothing more annoying that not just having one in the room at all times) and 45 mins later it showed up, only to be taken away later that night while I was out having dinner. I called to get one the next morning and it took them another 45 minutes to rustle one up. The elevator was excruciatingly slow, especially in the evenings when the rooftop bar was in full swing. And then there's the noise. You hear EVERYTHING, including a ridiculous elevator for the rooftop partygoers that actually runs right up the front of the building. Every time that sucker rose and fell, you heard it rumbling through the room. And because of the \"comfy\" concrete floors, you heard every echo of the building, every footstep of people outside, every conversation of people in the hallway, every open and close of the door. In short, this is an example of trying to fool people into believing this is what modernism is - it's sad joke foisted on people who have too much money and no taste. Cheap, non-functional, sparse decor masquerading as high design. And poorly designed rooms that may be nice to look at on websites but ridiculously impractical in person. If this is the quality of Mexico that people have come to expect, I feel sorry for those people.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNightmare experience\u201d", "Author": "anonymous159238", "ReviewID": "UR126172198", "Content": "A former New York in town for business, I was quite excited to check out the new, hip Hotel Americano. The bar scene in the lobby was hopping and breakfast at the restaurant in the morning was delicious. The room itself was ok, location a little far west. But never in my life have I had such an UNPROFESSIONAL encounter in New York. My second day I had difficulty getting the door unlocked (yes, they have physical keys and not key cards), a door which had to be yanked open to get out of the room since arrival. When I came down to say I was having trouble, I was not escorted back up but told to try again, sometimes you have to force it a little and if I still had trouble, then they would come help me. When I went back up to 'force it a little' the key quite easily broke off in the lock. This resulted in me be locked out of my room, without access to any of my belongings for nearly 15 hours. The front desk had no idea how to handle the situation. In New York City, where you can get anything at anytime, they insisted there was no one who could help until the engineer arrived at 8am the next morning. For some reason a 24hr locksmith wouldn't do the trick? I was given another room and only after asking was I given contact lense solution (but no case... if I needed a case could I call back to the front desk again?) and a tooth brush. At one point they even asked me if I had tweezers they could borrow to try and get the key out???? No breakfast or coffee offered immediately the next morning. The engineer who was promised to arrive at 8am didn't arrive until after 10am. At no point was a manager available after repeated demands to speak to one. Eventually, after the engineer broke the door, a locksmith was called. The only reason any of this was done was thanks to the kind and attentive doorman, Leonardo. In a City where superior client service is the norm and not the exception, I could not believe that their was not a manager on duty or called in immediately to handle this, nor did the front desk staff seemed to have any sort of training to handle anything more than passing out keys and taking credit cards.

In fact, some of the greatest gems in modern hotel history have come out from this sprawling metropolis. Which, in turn, gives the Big Apple an advantage that not many urban spots enjoy - diversification within hotel genres. Hotel Americano is a byproduct of this advantage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minimalism is not foreign territory to New York hotels, but its twist is. This hotel feeds a niche of customers who find it hard to find hotels in the dynamism of Chelsea, a part of Manhattan that is not well-equipped with accommodations of this ilk. Modernity with a little frill. Rather than concentrating on the modern interiors of the hotel, the concept behind allows for a rehashing of the definitions of modernity. It derives that utilitarian aspect of providing only the necessary of luxuries without overburdening the visitor with hotel formalities. Still, the hotel is not afraid to venture into different styles like boho chic and undertones of art deco for the sheer purpose of warming up the austerity of what has became second nature of the run-of-the-mill modern hotel. The service is basic yet efficient, and there is an iPhone/iPad App made specifically for your hotel needs. . All the amenities needed by a visitor in the room.

We'd planned to stay for two nights, but couldn't wait to escape this morning. Now comfortably ensconced elsewhere. Where do I begin to describe the horrible experience we had -- four of us, in two adjacent rooms? Our experience was similar to that described earlier by MaureenColorado. She wrote, \"The hotel's designer seemed to mistake cheap, sparse decor for good design.\" Please don't let the photos of the rooms on the hotel's website -- or elsewhere -- fool you. A bare concrete floor looks quite nice in a photo, but actually living in a room with a concrete floor is a bit like sleeping in Costco. There are (essentially) no chairs in the room. The stool beneath the teeny, tiny desk is impractical -- nobody could actually sit on it. And the beanbag chair isn't soft, and doesn't envelop you. You sort of sit against it, rather than in it. Totally useless. So your choice is to sit on the bed -- on the floor. There was a peculiar lamp hanging over one side of the bed, with probably a 20 watt bulb. But the switch for the lamp was on the other side of the bed. The other choice was the florescent light bulbs behind the bed -- but they were incredibly bright, and could not be dimmed. The bed -- essentially on the floor -- was surprisingly comfortable, but the sheets were too small and instantly became untucked. The bathroom was awful. It reminded me of a concrete version of a bathroom on an Amtrak train. Tiny shower cubicle, tiny sink, tiny shelf -- and very weak lighting. The towels were on a shelf at least (and I mean this) seven feet above the ground. I'm 6'2\" and almost couldn't reach the towels. Her Ladyship is 5'6\" and couldn't reach them at all. With so little light in the bathroom there's no way to put on make-up. Although we booked two double rooms, each only had one robe, and one pair of slippers. (Remember the floors are cold, bare concrete.) We had an iPad in our room -- chained to the wall -- but someone had apparently left with the device that charges it, so the battery was all but dead. There was no battery in the clock in my sister's room. We could not control the air conditioning or heating. The rooms had one temperature -- hot. In his reply to MaureeenColorado, Will Jordan wrote, \"should you come back this way again at some point in the future, we will have the stool in your room replaced with a chair from our office.\" That's exactly what they finally did for us -- they brought us two desk chairs, vintage Staples. They were comfortable, but hardly gem\u00c3\u00bctlichkeit. The hotel does not have parking. You need to go two blocks downtown -- yourself -- and park your car in a parking lot. This was explained to me ahead of time. Dinner was actually very good, and our waitress was very friendly and efficient. It was the only nice part of our short stay. But we then found we didn't have any hot water in either of the rooms, and at breakfast the next morning we encountered the snooty waitress from hell. Burnt croissants, no cream cheese (I had to send them out to buy some -- which they did, without much grace). The lack of hot water, hotel-wide, put us way, way over the tipping point -- and we checked out a day early. The hotel did not charge us for our stay -- which was gracious of them. Too bad they couldn't give me back a day of my life. Her Ladyship and I have stayed at the Adam & Eve Hotel in Turkey. It, too, has concrete floors and low-down beds -- but somehow it seems to (generally) work at the Adam & Eve, and doesn't work at all here. This hotel is definitely, absolutely NOT for people like us -- in our early 60's. It's not for families. This is a hotel for young couples -- it looks like it's the perfect place for an out-of-the-way assignation. (Who will know you on West 27th Street? I've lived in Manhattan for years, and have never set foot on this block of West 27th Street until yesterday.) But if you're planning an assignation here -- you'd better hope that the lady likes showers rather than baths, likes sleeping on the floor, and doesn't need light in the bathroom to put on her make-up. When we were checking out, the bellman said he was from a Third World Country and the problems we experienced were \"nothing in my country.\" Hey, guy -- I've been to many Third World Countries, too -- but I made a reservation for a hotel in Manhattan, not Guatemala.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cA Little out of the way but overall a very nice stay\u201d", "Author": "dddtttqqq", "ReviewID": "UR121630528", "Content": "I am sitting in the lobby drinking the complimentary mineral water some high end brand and am reflecting on our stay.

The sound of running water behind the walls from other guests using their toilets and showers was as audible as if only a sheet separated our rooms, and every conversation in the hallway, including the SHOUTS for service from housekeeping at 9:30am were enough to keep me on the edge of sleep all weekend.

Front desk staff was friendly and felt slippers were provided to shield feet from cold hard concrete floors.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou'll either love or hate the rooms, some problems with this new hotel\u201d", "Author": "Popepys", "ReviewID": "UR118572670", "Content": "Stayed here for one night while travelling on business. The hotel is very cool with an excellent rooftop bar. However, you'll either love or hate the rooms. Super modern with an iPad to entertain you in every room. But the concrete floor, bean bag for a chair and somewhat dark atmosphere even with all the lights turned on won't be to everyone's tastes. The bed is low down and more like a fouton but was reasonably comfortable. Biggest problem was a few inexcusable issues with this new hotel. No rail or hangers in my cupboard left me with nowhere to hang my suit! No hair dryer in the room. No coffee in the room, although there was a mini bar. These glitches were pretty annoying for the price but hopefully they will sort them out. The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the rooftop bar closed at 11pm which for such a trendy hotel was a bit annoying when coming back from dinner. Overall, you'll only like this place if you are into super modern hotels and can put up with some of the glitches.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Americano", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d2151571-Reviews-Hotel_Americano-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$293 - $627*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">518 W 27th St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10001</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2151571", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f2/40/f24009879417289372e56b81c6aebd2a1large.jpg"}}
