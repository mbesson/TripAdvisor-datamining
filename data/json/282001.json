The room was reasonably nice, with big but somewhat unnecessary decor (massive doors and a massive radiator which was a decoration only - the real heating came from somewhere else). It was nothing annoying, however - the room was quite tasteful. Although there were a few signs of wear (one of shelves was scratched at several places), I was satisfied with the room. It was clean and the hotel staff would carefully make it up every day. Location is good - in the center of Montreal, within a short walk of the business district, sights and metro. Staff is friendly and helpful. In standard situations, their English communication skills are very good but we had some problems explaining a non-standard situation (two people staying in one room but arriving at different times) to one of receptionists (a young Asian man). There is a \"continental breakfast\" served in the room every day. It consists of a croissant, a toast, coffee/tea and juice. I would prefer a bigger breakfast but it seems that \"continental breakfast\" of this type is standard in Montreal. There is free wireless internet and it worked well throughout my stay. I had two problems when I arrived. First, the water flushing mechanism in WC was broken. I informed the hotel staff and they fixed it quite quickly.

Great location, just a short walk from the Metro and an Underground City food court, as well as lots of \"regular\" restaurants and downtown attractions. Unfortunately, I arrived after hours on a Friday and stayed the weekend. The off-hours desk person did not speak English other than 1 or 2 words. I can ask \"Where is a nearby restaurant?\" (among other things, thank you) in clear French, and she just didn't get it, trying to direct me to the grocery store across the street. It was impossible to communicate with her, even by pointing at posted bilingual notices. (InfoTouriste assured me that ALL tourist-related locations in Montreal have fluent bilingual speakers available. InfoTouriste is wrong.) Rooms didn't have alarm clocks; no wakeup call available; individual room temperature controls non-existent; not even a box of Kleenex! No tub either. I'd been looking forward to relaxing from the rest of my trip in a bubble bath. But the rooms were clean (mattress was thin but comfortable enough after a hard day of walking), and breakfast could be ordered in the mornings. Their website says, \"fresh warm croissants baked on the premises,\" but the croissants were obviously those soggy store-bought things, warmed up somewhere. They were edible, though, as was the toast, tiny glass of orange juice and tea. Towels were small, thin and miserly in number, stairs were abundant and steep, and I feel sorry for people who brought their cars with them as all the cars had to be shifted around by valet every time someone needed theirs.

The issue has to do with the parking available at the back of the establishment. Upon arrival I was told that the parking lot was full (it only holds max.6-8 cars) and would only be available when a guest left. When I was making reservations I was told that parking was available on premises, no problem. The first evening my car was left on the street next to the hotel. The next morning I moved it into the Casa Bella parking lot only to be told that my keys were to be left with the front desk clerk. This was necessary in order for them to move the vehicle so that other guests could access their cars. In my car I had left (in the trunk) a bag with around 25 of my music CD's, these were the only items left anywhere in the vehicle. Upon returning that evening from a walk around beautiful Montreal I noticed the car's position in the lot had changed, just an observation. The following day I retrieved my keys in order to take a drive. I opened the trunk to find nothing. Empty. Gone. There was no sign, not even a scratch, as to forcible entry, as if someone simply opened the trunk with keys and removed the bag. My girlfriend and I confronted the owner and front desk clerk in order to uncover the issue of the bag and were told as stated in their parking/hotel policy that they hold no responsibility for stolen items. Furthermore when confronted they were condescending and unapologetic suggesting that we misplaced them unknowingly. It seems that this is a family run operation. We filed a police report needless to say spending most of the afternoon at the station. We returned to the hotel and left that day.

The Casa Bella occupies two laterally converted townhouses on Sherbrooke west, about half-way between McGill University and the Latin Quarter, each of which is about 15 minutes' walk. Location-wise, it is central in that geographic sense, but practically speaking it is neither here nor there, as the couple of blocks surrounding the hotel are quite barren, straddling the line between downtown offices and the edge of the Mont-Royal residential area. Having said that, it is quite safe and quiet to walk around at night. There is a gas station across the street, and behind it a Provigo supermarket. Construction is currently going on the site surrounding the hotel, but since I was there on a weekend I cannot tell you whether it would be noisy or not when they work. The previous reviewers were accurate to describe Casa Bella as a European style hotel - narrow, bit rundown in my view (some will say it's \"charming\", but I'm sure one can pick out much more than just charm from the 20-year old carpeting), and no frills. I stayed in one of the cheapest rooms, No 11, a single with a shared bath on the ground floor facing the back, for C$60+tax. I've seen that the doubles (from C$90+tax) in the hotel are much larger, but my single was so narrow that it would be impossible to fit to two single beds side by side. There was a stool under my side table, but there wasn't enough space between the table and the bed to pull it out. The room had a wash basin which was useful since the bath was shared. The TV in the room was small and had a separate cable box, but it sufficed and worked fine. My window looked straight out at the construction site, and I guess when the project is done, half of the hotel's rooms in the back will be looking at other people's homes instead of the previous alleyway view. Now, the hotel gives you two keys, one for your room and one for the front door. Why? Because even though the owner and some of the staff live on-site, the reception is closed between 11pm and 8am, which means two things: (1) you will not receive any telephone calls in your room during those hours, and (2) nobody will move the other cars in the parking lot for you if you need to take your car out. I don't want to sound too petty (after all I did book the smallest room), but I think the C$1 charge for every telephone call (including local and toll-free) is a bit steep and the breakfast is a bit mean. As the hotel does not have a breakfast room, I got mine delivered on a tray to the room (never mind the TV was on the side table so I had to eat on top of the drawer chest). The breakfast ration was a small cup of orange juice, a small cup of coffee, a croissant and - I wonder why - a quarter of a muffin. I guess they believe people cannot stomach an entire or even half a muffin. Anyway, I checked out the following morning and moved to a hotel right on festive St-Denis in the Latin Quarter and got a larger single with ensuite bathroom for C$69+tax, and another C$7 for parking.
