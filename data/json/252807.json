Unfortunetly, the parking was around the street, and the parking lot itself was a little confusing. Beyond that, the hotel is in an old building and tries to maintain some of the charm. Narrow stairs can take you up to your room. I was on the 2nd floor, so I didn't bother with the elevator. The room itself offered the essentials, desk, couch (not sure if it was a pull out), two twin beds and a split bathroom (shower in a closet size room and toilet and sink in another). This did come in handy for getting ready to hit the town. The shower did offer an overhead showerhead as well as your standard wall mounted showerhead. A nice touch, although I felt the money invested to install this could have been better spend somewhere else. The room itself didn't offer a view, looked over a small courtyard with other rooms accross the way. I just kept the blinds closed to avoid having on lookers.

Otherwise I cannot speak highly enough of this small, great-value hotel. Very centrally located- close to pretty much everything, as well as a central Metro stop.

I never stayed at this hotel. I tried to make a reservation for the Grand Prix weekend. All the hotels were fully booked, and I could just find this only room in this hotel for some 200+ CAD. We were going 3 people, and I gave the lady on the phone all the details including my credit card information. At the end of the phone call she asked me to confirm the details and she started to tell me everything back. She must have misheard me, and right after she said \"for one person\", I corrected her and said it is for 3, not 1. She said that room is not good for 3 people but 2 max. So, she didn't let me reserve the room for 3, and I said ok, I am not booking it then. A week later, I saw that amount had been charged on my credit card. I called them immediately. They couldn't find my name in the computer. They asked me to call a couple of days later to talk to Catherine (I don't know how to spell her name), the manager. I called them on that day and no one picked up my phone. After like 6 calls at different times on the same day, finally I could talk to someone who connected me to Catherine. I told her the story. And she said \"your story is hard to believe.\" She couldn't find my name in the computer either. Then she put me on hold to go through some stuff. Later, I guess she found that amount had been charged for no show for the room \"I booked\". I repeated once again that I had never booked the room. She said \"the one you talked to must have told you everything correctly, and you must have misunderstood. I don't believe your story and I won't refund this amount back.\" This conversation lasted for a couple more minutes as I was going insane. Then she finally said, ok, I will refund it but I still don't believe you. I go to Montreal very often, but I don't think I will ever stay at that hotel in the future.

Having stayed at the St-Denis, I can only conclude that it has earned such a high score on the basis of its low cost. Even then, that must be based on the high season, because on my visit this November, some great hotels I'd been to (the Omni, the Kutuma) were only a little bit more expensive. To put it simply, the loss of quality was not worth the savings in money. I will give the hotel credit where due: It was clean. It was worn down a bit (old stains on the carpet and furniture), but clearly not un-cared for or unsanitary. Housekeeping was quite thorough. The location was excellent for those wanting to be close to all the metros, and a mere block away from the gay village. My praise must end there. The walls were exceedingly thin -- or at least the floors and ceiling were, as my friend and I were frequently disturbed by noise from our downstairs neighbors or from the hallway. The bed linens, though clean, were as worn-down as the rest of the room, and certainly not of a \"3 Star\" quality (who gives those stars out anyways?). Most irritating of all, the \"free wi-fi\" that I paid for when I booked the reservation was out of commission the entire time I was there. According to the front desk clerk I talked to, this was not an uncommon occurrance, and they certainly exhibited no great desire to repair it quickly, and in fact seemed rather irritated that I asked about it more than once. So, beware, TripAdvisor travelers -- the St. Denis will provide you with a clean space to lay your head, but not much else.

Here is our summary: Pros: - Great Location - 3 metro stops from main downtown area - Room cleaned daily - AMAZINGLY comfortable Queen sized bed (room 217) - Large (25 inch) television - Cheerful multi-lingual reception staff Cons: - Very noisy (Next room's shower, pigeons at window, early morning garbage pick-ups at building's rear) - Sheets/towels cleaned using far too much Javel Water/Bleach There is usually breakfast available however during our stay the breakfast room was being renovated. Overall if you can get this hotel for around CAD$70 per night you are getting an absolute bargain compared to other hotels in this price range. On this basis it gets our highest recommendation.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel - Good value for money.

It was the first time for me going and my travel mate is a native Montrealan ( I hope that's how you say it ). I did not want to spend a lot and wanted to drive up from Philadelphia so parking was something to consider. I travel a lot and have stayed at very nice hotels and very crappy hotels in different parts of the world. I would say for the price this was a wonderful deal. My room was small to average ( like a room I had in Paris ) with no air conditioning ( did not need it in Sept. but what about July? ). My bed was a full size bed pretty comfy and bathroom was clean ( shower without great water pressure ). Parking I think was $12 dollars (double check price ) you get a parking card to park around the corner (dirty little street but safe parking) then you pay at check out. I must say the hotel served its purpose for me. I wanted a spot that after hanging in the city I could come to and relax in and I found that. It is certainly not a luxury or boutique style hotel but the price and location make it worth trying out. Oh yes I can't say a thing about the staff because I was in and out all the time and paid them no mind other than to say, \"bonjour\".

Of course, we also didn't want to sleep with cockroaches & crackheads either! This is always a concern when travelling to large cities, price versus class. I have to say that while the St Denis is not an luxuurious hotel it is very clean, conveniently located and reasonably priced. Our only complaint would be the plumbing, when showering, you basically have 2 choices; a cold shower or a hot drip! My husband was particularly annoyed by this but I figured it was a small price to pay for the benefits. We travel quite often and feel fairly well qualified to judge hotels and when I compare the St Denis to other hotels in the same price range in other major cities, the St Denis blows them away! We once stayed at a hotel in South Beach in the same price range and really did wake up to crackheads on the font stoop, left over from the night before! So if you want a affordable & clean hotel, within walking distance of clubs, restuarants & tourists areas, in the downtown Montreal area, the St Denis is excellent choice, if you want more than that, be ready to pay for it!", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "israel", "Title": "\u201cnot bad\u201d", "Author": "ronitm", "ReviewID": "UR6018027", "Content": "The hotel was fine- not great.

It is a very nice Intown Hotel. The best thing about it was the location, right across from the Berri train station that connects 2 main subway lines & at the Intersection of St. Denis and St. Catherine. It is in a college area, so there are lots of young people around. There is a mall with a grocery store a couple of blocks down St. Catherine. Going North on St. Denis, there are some nice restaurants and clubs with a bit of a Bohemian atmosphere in the neighborhood. We did not eat at the Hotel, but there is a Panini Restaurant next door that we had 2 good meals at. The room itself was average with an above average bed, which is all we really care about. The bathroom was newly remodeled with a good shower. The TV had about 30 channels, I believe. The coffee in the room was some of the best in room coffee I've ever had. The front desk staff were all helpful. The only real problem was a noisy air conditioner in our room that kept us awake at night when the compressor kicked on. We did not complain to the hotel about it because we thought we would get used to it. We never did. I'm sure if we said something to them, they would have corrected it. This is just an reminder to check that out if you decide to stay there.

I booked the room on Orbitz a couple of weeks before and got the room for $95 CDN. I was very pleased with the location.

The room abutted a courtyard that appeared to be shared with the university, so there was no street noise. The room itself was basic but clean and comfortable. My air conditioner was small, but I set it to 66 and was comfortable. The queen bed slept well and the free breakfast was filling (sausage, potatoes, toast, coffee). The elevator is quite slow so just take the stairs adjacent if you are on the first couple of floors and don't have much luggage. The room was without an alarm clock and facial tissues, but I had brought my own and it wasn't a great inconvenience. Parking can be had for $12 CDN. I found the garage and parked before checking in. Though the spaces are numbered they didn't seem to have a problem with where I parked when I discussed it with the front desk. Since I had already parked, the front desk attendant told me that it would be cheaper to just use the ticket I received when I parked rather than using a pass the hotel gives you.
