The location was excellent for me because I could walk to my place of work but as well because of its proximity to restaurants in the evening. The hotel is on a quiet street and staff are helpful. I had booked a single room at a great price through Trip Advisor but the room I was given initially was small, dank and dark with a single window giving onto the plumbing chute. I was able to negotiate an upgrade to a better room for about 20 euros additional per day. The room I was given had a lovely view over the garden to the church next door and was bright and quiet. I thought I was in a different hotel! My only critique is that the room had wall to wall carpet which is never a good idea in hotels particularly in hot climates: they always smell and are a repository for dirt, bugs and the rest despite the best efforts of vacuum cleaners. Being allergic to pollens, dust, mites, etc. I had to take my antihistamines before going to bed. My other critique is the breakfast: right up there with airline breakfasts! Awful synthetic juice and lousy coffee ... in Italy!!!! The gentleman taking care of breakfast was himself embarrassed. So what's the bottom line? Good hotel overall with a few drawbacks that one can live with if you get a good price. Easier to live with if you are on vacation (and can have plenty of wine to drink before going to bed) than on business (and can only take antihistamines because you have to work the next day).", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very affordable!\u201d", "Author": "gdawh10", "ReviewID": "UR115930190", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed in Domus Aventina during our stay in Rome in January 2011.

The only noise we experienced during our stay was from a concert on Circus Maximus, which made us close all the windows, but that does not happen often as I understand. Rooms are quite spacious with small verandas facing the side wall of an old church which is right next to hotel. Bathrooms and rooms are very clean and well-furnished. The staff of hotel provided all that was necessary, so the level of service is very good. I would give the hotel five out of five, as we loved our stay in Rome, but there were several things that could be improved. I would say that hotel was quite expensive for us, even with the discount we received from tripadvisor, but that is my personal opinion, as we were able to get cheaper hotels of the same quality in other major cities of Italy. Of course, the position of the hotel is one of the reasons for such price. The breakfasts we had in the restaurant were nice: muesli, cornflakes, yogurts, croissants, boiled eggs, etc. ,although could be improved. As we are in Italy, I would prefer to see real cheese, not processed cheese that we were served, the same about ham, which was canned ham, not real meat. As it was summer, I would also expect to have some fruits for breakfast, and there were none. However, breakfasts were very pleasant thanks to the barista, who was very friendly, always smiling and singing along the songs, while preparing coffee)) Do: visit residential area to the south of Aventina, where you can experience real Italian life, also there are many small shops and cafes to visit, pizzeria that we really liked and it is just a nice place to explore.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cLocation is everything\u201d", "Author": "Frankenyutz", "ReviewID": "UR110214424", "Content": "This hotel is located in a beautiful residential neighborhood very close to the Circo Massimo metro stop.

Our room opened out onto a terrace next to the Church of S.Prisca and was very attractive. A few tips would be to watch out for taxi drivers at Fiumicino airport trying to charge you 70 euros and head to the train station for an 8 euro ticket to Ostiense station which is not too far from the hotel. Also as you come out of the hotel most people will head down the road,turn left and head up to the Colosseum but if you come out the hotel,go right up the hill it leads round to the Circus Maximus and down to the beautiful old neighbourhood of Trastevere across the river.

We were both really pleased with the hotel. Our room was a great size, and a big balcony. Our room was clean and the maid came every day that we stayed. I agree with a previous review saying that the cubical is a little small, but is still perfectly useable. The breakfast was nice, the usual continental style with cereal, crossiants, pastries, bread, cheese, yoghart etc. The location was good apporx 10 minutes walk to the Colleseum, very close to the underground station Circo Massimo. The staff were helpful when we asked about transportation and the best way to get to sights. We got a shuttle bus from the Airport (6 Euros)to Termini then a taxi to the hotel which cost 10 euros. Going back we got the tube to Termini (1 Euro each). Also easy walking distance to the old jewish area, also know as the old Ghetto. We had a great meal in an italian restaurant there. I have already recommendid this hotel to others and would stay their again. I noticed it is more expensive to book via their own website and much cheaper via expedia or hotels .com.

Our room was a little dissapointing (Room 28) The hotels own info pack says 'all rooms have a balcony / terrace' - well ours had two head height windows which were of frosted glass. We therefore had little natural light in the room which resulted in a rather musty feel. We asked to be moved, but was told the hotel was full. We had a simlar issue with the air-con as a previous advisor noted - it seemed to go off after around 30 mins, regardless of how long you set it for. Luckily it was not to hot at night, so after initally cooling the room, we didn't need it on again. Although generally unhappy with the room, it was of a good size, with lots of storage space. The breakfast was fairly minimal, even for continental standards. The rolls were fresh, but there was only a choice of jams or meat paste - no cheeses or fresh meats and fruits. Overall the hotel was acceptable - clean, tidy with polite staff. If we'd had a room with a better view, it may have improved our overall opinion of it!!", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat doubles, poor singles\u201d", "Author": "MigsOfWigs", "ReviewID": "UR5832076", "Content": "I got a taxi from Termini to the hotel at 23.30 hrs for 15 Euros. Make sure to get a taxi from the official rank in front of the station, not from the touts all over the place. Had I known where i was going and been earlier I would have got the 175 bus from stop \"i\" at the front of Termini. It served me well during my stay and i bought a weekly ticket from the small Tabac/Lotto shop down the hill from the hotel across the busy road. You only have to punch the ticket on the ticket machine on the bus once then you can go on trains and buses for a week without having to punch it again. My thanks to the earlier reviewer who gave good info on this bus. As I arrived late and the single room i'd booked was taken, I was given an excellent double room overlooking the church. Breakfast was average the next day, no fruit or meats (why not, for the price?) but they had eggs and good cereals, toast etc and friendly guy running it. Then i was asked to move to a single room. It was not a good room, it overlooked a drain and walls only and smelt mildly of the drain. The bathroom was not in a good state, with some mould on the shower wall. I had asked for a room at end of corridor and this was it, room 27. It was quiet anyway. The main part of the room was clean and i couldn't be bothered to move again. Service was ok at the desk and a good gym at the school next door can be used for 8 Euros. Rome so magnificent i didn't care too much about the hotel but if you're on your own consider staying elsewhere.
