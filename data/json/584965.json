Our priorities were location to the train station, cleanliness/safety, price, and service. Target Inn hit on most of these points. First off, booked this hotel via Expedia and the hotel rates during the off-season very quite reasonable. Location is only about 10-15 minutes walking from Roma Termini train station, but could take longer with heavier luggage, more foot traffic, getting lost without directions, etc. In retrospect, there is great convenience because the Rome subway system is easy to understand (not many lines to deal with) and there is a subway/metro stop about 2 minutes walking from the hotel which I considered to be a plus. This metro stop, Republica, is one stop away from Roma Termini making it convenient for traveling to other lines. Hotel is on the third floor and options are multiple flights of stairs or a tiny elevator with a bit of charm, but slightly inconvenient due to its style, esp with bigger luggage. Hotel is near Via Nazionale with many shops, grocery store about 8 minutes walking distance, McDonalds nearby, ATM within 1 minute, and overall seemed to be safe enough around the area although a bit noisy at all hours of the night (at least from our room which overlooked Via Modena. Walking distance from sights is not bad although taking the subway out to certain locations and walking back may be a good strategy. Room was clean, modern-looking, and fairly spacious including a cabinet for hanging clothes, room safe (actually fit my 10\" netbook with a little arranging), two chairs, and free wifi which was the fastest and most reliable wifi of the hotels we stayed at during our 2 week trip through Paris and Italty. Shower had decent pressure and most of the time seemed to have adequate temperature control although there were a few instances where it briefly got too cold or too warm. No tissue box and the toilet paper allowance got low at one point. As we came during the winter off-season, we got some instruction on using our room A/C unit, however its heating abilities did not seem to work well despite leaving it on for at least 10 minutes to warm up according to the front desk (we left it on for 30+ minutes, no luck, so just turned it off). I suspect if it were summer, perhaps the A/C function might work better. Sufficient room plugs and a nice extra shutter for the window. As stated before, room was noisy from foot and car traffic at all hours of the evening, so bring some earplugs. Not sure if this varied elsewhere. Breakfast is served to your room which is a nice convenience. They were flexible with choices and tried very hard to accomodate. Seemed to be a bit on the sweeter side, but included ham/prosciutto, bread, glazed croissant, yogurt, fruit juice, and coffee/tea/water. Overall, thought it was a nice touch. Our last morning we had to leave before breakfast, however they were able to accomodate us with a special tray which we appreciated. Service was mostly good, but not outstanding (I say this on degrees of positivity versus negativity). They were overall helpful with directions and information for tourist sites, however just did not have the \"service above expectations\" attitude that we'd experienced at some other hotels in Italy. (i.e. further recommendations for dinner other than Target Inn's own restaurant in the area although they did direct us to the supermarket and a small pizzeria for snacks). One evening, we did have a gentleman who apparently was working his first day and thus had to call his co-worker for basic information regarding travel options to the airport, nearest ATM, etc. He was very helpful and apologetic and I feel it is more responsibility on the management to train their front desk staff (prior to starting work) to answer basic questions which any tourist is expected to ask. To his credit, he did call back to our room later and provide a different ATM location that he felt was safer and closer. Overall, I suspect it is difficult in a larger city to get the best of all worlds. Target Inn is certainly an adequate hotel (given a good price point) for its location to a nearby metro stop, cleanliness, included in-room breakfast and amenities, quite functional free wifi, and the willingness of the staff to help. However, if you are looking for exceptional service with above-average knowledge of local restaurants/etc, other options may be available. I would consider staying here again if visiting Rome and the price were right.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cValue for money and much much more...\u201d", "Author": "Francis D", "ReviewID": "UR120600869", "Content": "Me and my wife stayed at this fantastic hotel, 3 nights before we boarded our cruise and 3 nights after our cruise.

From the get go, when I reserved the room, I had emailed the hotel to ask for additional photos of the room (specifically the bathroom because the website\u2019s virtual tour didn\u2019t show bathroom photos and there weren\u2019t any of the Suite bathroom pics on TripAdvisor) and they kindly obliged and sent me photos. Right away I was impressed with the customer service. The great thing about the location of Target Inn is that it\u2019s right around the corner from the Reppublica metro station, which means that it\u2019s a bit off the beaten path from the Roman Forum, but our preference was to stay closer to a metro stop (and to the Termini train station from where we arrived from the airport and where we would be leaving from). It occupies half of the 3rd Floor of a building full of various other Inns. In standard European fashion, there is a tiny elevator that will take 2 people and 2 bags up, but it\u2019s a tight fit. We arrived at 10PM and were starved, Tony, the front desk guy (more on him later) recommended the hotel\u2019s namesake restaurant downstairs, which he said will give us 10% off if we tell them we\u2019re staying at the hotel. We initially dismissed the suggesting assuming the meal would not be very good but were left with few dining options since we got downstairs around 11:30PM to finally have dinner. We were ecstatically surprised when not only was the meal delicious (I had the most delectable homemade/handmade cheese raviolis covered in a porcini and truffle sauce), the wine amazing and the server handsome as ever, but also there were 3 different groups of Italians dining at the restaurant and not one tourist in sight!! There was live music (keyboardist who sang, accompanied by backup on his laptop) who sang various Italian songs, and then belted out the classic Hotel California. It was a fantastic first impression of Italy. We were in Rome over Palm Sunday April 2011, and booked the junior suite, room 306, (200 Euro a night), which gave us additional space to move around in, which was undoubtedly helpful for two twenty-something females trying to get ready. The service was great, Tony would ask us every evening when we arrived back at the hotel, what time we wanted breakfast the following morning, and he would deliver it to our room in the morning \u2013 absolutely perfect. Fresh fruit, yogurt, orange juice, cappuccino, croissants with jelly and Nutella spreads and crackers/melba toast we took for the road! Now a few negatives that need to be worked on: the walls in the room were scuffed and could\u2019ve used a little Mr. Clean Magic Eraser action, and the Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom leaked water from the shower doors that (unsuccessfully) wrapped around it when using the shower. Not a deal breaker, but between the scuffed walls, chipped paint on the windows, and the leaky tub doors, it just gave a much less polished look to the room. There was a wardrobe to hang up clothes, which was helpful for a 4 day stay, a refrigerator, an electronic safe in the room, and a great flat screen tv on the wall. The overall stay was terrific, I would definitely stay there again and I would highlight recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClean, modern, good service, well located\u201d", "Author": "Lillith21", "ReviewID": "UR110658483", "Content": "We recently spent 6 nights at the Target Inn.

You're in walking distance to the major sites (though Rome is a fairly large, hilly city). I was slightly concerned about breakfast on a tray in the room but actually it was good - the team even accommodated us with an extra cappuccio in the morning. You can also get additional drinks on room service during the day. Some people had complained about finding the entrance hard to find - the hotel is small and part of a much larger building but we had no problems - have a look on Google and you can see the facade of the building which helps.

It's in a decent area that we felt safe in. In addition, whenever we returned 'home' at night, the door is closed to the building and the desk clerk must buzz you in, so that added to the safety in the building. We also found the employees to be very friendly and accommodating. The beds were a little hard but I think that is more of the European standard. Also, after we visited some other hotels later in our trip and were able to pick from a wide selection of foods at breakfast, we realized how limited the breakfast had been at the Target Inn. After three days of the same croissants and yogurt, we were starting to get burned out. But overall the food was still tasty and it was kind of fun having breakfast in the bedroom where we had more privacy. The metro station (Repubblica) is close by, so as long as the workers aren't on strike, it's convenient to walk to and get around town. We ate at the little cafe there by the station, it is nothing fancy but we definitely enjoyed pizza and beer while people-watching in the piazza. We also ate at the Target Restaurant, the service is slow (European standard) but you do get a 10% discount due to staying at the hotel, so if you are looking for something convenient with a nice outdoor sitting area, it's fine.

Charming and delightful, great location, quiet, and able to accommodate a family easily. We were in Rome for 4 days/three nights on a family trip (2 parents, 2 children). We chose the Target Inn because of its central location: walkable, even with a 6 year old, to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and the train station. Very close to a metro stop, so the Colosseum and St. Peter's were reachable as well. The hotel takes up part of the 3rd floor of a building made up almost entirely of small B&Bs. Our room was spacious, and the beds comfortable (although the extra beds that the kids used would not be comfortable for an adult). The staff could not possibly have been nicer. Warm and welcoming, they gave us restaurant advice and an extra cup of cappuccino in the morning--served 10 minutes after the first so it wouldn't get cold--because my wife liked it so much. On the day we left we had a 9pm flight, but since our room was not booked for the evening, the staff offered to let us keep our bags in the room and even freshen up in the afternoon before leaving for the airport. The continental breakfast was promptly served, with a cornetto, coffee (chocolate for the kids), and juice. The room was spacious and clean, quiet and most pleasant. Those looking for perfection would be disappointed: minor scuffs on the walls, some old grout in the bathroom, and some of the spreads with ink-marks or other imperfections. There were some inconsistencies in the service, but they were all dealt with quickly and with grace. For example, there was no hairdryer in the room when we arrived, but the staff quickly provided one. One day they left too few towels in the room. We had more as soon as we asked. The internet was down while we were there, and as a result we had to pay our bill in cash. So if you are looking for big-hotel efficiency and five-star attention to detail, this isn't the place for you. It felt, actually, more like being a guest in someone's house that was well-set-up for having guests rather than staying in a hotel. The staff were never intrusive and always helpful. We would be happy giving the Inn 5 stars, but we wouldn't want to be misleading as to the imperfections we saw. But for us, the friendliness of the staff, the location, and the quality of the rooms overall more than made up for it. This was a wonderful hotel for us, and we would happily stay there again on another visit. We saw some of the more recent negative reviews on the site, and might mention that the owner (who was at the front desk most of the time we were at the hotel) said he had a falling out with a partner some time back, and that there had been some problems with service in that period.

They were so friendly and always ready with suggestions and advice on any queries we had about Rome. We were also making and receiving many phone calls each day and the staff was very patient and cooperative about that. They were forever passing on messages to us. Our room was large, always clean, nicely decorated and we loved the wonderful high ceiling. It felt spacious and very comfortable. The air-conditioning worked great and was much appreciated during the heatwave we experienced there. And we enjoyed having Sky TV, which gave us an infinite choice of channels and programs in both English and Italian. The room was very quiet (except for the night Italy won the World Cup!). The continental breakfast served in our room each morning gave us a great start to the day. As far as location is concerned, it was perfect for us. The Metro station is only a couple of minutes away at Piazza Esedra, and the hotel is just around the corner from the Via Nazionale, where you can catch a bus to almost any place. Many sightseeing attractions are within a moderate walking distance from the hotel. There are plenty of bars and 'tavola caldas' in the area, not to mention restaurants. And there is even a supermarket nearby on the Via Nazionale. Would we go back to the Target Inn? Definitely!", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "moynishan", "ReviewID": "UR5287057", "Content": "Stephen and his staff were excellent! They even booked us a reservation at the Borghese prior to our arrival (I would highly recommend this service and museum). We booked the suite since no regular rooms were available, so I can only speak of the suite here in this review as for the room itself, which was very clean and spacious - even the bathroom. We did get our room cleaned everyday. The TV was big, but only 2 English speaking channels (both of which were news channels, so having at least EuroSport in English would have been nice, esp since the Giro d'Italia was going on at the time). The breakfast was only OK, but the coffee was decent and getting Nutella as one of the 'jelly' choices is really great! Having it served in the room was pretty nice as well - having a quick snack in while getting ready is a good start to the day. The water in the shower was a bit odd - cold then hot, then cold then hot (rarely together to make it warm) and only half of a shower 'curtain' (enclosed glass that went in a half circle) so water would get on the floor; however, this seems to be pretty standard for Europe so it's just a part of the experience really. The location is great - less than a 10 minute walk to Termini and the Via Nazionale shopping district is just steps away. Not a far walk to other sites either (Trevi and the Spanish Steps is maybe 20 mins or less). We ended up renting a bike from Baci & Bici which was great - although they don't rent helmets (riding in Roma rush hour w/ no helmet is a wee bit scary, but if I did it ...), so bring one if you go this route - cheaper than public transportation, more reliable and no fear of someone reaching in your pocket. Of course, you can rent a motor scooter as well.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic staff, hotel just okay\u201d", "Author": "chris49", "ReviewID": "UR5226708", "Content": "My mother and I stayed in this hotel for one week. I must admit to start with there were a few little things that could have been better, but over the course of the week the Target Inn really grew on us. Just to mention the problems: we had four hangers for our clothes between the two of us, there is no shelf in the bathroom to put toiletries on, the \"free Sky\" tv wasn't working and the breakfast wasn't really up to much. Having said all this, we could not fault the staff who went out of their way for us, especially Gianna and the gentleman who spoke absolutely perfect English. The hotel itself is in a prime position, right in the centre - the room was absolutely spotless, every other day we had clean sheets and towels. Our room was quite quiet - we only had one night with a bit of noise - people shouting in the street at 3 in the morning. We arrived early, but the room was ready for us which was great as we'd been travelling practically all night. From previous reviews on this site, we understood that breakfast would be served in a local cafe/bar, but it is now served in the room. This was not really a problem, but neither my mother nor I are really into sweet croissants which is basically all you get (oh, and a few hard biscuits). We both prefer \"proper\" bread for breakfast!

We booked at Orbitz for about $440 for four nights/2 people, inclusive of taxes. It is a small, clean and modern hotel. The room we stayed in was #307: spacious room and bathroom. The only not-so-high-mark was that our heater was rather noisy and we could not get the room to a consistent, comfortable temperature; thus our mornings would be cooler than what we would have liked. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay immensely and would recommend it to our friends and family. Note: once arriving in Termini station, don't even consider getting on the Metro with luggage: imagine \"sardines in a metal tube\"...not pretty. We realized we could have walked from Termini to this hotel. For getting around, the Repubblica Metro station is about a 2 minute walk to the hotel. Check what time the Metro stops running as it stops pretty early (around 9pm). For you shopaholics with tons of luggage, there is a lift from the ground floor of the hotel building.
