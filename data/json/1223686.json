Red Zen serves noodles, and the Bistro serves buffets from morning to night. But the best is the olympic size swimming pool, giving me a great chance to stay indoor for exercise. Inside the changing area, there is the usual hot tub and sauna. The room itself is huge, compared to the other HKG airport hotels(Regal or Novotel).Internet access is wireless available, costs $140 ( Hong Kong dollar) a day, and printing is also available from the room and personal laptop. Staffs are very helpful,and because of the remoteness of the hotel, taxi fares are refunded for trips between the hotel and Tung Chung MTR station, which is about $40 one way. Hope the ground will be improved in the future,making it a perfect vacation stay. For now, it will do as a quick stop for airport hotel.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR468621119", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "strpyw"}, {"Content": "Great Atmosphere My Husband and I stayed at the Marriott Skycity for 4 days from 26 th Dec 08 -30th Dec 08.The hotel officially opened only 2 weeks prior to that, we got an excellent travel industry rate for this property.We arrived at 7 am, approached the hotel desk at HKG airport and was immediately transferred to the hotel by pvt car transfer.(About 10 minute ride)and was immediately checked into an ocean view deluxe room (Which was very spacious by HKG standards) , the amenities were all in line with Marriott standards. We even had a staff visiting us later that day to check if we needed anything in addition , which was excellent .All the staff members we dealt with were extremely polite and willing to assist.Getting around was less of a hassle than we thought, especially since Im in my last trimester of pregnancy.The Concierge desk even offered a reimbursement of taxi fare , should we need to take a cab at any point to get to the hotel .We used Octopus cards to get around, and found them very convenient .The Airport express leaves from the Asia Expo just across the road from the hotel, the Asia expo also has a few cafes, which offer breakfast options(though slightly more expensive than standard BB places elsewhere) The Arena is one such outlet. The Asia World Expo Bus terminus is about a 5 min walk from the hotel and Bus S1 (operates at 15 min intervals) will take you to Tung Chung MTR station .That line operates all the way to HKG Central (We mostly spend our time at Mongkok , so we had to change MTR lines at Lai King).CityGate outlet mall is located right at the entrance of TungChung MTR station, and there are a few restaurents located in and around the area.Ngong Ping Cable Car station is located just across the road from Tung cHung MTR sttaion.We were quite happy with our stay at Marriott Skycity and would definitely return, and would recommend this property to anyone who is looking to explore Hong Kong, with a base away from the hustle and bustle .", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR730162603", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Bengi0"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1223686-r23241013-Marriott_Hong_Kong_Sky_City_Hotel-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "1223686", "Price": "$302"}}
