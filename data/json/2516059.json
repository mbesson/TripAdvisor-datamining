The pool/jacuzzi area is an oasis in the middle of downtown! So relaxing to sit out there around the beautiful plants, flowers and birds while sipping a cocktail. The staff was attentive, polite and very helpful. A VERY special thank you to Uno for making sure we had such a great room! The walls, the ceilings...all of the decor was an experience in itself. It was a special experience to be inside the room looking out at all the huge modern buildings including the Staples Center while at the same time being inside a room with such history and charm! I highly recommend staying with Uno and his wonderful group of employees at the Fig...it is an experience you will remember and in our case cherish! You can stay at a Marriott or a Hilton no matter WHERE you travel...you will be hard pressed to find a hotel with such charm and personality at this hotel anywhere.

They also did not offer to reimburse me for the new pants that I had to buy. I work for a company that owns hotels and a resort, and service is everything. The Figueroa may look like a unigue hip hotel, but it has the service of a run down motel in the middle of no where.

It's got everything I hope for when going to a conference - good communication while setting up my stay, attentive folks at the counter, and comfortable rooms. The breakfasts are good and reasonably priced, and I like being able to open the windows at night for fresh air. The street noise is more apparent with open windows, but it's easy enough to close them and use the AC. I didn't find the AC to be distracting when I had it turned on. The bathroom was clean and well-lit, there was plenty of closet space, and the TV had enough channels for me. The room service staff was friendly and efficient when I met them in the halls, and did a good job keeping the room clean. One thing I noticed was that the wireless was pretty slow. However, there were about 5000 programmers in town, and people who stayed in other (much more expensive) hotels had the same comment. Not a complaint, just an observation. The location is great - it costs fifty cents each way to take a bus to the LA County Museum of History, the Science Center, and the Rose Garden. The Jewelry District is within easy walking distance, as is the LA County Library, the country's shortest railway, and the Public Market.

So BOTH The Standard (which we stayed at for 5 days in Dec) and the Hotel Figueroa (which we stayed at for 4 days in April) are the kind of places we like. I found it VERY HELPFUL to read a lot the Trip Advisor reviews to manage my expectations of Hotel Figueroa because a \"tourist hotel\" is very different from a \"boutique hotel\" \u00a0So that is why I want to put in my two cents, to help the next guest determine if this is the hotel for them. For example, my very particular husband \u00a0DID NOT read the reviews and was initially put off when we arrived because:\u00a0no valet parking, no bellhop (it was after 10pm onEaster Sunday though) and they have old fashioned room keys with a plastic tag with the room number, instead of the modern card keys we are used to. However by the time we left he fell in love with the place and is already talking about coming back. \u00a0 To cut down on typing I will refer to Hotel Figueroa as HF and the Standard as TS 1 HF makes you feel like you are on a Hollywood set of a Moroccan movie. (Shakira shot a music video here awhile ago and while we were there a commercial was being filmed). \u00a0TS makes you feel like a mid-level executive in the entertainment/fashion industry. Both hotels have a touch of fantasy, just different type of fantasy. 2 \u00a0HF is literally across the street from LA Live and with all the restaurants, grammy musuem and entertainment venues located there, it means you don't have to be a slave to your car which is often the case in Los Angeles. TS is only about 5 blocks away from LA live, but I wouldn't recommend walking there at night. Besides the LA main library, not much else is near TS except other hotels and office buildings so there is not much to do outside of the hotel.\u00a0 3 HF front desk staff is from Central America/Mexico and they rarely cracked a smile or provided anything more than average customer service. I think if you speak Spanish they are a little friendlier based on what I observed. TS staff are young, outgoing and friendly and understand what is means to be in the hospitality industry. But considering the difference in the price of the rooms of the two hotels, it isn't fair to expect outstanding customer service too. 4 The bulk of HF guests during our visit were European tourists, young and old. At TS it was a lot of NY'ers on business, everyone on their mobile device. And on the weekend it was a young party crowd playing loud music and the hallway reeked of marijuana.\u00a0 5 HF has charming and romantic pool/bar area with incredible foliage and cacti. Feels like an oasis in the midst of the glitzy LA. Very relaxed vibe. TS has a rooftop pool/bar area \u00a0with killer view and it is definetly a party/pick up scene with everyone looking tan and fit. 6 Our only meal at HF was one breakfast and it was reasonably priced but nothing special. Fortunately they are between The Pantry and Magnolia on one side and all the restaurants at LA live on the other. (Maybe we would have had dinner here if they had bellydancers to complement the Morrocan theme.) TS Standard is a tad pricey for the portion size but has delicious food - especially the chicken and waffles. There are some other restaurants nearby, but not as many as HF. 7 HF parking is $12 which is a big savings for this neighborhood where $30 and up is going rate. You have to self park, the occasional attendant there is just to monitor that you have a parking permit on the dashboard and there is 24 hour video survelliance. This is a good thing because you have to drive down an alley (well lit, but alley nevertheless) behind the hotel to get to the parking lot. This felt a little scary when we first arrived. Parking at TS is $30 and they have parking attendants to bring your car. Tipping these guys every time you need your car starts to add up if you are going in and out for several days. And if there is a function going on at the hotel, the wait to get your car can be long. 8 HF has refrigerator in the room so can bring your own snacks/ treats (no microwave or coffee pot though) TS\u00a0has a fully stocked minibar so only things can have in frig is what they sell you 9 \u00a0Although HF rooms have an unconventional design in terms of decor - the room configuration is conventional. Meaning they have an armoire with drawers, big closet, multiple mirrors, nightstands. None of this was at TS. If you are staying more than a weekend, this matters. I also didn't like the bathtub/shower in the middle of the room at TS nor the beds on the floor. 10 We did NOT experience any of the complaints that a few reviewers mentioned - dirty room, homeless people nearby or a\u00a0noisy room. Our room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool. When our window was open we could here faint sounds of the music from the bar, but because we liked the musical selections, it wasn't a problem. We do wish they had free Wifi- like The Standard, to keep us from going next door to Starbucks.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFigueroa Hotel, the best place to stay in Downtown LA!\u201d", "Author": "Amy L", "ReviewID": "UR127606771", "Content": "Great vibe, great atmosphere, the most uniquely decorated hotel, fun to stay in.

I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant to go in the hotel seeing that it looked a bit shady from the outside but we didn't have much choice since it was a busy week with 2 conventions going on and most of the surrounding hotels were completely booked. I appreciated that they did give us a room even though they said they were sold out. We stayed on the 6th floor in a room that was facing Figueroa street. First night, one can hear people yelling, cars, sirens, street bumps from the street outside. It didn't quiet down until about 12:30 am. There was a huge billboard with extremely bright lights pointing up from the Luxe Hotel across the street so alot of the light was going in our room. Needless to say, I could not get any sleep! To top that off one can hear doors slamming and people walking/talking around in the hallway. I was also a bit concerned about security since anyone can go in/out of the hotel and up the elevators although there was a chain at the door and the lock on the door knob but that was it. I called front desk and asked if they can provide ear plugs or eye mask, but this isn't a 3 or 4 start hotel. They tried to be accomodating and said that they can move me to another room on the 2nd or 4th floor but they were both facing Figueroa St so it may be worse. They sent a maintenance guy to come see what he can do and I asked for a blanket to be rolled and placed on top of the curtain to prevent the lights from coming in. He was nice enough to do that. Next morning, I asked to be placed in another room which helped a bit. I asked if the blanket can be placed on top of the curtains but the front desk stated that it was not something they can do even though I told them that it was already done the day before. This new room still faced Figuroa but a part of the building blocked the room from the lights and also the street noise and there was blinds although some lights still went through at the top. I finally got some sleep on the second night. The television was small perhaps 15in wide and the remote sometimes did not turn on the TV, i.e. you have to turn it on manually, then the rest of the remote worked. There was a small refrigerator but I don't think it was cold enough. For some reason, it was hot in the rooms. Both the fan and heater were both off as I didn't want to blow dust around as the curtains were a bit dusty at the top. The bed is reasonably comfortable and the bathroom seemed clean but old. It did feel like we were staying in a developing country. Parking was in the back of the hotel and very cramped. I rented a brand new car and didn't get the insurance which covers for scratches so I was always concerned that it might get scratched, but thank God it didn't. The guys at the parking lot were helpful and accomodating. Yes, we were staying at the heart of downtown so I can't really complain much about all the noise and staff did try to accomodate and helped with the room change which is why I rated this hotel an average instead of poor.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA true gem; a visual and sensory delight; an oasis in the heart of the urban center.\u201d", "Author": "annebubkgs", "ReviewID": "UR126160243", "Content": "Wonderful hotel.

The landscaping with the plants and fountain transported us elsewhere and made us forget we were in downtown LA, a mere half minute from the bustle and big box of LA Live.

We hadn\u2019t considered spending an evening at the poolside bar, but it turned out to be one of our best decisions.

No better room could welcome you to this hotel, and there is no better place (other than poolside) to start the day. The straight-forward and very fairly priced breakfast is served here in an environment conducive to strategizing the day ahead. The owners\u2019 love of their hotel manifests itself everywhere. I stayed in a different room than my last visit and pleasantly surprised how the rooms were unique and so different from each other in their layouts, colors, and furnishing. It was so refreshing being somewhere that wasn\u2019t cookie cutter. Something as small and seemingly insignificant as a hotel room door has been afforded painstaking detail here where many doors are profoundly different and home to its individual and intricate one of a kind design. Similarly, some of the hallway lamps are housed in hanging lead fixtures which flicker hospitably, yet give a medieval and timeless aura. And the silver house phones in the lobby complement the space, despite being weirdly modern. I regret not snapping photos of all these elements, but can take solace in the fact I know we will come back here at some point. It\u2019s become a destination in itself for us. It would be unfair to close without complimenting the staff on their professionalism and attentiveness. The stunning architecture and interiors would be devoid of vitality if the staff wasn\u2019t as friendly and helpful as they were. They seem to share the owners\u2019 love and respect of this property and were quick to ensure we had the best stay possible.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, California", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and reasonable if going to LA LIve area\u201d", "Author": "fromsocal", "ReviewID": "UR122257573", "Content": "Ok, this is not a five star hotel and when you pull up in front you will think \"oh boy what did I do (no street appeal).

And possibly florid. Get some coffee and settle in. The Figueroa Hotel has been an incredibly important fixture in my life for many years. An oasis in the middle of downtown Los Angeles, the Fig is the most beautiful and magical hotel I have ever visited, and this includes stays at the Ritz in Paris and various overpriced monstrosities in London and on the coast of Monaco. I had my wedding reception at the Fig, I celebrated two anniversaries there, and I've spent far too many hours hanging out and drinking with buddies at Rick's Place, the covered bar outside by the pools and walled cactus garden. If I had my way, I'd live there. Good to know up-front: If you resonated with the traveling style of George Clooney's character in \"Up In The Air,\" and are a fan of those Best Western ExecuSuite type accoutrements -- TV-Bigger-Than-Bed, cookie-cutter execudesk and \"confab area\"; poly-fiber bedspread that picks up inoffensive pale peach color scheme of room; hairdryer, mini coffeemaker and high-speed WiFi in the molded plastic bathroom; Nutty SnakMix in the minibar; continental breakfast of stale muffins and canned orange juice; free shuttle to the local Aqua Park; Absolutely No Surprises -- you're going to hate this place. Try the Ramada or whatever it's called across the street. But if you're interested in combining form with function -- uncommon loveliness and a sense of the exotic with comfort and affordability -- then you need to check out the Fig. That sounds strange, no? Would never put those two scenarios together, right? That's a big part of what makes the Fig so unusual. It's difficult to list the things I love about the Fig in any kind of order because my experience of it has always been more about the whole vs the sum of its parts, sort of thing. If I close my eyes and think back, multiple images flash by: - the flickering light from the tin and colored glass Moroccan lamps; - the deep blues, burnt oranges and rich reds of the unique and intimate guest rooms decorated with antique furniture, original artworks and tapestries; - evenings spent lounging with friends and a bottle of bubbly by a fountain in the walled cactus garden, bathed in reflections of light rippling up from the tiled mosaic floor of the heated wading pool; - mornings in the same garden, this time breakfasting al fresco by the tiled swimming pool, aware of the omnipresent L.A. helicopters, but still feeling like I'm in the desert somewhere, maybe on my way to a secret rendezvous, oversized sunglasses and floppy hat de rigeur. - the magnificent lobby, a fabulous melange of various influences. Is it Moroccan? Is it Spanish Colonial? Do I care? - Oh! The entrance from the back alley, this long passageway of wrought iron and flowering hibiscus vines into the walled garden, past the pool and bar and into the main lobby. It's like following a path into some magical world. Well, it's not \"like\" that; it actually is. One last thing: Since a place is only ever as good as its people, a word needs to be said about the management, i.e. Uno Thimansson, the owner, the operator, the manager -- it's hard to know his title is because he's a cagey fellow and rarely admits to anything. I've never experienced such warm and magnanimous treatment from anyone in the so-called hospitality industry -- he's nicer than my parents, actually. When I called at the last minute to find out about having our reception at the Fig -- um, because we actually eloped, like with a week's notice -- Uno helped me figure out how to do it on the cheap (without making me feel like a loser) and found us a room, even though they were already sold out. During the whole process, I kept saying, \"It's fine, I'll find another place,\" but he'd say, \"No, hold on. I think I can figure something out. Let me call you back.\" It's been like that every time I've been back, whether to beg for a room at (always always always) the last minute because I just came into some unexpected cash or to prevail on them to keep the bar open for One Last Drink. And it's not like the hotel makes much money of me or any of my broke (yet charming!) bohemian arteeste buddies. Still, Uno and his staff are unfailingly gracious, treating me and my raggedy gang like royalty. Hell, I'm only writing this review now, and it's been six years already, so that can't explain the continued kindness and generosity over the years.

The best way I can describe this hotel is that is an oasis in downtown LA. You walk in and you're transported to a different world. The architecture is kind of latin, kind of Moroccan. Lots of arches, lots of colors. Great, friendly staff. Our room was a regular room with a king bed (I believe). It was a bit oddly laid out, but comfortable and quiet, other than noise from the street (which can be substantial if there is a lot going on at the neighboring arenas). The window air conditioner helped mask some of the street noise, but sirens cut right through it. There was a ceiling fan above the bed which is probably all you really need on everything but really hot days. The bed was comfortable but nothing to write home about. The room had a desk, a couple of comfortable (not cushy) chairs, an ottoman, a dresser, a table. Colors tended toward rich red tones. Two closets, one didn't seem to be used often and had a musty smell, but the other was just fine. Things that seemed to be missing were an ice bucket, lots of blurbs about the hotel itself, and a mini-bar stocked with too-expensive treats. The hotel has a parking lot our back which seems really small for a hotel this size (12 stories) but we always had a space. One note about the lot is that you must turn into it off of Olympic and cannot get to it from Figueroa. You'll need to wave off all of the parking attendants if there is an event going on and tell them you're staying at the hotel. If you need web access or want to print your boarding pass, you can use a small netbook at the reception desk. The first five or so printed pages are free. The lobby and kitchen area are very comfortable and there were always people in them, unlike some hotels that feel too cold for humans to feel at home in. The two days we were there, the kitchen had a buffet breakfast that was good and inexpensive (priced by the item so you could choose what your meal cost, not just what you wanted). They'll even make you a latte or espresso if you prefer. Wander out back and you discover the bar/pool area, which looks and feels a lot like you're in a tropical paradise and not in downtown LA.

If the server could not find a location to place a food platter, it was simply handed to a guest and the server walked off, leaving the guests at the table to figure it out for themselves.

It's location made walking to the Convention Center easy. We stayed in room 415 which has two single beds. The beds were very comfiortable. The room nicely painted and the bathroom seemed large enough to me. Yes the Fig is an old Building, but I found none of the problems and have none of the complaints some people have put up here. The Air-conditioner worked great and kept the room cold :) The room was spotlessly clean and the maids had the room cleaned and beds made every afternoon when we came back \"home\" from the convention center. Hot and Cold water worked fine and having a deep tub was also nice and gave the option for a bath or shower!! The Beds... These were singles and at first I was a little worried since I have a bad back and had just gone through back surgery earlier in the year, so I tend to toss and turn at times. The bed was so comfortable, I slept peacefully and no tossing at all!!! And while we had a view of the intersection, the room was quiet and noise from the street did not disturb us, Even my Granddaughter loved the decor and the pool area and we made use of the pool during our stay.

Not at all like the run of the mill box rooms you find at chain hotels downtown. Comfortable beds. The hotel is often booked with overseas tour groups which accentuates the foreign feel of the hotel. The pool bar is truly a Casablanca style oasis in the middle of downtown. The walled gardens surrounding the pool, lushly landscaped and the soothing chillout music will have you forgetting that you are on the edge of the center of downtown.

A big plate of scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns (with Cholula hot sauce, yum!) and coffee was only $6.00, a welcome relief from the only slightly better buffet at the Hilton up the street for $24.

Not safe. 2) No safe in our room. 3) Electrical outlets jerry-rigged and looking extremely unsafe - two prong only! The one behind the bed was impossible to reach, but that was probably good, because it might have set me on fire. 4) Air conditioner, which needed some firm whacks to get it going and seemed circa 1984, had enough dust accumulated in it that we seriously debated turning it on. That kind of stuff is gross. And easy to keep clean; no excuse. 5) Security of your personal information: this place is run on a typewriter-and-carbon-paper system.

More like you were still in the early 1980s and sort of regretting it. 3) \"Breakfast.\" It belongs in quotation marks, trust me. On the plus-ish sides: 1) It was clean enough. The beds were old and dorm-like, mattresses bad, and sheets were not nice, but it seemed clean. 2) Someone has clearly tried hard to decorate with care. It is sort of endearing, because they obviously tried, but you can't make an old YMCA into a Moroccan boutique hotel. It still smells like my college dorm - maybe the grout from the tiles or something? Industrial cleaners? It makes me think \"no way will I ever go for 'Moroccan,' because it means 'this stuff is old so we'll make it dark and maybe no one will notice.'\" 3) The pool area is nice for a drink - the kitsch works there. The building is old - own it. Don't try to make it into some weird Moroccan theme. Go with the vintage-YMCA/college dorm feeling. That could bring up a lot of interesting memories for people.

So we knew one day we'd do a \"staycation\" here. The event was our anniversary. The owner (I presume - he was French and I remembered some reviews here describing him as such) took my booking. Our main thing was we had only one night to spend and we wanted full advantage of the pool but with a usual 3pm check in & 11-noon check out it didn't really leave us much daytime as official guests. Well the owner offered unsolicited to give us an early check in (noon), late check out (2pm) AND let us use the pool the whole next day. Sold! Very very nice of him. He asked if we'd like a \"dark\" room. I said to book us in whatever would be romantic. He gave us the \"Prince\" room (#125). It was the base rate, around $150 + tax and + parking. I cannot even describe how much I loved it. Purple, BIG, 2 closets, gorgeous furniture, canopy bed, beautiful bathroom. Some people have talked about dingy rooms. Well I can tell you the bathroom was entirely spotless - it looked like everything was just caulked and grouted that day. There was a cool farm sink too - separate hot and cold taps but I'm down with old funky things like that. There were 2 downsides to my long-awaited pool experience. 1. no lounge chairs. Just metal cafe ones. I get that they have a big bar scene at night and need space for people but it was a downer not to stretch out. 2. the pool & spa close at 8pm. Again this is probably for bar biz. But we wanted to use the hot tub at night! wah wah wah Oh and one more, the water was pretty frigid. Not heated. But it was still gorgeous and the spa made up for it. It was also a little hard to get ice. I assume this is b/c they try the whole \"no outside food\" thing. But I smuggled stuff in. We also spent $70 or so at the bar & restaurant so I feel no guilt over this. The mojitos at the bar are stellar. We tried both the burger & the tomato pasta from the restaurant and both were satisfying, especially the pasta. Not grade A but the Original Pantry next door (supposedly a city favorite) turned us way off and this was a much better alternative. Plus we got to eat by the pool with a cold beer. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat, and I'd want that room. If you are into exotic, and a little funky come here.

My roommate chose this hotel for herself, my daughter and me because of it being the closest walking distance (about 2-3 blocks) to the L.A. Convention Center (we attended the 2008 Screenwriter's EXPO). She also told me it was a neat atmosphere. When I read negative reviews I became nervous about spending over $100 a night for what the reviews were saying. I decided to go with the positive reviews which included my roommate's and take a chance. How bad could it be? after all, I've stayed in Youth Hostels in Europe. I was thrilled when I arrived in the rear parking lot to enter through a long corridor/out door court yard which was filled with plants, color and beautiful tiles. We had to park in the car wash parking lot (next to Figueroa lot) as there was a Wedding party taking over the hotel parking lot. Figueroa gave us a parking pass as they have an agreement with the car wash; so don't panic if you have to park there. Go get a pass at the front desk. The staff were friendly and the service perfect. The men cooking and serving breakfast were sweet and very helpful. Everyone was always smiling! Yes, the rooms had no carpet, and looked kind of \"old world\" but that is the POINT. The water pressure in the shower was better than most hotels I frequent. If you want CUSH do not stay at the Figueroa. If you want historic ambiance (similar to a Tombstone Arizona B & B) and convenience to the Convention Center- then the Figueroa delivers more than you can imagine. The colors, lighting, decor, dressed employees, out door lounge and pool area-took me into a world that I wanted to stay in longer. My only complaint? (no 5 Star rating here) No coffee pots in the rooms, signs up \"Do Not bring in outside food or beverages\" (yet they provide refrigerators hidden in the Television Armior and no one gave me trouble about having a cooler full of food for sack lunches and dinner); AND I did not like having to pay for a breakfast.

Avoid the Figueroa Hotel at all costs at all future events. I did not always believe the horror stories about this hotel until we checked in. I had thought that this would be a one star-Motel 6 type of motel. Unfortunately, it was far, far worse than a Motel 6. Normally I don't even mind sleeping in a Motel 6, as long as it's sanitary and clean. ( I've been to hotels in other countries, as well as the Midwest and East Coast in the U.S. ) This was one of the worst hotels that I ever been in my life. Due to the proximity of the location to the LA Convention Center, I had booked this hotel for an Anime Expo Convention at the LA Convention Center. When my roomates and I checked in at the Figueroa Hotel at Day 1 of the convention, we were appalled when we entered room #318. This what we found in the room: (There were other things as well, but these were the most appalling parts.) 1. The hotel room floor-It was not carpeted and a plain floor. There were various cracks everywhere in the floor. (Some were large enough for you to stub your toe or trip over.) Also the floor was filthy. When you walk barefoot on the floor, the soles of your feet became black with dirt & hair. The room was quite dirty and there was dust everywhere. Even in the tables. The wooden chair facing the table was broken and left unfixed. 2. Rest room: There were cockroaches running across the bathtub and toilet seat. The toilet seat's was chipped and it was hard to flush. The Bathtube/shower-The worst part. The bathtub was not a flat surface and strangely curved in a steep angle. Once the shower is turned on, it becomes very slippery and I fell down 3 times. (When I tried to get back up I would slip and fall again.) The fall had bruised and strained my back. I had to see a masseur, (Spent $99) in another hotel to help ease the back pain. ( I had to see my doctor after the con was over and he prescribed me diclofenac sodium for the pain.) My 2 roomates also said that they almost slipped and fell inside the bathtub. The shower would also turn suddenly hot and then suddenly cold. When I complained to the manager, Uno about the situation, he was very rude and tried to argue with me. He refused to apologize and tried to shift the blame on me for falling down. One of his responses was \" The bathtub is 85 years old. What do want me to do about it?\" The hotel manager never once apologized, never bothered to call or come to see if we were O.K., and just didn't care whether we stayed or not. The room situation had gotten so bad that we all checked out in the morning after the 2nd day of the convention and checked in the Wilshire Grand. (An excellent classy hotel with great service. Plus the price difference as compared to what the Figueroa Hotel was quite minimal.) I just want to caution anyone who are thinking about booking at the Figueroa Hotel in AX 2009. In some cities, this hotel would have been condemmed by the city due to lack of health standards. Since this hotel is privately owned and not part of a hotel chain, it makes me wonder what the fire marshal or health inspector would find if they pay this hotel a surprise visit. (Having cockroaches running around the restroom and hotel room are a good indication that it is not up to the current heath standards.)

They are not lying. I've stayed at shabby hotels in third world countries that I thoroughly enjoyed because of the excellent service. The Figueroa would be a nice hotel, were it not for the service. It began right when we checked in. I had called a few days before to request an early check-in time. I understand that it cannot be guaranteed. So when we arrived and were told that the room was not yet ready, we were happy to wait. However, the couple right behind us were told the room was not ready, but Uno (the owner/operator) told the lady at the front desk to find a room that was ready for the couple, and somehow there was a room ready. The front desk lady did not make any attempt to do the same for us, though we were still standing near the front desk. From then on we got nothing but rudeness and attitude from the staff. After dinner and a show, we returned to the hotel to sit in the jacuzzi. There was a very loud private party at the hotel. So we were not allowed to use the pool area or the bar by the pool, even though we were paying guests. When I complained about this the lady at the front desk told me I should have asked if there was going to be a party the night we were staying there, as if I am supposed to assume that a party is going to prevent me from using the facilities that I am paying for. Then a boy got about five inches from my face and told me that I have no right to complain or talk to the front desk lady that way, even though she was the one being rude. When I asked this boy (he had a uniform on, so he did work there) who he was to tell me I cannot complain, he scampered away. There were at least two other people at the front desk behind that I overheard waiting to complain about the pool being closed and the hotel policy of \"No outside food or drink allowed in the hotel.\" Later that night our TV was not working, so they sent the same boy that seemed to try to start a fight with me an hour earlier. They must have thought that was funny. Of course I told him to leave our room so as to avoid any incident. We were told that Uno would be at the hotel at 8:00 Sunday morning and we could discuss our complaints with him then. When we checked out at 9:30 Sunday morning, Uno had not yet been at the hotel and the lady at the front desk said he may not be in. I called the next day and spoke to Uno. I told him that I have some concerns about how we, as paying guests, were treated during our stay. He asked me if I wanted him to weep for me. I'm not sure what he meant by that, but didn't think it was a good start when he had a very disappointed customer. He asked for my name and room number. When I gave it to him he said his staff had told him about me and said that I was rude and would not listen to reason. I tried to explain to him that I was not really getting any good reasons for the poor service I received. We discussed the pool being closed. Uno said that his insurance company told him to close it at 7:00 because it was dark and people may get hurt using it after sunset. (So make it safer?) I agreed that insurance is a good reason for that. But also said that is not the reason I was given when I tried to address this with the front desk (they mentioned the private party) and also there are no signs on the premises or on the website indicating that the pool area closes at 7:00. I said that my wife and I chose the Figueroa partly because we wanted to use the jacuzzi and so we paid for something that we did not have access to. Uno said that he did not think that makes sense. He brought up the fact that I did not let the boy in to look at our TV when the hotel sent him. I admitted to this and described, again, the how the boy approached me earlier. Uno said the boy was not trying to start a fight. I tried to say that he took an aggressice stance and got very close to my face, but Uno cut me off saying that I had been doing all the talking so far (though he had done just as much). He repeated that the boy was not trying to start anything with me (and perhaps he wasn't, but certainly approached me like he was) and that if his staff was rude to me it was my fault. This conversation with Uno ended with him saying he would like to terminate this converation, for some reason thanking me, then hanging up. This conversation with Uno certainly showed that he sets the standard when it comes to rudeness and disrespect among his hotel staff. Adding to the poor service, the beds are hard as boards and the showers don't work very well. The rooms are adequate, but not worth what you pay. Again, DO NOT STAY HERE.

Living in Los Angeles ourselves (my wife and I), we don't get too many opportunities to stay in hotels in the city. But we do stay in a lot of hotels across the world and I do a ton of research, so take our word for it, THIS PLACE IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST. While we splurged on the Casablance suite (room #100), I made a point of checking out a friend's room since I had read some pretty God-awful reviews in here. In fact, some of the reviews were so bad that I hesitated booking a room for my wif'es 35th birthday. I even considered canceling my booking like another reviewer here. Up until entering the room after checking in, despite how cool the lobby was, I was very concerned but decided to realize that this place wouldn't be in both 'Travel & Leisure' and 'Conde Naste Traveler' magazines if it wasn't special. It's also in a handful of other publications with decent reviews. And special it certainly is. If we booked a suite (not to mention the hotel's biggest & best) anywhere else downtown, we'd be paying $700 and up. Easy. In February for my birthday, we got the penthouse at the Standard Downtown for 1/2 price (booking the night of) for $500 (normal price was $1,000). We paid $245 for the Figueroa and it was a great deal. Out on the street, you walk up to the door wondering where the valet is and what kind of dump this place could be. It certainly doesn't look like much from the front. Parking is directly behind the hotel, piece of cake. To save you some time, pull up in the back instead of the front when you check in. Once you enter, you're swept away to Morocco. The lobby, restaurant and various bars on two levels were absolutely breathtaking. I felt like a little kid at Disneyland, running around to check out all that there is to see. The pool is beautiful with its own bar out back. We had a great time hanging out here with friends after we grabbed dinner up the street at Nick & Stef's (spectacular steak). The room...where do I begin?? You enter the Casablanca suite and you expect to see princes and princesses recling on the sofa or bed or sitting on the bench/trunk near the window. The decor is sultry, sexy and so much fun. The room is huge and the bathroom....the tub is a concrete swimming pool with a rain shower head above you. It's wonderful. The second we stepped into this room, I knew I was going to be sorry it was only for one night and we had an early morning the next morning. If you're looking for a room with a view, forget it. The view IS your room. There's a small window to let in light (and air I imagine), but of course, any added light would take away from the warm, cozy Arabian theme. There's good air conditioning and it was a warm L.A. day and night. We had a bar area with a fridge and coffemaker. There's a T.V. if you need one and the bed is amazingly comfy. The quilt is so big and fluffy it looked as if someone was sleeping in our bed. While the pool bar is hopping and definitely worth grabbing a drink at, I thought having our room right next to the upstairs bar might cause some commotion that would make sleeping difficult. Nope. I don't believe they even opened the bar outside our door and the lobby was surprisingly quiet. Now for the standard room....I have no clue how many bad reviews I read before deciding to stay here. The room I saw, up on the 7th floor (we had 2 sets of friends staying in 2 rooms on the same night), was a perfectly good standard room. Okay, the floor is concrete (painted) but the room was cozy, clean and cool. The theme from downstairs is even continued up into these smaller rooms with interesting colors, furniture and furnishings. There's a fridge, A/C and T.V. and the bed looked very comfortable and clean. I just don't understand how you could give this place a bad review. The bathroom was clean...i even checked out the tub, which was clean and in perfectly good, working order. I believe our friends paid $140 for their room. Average for downtown I believe. For the same price, my wife and I stayed at the Bonaventure in June for a wedding and while it was nice, if you wanted to be picky about some things, it certainly wasn't perfect. I was pleased with it, and certainly more pleased with the Fig. You don't stay at the Fig if you're looking for the Ritz. And if you're looking for the Ritz, you're going to pay a lot more. If you're looking for a very cool, funky, clean and inexpensive place to stay downtown, this place is AWESOME. We never had any trouble with management and checking in and out was a breeze. Sure, they have a policy as do any of the other hotels against having parties in your room. And they assume, rightly so, that if you're inviting people up to your room, you're inviting them to have a party. Let's be realistic here. What else would you be doing? The Figueroa makes it very clear that they don't approve of parties when they give you a paper to sign upon checking in. Any other hotel makes you do the same thing, you just don't know you're agreeing to not having parties in your room. Check the back of your checkin contract (or the small print). Or ask. As for throwing parties in your room, I actually have quite a bit of experience with this. Like anywhere else, I imagine you CAN have people up to your room as long as you're mature and respectful about it. If you're boozin' it up and causing a lot of rucous (and being obvious about it), you're going to get booted. If you're quiet and have a nice group of people over (not a mob) and having a beer or a glass of wine up in your room, I'm sure you'd be fine. But then again, on a nice night like it was this weekend, why would you stay in your room? And just remember, you're staying in a hotel. You're expected to be mindful of other guests. If you have more people in your room, you're bound to disturb your neighbors. I'm a fun loving guy but a light sleeper. I've been woken up a number of times by noisy neighbors. Anyway, I plan on staying at the Figueroa Hotel again. Absolutely, no question. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. If you want a fun and unique night out on the town, this is a great place at which to finish.

I did see room for improvements though. They are missing some basic amenities that would really make the stay a lot more pleasant. They have no one available to either open the door or help with luggage, no alarm clocks in the rooms, no robes, towels, linens and toiletries are poor quality and they have about ten channels of basic cable on the tv. No coffee maker in the room - but there is a small fridge. They have a very limited menu in their \"cafe\" - choice of a burger, fried chicken or chicken salad, and there aren't a lot of options in the area either. It's not in the best neighborhood. There is a lot of street noise - the hotel is right next to the 110 fwy, and near a busy intersection. The floors are bare concrete, so no sound is muffled - I did not hear noise from other rooms though. Overall, they've done a fairly good job of renovating the place - the decor is charming, especially in the pool area - but they need to bring the service and amenities up to speed.

Sadly, we have to enthusiastically concur with other reviewers who called the staff rude. For us, it was mostly the owner, an older French man--I won't say gentleman--who actually threw two of our friends out of the hotel for playing the piano. The friend who played is a trained jazz pianist and very talented. Other guests were sitting around, clapping, and really enjoying it when this French man stormed over to him. He called him and our other friend names and swore at them. They left, but only after he grabbed our friend's tie and called him an idiot. He was physically and verbally abusive to our friend who is a very kind and reasonable person. We were shocked and confused, but didn't have the whole story, so we reserved judgement. We didn't understand what had happened and after our two friends left the hotel, my husband approached him to find out. The owner, flanked by two large Mexican bell boys, pushed my husband and poked him in the chest three times, saying, \"I want you, your wife, and your baby out of my hotel.\" My husband was so stunned that he agreed to leave. We got our money back and packed up. It was nearly midnight and raining outside. We drove home (we live in LA, thank God) in the rain with our seven month old baby screaming and crying.

The visually-stimulating, full-of-character Moorish-themed Figueroa made us feel that we were far from the concrete confines of downtown LA. We found the staff courteous and helpful, the room cozy (not small) with comfortable furnishings. A window unit A/C was adequate and the room was cleaned daily- even had a larger than usual mini-fridge. The pool was beautiful, great for basking in the sun and reading near the water. And, you can't beat the proxmity to the convention center, just a few blocks away. Didn't try the food, but the dining area always seem to have business.
