Decided to go with the \"5\" because despite a few issues with housekeeping, this property and its staff went the extra mile to make things right. We stayed for 2 nights and were picked up at DAB by the Marriott's hotel shuttle. We asked Allen (the shuttle driver) if he could recommend a restaurant that we could walk to. He told us the shuttle could run us over to the nearby Marriott Courtyard restaurant or he would take us to any of the local restaurants in a 3 mile radius (free) and then just call him and he'd be back to pick us up. Nice! Checkin at the hotel was friendly and efficient. After checking into our room we called downstairs for the shuttle, so we could go to dinner. This was such a great service!! The downside to our experience at this hotel... after dinner we came back and settled into our room and found a wastebasket over-flowing with trash under the kitchen sink, plus a coffee maker with coffee & filter from the previous guest. Ick! Called the front desk and Allen came up immediately and took care of the problem ~ even brought us a brand new coffee maker. Allen really went out of his way to make our stay excellent despite the problems that were not his fault. We later received a follow-up call from the Housekeeping Supervisor which was a nice customer service touch as well. Okay, so what made this a 5-star stay? Super friendly front desk staff! Room was quiet and other than the trash problem on check-in, room was very clean. Beds were comfy with lots of pillows! Good channel selection, good wifi, great climate control. And excellent breakfast! The breakfast attendant was very hard working, the food was fresh, a good mix of healthy food and not-so healthy ;) And there were plenty of tables in 3 different sections.

I was able to check in early, given a room that met my floor preference and location perfectly and he addressed some issues with the room. My biggest complaint usually with Marriot and Hilton (I am a rewards member for both) is their unwillingness to guarantee late checkout. I asked on Saturday afternoon for late checkout on Sunday and was told for sure that I could have the room until 2. That is such a huge relief when we travel for swimming, as we never know quite how long the meet will last, but hate to have to pack up the room in the morning when we have to be at a pool for 6:30am. The internet worked perfectly and the room appointments were good. This is a Residence Inn that has not been renovated recently, but it was still nice enough.

We got a good rate, and was our first stay in a Marriot chain in the last four or five years. We always had faith in this chain, and although this stay did not change our opinion, this hotel definitely needed to try harder to keep up with the Marriot image. Upfront, I must be fair to say that the room we had was clean and relatively comfortable, but there were numerous minor inconveniences that negatively impacted my rating for them. Our booking and reception at the hotel was efficient and pleasant. After entering the first room on the first (ground) floor, I immediately found out there was no signal strength whatsoever on the WiFi. I told my wife not to disturb anything in the room until I checked out the signal at other parts of the hotel. I went to the third and fifth floor and checked signals right outside the elevator and got 100% strength on each floor. I returned to the front desk and request for a change of room to the upper floors, and was very pleasantly accommodated. We got a new room on the fourth floor and had to leave right away due to running late for an obligation. When we returned after dinner at about 8 p.m., I found that the signal in this new room was also 0%. But once I stepped out in the hallway and walk towards the elevator, the signal went up to 75 to 100%. Eventually, I took my WiFi tablet to the lobby area to check e-mail, and found out (unfortunately) that although the signal strength there was good from my tablet to the router, the pipeline going from the router out to the internet was so slow that I had to give up any web surfing out of frustration. This condition was verified by another couple traveling with us whose room was right next to ours. Surprisingly, the speed improved dramatically in the morning, probably due to low usage by other guests in the hotel. Meanwhile, my wife found out that there was no tissue, no dish towel in the kitchenette, no guest information folder, and a bunch of wet dishes in the dishwasher (condition unknown). She recalled that in the first floor room that we were originally assigned, there was a guest information folder, a box of tissue, two dish towels and the dishes were neatly stacked in the cabinets. When I turned on the TV and tried to look for CNN, the single sheet of paper for channel guide was so confusing and misleading that I could not locate the station. I called the front desk and the first response was \u201cI don\u2019t really know because we just had a new cable provider\u201d. She called back five minutes later and told me the number for HLN (Headline News) instead. When I insisted on CNN, she hesitantly said \u201c10, but it did not work on our TV downstairs\u201d. In fact, CNN on \u201c10\u201d worked fine in our room TV. As for the suite, it had a green sofa and a mismatched red arm chair (did not seem to be purposely put there by designed). The two TV\u2019s, one in the sitting area and one in the bedroom, were LG\u2019s and were very clear. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were wimpy. We were too embarrassed to ask for firmer pillows by bed time because we had already asked for too many other missing stuff. The shower handle would not shut water off completely unless it was overly tightened, and by then, the whole shower assembly became loose. The counter sink stopper would not hold water. The bottom line was: the quality control in our room was poor. The cleaning personnel should have checked and reported discrepancies to the maintenance crew to get them fixed instead of letting them go to frustrating those \u201cone night\u201d guests.

We opened the curtain to the only window in the room to stare at the corner of the building and therefore had a very limited view of anything. Disappointing at best. We called the front desk and were given another room on 5th floor. This room (studio) had 2 windows which was nice and looked out on the airport side of the hotel over the pool. The only thing immediately noticeable was the amount of dust on the tables, desk and return duct. It looked as though this room hadn't been used for a while - so we just ran a towel over things and cleaned it up. Not a big deal. After purchasing a few groceries, we put them in the refrigerator. The fan kicked on and wow - it was noisy. We tried to run the garbage disposal only to have it not run and the sink back up. My husband turned on the sink in the bathroom and the entire faucet came off in his hand! There was no way we were going to tolerate these inconveniences the entire time, so I went down the to front desk to report the problem. The front desk clerk put in a request for maintenance the next day. The next day, upon returning to the room in the early afternoon, we discovered no maintenance on the items had been completed. I went to the front desk to ask when someone might be coming. The desk clerk (a different person) had no record that maintenance was to come to our room at all. He put in a telehone call and had someone to our room within a half hour. The maintenance person, Cliff, who worked at the Courtyard down the street is to be commended as a dedicated Marriott employee. He was kind, considerate and extremely conscientious about his work. He had all 3 items resolved quickly. He showed pride in his work and we are hoping this note gets back to him and his supervisor. The breakfast area was clean and well-stocked.

Yet, the management handled the situation with class and did the only thing they could do, compensated me for the stay.

It is located under the bridge going to Daytona Beach.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, OH", "Title": "\u201cRooms Overlooking Pool Noisy\u201d", "Author": "susanmurray", "ReviewID": "UR8401668", "Content": "Recently I spent four nights in this Residence Inn and for the most part it was a good experience. The hotel was spotlessly clean and well appointed and the free breakfast was one of the best I have encountered. The staff was polite and helpful with the exception of one evening desk clerk. At first I had a room overlooking the swimming pool and the music was loud and annoying. I finally called down to the desk and asked what time they turned the music off and they said 11:00PM. I figured that was reasonable and I could read until then. When 11:20 came and went and the music was still on I called back and asked about it and the desk clerk said \"oh, OK we'll turn it off \",in a tone that made me feel that I was personally responsible for breaking up his party. I looked out and there were only two or three people on the deck by the pool anyway. I suspect that there were far more than that who wanted to get to sleep. The next day I requested a room on the other side of the building not overlooking the pool and the request was quickly granted. It was a bit of a bother to have to pack everything up and move but the new room was very quiet and the rest of my stay was good. I would just suggest that anyone preferring sleep to listening to rock music at night request a room on the outside of the building not overlooking the pool.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocala, FL", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "crymik0123", "ReviewID": "UR7722244", "Content": "I had a great experience at this hotel.

The room I stayed in was large and felt very much like home. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and dishes and with an ice-maker, dishwasher, two burner stove, and granite countertops, it couldn't have been more inviting. The decor in the room was modern and welcoming. The large overstuffed chairs in the loby were seperated from the front desk by a dividing wall holding a very large flat-screen TV. This allowed me to really feel as though I was relaxing in my own living room (if I had way more money than I do), while waiting for my ride.

We booked 2 rooms for a 3-night stay for May 18th through May 21 for a graduation with family members coming from all parts of the county. As a Platinum member I booked my reservation through Marriott Rewards desk, but was paying for my stay and not using points. A few days later on Marriott\u2019s web site I booked an additional room. The additional room had a request for an early arrival for May 19th at 1 PM. (yes, they have an option you check when making the reservation) So I now have a total of 3 rooms booked. I call 2 weeks before arrival and speak with a supervisor requesting all rooms be on the ground floor next to one another with a pool view. He tells me no problem and has blocked off those rooms for us. The property has several serious customer service and management problems. They can\u2019t seem to get a reservation correct even when you call 2 weeks prior and request room location for 3 rooms together, speak with management who confirms the blocked rooms for your arrival. Upon arrival no one knows a thing and no one cares to help remedy the situation. Early check in request\u2019s are not honored leaving guest to wait 2 hours after requested check in to get there room while maids clean other rooms instead of the room that the quest is waiting for. Plus, several other guests checking in had problems with their reservations including a couple who made a 2 night reservation but the hotel only had them for one night leaving them no room for the next night. After the disappointment of having to all be roomed apart we decide to get a drink from the nightly beer and wine cocktail reception and cookout that the Residence Inn\u2019s are famous for. The front desk tells us there is no cookout, no bar and no cocktail reception. When I inquire as why since every other Residence Inn I have ever stayed at has them I am told that no Residence Inn has cocktail reception/cookout and if we want a drink we can WALK to the Marriott Courtyard down the street. This location is the closet hotel to the Daytona Speedway and I can\u2019t imagine Nascar fans staying at a hotel without any place to have a drink. The next day at the pool I see 2 new covered unused BBQ grills by the pool. Hmmmm??? As Platinum awards member who spends over 75 nights a year at Marriott properties I decide to call the Marriott rewards desk and explain my treatment at this property. The lady I speak with apologizes and makes a phone call to the General Manager who is not on property at that moment but assures me she has left him a message and he will contact me as soon as he returns to the property. Well, for my entire stay I never heard from the General Manager or anyone else at this property. I doubt I will stay here again. Hopefully, Marriott will improve their service at this location.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn by Marriott Daytona Beach", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d596573-Reviews-Residence_Inn_by_Marriott_Daytona_Beach-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$97 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1725 Richard Petty Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32114</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "596573", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/82/2e/822ec12ec7424ac30bcbd8fbd0bf6ff39large.jpg"}}
