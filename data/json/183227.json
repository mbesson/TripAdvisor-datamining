Breakfast is served until 12.30 and includes juice, coffee, bagels, pastries and yoghurt. Everything about this place is quite tired.

It is easy to miss from the outside. However once inside, it was really nice. The rooms were very cost efficient, as Montreal can get hella expensive. Even though it was on the cheaper side, you don't sacrifice anything a more expensive hotel can offer. The rooms were decent sized. They were clean, and had all modern amenities. They offered complimentary breakfast. Croissants in the morning are fantastic. The hotel is only a few blocks from where the party is at on St. Denis street. If I got the street wrong, it's probably because we were too busy having fun to remember. There is no ice machine, but they give you packets of ice. It did the job. It's quiet during the night, which is nice for folks looking to escape the party. The only complant I had was they held the money on my credit card for a while and then released it without taking the payment. They then charged me again about a week later. That's not really that big a deal, but if you live paycheck to paycheck it can cause some headaches. When in Montreal you must: Visit a strip club (if you're from America). It's $5 cover, no one tips, and the girls were hot. I bought my girlfriend a lap dance for $15 and I got to watch! It was great! Visit Notre Dame. Have fun in there. Have A LOT of fun if you want to get sacrilegious. Check out the Bio-dome. It wasn't a must see, but it had a lot of cool animals, and plants. Party with the people! Straight, Gay, black, white, green...everybody gets along and has fun together. If you do stumble into a gay bar, be warned, they play hardcore porn on the t.v.!

We saved a bundle on cabs, and I hate driving in a large and unfamiliar city - esp. when I don't speak the language. The metro station is at most one block away. Maps of the metro system are readily available, and are very easy to understand even if one speaks no French. There are multiple route lines with transfer stations, and the guide books tell you which metro station to use. But be aware - the system is not friendly to people with mobility problems! In regard to parking, I gave them my spare keys and kept my set. That way one can access your car to get or store belongings. Safe neighborhood near 2 universities. Be aware that Euro bed standards are smaller than US standards - roughly 6 inches narrower (verify for yourself).

Each was decorated differently, lending a bed & breakfast feel to the hotel. - we passed some used needles en route to the metro and we saw city workers cleaning up sharps as well.

In this hotel, we felt like we were playing a game.. We constantly felt like we were watched and discussed by the staff, perhaps judged, but hopefully not. The staff, too, seemed like they were \"playing House\" in a very cute but not very professional manner. For example, breakfast was served in a tiny room with a menu on the wall. A handsome and sweet-voiced young man would come out with a tray and ask what you would like... but he would merely bring you something that, if he had not been there that morning, you could have grabbed yourself from another hall-kitchen type of room. Examples aside, here's the breakdown: Parking - you have to give your keys to the front desk and they have control of your car. They do not valet it, but they need keys in case of an emergency. Check In - The process is great, very friendly, but sometimes too friendly as they want to know a lot about you to get to know you. It's an experience kinda like when two people meet for the first time and decide if they want to be friends... just a preference question if that's good or bad. Business Center - Internet access is provided at a computer station that is very old, but that's completely normal by small hotel standards. Room - We stayed in a large room, but it was on the third floor. Keep in mind that there is no elevator and the building is at least a hundred years old. It's a tiresome climb, with strange decor of all the times in the last century. Our room had a huge bathroom, but it was by architectural purpose. The building was not always a hotel, so some rooms are larger than others. The room was quiet with a view of the parking lot. Water pressure and cleanliness was adequate but we felt like we were inside a game of Clue with the decor. As an added bonus, we got to see a mouse in the room... but the front desk didn't think much of it. Maybe it was something I don't understand, but I wanted to cancel my last night of the stay at that point, to no avail. Location - The outside area is great. It's close to a subway station but feels safe and city-like. There is plenty of things to do and a great dining spot is \"L'Academie\", where you can bring your own wine. This hotel needs better management, in our opinion. I thought this was an amazing find and truly looked forward to the trip.

We were not disappointed. The location was great, with good restaurants within easy walking distance, ranging from L'Evidence for breakfast to the incredible Spanish tapas bistro Pinxto in the Plateau area. The Metro stop is across the street, and the hotel offers free parking (we ended up never moving our car because using the Metro was so easy.) Don't expect a fancy lobby; in fact, there isn't really a lobby at all. The hotel seems to be made of two houses connected to each other, so there is a big variety of rooms. We stayed in one with the tiniest bathroom we had ever seen in a hotel, and another with a standard size bathroom, but both with new fixtures. (There are also large suites in the hotel--a cheerful maid showed me a just-vacated one she was cleaning.) We found the decor in the rooms rather charming, like a \"homey\" B&B. I was very surprised to read the bed bug review, and found the owner's response interesting. We actually found all the staff to be more responsive and friendlier than what the previous reviewer unfortunately experienced. The desk clerks were always very helpful; they gave knowledgeable directions and suggestions, they let us keep food in the refrigerator, and Alain even let my daughter take home a music poster that was up on the wall of the computer room (there is also a bin of giveaway posters of past events in this room and, this being Montreal, there's some striking designs.)

Living in New York City, I am totally on guard and aware of the huge bed bug problem everywhere. I arrived prepared to search the room for anything suspicious, and unfortunately I came face to face with my first bed bug at this hotel. The bed was on a wooden platform, and when we lifted the box spring, we could see dark flecks and then the bug itself. (Every traveler should read up on how to search a room and what to look for. Be prepared!) Both the mattress and the box spring were enclosed in high-end encasements, which is an excellent thing to see at a hotel. However, it was a also a red flag that they've been dealing with this problem off and on for a while. Thankfully we had left some luggage in the car while we searched, and the rest was placed in the bathtub (the safest place in a hotel room). After calming down from my subsequent panic attack, we went to alert management of the situation. Both gentlemen seemed to be nice people, but I was not impressed with how they handled the situation. We were offered some \"spray\" and told there were no other rooms to switch to. I stated that there was absolutely NO WAY we could stay in that room and then risk bringing the bugs back home with us, and that we would have to find a new hotel. Just spraying something would not have solved any level of infestation. I also offered to show them what we had found and where, but they were totally uninterested in checking things out. Management was polite as we piled out of the hotel, but I tried to emphasize how much they needed to get a serious professional exterminator in there. They were shockingly complacent about the whole situation. I'm 100% sure that they rented our room to someone else later that night since it was a busy holiday weekend. I understand that bed bugs are a problem and that it's possible to run into them practically anywhere.

We booked early and were able to secure \"Room 26\", a large room at the back of the hotel. The room was nice, clean, well maintained throughout our stay, and very quiet. Some of the furnishings weren't at the very peak of modern fashion and the room itself didn't have any more character than you would expect from a typical hotel room, but on the whole we had nothing to complain about. The hotel itself was quite similar to our room - perhaps needing a renovation to keep pace with a new modern hotel, but it was clean, well maintained, and decorated with some quite wonderful pieces of art. We were always greeted warmly on arrival, and the employees were helpful in giving us directions, offering advice, or just generally being informed on the surrounding area and attractions. In particular, the manager (didn't catch his name but he had a mustache when we were there) was terrific. Breakfast was the largest disappointment with Chateau L'Argoat. My wife and I stayed in a full B&B in Quebec City, our previous stop, and were expecting something along those lines for food service, even though we knew we were receiving a continental-style breakfast. Breakfast is, in fact, just a pastry of some sort (muffins, toast, croissant, bagels, etc.) that was obviously store bought, with coffee, tea, or juice to drink. We always had enough to eat and never left the hotel hungry, but by the end of our stay we were opting for just a coffee and looking elsewhere for something to eat. The service was, as with the rest of the hotel, terrific, and the food itself was fine, but we expected more. I don't know whether to call this a failing or just mis-aligned expectations. Location-wise, Chateau L'Argoat is just about the perfect combination of close to the night life but not too close. It is about a two to three block walk to Rue St. Denis's, on of the major night-life destinations in Montreal. We were in town during Just for Laughs, and St. Denis was quite busy most nights, so the extra distance meant that we slept well while someone staying at a hotel right on St. Denis most likely would not have. We were also a very short walk from the Metro station, and perhaps 20-30 minutes walking to downtown Montreal and the Vieux Port. We walked pretty much everywhere, and were happier for it. To sum up my review, I would return to Chateau L'Argoat again when we return to Montreal. The location was terrific, the rooms satisfactory, and the service friendly, warm, and helpful.

I was limited though, my gf told me that she wanted a \"romantical night\"(haha!), so we needed a jacuzzi, a large bed, wine and isolation. I thought Montreal in the Winter time, you can get anymore isolated and alone than that. It was so. I booked online via e-mail with Argoat, it was $120 for the Queen sized bed and double whirlpool bath. MY TRIP: I drove my fat American butt up from Albany,NY(USA) to Montreal(About 3.5 hours). I decided that a GPS was a waste of money, and probably just a hassle if I borrowed my mom's. So I didn't...yea, I got lost. Big time. The only number I had and the only person I knew, was Gilles at the Chateau. I called the Chateau and I spoke with Gilles who was working there. He was the nicest and most patient person in the world after being lost for 2 hours on the phone with Gilles, we became good friends..haha. The only thing about him was that he had an accent. So awhile of driving I got close to the hotel, I thought Gilles was telling me to turn on \"saint duber street\". I was drove all over and I called him back 3 or 4 times but I never saw a \"saint duber\" on the right or left side. I said, can you spell the street name for me...it was \"Saint Hubert\"...hahaha! THE HOTEL: So yea, after that little mishap I arrived at the hotel. It was just like I had read about. It was small, it felt cozy like someone's house. You just feel comfortable there, safe, it reminds you of home. The room was done tastefully, the bed was nice, really nice. We got alot of use out if...if you know what I'm saying. The hot tub (which is not in the pictures) was a lot of fun. We couldn't figure out how to get it work, we called the front desk. The guy came up, he thought it was broken. Turns out he had never used it before. He was going to upgrade our room from the one we had to the other larger jacuzzi suite. Then he figured it out, there's a special button on the top of the tub. You won't notice it, it looks almost hidden. Anyways, it worked. I had my romantical night with my lady. The TUB and BATHROOM ARE HUGE! There's a walkin shower too(If you are really interested PM me, I have a video I took of the room) The TV is small but if you are staying there for the reasons I was, you won't be watching TV. It did have a DVD player which I used to play some jazz and other romantical music. Also, parking was easy and free. FOOD: It was minus 5 degrees or less with the wind. So I didn't walk around at night or the next day. It took all the courage my gf and I had just to go across the street to the Hilton. At the Hilton is where I ate dinner and it was delicious! I had a chicken burger, a turkey club sandwhich, and some french onion soup. Our server there was hilarious, a real character. The bill came to around 50 sumtin Canadian for 3 drinks(alcohol), a soup, and an 2 entrees. Great deal, considering I would have payed double for that quality they offered. The breakfast at the Chateau was also as described here. It was amazing. The coffee and juice was really good. I had a muffin, crepes, toast, haha, everything. NO WONDER I'm a fat american!!

Though we were choosing a hotel by running out of the car and checking rooms/prices, L'Argoat was a perfect find. The rooms are decently cheap, but vary heavily, from an odd smaller room with an unattached (but private) bathroom (just the one room, a victim of the older architecture), to sunny, queen bed and jacuzzi affairs. It being late we opted for the jacuzzi, which still put the room down cheaper than our original booking. L'Argoat has three floors, attached by stairs. There is no elevator or handicapped ramp. The only problem we had all stay was with the heat. With the outdoors so cold, the Quebecois like it hot, and we couldn't seem to make heater go below sub-tropical. Cracking a window was a quick and very effective fix. Breakfast in the morning is simple and french, baked goods brought to order and coffee tea and juice. If you're really hungry you'll have to head out into Montreal, which is probably why you're there anyway. The desk staff were friendly and courteous, and basically run the entire place. Housekeeping is separate, but the desk staff are also your parking attendants and waiters for breakfast. The parking situation is a little house party style (but it was free). You have to leave your keys at the desk because the lot out back can only fit enough cars if they park people in. We decided to trust them and they didn't ding up anything while we were there. But I could see it being inconvenient if you were in a hurry. The parking is also off of an un-plowed back alley, in Montreal.

I like the back because it is quieter than the front rooms that face the street. The staff has always been friendly and bi-lingual during my two stays there.

I must also mention the yummy continental breakfast, with really good coffee, fresh baked muffins and croissants, including pan au chocolat, as well as fresh fruit and OJ. The dining room attendant was very friendly and helpful. This hotel is across the street from the Doubletree, so you can easily grab a taxi if you want, but the Metro station is right there and it really is the best way to get around. The bus station is just 2 blocks away if you want to catch the Aerobus to the airport. In summary, a great hotel with great staff and a great location--what's not to like?", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cEuropean charm with lots of value\u201d", "Author": "jeanki", "ReviewID": "UR10078561", "Content": "I had a really nice stay here, and thought it was a wonderful value with free breakfast, free parking, and free internet. It is a small European style hotel in a charming refurbished set of adjacent rowhomes. The room was not large but certainly a comfortable size with pretty French style decor and a comfy leather sofa. The bed was a little bit saggy but it had a down feather bed and plenty of comfy pillows. I am picky about bathrooms, and I adored this one because it was so roomy and spotlessly clean with modern fixtures, a shower stall, and a whirlpool tub. My only quibble would be a slight musty odor coming from around the dresser area, but the rest of the room and the bedding did not have this odor. The TV had a full complement of cable stations in both languages, and the best part was that this room was really quiet (try to get one facing away from the street). You could sleep really well there. The staff were very helpful and relaxed in a good way. Feel free to ask them for maps and advice. The continental breakfast was wonderful, with fresh squeezed orange juice and a nice selection of pastries which they serve warmed to order. I suggest the huge and delicious maple muffin. The location was easy to drive to, and although initially it seemed kind of out of the way from the conventional downtown area where most hotels are, it turns out this location is even better because of its proximity to the best, hippest neighborhood in Montreal, the Plateau which just a short walk away north on St. Denis. You can also go south on St. Denis into the Latin Quarter which is like the St Marks Place of Montreal. If you keep going south it gets a little seedier into their Red Light District but it still feels quite safe. The Sherbrooke metro obviously also is just a block away and connects easily to everything. You are just a few stops away from the lovely Old Montreal district and Chinatown, and if you can visit the heart of the Plateau by going one stop to Mont-Royal. You can transfer at Berri-Uqam to the green line and visit the rest of downtown Montreal and the McGill/Saint Catherine area for mainstream shopping and museums (the nice Montreal Fine Arts museum is free this fall!) You can get a tourist day or 3 day pass for the metro. All in all, this is a great place to stay in Montreal, with the personal quiet feel of a B and B but the amenities of a hotel. Montreal is a mellow but posh city with awesome food and a unique vibe. You get the French culture without the attitude which is great, and everyone easily goes bilingual there. It's too bad that the US dollar is weaker than the Canadian one right now so its not quite the bargain it once was, but its still a great place to visit.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff\u201d", "Author": "PaulaNakamura", "ReviewID": "UR10072479", "Content": "The owners were very kind and helpful during our stay.

I stayed in room 14, which is one of the more basic rooms ideal for one person or a couple on a budget. The room was very comfortable, with a solid matress, brightly painted walls and interesting artwork. A mirrored closet and chest of drawers provided ample space for clothes and a place to hide cases etc. The room has a seating area with coffee table and lamp for reading, a writing desk with phone (free local calls) and free Wi-Fi internet access, and a good size TV with cable. This room also came with remote controlled air conditioning. The bathroom was rather small (half-bath) but very clean and fresh - more than adequate for a short stay. There is housekeeping daily. The small but well kept breakfast room is decorated with posters from past Montreal events. The breakfast is continental with the usual croissants, pain au chocolat, bagels etc. Tea and coffee is available, along with juices and herbal teas (there is also an all-day coffee machine). The waitress was always extremely friendly and helpful, and the service was fantastic. There is a lounge next door to the breakfast room where you can read a paper or use the hotel's computer if you have no laptop. Everyone from the people on the front desk to the housekeeping staff were always very friendly and polite and keen to make you feel at home. When I asked about local coffee shops, the kind woman at reception took me onto the street just outside and gave me plenty of helpful suggestions. The hotel lobby also has plenty of free leaflets and guides to local restaurants, events and attractions. Whilst some of the decoration is a little quaint (brass beds), I really cannot fault this hotel for the service and value for money. At just $85 a night I had a clean, comfortable hotel with great features such as free internet, and only a 3/4 minute walk to the Sherbrooke metro station. Indeed, it is only a short stroll to the main shopping parade of rue St Catherine.

My wife and I stayed in a room at the front of the hotel and there was some street noise at nght so if this bothers you try for a room at the back. The location was excellent right on the edge of the Latin quarter and close to the Metro. Rooms were very clean and the maid service was impeccable, breakfast was a little sparse but at the end of the day you get this included in the cost, rather than as an additional cost. Please note this hotel is not really suited for disabled or elderly/infirm people as there are a few steps up to the main door and no lift in the hotel.

Also, the Sherbrooke metro station is right across the street. And, Rue St. Denis is only a block away. My only complaint would be the room did have a hint of smoky smell.

It is actually two adjoining rooms with a door that closes between them. There is a full-sized bed in one room and a twin bed in the other; each room has its own TV and air conditioner (operated with a remote control). The bathroom was huge, with a bathtub so long I could completely stretch out and be totally underwater from head to toe (I'm 5'4\"). The room and bathroom were extremely clean and was always fully stocked with towels, soaps, etc. (The lavender soap was so great, I brought a bar home with me!) It was painted in cheerful yellow and light green, and I enjoyed that some of the original woodwork had been retained. Based on what I had read in other reviews here, I asked for a nonsmoking room, in the rear of the building and on an upper floor. All of these requirements were met -- our room was actually at the end of the hall on the second floor, so we never had anyone walking past our door. A few times I could hear voices (either from the hall or the adjoining room), but never as much as a loud TV or footsteps overhead. We heard absolutely no noise from outside the building. The staff was always extremely friendly, both in my e-mail communications to reserve the room and in person at the hotel. Everyone I encountered spoke good English. The breakfast options were basic (nothing home cooked -- store bought pastries, etc.), but I'm not a big breakfast-eater and a bagel was enough to satisfy me. The coffee was good and plentiful. They also had some samples of a new brand of muffin set out for guests to try and offer opinions. I didn't drive my car at all during my stay, and it was completely safe parked behind the building for three nights. I used the computer in the lounge to check my e-mail every evening, and only once had to wait (less than a few minutes) to use it. All the guests I encountered were friendly and seemed to be satisfied with their choice of lodging. The Chateau d'Argoat is a great option for those who want the personalized atmosphere of a bed and breakfast, but who want some of the benefits (such as your own bathroom and a little more privacy) of a hotel. As other reviewers have said, the location is great and it is a lot cheaper than the chain hotels on this part of Sherbrooke. It is in an older building, and if you're looking for an upscale boutique hotel or a Sheraton-type place, this isn't it, but it is very well-maintained with both original details and modern updates.", "Date": "July 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding, CT", "Title": "\u201cCharming, Friendly and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5383050", "Content": "We stayed for four nights in room 7.

What a terrible mistake that was. This hotel could not have been more dissapointing. The room was disgusting -- the carpet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in over 20 years and I was literally grossed out when my bare foot accidentally touched the floor. I had to wash my hair in the sink the first morning because the shower head was so old that water was hardly coming out of it. They did replace the shower head once I complained, but the water pressure was non-existant and so I had to continue washing my hair in the sink the rest of my stay. There were two double beds in the room but one of them was completely un-usable. The matress was so hard that my mom and I actually checked to make sure we weren't sleeping on the box spring. If the floor hadn't been so disgusting I think I would have slept on the floor. Instead, my mom and I had to share a bed every night. I'm not sure where the pictures on their website came from but they are CLEARLY not of the hotel in its current condition. It looks like it hasn't been renovated or even updated in 30 years. Additionally, on our first day there we asked the man at the reception desk for recommendations for a good place to have lunch. He sent us on a 15 minute walk through a dangerous-looking park into a street filled with tourist-trap restaurants where I would never be caught dead eating. We discovered by ourselves the next day there's an entire street filled with great restaurants and cafes just down the block. It was the last time we asked anyone at the hotel for recommendations. Honestly, I've been traveling all my life and have never stayed in such a bad hotel. And I'm not the only one who feels this way. While we were waiting for a cab to the airport on our last day, we saw 2 different couples complain about their room and leave to start looking for another hotel. This place doesn't deserve the 3 stars it has. Please, if you want to have a nice stay in Montreal, DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL.

If you don't want to bother with transferring underground trains, you can walk a few more minutes - downhill - to the bus station, where there is also a metro stop (Berri UQAM).

The first morning I had to wait 5 minutes for a table. No big deal. Breakfast is served from 7 am until 12 noon, I believe. There seems to be a bit of a rush at 7, but if you arrive later you will have no problem. I also saw some people taking the food back to their room. We had a room facing the front, right across from the front desk, and while there was some noise, nothing that I couldn't get over. The room had a 2nd door that you could close in addition to the one that went into the lobby area, so that helped buffer indoor noise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. When we checked in, the person on duty told me the hair dryer in my room was broken, but he would have another placed in the room. When we got back a couple of hours later, it was there.
