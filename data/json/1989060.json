When we checked into the hotel we were greeted by a nice young man, who was wearing a trainee badge, he was helped by a male receptionist who allocated our room, I politely ask if there was a choice of room, he shrugs his shoulders and said a double room is a double room! He gave us very limited information regarding the hotel, compare to other guests when checking in. The room was so small, dark and standard of cleanliness was not at all good. The bathroom was so small it was really awkward to use, the toilet smelt and the toilet roll holder was broken, the roll was just stuck on the end, which constantly kept falling off. That night we discovered that sheets stunk of cigarettes,one good thing is they did seem to change them daily. The next day we left at 9.30 am and returned at 6.30pm,they had just started to clean our room!! I spoke to reception, they just said \"Sorry\" and that was it. It was only then we discover the bar, the bar man completely ignored us, we had to get up and walk over and speak to him. I just assumed all of the rooms were like this as I had been told on checking in, on the last day I saw other door open and the rooms were extremely spacious, so I strongly advise guests to check before the accept a room.

Breakfast is a huge display of food--everything from cold cuts and bread to yogurt, fruit, eggs, bacon, and several other items that we had been longing for! The places we stayed prior to Hotel Grums literally had a table with croissants and butter, so this was a nice surprise! The spa area was a great afternoon retreat as well--the sauna and steam room were soothing and a dip in the pool-sized hot tub was a great way to relax after walking all over the city. The staff is very helpful, even the people who work into the wee hours of the morning. Everyone was always ready to answer questions or offer suggestions on things to see/places to go in the city. Hotel Grums is a great place to stay if you want to be near the Port of Barcelona, near some nightclubs (on Paral.lel), and want to be in a location that is convenient to get to the main sites in the city. The longest metro ride we took was to La Sagrada Familia, which is an easy ride across the downtown area.

The rooms were really nice and the hotel was fine for what we needed it for. As part of the stay we were given a free drink and tapas (though as one person pointed out it wasn\u00b4t really tapas but it was free so why get your knickers in a twist). On the first night there was a barman and he seemed fine and was there for a few drinks. The second night (same guy) didn\u00b4t seem so good and kept hiding out the back. The first time we waited around 5 minutes with no sign so I went to reception to be told there was someone there, fine but they weren\u00b4t actually there so she proceeded to just call the bar and surprise surprise no one answered, well that was because no one was there! Anyway another 5 minutes and he came out but after serving everyone disappeared again to which we just decided to head out to our favourite bar Diner Apolo! Seriously go there much nicer vibe than anything I saw on the ramblas. The spa is very small but has a nice enough swimming pool/large jacuzzi with a steam room and sauna. However any more than 6 people you\u00b4d probably be getting a bit too friendly especially in the changing room!

First impressions were positive, a smart modern glass reception area and a superb clean, modern room. The bed was huge, nicely firm and supportive with top quality sheets and pillows. Our room, 413, overlooked the central courtyard and had great lighting, mini fridge, free in-room safe and TV, although as others have mentioned there is NO english language channel. Location wise the hotel is out of the central tourist area in a largely residential area called Poble Sec two just off Avenida del Paralelo and 5 minutes walk from both the nearest metro station (Parallel), the Naval museum and the port. It is also perfectly located for exploring the Olympic park on Montjuic mountain overlooking the city. TIP**- if you want to avoid the overpriced tourist traps in the old town head 10 minutes west from the hotel to a street called Carrer de Blai where you will find lots of little tapas bars where all the locals congregate in the evening to pass the time of day and put the world to rights whilst their kids play football and ride their bikes - a real taste of the true Barcelona and with tapas/montadito dishes priced at around 1 - 1.50 EUR each you can spend a great evening out for less than 20 EUR for two of you! However if you are planning on spending all your time in the old town area of Barri Gotic or Borne to the north of Las Ramblas then you will need to factor in a 15-20 min walk each day. With regard to the safety aspect mentioned by some previous reviewers I must say that at no point did we feel unsafe of threatened in any way. The road leading to the hotel from the Parallel metro is well lit and overlooked by apartment buildings all the way and although we did see a few people sleeping rough in the park, they are easily avoided by sticking to the road and like any big city you just need to use some common sense. Our rate included breakfast served from 7am through to 10am each day on the mezzanine level with access to the central courtyard. Catering for its prime european clientele, it comprised lots of cold meats, salamis, cheese, pastries, cakes, donuts and fruit and although there was a small bacon, sausage and scambled egg selection, this was pretty poor and not a patch on the delightful continental selection. However at 11 EUR pp it is not particularly good value and if you are not on an inclusive rate then I would strongly suggest going next door to the lovely looking bakery/coffee shop. Access to the gym and spa is now charged at 6 EUR pp - maybe in reaction to some of the previous comments! The gym area is very small consisting of just a treadmill, a couple of bikes and an area for floor exercises, whilst the pool was about 10m long with a steam room and sauna just off to one side. As I had the place to myself there was plenty of space and the area was great for a relaxing few hours after some hard sightseeing. On the negative side, my biggest gripe was the lack of the free wi-fi that never actually worked and the fact that in some areas the hotel felt unfinished with loose and badly aligned fittings. However overall I would recommend this hotel if you can get it at a good price and are looking for a comfortable modern quiet hotel outside of the main tourist areas.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMinimalist\u201d", "Author": "peecee007", "ReviewID": "UR118371473", "Content": "My wife and I chose this hotel completely blind after leaving it till the last minute to book a hotel in Barcelona before we got on the cruise ship.

We were room only so can't comment on the food and drink. Big plus for us was that there is a coffee and cake shop next door and a Lidl supermarket just around the corner. Free wi-fi, free safe.
