The hotel is in an ideal location to all downtown attractions. Literally within walking distance of everything you would need or want to see. I was impressed at the modern decor and attractiveness of the lobby and bar. I was also impressed by the room. It had great window with a view of downtown, super comfy beds, a large armoire and roomy dressing area and the room was very tastefully decorated. The room was also quite clean. I found the staff to be always incredibly friendly and helpful, so much so that it really stood out for the service alone. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and it was perfect for my business trip. There are only a few negative things about my experience: that there were a few minor details that needed tweaked in the room such as a small area of peeling wallpaper, recent repair that was not yet painted on the ceiling. (honestly though the rest of the room was so clean and nice it didn't bother me) The elevator is old and during one break in the conference when it was enduring a lot of use, it just quit and we all had to use the stairs. I ordered room service 3 times for convenience and it not only took a long time to get my food but the food was alway just mediocre. There was no refrigerator in the room, a small one to keep drinks cold would have been a nice touch. All in all, this is a nice hotel with great service, comfy rooms, great decor and a location that cannot be beat. This place is perfect for business. I would skip eating at the hotel though (at least room service). There are some fantastic places within walking distance or a short cab ride for breakfast, lunch and dinner.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Enterprise, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cAcceptable place to stay, especially for business.\u201d", "Author": "GermFreak", "ReviewID": "UR128496737", "Content": "I stayed here years ago when it was a Wyndham. (That time I got stuck in the elevator. More about that later.) I attended a conference here the past three days which was in this hotel so it was the place to stay. We attended a very large conference with hundreds of attendees. Pros: Great valets and bell hops. In fact, the staff would be the best part of the stay. I could not go on enough about the young men who worked here. They were simply wonderful. We interacted with many different gentlemen and they were all very professional. Also, the front desk staff were helpful. The room was not ready when we arrived early but they held our luggage and called me when it was which allowed us to go to dinner. The rooms were pretty clean, which is my #1 requirement. Great blinds to block out light. The location is really good, too. We were in the perfect location to visit the Heard Museum, Scottsdale, and the Desert Botanical Gardens. Cons: The escalators were not working going down. You cannot take an elevator down from the ballrooms to the Lobby. You must go the the bottom floor and walk outside. This was not a problem for most of us but it was for some. I do not know how someone who is physically handicap would attend without a great deal of assistance. The gift shop has very high prices, which I think most of us expect. Go to the store before coming here. The worst thing was that things are not well marked or explained. Do they serve breakfast? When? Is there a restaurant? Where is the pool? Why is there no phone book? The hotel channel did not work. Also, the walls really are pretty thin. You can hear slamming doors, etc. No refrigerator or microwave. Valet parking $23 and no free internet. Even if you get a good rate you are going to be paying full price soon enough. Back to the elevators - Did I get stuck? No. Did all the elevators go down? Yes. MANY people could not get to or from their rooms. One lady walked up 15 flights to get to her room. Not me. I asked about the service elevators and soon the staff was taking us on those to get us to our rooms, though it took about 15 to 20 minutes for this to occur. I think the elevators in this building need work since I know that the problems have been going on for years.

I received neither an upgrade nor a note so I guess my high degree of loyalty to Marriott doesn't matter at this hotel! The room was nice and beds were comfy but the A/C didn't work. It took them an hour to fix it and then they left plaster and who knows what else all over my carpet so I had to call down again to ask for someone to vacuum. The front desk staff was only mildly helpful but the staff supporting our meeting were very nice. Lobby was beautiful but as others have said there are obvious areas they haven't addressed in the renovation. I said Hail Mary's every time I got in the elevator as it frequently stopped a couple inches above or below the floor and I felt it was only a matter of time before I got stuck. The concierge lounge is very limited although the free breakfast they offered instead was quite nice. The gym is in serious need of an overhaul.

Overall, this was a good hotel, but my expectations at the time of booking were not met. I had requested a King room when booking, and even checked in the day before to confirm and ask for early check in at noon. When I arrived, I was told that I was booked into a 2 Queen room and that they didn't have a king room clean. I asked how long it would be, and that woman at the desk said it should be just a while longer..after noon. I had 30 minutes, so I asked her if I could wait in the bar and have a drink, then check in at noon. She said yes. But I sat in the bar for a full 10 minutes before realizing that it was not open/not staffed, and that was not going to change at that hour in the day. It would have been great to be told. I checked back in at 12:45 to learn that there was still not at king room available. Tired and wanting to just have a place to relax, I took the 2 Queen room. It was clean and had everything you could want, but was dark, and felt small and overcrowded. The paint was chipping on my bathroom door and the toilet paper holder was loose in the wall. There was a lovely cabinet in the vanity room for me to hand my clothes, but the space was not large enough to accommodate myself, the cabinet and my suitcase all at one time. The service was spotty. My room was cleaned daily, and my used towels taken away..but no new towels were left. I was there for 3 days, and my towels were never replenished. The pool was completely in the shade 24/7, so really wasn't of any use at all. The elevators were so obviously old that I was a little scared every time I stepped into one. The walls were thin, and I was woken every morning by other guests in the hall leaving for daily activities. I just felt that the hotel misrepresented itself, and had I had realistic expectations, I would not have been so disappointed. It was just very much an old hotel with a little spit polish. The saving grace to this trip was the evening Navigator (Renaissance Concierge) whose name was Ivy. He was FANTASTIC!!!! He found me a great trip to the Grand Canyon, calling two companies to find me space. He advised me on how to get out to Scottsdale the following day for a Giants spring training game, and when I could not reach my cab to return, he called around to find me a taxi at an affordable rate to get back.

If it wasn't for outstanding customer service I would have rated this stay a 2. The following things led to a poor experience: No hot water one morning. Three days (of seven) my room wasn't cleaned - around 4 or 5 PM I called to inquire and they were very responsivenss to sending housekeeping, but I'm not sure why it wasn't done. Bar service is very slow - the bartenders were nice however you often had to wait a long time for drinks/food. It wasn't really their fault, they were understaffed and it showed during busy times and happy hour. Valet - HUGE problem. Took at least 15-20 minutes to get my car, on one occasion they 'accidently' parked me in behind a bunch of cars parked for an event and I had to wait almost 45 minutes. The concierge lounge was subpar and needs improvement. In saying all of this, my stay was turned around by great customer service. I called management to speak about the problems and Andrea was terrific. She listened to my concerns, apologized, and followed up so things could be improved. The experience had not met my expectations of staying at a Marriott, however Andrea restored my trust in Marriott's commitment to great customer service. Additionally, Amanda at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. The concierage was a bit rude when I inquired about something, but I spoke with Amanda and she was able to provide a much better solution. She was cheerful and always willing to help.

It turns out I was in the wrong queue because there weren't any markers or signs telling me where to stand. In between all this, the drunk businessmen at the bar were making such a racket that it would have been hard to understand what anyone was saying... if anyone bothered to try to help me, that is. After surviving the checkin, I was really surprised how weak the facilities were inside the room. First, it was kind of small. I had to move furniture before I could open the ironing board all the way. If I was thirsty after waiting through the check-in queues, I would have to come up with $5 to enjoy the bottle of water they kindly placed in the room for me. The coffee machine was a single cup format. And the cups were foam. The linens didn't completely cover the mattress so the corners popped open during the night. The internet comes at over $10.

I would definately stay at the Renaissance again, should I make another trip to Phoenix.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Front Desk, Worst hotel shower ever.\u201d", "Author": "corey_sebes", "ReviewID": "UR125829670", "Content": "To start with, this is a pretty average Renaissance. Similar to most of the others I've stayed at. One thing that did stick out was how awesome the Front Desk was. We were going to a Suns game and needed to print our tickets. Amanda at the Front Desk really helped us out, and she was able to print them off for us at no cost (the concierge wanted us to pay $7 for 2 pieces of paper...). Two things that were really disappointing about my stay: - The valet service was pretty horrible. In the morning, I would call 15 minutes before I wanted my car (they recommend 10) and my keys would still be hanging on the board when I went downstairs to fetch my car. I also had brought my car back and told them to keep it out since I was leaving again in 10 minutes. I went downstairs, and it was back in the garage. Luckily the restaurant held my reservation. - The shower was also horrible. Most renaissances have the waterfall shower heads, and this one had one from the 80s. There was usually no water pressure when I showered at 5am, and the water was cold every morning except my last one there. I had to wash my hair in the sink multiple times. I didn't have a choice of my hotel, but I would probably stay at a Marriott instead just so I know the consistency is there. The Front Desk was OUTSTANDING through and so were the people I talked to in DTS.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cAverage In Most Ways\u201d", "Author": "winwolf56", "ReviewID": "UR125617708", "Content": "This hotel is well situated in downtown Phoenix for the convention center (just a few short blocks), sports facilities or downtown office towers.

While the area feels safe after dark, be prepared for a lot of empty store fronts. The hotel and rooms have been renovated reletively recently, but it is hard to mask that this is an aging hotel in a struggling downtown. LInenes were on the cheap side and room amenities inferior to other Renaissance Hotels I have been in previoulsy. Staff are very pleasant and made me feel welcome.

Overall the hotel is great and if you are going to stay downtown this is by far the best hotel but I think the thing that made this hotel just that much better was the awesome staff. They were friendly, clean cut, fun, and professional. Amanda at the front desk is very sweet and was helpful at answering many of my questions and still was fast and efficient at check in. I also worked with two bellman on my trip. Thomas and Floyd. Thomas brought my things up to my room and was not only friendly but extremely informative about the room and before I even had to ask if he would get me ice he already had the ice bucket in hand and offered to get some for me ad Floyd saved me from being late to the airport on my checkout.
