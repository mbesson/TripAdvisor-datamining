We caught the taxi from the airport, and it cost us 40 euro. The taxi will also drop you off about 10 metres down the road, as the road which the hotel is located on is too narrow for cars.I really loved the area the hotel was in. It was in a residential area and very close to a supermarket. It was also easy walking distance to all tourist attractions.Yes you have to walk up stairs to get to the hotel, but we didn't find this a problem and the staff offered us help with our luggage on arrival. In fact throughout our stay the staff were very polite and helpful.The rooms were modern and very clean. I have stayed in several 2 / 3 star hotels in Italy, and this bathroom was probably the best so far. The rooms were spacious, air conditioned and cleaned daily. I was also impressed with the daily breakfast, which included fruit, cakes, cereal, croissants and freshly brewed coffee.This was one of the cheapest hotels we stayed at in Italy, but was definately the best. For the budget concious traveller I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR396153337", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Filamena"}, {"Content": "Liked the hospitality Hotel Cardinal is a nice hotel located right behind the Duomo in Florence. The hotel can be reached by a 10 minutes drive by taxi from the Railway station. Its advisable to take a taxi as its difficult to find the place on your own the first time you visit. Besides, its a 20-25 minutes walk from the station so it may be difficult to reach there on foot with luggage and also when travelling with kids. As per the description in the reviews I read, this hotel is located in one of the lanes behind the Duomo in an old 2 storeyed building with 60 steep steps leading to the reception. You may get totally dissappointed when you reach the entrance of the building and climb the steps. We were all girls with a child in our group so didnt hesitate to call the manager at the desk down to pick up our heavy bags. I must mention that the staff here was very friendly and the florentine hospitality was the best that we've seen of the cities visited in Italy. The rooms and bathrooms were neat and clean. This hotel can be inconvenient for older people due to the fact that there was no lift in the hotel building and the location was far from the station. But besides that everything else was perfect. And the best thing about this place is definitely the friendly and helpful staff. This place reminds me of the bed and breakfast places that are found in some parts of UK.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR855332448", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sk18"}, {"Content": "In The Heart of Florence       The room", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR155613261", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gunnar_OShea"}, {"Content": "The worst we experienced ! After finally finding this hotel and being unable to park our car anywhere, even to deposit the luggage things only got worse...we (myself, 2 young children and my husband) had to haul our luggage up 60 odd steep steps to the 4th floor to reception with no help from anyone at Reception either.Upon checking we were told that even though we had booked for 4 they were only expecting 3 of us ! They had to make up a room for us (drag in another bed). We walked into a bare bones basic room. It was a hot 30 degree day and after hauling up the baggage we were hot but could not get the Air Con to work. They fiddled with it for 1/2 hour but could not work it so said someone would fix it tomorrow (it was only 2pm). There was no fridge, no safe, no air con, no elevator. The batroom was mouldly and dirty looking and the paint was peeling off the hughe cracks in the bedroom walls. Enough !!!

I booked the hotel mainly for its location and after having read the reviews by other travellers (on tripadvisor) I was quite worried, I have to say. However, the stay at this hotel turned out to be a very good one indeed. Our room was very nicely furnished, very roomy, it had a very good bathroom, a TV and airconditioning (which could be regulated by us). There are indeed 66 steps to get to it but once you go up the steps, it was indeed worth the while. The location is superb as it is close to some great restaurants and within easy walking distance (as little as two minutes) to Florence's best sites including Piazzale Michelangelo (some 20 - 25 minutes without stops). On our arrival we were greated by the reception who helped us with our suitcases and breakfast was what one expects from a 3-star hotel in Italy.

I was looking for a cheap hotel in the middle of Florence, and that is exactly what I got. It was about 100 euros for a double room for 3 nights, which was amazing value.

Perfect location - 10/15 mins walk from train station but just a couple of mins from the Duomo - we could see it from our room! Is on a pedestrianised street so a lot quieter than most places I've stayed in Florence. Walls are quite thin however so i can see it would be noisy if the people next door were.
