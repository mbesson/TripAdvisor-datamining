My husband and I travel a lot and we have never met a more sincere hospitality staff. The staff were not at all the tips-seeking variety that we usually meet. Every exchange with them felt sincere. The hotel goes all out to give rooms a personal touch. The decor was tastefully done and impressed us immediately. The moment I entered the room, I could almost feel the person who had done up the room. There were delicate details like the arrangement of towels on the beds. Breakfasts also had a homemade quality to them. I believe there exists a good relationship between the staff and the hotel owners (whom we did see quite often during our 4 night stay). We went there in spring when most hotels have switched off the central air-conditioning. However, it was warm on the first night. It is not so comfortable leaving the windows open as there are sudden loud noises from passing traffic (not much traffic on the small lane, but enough to be disruptive) in the middle of the night. The next day, we asked if the air-conditioning could be turned on, and the staff promised confidently that he'd make a request to management. For that one night, we had air-con! (The system was switched back to heating when the temperature took a drastic fall the next two days.) I truly appreciate this gesture to be flexible and accommodating -- something you will not find in the big hotels. As we were travelling with my 1.5 year old toddler, we spent a lot of time in the hotel (afternoons for her naptime, and early evenings back). My daughter absolutely loved her experience and didn't want to go home. The common area was small, but homely, and completely satisfactory to my toddler. The staff played with my daughter everyday and entertained her with the little hotel bird. During our stay, we had to make a trip to a very local area as we were buying a double buggy that wasn't displayed in most shops. Cengiz Demirli, the owner (with his father), was at the reception in the afternoons and he made phonecalls to make arrangements for us to view the buggy. He even got us a discount over the phone. When we were at the shop itself and had trouble with credit card payment and the shopowners could not understand English, Cengiz was so helpful when we called him to mediate the situation. He was also present to assist us during the delivery and setup of the buggy to the hotel the next afternoon. We have many other lovely experiences during our rather intensive 4-afternoon-and-night stay that only you can appreciate if you were there. (= Highly highly highly recommended. The hospitality and accommodation was THE holiday itself for us. It left us feeling so good about the people of Istanbul.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Brome", "Title": "\u201cNice location and warm reception\u201d", "Author": "Michel-Lyne", "ReviewID": "UR127999985", "Content": "We just spent a week at the Esans hotel.

Saw the positive reviews on this forum and decided to try Esans (plus the price for a single room was around 60$). I was however apprehensive since the property seemed quite small. I reached the hotel quite early at 5 AM and unfortunately all rooms were full. The night receptionist (Dauliat fromTurkmenistan) kept me company during the entire duration, offered tea and coffee and ensured tht as soon as the first check out happened, the cleaning staff had my room ready in no time. I got my room a lil after 8 AM with no additional charge for an early checkin. The rooms are done quite tastefull, albeit slightly on the opulent side, The terrace offers some magnificent views of the Bosphorus and Hagia Sophia. Pros : 1) Close to all major sites in Sultanahmet - TopKapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazar 2)Amazing Breakfast spread. Good Turkish Spread. In the summer I was told the breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace. 3)Nicely done rooms 4)The best part of the stay - the staff - i dont remember having seen such an enthusiastic and dedicated staff in any hotel around the world.The young staff ensure you feel at home and are always willing to help you with anything you would require. Cons: 1) The hotel does not have a lift/elevator. Hence access to all might be a problem. 2)The walls are quite thin. So you could end up hearing conversations and footfalls from rooms around you.

However, the selection on offer - though very good - was not as extensive as some reviewers have implied.

The drive to the hotel was about 30 minutes . we had an excellent price deal on the hotel and were graciously accorded an upgrade for one of the rooms ( we booked 3). On arrival we were offered hazelnuts and tea/coffee ( a distinct Esans welcome hallmark) and were very graciously introduced to the hotel staff by Engin and Abdullah. The hotel is walking distance to all the touristic sites of Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Sultanhamet square. The tram stop is also around 10-15 minutes walking and takes TL 2 for most tram stations. The area around is dotted with lovely European styled restaurants and a dinner at one of these is highly recommended ( they did offer us group discounts for dinner being off peak season). Breakfast is adequate to good though I would prefer to see more vegetarian options. They did however offer us a special vegetarian spinach borek ( veg spinach puff pastry) on one of our breakfasts. Rooms were adequate size( The superior room was bigger). They also have a terrace on the 4th floor which is great venue for drinks with dinner. Mustafa was a great help with the assistance and what stands out really is the personal touch that they bring into the dealing with clients and are happy to answer all your questions the best they can. regrettably with 5* hotels this is not something that you can experience . So if you are looking for a good , warm and friendly hotel with great prices and close to everything .. this is the place to go.. Highly recommended ******.

This was not the case. They only offered 1 complimentary pick up; whilst having to pay for the others. I made an argument that if we have made 3 separate bookings, would they have offered each of us complimentary pick-ups as stated on their website?

This was my only major gripe about this hotel. The rest are all good. The breakfast, our room [bar the wooden ceiling/floor], cleanliness, helpfullness of the staff and location of the hotel. Our room was on the first floor, the superior room is big and spacious. However you can hear footsteps of the guest on the upper floor as the floor is wooden and the carpet is not thick enough. We were very unlucky for 2 nights when the guest on the top floor was wearing some chunky heeled boots traipsing about the room early in the morning and late at night. Overall it was a good stay, but I do suggest to future guests to make sure you confirm the complimentary airport pick-up if you have more than 1 room booked for different arrivals and request for upper floors room if you are a light sleeper as moi.

From our room, we had a view of the Bosphorus over rooftops, which was a plus, though it's worth mentioning that everyone has access to the rooftop terrace. General description of the hotel: website gives a pretty accurate image. This was a wealthy Ottoman family home, beautifully restored, converted into an 8-room hotel with modern features added: automatic lights in the staircase, air conditioner (individual controls), in-room safe, mini-bar, small flat-screen TV, modern shower, etc. And everything works! Location: hard to imagine better. Literally only a couple of minutes walk to Topkapi, Saint Sophie, etc. Also easy walk to tram stop \"Sultanahmet\" with modern trams passing every few minutes to take you to other neighborhoods. Tram is really easy to use, but if you prefer taxis, there's a taxi stand just around the corner - front desk can call a taxi for pickup in less than 2 minutes. Hotel is located on a street with no through traffic - just access to a small parking lot, used only during the daytime when tourist sites are open - no cars at night. Plenty of restaurants just around the corner. Neighborhood is absolutely safe, even late at night. Room: spacious, bright, well-appointed. Bed is large (180cm) and comfortable. Everything is spotlessly clean - towels are changed daily. Breakfast: buffet style with both Turkish and \"western\" selections. Among other things, fresh- squeezed orange juice, fresh-brewed coffee. Noise: A light sleeper in our party said he heard some cars passing on the nearby Ishakpasa Avenue - but in such a dense area, it's hard to get completely away from all nocturnal activity. By comparison, many of the other hotels of the same category are much less well situated - directly on such avenues, some even on the avenue with the tram going by! At least Esans is tucked away on a small side-street. As for the call to prayer mentioned in some earlier posts, it can be heard everywhere in Istanbul (that's the point!), and frankly it's not so awful. Besides, it comes so early in the morning, it really isn't a problem to go back to sleep. Business/money matters: We made our reservation through the hotel website, so handled by \"Reseliva\" - all went without a hitch, and we promptly received a confirmation email from Esans directly. Free airport pickup was well organized, and much appreciated. On checkout, we chose to pay cash for a 5% discount (easy to do with ATM's widely available). Hotel staff/services: a handful of young men take turns at reception. They each have a different personality, but all are incredibly eager to please - ready to do whatever they can to make your stay more enjoyable - offering tips about public transportation, restaurant recommendations, answering any kind of question, trying to find a solution to any problem. (An example, among many: there's a computer in the reception lounge for guests, but it's not hooked up to a printer, so they let us use the hotel computer to print our boarding passes).

Upon arrival at the hotel, we met Engin (with his fancy haircut!) and were presented with a couple of glasses of Turkish sweet wine and some Turkish Delight while our check-in was processed. Our bags were taken up the stairs to our room (which was on the first floor -- street level), Dervish Odour room. All rooms in the hotel are named for scents (\"Esans\" must mean \"essence\" in Turkish, I think). The room was a good size and very attractively appointed. It was, in fact, in the same color palette as our wedding -- Tiffany blue and brown! The bed was a bit firm, but the pillows were cushy. Just after checking in, the staff brought us up a little plate of fruit as a \"welcome.\" I don't know if they do that for everyone or if it was special for our honeymoon. It was lovely. The bathroom and shower were very nice (with decent water pressure) and the A/C worked beautifully. The hotel is in the middle of everything and the staff truly goes out of their way to please.

In the morning, the breakfast buffet was fabulous -- plates of meats, cheeses, eggs, olives, tomatoes, plus yogurt and toast. A huge spread...far better than what we got at other more expensive hotels on our trip! We were awakened by the call to prayer at 5:00 a.m. As mentioned, it's quite loud (even with the A/C fan running), but it was really beautiful, too and we, honestly, didn't mind. We later stayed in a different hotel at the end of our trip which was twice the price and, while pretty glamourous, doesn't beat the Esans for value. I would recommend this hotel to EVERYONE!!!", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cLove the Esans!\u201d", "Author": "Leesh77", "ReviewID": "UR118935498", "Content": "Istanbul is a great city, and the Esans is the perfect place to stay to enjoy it. I booked the Esans hotel based on the comments on Trip Advisor, and my group couldn't have been happier. From the moment we arrived, and they met us outside at our cab to get our luggage -- we felt right at home at the Esans. Why it is so great: -- The staff is incredibly friendly and willing to help you out with anything you need. Snacks, tea, directions, reccomendations, car arrangements, anything! More than once we were asked, \"do you need anything else to make your stay enjoyable?\" For dinner, we asked for suggestions, and they walked us to the restaurant to make sure we found it! They were also really great about holding our bags after we checked out. We had a late flight, and they not only took care of our luggage while we explored Istanbul in the morning, but when we returned back to get our luggage - they offered us tea and snacks, called a cab for us, carried all of our luggage out...AND gave us a little gift when we left! Love the Esans! -- The rooms are adorable. For what you are paying, the value is excellent. Each room is decorated differently, with a boutique-feel. Spacious, clean... Bed was comfy. Air-Conditioning works well, and can be adjusted to your liking. Bathrooms are modern and roomy, and I know this is minor - but they have huge towels! ( I love huge towels). There is also a safe and a mini bar in each room. There is free wifi in the entire hotel, and a computer in the lobby that anyone can use. One note: they do not have 120 V outlets, you will need an adapter. Outlets are the typical two pronged round \"Europlug\". -- The location is ideal, and close to everything you would want to see in Sultanhamet. Steps from Topkapi Palace, and another 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque, and the Hagia Sophia. Also, there is a taxi stand right around the corner - so if you need a cab called, it literally takes about 2 minutes for it to arrive in front of the hotel. -- Great roof terrace that looks out over the sea. You can enjoy your breakfast up there...which they are more than happy to carry up for you! (There is no elevator.) Breakfast is a great selection of pastries, yogurt, eggs, cheeses - more than enough to fill you up! (...and if you are not adventurous - there are Cocoa Puffs.) There is nothing bad I can say about this place. It has a really \"great bed and breakfast\" feel, and if you want to experience Turkish hospitality at it's best - The Esans Hotel is where you want to go...I will definitely be back!

Yes, the management said, they would bring your breakfast tray up there if you wished, but it's not their normal breakfast location.) The staff is indeed very friendly and accomodating. Don't count on perfect English however -- with the result that you may not always get what you think you've requested even though they're trying like mad to provide what you want. The rooms are large. We did book the family room - to make sure we had a large room - although we later saw that many of the other rooms are equally comfortable (and air conditioned). The bathrooms are clean (but bring your own washcloth). And the Wi-Fi worked well. Its location is good but to get back from some locations in Istanbul can be quite difficult because although there's a taxi rank only as block and a half away for getting to the center of town, very few cab drivers can find the location coming back. Be sure and get written instructions from the front desk as you depart anywhere. Note that our friends, who stayed longer than we did, discovered after we left that there is a very simple one-stop train that works beautifully to get to, say, the Spice Market. But we weren't told about that by the front desk. There is no elevator so be warned you may have as much as a three flight walk-up, especially if you book the family room.

I could say I'm really highly satisfied with an even short 4 days stay and I'm definitely planning to come with my friends, enjoy Istanbul on a much longer opportunity.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201chighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "jasxie90", "ReviewID": "UR91230663", "Content": "I didnt know much about Istanbul but the staff there helped plan all the places that are worth seeing and I had a lot of fun! the rooms are cozy and very clean!

That's why my friend and I decided to book a room there. Alas, we were very disappointed. While located conveniently in the center of old Istanbul, the quality of the hotel itself leaves much more to be desired. There was nothing majorly disturbing about it but there were so many little things that just made our stay quite an exhausting one. The staff don't speak good enough English to hold any sort of intelligent discussion. For example, when booking we exchanged emails and received a confirmation that we would get a room on the 3rd floor. When we arrived, we got a 2nd-floor room and all we got in response to showing a print-out of the email correspondence was \"sorry, it's booked\". Another issue with this hotel is that it has wooden floors that don't muffle any sound. In fact, they make every step sound like thunderstorm. So, if you have inconsiderate neighbors upstairs, this turns into a huge problem, which was our case. I have no idea what they were doing but it was unbearable. I went to talk to them and they started screaming at me. We mentioned the problem of noisy neighbors to the person at the reception but the hotel was unwilling to do anything about it. They pretended not to understand the issue and just shrugged it off. Again, this brings me to the matter of poor English language skills. Perhaps it's just a strategy to deal with conflict, I don't know. The outcome was that our problem wasn't solved. The rooms themselves were nice. The bed was comfy; the linens clean and fresh. However, when we moved in, there was a lot of hair in the sink drain. After the first night the cleaning lady took two towels and never replaced them so we had to call the reception and ask them to bring them. We also discovered that the cleaning lady threw out all our special airport plastic bags for liquids that were stacked nicely next to our colognes. At the same time, the trash cans weren't emptied. The breakfast was very poor. I travel very often and usually know what to expect for the money I am paying. There was some cheese, some bread, some cold cuts, a few bowls of canned olives and omelette. There was no coffee, only an instant coffee-like drink. The breakfast table just looked depressing. We didn't care to have breakfast at the hotel the next two mornings, especially since you can have a nice morning meal for, like, 5 euros in any of the surrounding cafes. Finally, on the day we were checking out we saw the tiny lobby of the hotel packed with locals waiting for something. Turned out the hotel was a gathering point for owner's friends or relatives to go to an engagement ceremony. Now, is that a way to run a hotel?! If it were a B&B or a hostel - go ahead. But it's a HOTEL, for crying out loud! Overall, the hotel has potential. If you're lucky you will have a nice time. However, in case you don't get lucky, you'll regret it. I am just not sure it's worth the risk.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubrovnik, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "albdanua", "ReviewID": "UR87708738", "Content": "Esans hotel is a very nice and beautiful hotel. rooms are very oriental decorated, staff is very kind and helpful.
