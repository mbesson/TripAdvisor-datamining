However, they do not have a kettle. Breakfast was quite limited and can be quite sick of the food after the third day. However, they provided ham on the last two days of my 5 nights stay in rome which was a bonus as the breakfast has no meat, only pastries, jam, nutella, tea and coffee. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful although not all are good in English, however, they do make an effort in trying to understand what I was trying to ask them. The free wifi was down for one day but the hotel staff are nice to let me use their office laptop for a while. The following day, the wifi connection was fixed. The hotel has a small lift and can only fit 3 people at one time. Overall, this hotel is ok to stay in as it is located near the termini station and is very accessible to various restaurants at night.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nootdorp", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Thee62", "ReviewID": "UR48220458", "Content": "We stayed in hotel Cherubini for four nights. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The hotel is about 2 min. away from Termini station where all the public transportation is available. The room and bathroom are small and clean. Free wireless internet. The hotel is situated on the second floor of the building. A lift/elevator is available. Breakfast is simple. The neighbourhood is crowdy but what do you expect if you are near a station. It didn't feel unsafe at all. Perfect for a short stay and near all highligts.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goiania, GO", "Title": "\u201cOK budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "LiliBrasil", "ReviewID": "UR48088963", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel in October/2009 and thought that it was just fine. The recepcionist was very pleasant and gave us some tips about the city. The price was lower than some similar hotels that we saw on the internet. Cleanliness was enough, but not \"shiny\". Breakfast was included and it was OK. The neighbourhood is very noisy, so it can be a problem.

What we got was just what we expected from the reviews - a budget hotel (95 euro for a Friday night) that gave a comfortable clean night's sleep. Some of the fittings may not be the best, but the helpful staff were excellent; umbrella for Rome showers and free internet were a bonus. We soon got used to the vibration from the passing trams - which also made breakfast interesting from the balcony. The hotel is not easy to find from the street - look for one of several bells at a doorway. Once inside, the hotel is on the second floor. As luck would have it, the lift was not working - the big suitcase was a hard lug.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Mika7275", "ReviewID": "UR10077203", "Content": "Just visited in Cherubini. Good location only one minute walk from Termini and about 15 min to Colosseum and 20 min to Piazza di Spagna. From Termini station you can take a nonstop bus number 40 or 64 to Vatican. Many good restaurants near the hotel with reasonable prices. One of them is located under the hotel next door to the left. Tourist menu only 10 euro including first course, main course, dessert and wine or beer. Rooms are very clean and they are just renovated. Service and the staff are very helpful and nice. A small breakfast is served to the room that time you want.
