{"Reviews": [{"Content": "It's like a Third World Dive I have stayed in dives in third world countries but this dump defies all standards. When I arrived, a bolshy receptionist would not accept my voucher, which was a print out to confirm payment. She demanded proof of payment and when I said that I didn't usually walk around Amsterdam with my credit card statement, became even more obstructive. We argued and said that I wanted to see the manager and complain - and only then would she check me in.The room was a garret in the eves, it smelt, and the bathroom stank, with a deep sewage, drainy smell, with a dirty shower which obviously had not been cleaned since the last guest had checked out. I asked them politiely to clean it but to no avail. One evening I returned to my room only to find it bare - they had removed all my belongings to another room without telling me - so I still had my laptop in the safe and had to go and redeem it. This happened on 2 occasions. I heard mice scurrying in my room, but was too depressed to do anything about it, the fire alarm which was just out side my room went off in the middle of the night...I had several sleepless nights in this dive and it might be cheap, but it's a false economy.

After reading some of the reviews on this website I was not looking forward to stopping in this hotel. When we arrived and checked into our room we were very suprised. The room wasn't huge but was clean and basic and looked like the room on the pictures on the hotel website. Yes it isn't one of the best hotels but for the price you pay and the location it is in you cannot expect to be in a five star hotel. The only problem we had was that the bathroom was on the hallway so not very personal but after reading the reviews about mice, I couldn't complain about that. Yes the stairs are steep but that is typical of Amsterdam,  I cannot comment about the safe or possessions going missing as I must admit I never use hotel safes and always carry anything valuable with me.  I don't know what the breakfast was like as we didn't wake up early enough to go and try it :-) I would stop here again as it is in a fantastic location and perfect if you spend most of your time out and about and don't want to pay a lot of money just for somewhere to sleep and shower!With this being one of the rare good reviews about this hotel, maybe we were lucky and had one of the nicest rooms?", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR904468036", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Vic-UK-88"}, {"Content": "dont go here Well dont no were to start ,had no heating was very cold.

Our rooms were on the 5th floor of the building.The rooms seemed adequate at first....in line with what you would expect from a 2 star hotel. There were no towels in our rooms though and there were workmen in our rooms on arrival which the reception staff failed to mention. MICE:One of our party went for a nap in one of the rooms and noticed the sound of mice scratching in the room! We advised the reception staff member who admitted that they have a mouse problem but that they had bought poison in from Belgium which would kill them within 10 minutes of consuming it! Comforting!! We were not offered another room as the hotel was full and there was no satisfaction given. Eventually we went back to the reception to complain that we wanted to leave and we wanted a refund....the person on the desk just handed us a complaint form to fill in and said the manager would be there in the morning! We later found out that he was the manager!!! That night 3 of us slept in 2 single beds pushed together in the room without the mice! The next morning we went back to the reception to sort it out. After some lengthy negotiations the general manager came to the hotel and refunded us. We still had to pay for the 1 room that we stayed in though which I think should have been refunded also given the circumstances. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

We were in a quad room with a radiator that was on constantly at 5 even when you turned it to zero!!! You woke up feeling like you were in spain with no air con! We complained about this to the staff but nothing was done! We had to have our window fully open all the time! This was pretty unsafe as there was a bar missing from the outside so if you stumbled you would be lying on the pavement below!Secondly we had money stolen from the room which we reported  the staff did not seem to concerened  said they would pass it on to the mananger! This made us angry but not much we could do about it! I was asked to fill out a complaint form which I did but it also asked for my bank details!! Why on earth would they need that I thought?!Thirdly the cleaner rummages through your case  belongings which I now realise he was probably looking for more money!Since returning home I read the other bad reviews regarding money being stolen etc  that all the hotel staff are in on the SCAM...to be honest I quite believe!!! These reviews were left just the day before we left..If only I had check this site again then and seen those we would prob gone elsewhere or been more carefull  taken our money with us! THEY EVEN STEAL IT FROM YOUR SAFE IN YOU ROOM!!

Let me start by saying that I rely on TripAdvisor anytime I travel. I read the reviews and look at pictures posted by travelers (because let's face it...NO property ever looks like the pictures posted by the property!). I usually find that the reviews are split about 50/50 between good and terrible ratings and try to average it out for myself. And then after I stay there...I wonder what some people expect and decide that they are just negative and hard to please people. Still, I have never written a review to TA before to give either a favorable or unfavorable review. This time, I feel obligated to write to save anyone from even considering staying at this place! I feel that listing this property as a hotel is misleading. While some might call those extremely narrow and steep stairs quaint, it should also be considered how one would escape in the event of a fire or other emergency! Speaking of which, the steam from the shower set off the smoke alarm and around 30 minutes later an employee came to see if we were ok. In 30 minutes time, the entire building would have been burnt to the ground! Besides the rodent infestation (seriously...not A mouse...an infestation!), the general cleanliness of our room was even below standard. On our arrival, our non-smoking room smelled of pot smoke...but we thought hey, it's AMS, it's all cool. Then I found a huge tangle of someone else's hair in my bedding! And then there is the shower situation. It is not a stall even...the water just runs out on the floor with no barrier at all. After no sleep at all, I was relieved when my friends said we could leave...at 4 a.m.! We were still charged for all three nights of our original reservation. The fact that management of this property has yet to respond to our request for a refund is the true testament to their concern for the unsuspecting traveler.

We reminded ourselves that we were there for the city and not the hotel.Approximately 30 minutes after turning out the lights to go to sleep that first night we heard the rustling of plastic bags and turned on the lights to find several mice crawling around in our purchases of the day. After hiding the bags in our suitcases and calming ourselves, we turned out the lights again and tried to sleep. Almost immediately we heard the mice running around the room again and when my friend reached to turn on the light she startled a mouse that was walking along the headboard of my bed. . . . .the mouse fell on my head.We then left the lights on, but after only 30 minutes the mice returned and began running around the room even with the room fully illuminated.

Unsuitable for those who cannot climb stairs.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR428582601", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mammamarg"}, {"Content": "hotel difficile d'acc\u732bs pour les personnes ag\u8305es   showReview(19646488, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR207460798", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Schon eine Nacht war zuviel   showReview(19646489, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR819013915", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "einfach nur unzufrieden   showReview(18535408, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325361764", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "tres d\u8305\u83bdu   showReview(18535407, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR790631703", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne Wieder   showReview(16591357, 'full');", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR119315770", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "chercher d'avantage   showReview(16591356, 'full');", "Date": "May 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR548171996", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Chambre mal plac\u8305e   showReview(16591355, 'full');", "Date": "May 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR896133508", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Do not book a hotel in Damrak Street, particulary not Damrak Inn   showReview(15568927, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR506590672", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "tr\u732bs content   showReview(15568925, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR604834606", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Nous y retournons surement   showReview(14736835, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR990484297", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Il est urgent de l'\u8305viter !
