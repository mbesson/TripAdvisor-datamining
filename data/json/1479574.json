Ordered a Double Deluxe and was give a pokey tiny room in the centre of the hotel on the third floor overlooking the central core of the hotel. Rooms were so dark (with brilliant sunshine outside) that you had to switch the lights on to see what you were doing. Decor of rooms matched the room. Dated, dark and depressing. Reception and lifts are a total farce. Reception tiny. Lifts only accommodate two at a time and are incredibly slow. We walked to our room most of the time. Staff efficient to be optimistic, but certainly not friendly. Asked for an iron and ironing board (twice) on day one together with more clothes hangers (of which we had three). Iron arrived, together with three more hangers, but the hotel did not have an ironing board??????? We were told to use the table which had a glass top. Wonderful multi-jet shower in the bathroom which could not be used because the door leaked badly. After having a basic shower the bathroom floor was flooded. No tea or coffee making facilities in room, no information about Madrid, no instructions on how to use the phone, no free internet. We visited the acclaimed rooftop bar on the first night for a nightcap of two beers. We were not give a choice and were delivered two bottles of unidentifiable wheat beer which was not pleasant. The bill for the two beers was 29\u20ac which we feel outrageous for two drinks we did not want.

It really is not a Hotel at all in my eyes rather someones residence that has been turned into rooms to stay in. Firstly there is no lobby and the front desk isnt even as big as the desk in the rooms. The really most annoying thing was in fact the trouble with the Wifi I had but seriously after a 20 hour journey through, trains, planes, taxis and buses the last thing any traveller want to do is take all their luggage up one last flight of steep stairs which is what greets you as you walk in. If I was running this hotel I would surely employ a Doorman whos only job is to take peoples bags up those darn stairs. My partner is very petitie and there is no way she is getting a 20 kilo case up one stair never mind ten or so. So I was left to take all the luggage up. And then was greeted by three staff! One in the back room! My check in was 11pm so I am sure the staff at that time prefer not to see anyone at all and thats the feeling I got. So checking in I was greeted with very incomplacent attitudes mostly at the fact I didnt speak Spanish I suppose. With rather no explanation or even a map of the area we were handed the keys. If we were a family of 6 or so there would have been no room in lobby almost. The elevators are made for residences not really getting bags up and down to rooms as they are extremely small, tight and slow. Again for just living there it would be fine youd never have luggage. I booked the suite room which is in fact just a double with another room in it that has a separate door and key that opens that also so we got two keys. Leaving the key in that other room and accidently closing the door will lock you out and this happened to us so had to go down and get another key. In the room there is no Service Menu of the Hotels services at all. I managed to work out this is because this Hotel doesnt offer any services whatsoever. There is no Number on the telephones next tot he bed to call to front. This is quite annoying but I just went down each time I was asking about something and well in fact it was because 1. The Wifi Completely did not work in the room at all 2. There is no Iron in the Suite room even. I was given an Iron promptly but with no Iron board so I used a towel and the sofa. The shower in the suite room goes cold every 30 seconds for about 2 or 3 seconds. The suite room TV did not work at all but we could hear the TV in the next room which was actually just another one of those connecting doors that was just not opened which gave the feeling of the people there being right next to you and in fact each room can hear absolutely everything in the other room right down to talking on the phone. If you do business dont get these rooms! I have no idea why but it seems so many hotels cant organise their shower water to stay in the shower and Ada Hotel is a shining example so far as that the shower door has a really nice big gap so that the water can get everywhere. Not to say this is bad but there are sideways jets in this shower as well! that point straight out rather than down but you can only select two of these at a time and without the shower as well so its pointless to have them although it looks styleish using these would seriously just shoot water staright into the bathroom entirely. After actually taking my computer to the much nicer day time staff and showing her it wont connect I was told to go back to the room and call the Free Toll number to fix the problem with Ibahn internet themsleves. Since there is no service menu I had to g back and find out how to call an outside iline which of course is usually 0 but the free number also had zeros so after another trip I was dialling 000 number number and got through to a lady in India! who asked my hotel and country and after about 10 minutes of telling her my IP full name and room number and so on her and I worked it out. This hotel should offer FREE Wifi throughout and forget having to put in your room number and Name! While I was asking about it another guest mentioned he coudlnt connect but I dont think he went as far as I did and gave up. The hotel is quite close to the main sights and streets if you are prepared to walk around 15 minutes or so and we walked to the Plaza Del Sol, Plaza Major, Royal Palace and so on so for Madrid and a day or two the location is on fact fine. I liked the fact the suite room had an outside if what very thin Balcony that you can walk out on around the both rooms and spend a few moments gazing at city life every so often. This also looks right up the Gran Via street if you look sideways from there. The closest Train Station was Gran Via. Their is an advert in the room for a Free iPad with 3G with Apps on Madrid installed that you can use free for the first 24 hours then its 12 Euro a day. But if you stay one day you can get the whole day free and just return it without paying. I found this pretty rare and too good to be true so looked into it but in fact it is true as they expect most people to get it for more than a day after using it. I would have used it for Google Maps only but stayed more than two days so gave it a miss and used a good Madrid road map. There were quite a few bars and restaurants close by the hotel in the back streets to the left as you come out the hotel. Have a great stay and I hope this helped your decision.

As others have mentionned there are two main motivations to stay here. Locations and quality / price ratio. Location is perfect for several reasons. there are Metro stops a few meters away from the Hotel = \"Banco Espana\" or \"Gran via\". Here you are in walking distance of many museums like the Prado and Thyssen, of sights of interest like Puerta de Alcala, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Retiro Park just to give a few examples. Metro takes you there as well. The Hotel is clean and rooms are comfortable. Ameneties in bathroom, Rooms that I have had here have Glass Showers not bath. The shower has a massage ramp. Rooms have flat screen TV but internet is at a cost some 7 \u20ac an hour, or 17\u20ac for a full day. There is a Starbuck up the street as an option for Internet and breakfast. I have always gotten a good deal at this hotel at around 100 \u20ac a night, sometimes a little less and some times a little more. There is a bar and a restaurant on the 6th floor. No gym. Now for the Negative. If anything goes wrong this place is unprepared and understaffed. The staff on site is abandonned by Management who in NEVER on site. Thare is often just one person at the minuscule front desk. There is no support from a responsible person. On my last trip we had no hot water three days in a row. On the second day the water was brown. The young lady alone at the reception was going out of her mind answering questions and complaints from the entire hotel. The only thing she could tell us was that the problem was beeing worked on and that it would be solved. It took 3 days. e decided to find a solution on our own that second evening so we could shower to go out to dinner. We booked a place across Gran Via at Catalonia Hotel. At the same time one of the two elevators was broken to access the over 200 rooms. Both are very small. So this was a big problem, even more because there was a private party that evening at the Restaurant level. The back up in the small lobby was massive. Shame on management. Shame on supposedly responsible individuals who abandon their Four Star Hotel clients and their employees in the middle of the storm. These individuals have no place in this profession. This is a service profession and their responsibility was to offer solutions when we were in the middle of the storm. Under those conditions I would say the lonely staff was heroic.

As per a previous review should you require a drink for your room go to the Corte de Ingles in the supermarket and they sell wine, beer and spirits. The room bar service is expensive being rum drinkers they wanted 12 euros for a small bottle you would get on the plane! The breakfast was good with a selection of cold meats, cereals, juice and a small hot buffet, the breakfast setting is lovely and the view over the city breathtaking. This hotel is in good walking distance to the main and surrounding areas. Overall I would definately go back, the Santiago Bernabeu for the game was amazing the atmosphere electric and the metro trains run every 5 minutes so no problems there. The tapas bars are friendly and when you order drinks, normally they give you small plates of food to accompany the drinks so overall not an expensive night. My husband had a Baileys due to be a little hung over and the measure he got for 5 euros was like 4 nips it filled half a brandy glass ;-) the tapas excellent to we went to El Labriego a few times, small friendly and very spanish, at the top of the Gran Via at the square is the Corte de Ingles diagonally across walk up the street, at the end of the street and turn left.

First impressions made our hearts plummet we entered the hotel by a tiny small door up a flight of steps to a very small reception area. Booking in was very efficient. Up to our room on the third floor, wow, a small corridor with a desk and table lamp, then into the main room with a very large wardrobe, containing a safe, then the bedroom two queen sized beds with plenty of room to move around in, in addition we had a chair a two seater settee with small side tables and table lamps then their was a coffee table a mini bar and a flat screened TV, the soft furnishings all matched and the curtains certainly kept out the sun first thing in the morning. The bed linen was clean and fresh the bed was comfortable but firm. The bathroom was a good size with a hairdryer and a good selection of toiletries. The only thing we would have liked, even though not essential,was a tea and coffee making machine.. the breakfast room/restaurant/bar was on the 6th floor which was fabulous the decor, seating views etc where wonderful. The 7th floor terrace was even better. Breakfast is/was a buffet. A large selection of coffees, teas, juices where available. You could even have churros and chocolate if you wished. Hot dishes where bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs which where absolutely amazing. the toaster worked extremely well toast was done perfectly. A good section of cold meats, cheeses and bread. plus cereals yoghurts and pastries. Staff were pleasant and always neatly turned out. Whilst talking to a member of staff we found out that the building was originally a gentlemans club and they sold part of the building to a hotel chain, however the club continues to use part of the building and it has retained the grand formal entry to the building, do walk up the Gran Via in the evening and have a look, it is beautiful, marble and chandelires. Which explains why the hotel entrance is not very grand. Location was , for us, perfect we could and did walk to all of the sights, The Tyssen and Prado [Retiro & Royal Gardens] where a 10 minute stroll/walk away. The Real Palace, Temple of Dehob where about 20-30 mins away. The view from the Palace of Cibele was a few minutes away. Plaza Mayor and Puerto de Sol weren't far away either. Do go on the Madrid bus trip it gives a good overview of the city. The Reina Sofia museum was our least favourite , however if you like modern art go, Try the cafe Riojana [or similar] on the Cala Mayor and try the cafe Mallonquin on the Puerto del Sol.

We checked into the hotel late and went out touring the following day. When we returned to the room in the late afternoon, both balcony doors were swinging open and one had been pulled off its hinges. (Strangely, the room had not been cleaned although it was late afternoon. In hindsight, it seems strange that the maid was not the one to discover the room had been broken into. Having read some other reviews, I wonder if this hotel has a serious theft problem.) Luckily, nothing was taken. We immediately reported the incident to the front desk staff, who seemed unsurprised. They sent a repair man, who fit the broken door back into place and lectured us not to open it, then left. Feeling vulnerable, we packed our things and asked to be moved to a room without a shared balcony. The woman at the front desk thought this was a highly unreasonable request. She informed us that incidents like these are why they provide combination safes in the rooms. After a few minutes of arguing, a manager came by and told her to give us a new room. She did so, but made a big production of it and certainly never apologized to us for the incident. The following day, not wanting anyone at all in our room, we put out the do-not-disturb sign while we were out. When we returned, a maid had cleaned our room. Nothing was missing, but we were nevertheless disturbed. Upon checking out, the same woman at the front desk tried to charge us for items taken from the minibar in our first room. (We didn't even know there WAS a minibar.) When we argued, she did agree to remove the charges (though we are keeping an eye on our credit card and don't know yet if she was true to her word).

Building work next to hotel, woke us at 7-8 a.m each morning, be aware of this if you plan to book as it looks like it will go on for some time to come.Ask for a room to front of hotel.

We expected a kind of hole in the wall for the price and location in such a city, but once we entered the tiny lobby, we were heartened. The busy and efficient front desk clerk spoke good English with a smile and was dealing with several travelers whose plans had suddently changed because of canceled flights because of the volcanic ash issues, however, she took her time with each customer which we knew she would then do with us when it was our turn. The \"lobby\" was tiny, the elevators even tinier, but the room was completely lovely with 2 larger than twin beds, a large window opening on to the Gran Avenido 4 floors up, and to beautiful sights, (noises), and architecture; the batroom was big (although the shower doors leaked water on to the floor), and there was a little couch. Maybe because we had come from much starker rooms in Morocco did we think this place was perfect, but it was, and I will definitely stay here again. The clerk was helpful every time we had a question, even though she was swamped with needy customers the two days we were there. The breakfast buffet was lovely -- cakes, fruit, cheeses, meats, sparkling wine, breads, coffee, juices, and eggs -- in a separate alcove from the well laid tables in the dining room. The location couldn't have been better --right on the bus line, near the metro, on wide avenues with wide sidewalks and taxis, near the hop on/ hop off tour bus, and shopping and people watching. The Latino area was just blocks away as were the museums and promenade. And we found in the next block a perfect tapas place for a perfect evening's entertainment.
