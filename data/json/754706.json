The ferry stop is no more than 30 meters from the hotel exit, there is a nice park next to the hotel, the fish-n-chip place behind the hotel is very good and reasonably priced, and the staff is friendly. Bondi Beach is 5 minutes drive and there is a beautiful trail right out the door of the hotel that goes along the cliffs above the water that's great for jogging and for site seeing. The parking can be a bit of a problem when the weather is nice because of everyone parking for the ferry, and the fruit bats in the trees at night took a bit of time for a midwestern boy to get used to - but I guess they don't bother anyone. There's a good Asian restaurant close by, but the Doyle's place next door is a bit over priced. Nice hotel - I'd go there again.", "Date": "May 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR400723343", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TravelMavin"}, {"Content": "Just Perfect Just recently I stayed at this hotel. I was a bit apprehensive at first, but I was pleasantly surprised.I booked a harbour front room and was assigned room 111, which is the best room. So spacious, asthetically pleasing and definitely at a 5 star level.I originally was assigned room 110, but was upgraded for free to 111. Room 111 is the most spectacular room. Huge balcony, bathroom, comfortable king size bed and a room fit for a king. I seriously recommend you book room 111.The hotel is just fabulous! Great pleasant service, quiet. The hotel even surpasses the quality of other hotels I have stayed at such as The Amora Jamison, The Sheraton. The view is breathtaking!In my opinion this hotel should be rated 5 star and not 4. The 4 star rating is selling themselves short.My only disappointment was the buffet breakfast. I was told by the last min website that it was hot buffet breakfast, however it was 98% continental. But in saying this, the buffet breakfast was just delicious.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551653006", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "miaow_girl"}, {"Content": "Stay here once in your life I randomly turned up here whilst driving round Sydney. I believe this was once called Doyles Palace Hotel. The rooms are spacious and have exceptionally well appointed bathrooms. The Hotel has a huge dining and drinking terrace with stunning views towards the Sydney Skyline. ( I think this is quite famous). Next door is the original Doyles seafood restaurant. Don't expect huge amounts of service here. Its a bit like a huge pub/restaurant with rooms. Staff couldn't figure out the wireless internet and the rooms lack anything other than floor level electric sockets. But really these are tiny complaints, this is a thoroughly lovely place to stay for a short while. Once in your life, have fish and chips with a crisp white wine overlooking the skyline and bay. Incredible.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR702588513", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AndrewCrown"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d754706-r22329263-Watsons_Bay_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "754706", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
