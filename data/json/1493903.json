Inside it is well styled, modern, clean and in good condition. Our room had a balcony with decent views and everything worked well. The room was quite narrow though and thus didn't feel overly spacious. The bathroom was also nicely done and everything worked well, but the soap and shampoo is well hidden! Wifi is a pain as you need to go to reception to get a code - they can't provide it over the phone. It costs Eur2 per hour. Breakfast was decent enough, but is spoiled by the setup, with a lady with a messy trolley noisily going around the room collecting finished plates and simultaneously checking your room number. I guess it keeps costs down though - this is a reasonably priced hotel. I would stay here again.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kfar Tavor, Israel", "Title": "\u201ca place where to stay\u201d", "Author": "leosip65", "ReviewID": "UR121969850", "Content": "A renewed hotel in the Gotic city of Barcelona with very nice rooms friendly atmosphere and well located to explore that part of the city.

The rooms were clean and spacious enough with a very nice bathroom. Eventhough it's located next to a rather busy street the rooms were soundproofed so we weren't disturbed. Excellent location, within a walking distance from the port which had great restaurants. The hotel found us taxis whenever we needed one. The staff were very helpful. Only problem was the breakfast which was served in an underground room and wasn't very rich.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel has some good and bad and really bad points. Overall, not a four star by any means.\u201d", "Author": "ConscientiousTourist", "ReviewID": "UR73611852", "Content": "What is good: The hotel has spent money on fixtures and making the public areas look nice. Cool bathroom fixtures, rainshower etc... and bedroom furnished nicely. Location is very central to the beach, the underground trains and the Gotic Quarter \u2013 really enjoyed that. The housekeeping staff seemed friendly whenever we asked for towels or other small items. What they could do better: Service is poor. Hotel is disorganized, less than friendly staff at the front desk. Most inquiries are met with \u201cno, not possible\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. When passing by the front desk on a number of occasions, we overhead the desk agents in some type of altercation with guests on the phone. Air conditioning in the rooms cannot be controlled by the customer \u2013 it was preset and we found it quite cold at times so opened the windows to make it more comfortable. Pillows quite hard and are made out of those tiny pieces of styrofoam like a bean bag. What is unacceptable and why we would not recommend this hotel: Misleading advertising. Hotel website says \u201cfree internet\u201d, \u201cking beds\u201d and there are websites selling the property they say, \u201ccomplimentary breakfast\u201d. Upon arrival, we were told internet is 12 Euros per 24 hours, that there are no king beds. The most unsettling part and a pretty negative last impression for us was upon check out when we discovered the so-called complimentary breakfast was not free. As the front desk agent explained \u201ccomplimentary\u201d in Spanish translates to, \u201ccomplimentarios\u201d which means \u201cnot included, extra\u201d. Despite our attempts to explain that the English website where we booked led us to believe it was included, we were forced to pay \u2013 when we said we would not pay as it was false advertising, the agent immediately said he would call the police. Perhaps this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. We asked him to have the hotel at least fix the wording on the internet to remove any ambiguity so as not to have this problem in the future. The agent said WE should contact the website company (which makes no sense for the consumer to manage a company\u2019s site and its partner\u2019s sites). 129 Euros later, we left the hotel feeling somewhat taken advantage of. Please check in advance as to whether your breakfast is actually included. Ironically, this breakfast was the least impressive of all the hotel breakfasts we experienced on this trip and the only one we had to pay for since the others were all included. Certainly not worth 10 Euro per person. There are many places to eat within one or two blocks had we known. Other minor issues with the hotel: We needed use of an iron. It took two days to get one since the hotel has one iron for the entire room inventory and apparently it was locked up in another guest\u2019s room and the hotel could not get it back (?). I mention this as a good example of how the hotel doesn\u2019t really make an effort to help guests. Room safes are available but one must pay 2 Euros per day to make sure their valuables are safe. For a four star hotel this seems tacky and somewhat unethical. This was the only hotel in our European trip where we had to pay for a safe. Again, not a four star move in my opinion.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Gargallo Hotel Colonial", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1493903-Reviews-Gargallo_Hotel_Colonial-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Laietana, 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1493903", "ImgURL": ""}}
