The proximity to the hospital is fantastic, with only a 10 minute trip to & fro. We knew before we booked that this block of apartments fronted the Eastern Distrubutor, one of the busiest motorways in Sydney, but with double-glazed windows in the bedroom, the noise from the road wasn't an issue. Our apartment (1008) which was split level and had the added benefit of a powder room adjacent to the living area, had a great view over Moore Park Golf Course and across to Bondi Junction. However, this particular apartment was adjacent to some sort of mechanical equipment (possibly a large air conditioning unit) which meant there was a constant motor-type noise present. It certainly would have been more pleasant had this noise not been there but having said that, at least it wasn't a noise that cut in and out ..... that would have been really difficult to tolerate. Located downstairs was the bedroom which had a king-sized bed. The enormous bathroom with its bath and separate shower, also had a full sized washing machine, dryer & laundry tub. The apartment also had a small study located at the foot of the stairs and this was a great place to store our luggage but the noise from the aforementioned machinery made it unpleasant to use for its intended purpose. We found that we often needed to use the air-conditioning units in the bedroom & the living room as for most of the time the noise from the traffic was just too great with the windows & sliding doors open. However, this wasn't an issue for us because by using the air-conditioning we were able to deep Sydney's extreme summer humidity at bay! The kitchen had all the appliances necessary to self-cater but only just enough china to get us through the day. It was great to have the full-sized gas cooktop to cook on and I also appreciated having the dishwasher. We took advantage of the long-term $10 per night parking and felt very comfortable leaving our car in the enormous carpark as it was regularly patrolled by security staff. We were able to park right at the lift which made moving in & out as easy as possible. Our situation during this visit didn't allow us the freedom to wander around this Danks St area but there were many, many cafes close by and also a Coles supermarket which was very handy. There was also a chemist and a medical centre. Not far away was the Surry Hills Shopping Village in which there was another Coles supermarket, as well as a post office and numerous other small shops & cafes. A regular bus service runs from a stop just near Coles, with the 301, 302, & 303 all going to the city. There were only a couple of minor issues that stopped me clicking on the 5th dot in this review. We felt that the TV reception was very poor, despite the efforts of the staff to rectify this situation. We assume this was because all the channels came through Foxtel. There were only 5 free to air Sydney channels, but none of the digital Freeview channels were available. A lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom would have been of great benefit to we \"over 60 year olds\" with failing eyesight! As my husband was so ill, we were unable to take advantage of the daily 'light' housekeeping so we can't comment on this service. While we didn't have much need for contact with the reception staff, when we did they were extremely helpful & pleasant, especially Koo who always had a smile on his face and for whom nothing was too much trouble! We have no hesitation in recommending the Meriton Danks St as a great place to stay and we'll certainly stay there again should the need arise.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petaling Jaya, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cVery much at home in this serviced apartment\u201d", "Author": "Highadventurer", "ReviewID": "UR123997448", "Content": "Have to book well in advance to get good rates and the serviced apartment has the amenties as home eg laundry, full kitchen and fridge.

Reception was warm and welcoming, and a couple of small problems (with air conditioning and bathroom) were fixed without fuss while we were out in the morning. Perhaps greater attention could be paid to the \"How to\" section of the guest compendium. Although we were travelling light, we still had a big impact on the bedroom, which seemed somewhat small for a king-sized bed and our luggage. Closet/wardrobe space was excellent, however. We were afraid of noise levels, based on others' comments and the fact that we were close to a swimming pool which seemed to attract drunken youngsters; however, they were gone before 11pm and there was nothing to interrupt our sleep. The fit out seemed adequate if unremarkable, as long as there aren't more than four of you wanting a glass of wine/cup of coffee etc at once. Location is excellent when you know where you are! In fact, you are in a block which is a very small part of an area occupied by similar blocks with permanent residents, so that there is a good supermarket (Coles) about 100 metres along the road, and a variety of shops including a newsagent which sells bus tickets - the Sydney bus system is remarkably simple and inexpensive. Outside the newsagent - more or less - is the bus stop where buses on four lines will take you into the city.

So for all future trips have opted for a studio apartment which was much better. The apartments themselves were clean, well appointed and quiet as long as you kept the balcony door shut. Otherwise the noise from the Eastern carries straight through. On the negative side, this set of apartments includes alot of permanent residents.

There are a handful of dining options, but you would be better off jumping in a cab & heading up the road to the city. The downsides to the property were the proximity to South Dowling St. Many apartments directly overlook it. Which, if you are a heavy sleeper (as I am) will not be a problem.

The other thing I didn't like was that the Gym and Pool are in a separate shared facility, about a five minute walk away. The pool was quite nice.

Having a serviced apartment with its own kitchen and laundry facilities was a real necessity for us, as eating out with small kids is often not a pleasurable experience. The front desk service is average, nothing to write home about, but the rooms are good. I asked for a 2BR apartment on one level due to the kids, and the apartment was too small for my liking. However my partner had previous stayed in a 2BR split level apartment and he said it was HUGE. I had a peek in one when it was being cleaned, and we will definitely go with that next time. You basically have one master br with ensuite on the top level, then go down the stairs to a large kitchen/dining/living area and 2nd BR and bathroom. The location of the apartment is okay. Buses frequently go up Bourke St into the city where you can easily get connections to all of Sydney's sights. Sydney is huge so you are usually going to need to get public transport to the beach, zoo, city, wherever. I disagree with the reviewer who said you will need a car - you won't if you are travelling to the usual sightseeing places as these are well serviced by public transport. The apartments are clean, are serviced daily and are generally well equipped. There is a Coles supermarket about 100m away and a few take away options e.g. sushi, chicken shop, pizza etc. A few dine-in options on Danks St (some seemed quite nice). It is a great location if you need to get to or from the airport quickly - about 15 mins in a taxi. The noise didn't bother me too much. Provided you keep the windows closed, you won't be woken by the noise. The aircon units are plentiful (in living area and each BR) so will keep place cool in summer. There are not that many facilities within the complex compared to what you would get in a hotel - for example, no in-house restaurant or bar; gym and swimming pool are located off-site; also not sure if they have a business centre or other such facility. However as you have probably gathered the rates are quite competitive and it's probably due to the fact that they don't provide all these add-ons (which, to be honest, we didn't need anyway). Meriton now have a strict 'no party' policy which they seem to enforce. We stayed over the long weekend and while the place was fully booked, we found it very quiet.

First, it took nearly 15 minutes to be served. Second, when we were finally served the person we were dealing with did not seem to understand that we had already completed all necessary registration details. Third, once this was understood, the woman proceeded to advise that there were no 2 bedroom apartments available and that instead, we would have to take two one bedroom apartments. We advised that this was not acceptable and asked to speak to the manager. We noted that our booking had been made well in advance, and that if the had been a problem, that we should have been advised earlier in the day when we registered. The woman asked the manager to speak to us, but he was reluctant to do so. Instead, the woman asked \"that we go to the rooms and that he would contact us later\". As this was unacceptable, we demanded to speak to manager. After having to wait for a further 10 minutes (by now we had waited over 30 minutes) the manger came to see us and advised that the property was overbooked. After some discussion he agreed to \"find\" us a 2 bedroom apartment (why this could not have been done in the first place is anyones guess). We were finalluy allocated an apartment on the 14th floor. On initial inspection it looked fine, but once in we realised that the apartment was filthy. There was dust on all surfaces, the tiles in the bathrooms were filthy and there was a rotting stench coming from behind a locked door. Given the difficulties we put up with the accommodation. We checked out at 6.30am the next day. Upon check-out we were told that reception staff \"do not start work until 7am\". When I asked if I could pay, the \"security\" guard advised that it was \"not his job\" to take payment an that \"the managemenet would deal with the matter late in the day\". In short, this hotel is appallinglu run with poorly trained staff and filthy. I will never stay in this property, or indeed, any other Meriton property again.

Sheer luxury. I can only comment on our experience and we were very, very lucky. Arrived at the Meriton Cameo from the aiport for a 5 night stay after spending 3 weeks travelling down the East Coast. We had stayed in Budget places and we booked in advance a 2 bedrm apartment for 4 adults based on reviews I read on here. We worked out before we left the UK it was around \u00c2\u00a316 each/night and that suited our budget. I think the taxi trip cost us around $30 but I think we were charged extra as we had a bigger car for loads of luggage. We were taken right to the main building which looked exactly like we expected. Modern building about 10 storeys high. Went into the recpetion area which was small but clean and modern and checked in. We wanted to pay our accommodation by cash, and Dad being Dad was not keen on us paying up front without seeing the room. We did however pay the $830 approx upfront, and we were given our key for the 10th floor. The key also activated the lift. We got in the lift, up to Floor 10 & the doors opened & we saw our room was to the right. At that point I noticed there were only 4 rooms on the floor but never really thought much of it. Mum went in the door first & immediately turned to me with her mouth wide open!! It was HUGE!! we went in & my Dad immediately bagan to panic that we had paid $830 & that was for the one night but no, the receipt definitely said 5 nights. The kitchen was so modern & fancy, big living & dining room area, big bedroom with en-suite, a bedroom with 2 beds, another bathroom and a utility room with washing machine & tumble dryer. We went out on the patio & you could have held a massive party on it!!! We were absolutely stunned. We found out a few days later that we had been upgraded to a penthouse suite. We have no idea why, but it was luxury. We used the pool facilities once which were in the building opposite & were lovely. I have nothing negative to say about these apartments. Yes they are a bit away from the centre of Sydney but there are buses frequently from a bus stop just across the road. Surrey Hills is a short journey away & although we did not go out there to eat, there seemed to be plenty to chose from. Our favourite restaurant was down at Darling Harbour & was called Baia.

I recently travelled to Sydney with my girlfriend for the weekend, where we stayed at Meriton Cameo for two nights. What a great place to stay! Location - It was only a $14 taxi fare from the airport (15 mins), and buses to Circular Quay (301, 302, 303) leave regularly from just around the corner (Bourke St), and it's only a 15-20min trip. There are countless pubs and restaurants on Crown St in Surry Hills, which is a very short walk away (25 mins to the most distant we visited at Foveaux St), and even shorter on the bus. The $10 steak at Forresters was excellent, and we were impressed with every one of the bars we visited. We also walked home during the early hours of the morning, and never once felt unsafe. Fox studios and the SCG/Aussie Stadium are about a 30min walk, and Bondi is not far on a bus. There is also a handy 24hr convenience store in Potter St, which is surprisingly well stocked, and fairly inexpensive. Room/Facilities - Our room was modern, very clean, spacious, and well equipped. The 2 balconies gave us some nice views, and the king size bed was a dream to sleep on. The kitchen was a really nice touch, and would probably satisfy a budding chef. Sparkling bathroom, with a great shower and a large tub. We managed to visit the pool complex, and were blown away! Three pools (one was a genuine lap pool), a spa, and a sauna. The gym looked to be very well appointed too. Staff/Service - The staff were the best I have experienced at a hotel. We arrived at about 10:30am, and rather than just holding our bags, the staff checked us in early! They were more than happy to hold our bags until departure, and offered to organise a taxi for us. We were always greeted with smiling faces, and our requests, though few, were met with ease. I thoroughly recommend the Meriton Cameo to anyone visiting Sydney. Those worried about being out of the city, don't. It was a breeze to get there. There is plenty of nightlife/activities to keep you occupied in Surry Hills.
