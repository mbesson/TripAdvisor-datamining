I think they have the best loyalty program and am always treated well at the hotels. That said, I have now stayed at the Bonaventure two times. It is a huge property constructed in the 1970's and utilizes a lot of concrete (or what appears to be concrete). The location is great right in downtown L.A. If you have business downtown you may be able to walk. You can walk to L.A. Live and the arenas in the area. However, the distance is almost a mile so I suggest the hotel offer some sort of shuttle for people who may not want to walk that distance. With the hotel competition in the L.A. Live area - this could be a strong selling point. The rooms are somewhat small. The double rooms have double beds and not the usual queen beds. The beds are also a bit soft. Overall, I think the property is nice but needs some updating. Notwithstanding, I would probably stay again.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a Business Trip\u201d", "Author": "RetroStewardess", "ReviewID": "UR129198676", "Content": "I stayed at the Bonaventure in April for a trade show.

The reviews on this hotel I have read thus far, in my opinion have been accurate and a fair description of the hotel, it's location and lack of service skills. Location: for downtown, it is fine, if downtown is what you need, I was on a business conference that was out of the Convention Center, and it required a shuttle. Everything is so far away in LA, whereas in NYC it is right down the street. It took me 45 minutes round trip to by walking to buy a bottle of water and some snacks outside the hotel about 3 blocks away. The area- Downtown LA simply is a riddled with questionable people and they are all very aggressive. Being from NYC I don't mind this as much, but others do and it is getting worse from what I have been told. Sorry, but a single waling female has no business walking anywhere in the downtown area at this point. The Hotel- definetly aged, and worn, and lacking in any type of real 4-5 star level service skills. Check in was smooth, but that was last time I spoke to anyone at the hotel who didn't have an attitude, or was too busy to be even friendly. The morning coffee service at the bar, they didn't even look at me as I ordered, so the next morning I went across the street to a local starbucks to avoid these 2. I even had questions on the hotel's services- food services, business center and could never get a straight answer or worse conflicting answers. The exception to this was the concierge whom I consulted once and he was great. The Room- aged for sure, older and useless and beat up furnishings, very thin walls but otherwise wasn't too bad. Our room did not have an honor bar, nor a TV with any hotel services/movies/etc, you would expect A Westin to have. The INTERNET: Simply stated was horrible.. They still charge 12.95 per day for this, which is why luxury hotels or luxury want to be hotels such as this, are losing share to the limited service hotels. The internet NEVER worked and when it did was so slow I could not even work on emails. We made numerous calls to the front desk, and of course they knew there were problems, but continued to tell me it would be fixed, it never was, or to come down to lobby and use free wireless signal, which of course is what I really want to do at 2:00 am when I finally have time to answer my emails. To their credit, they did not charge my room after I complained daily and took off all internet charges. LASTLY- Food and Beverage- Simply the rudest bar tenders I have ever seen in my life, made me not want to go back to lobby bar, in fact I didn't after my second night. The very over priced breakfast at I believe $24.00 for a buffett was ok, but did it only once because of the timing and the cost. Room Service took over an hour, was cold etc, but it was my last night and I expected nothing less from them as I would now of any department in that hotel at that point. This property have generally low TA scores for its level and brand and it is now easy for me to tell why.. Will not return ever and may have to go to SPG, due to the fact I paid nearly $300 per night and don't feel I had the service level returned.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad location\u201d", "Author": "Traveljunkie511", "ReviewID": "UR128583672", "Content": "Unless you having business meetings in downtown LA this is not the best hotel.

This review is for The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites in Los Angeles, during my recent Los Angeles Trip (February 2012). Room Type/Class: Traditional Room Date: February 7-10, 2012 Overall Rating: 4/5 This trip was explicitly to attend two concert events - one at Club Nokia and the other one in Hollywood. I lived and worked in Los Angeles for many years while I was in graduate school, so I'm really familiar with it. Since Club Nokia is part of L.A. Live, I thought it made sense to find a hotel that is within walking distance of L.A. Live, which put me downtown. I considered the Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton that are part of L.A. Live, but they were much more expensive compared with The Westin Bonaventure's Hotwire price. I ended up deciphering a \"hidden\" discounted offering on one website to purchase on another, and found that The Westin Bonaventure was the hotel being offered within that class range for a highly discounted cost off the base rate, and booked it. So the hotel has valet parking, but it is an additional $35 per night. If you don't mind walking a block or two, I noticed that there appeared to be some other public parking alternatives that would be cheaper; I ended up using the valet, which is underground and you walk down a hallway adorned with movie poster one sheets of films shot at and around the hotel (see photos below), and up an escalator toward the main entry level where the front desk is located. Check-in was quick and otherwise unremarkable. I had originally booked two nights, but one of my events was canceled and rescheduled... I asked if I could add a night at the discounted price, and was told they couldn't sell rooms at that price, but the guy at the front desk looked in his computer to see their occupancy for the desired night, and more or less indicated that if I went on that reseller website again, I would likely be able to add the third night at the same reduced rate (when I went up to my room, I was able to do this and add it on). I was actually really excited to check out the elevators, as there is a scene with Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies where he goes up one of the elevators on horseback; the gentleman at the front desk was able to direct me to the exact elevator I was seeking. As for the room itself, I had the basic/base room, and was pleased that it was on one of the higher floors (better views). While on the small side, it was very clean and nicely appointed, as I've learned to expect from Westin properties. Maybe because it is an older property, the shower and bed are maybe not as \"Heavenly\" as some other Westin properties, but overall the room suited my needs perfectly (traveling alone) with king-sized bed and computer desk. Internet connectivity via WiFi was good but not spectacular. For me, the best bonus of the room was the view. Most of the outward facing wall is glass floor to ceiling, as the view was spectacular, particularly at night. There are some amenities in the hotel that I just didn't have the time to use - restaurant, bar, etc. As noted, I had come to L.A. for a concert at L.A. Live, and found that it was definitely a reasonable walking distance from the Westin Bonaventure - maybe too far for some people's taste, but I walked back and forth several times and I don't think it took more 15 minutes. Overall, I don't have any complaints at all, though it would be nice if valet parking was included, but I knew from my research ahead of time that was a cost to factor into the overall value proposition of the stay. When I attend a future event at L.A. Live, I would likely return to the Bonaventure, unless there is a special deal at one of the competing properties.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDowntown Gem\u201d", "Author": "Eltee_loves2travel", "ReviewID": "UR128352533", "Content": "The Westin Bonaventure is a gem in Downtown LA.

We requested in our booking a king sized bed, we got it. The bed was huge, lying in the middle you couldn't touch the sides. The bed was very good plenty of pillows - it was part of our honeymoon trip. We loved the view and in our jet-lagged state enjoyed watching the sun rise every morning from the bed. The curtains were left open for most of our 4 day stay. It's the second time I have stayed here - the first time was for a large conference in 2010 - this time I got to see a little more of the hotel. Everything is contained within the building including several fast food outlets on the floors above the lobby. At one stage we tried to get to the rooftop for a better view but ended up in the steak restaurant. Perhaps we got lost. I can't remember the cost of wifi in the room but it was for free in the lobby. In fact if you go down to level 5 in the elevators and then walk down one level you get a very quiet booth seating area which still receives the free wifi signal from the lobby. It's a good airy bright quiet place to check your emails. There's also a small indoor circular track one floor below that level for running. The guest elevatots go from lobby level to level 5 - for the shops do it the old fashioned way and take the stairs. Transport around this hotel is good - we went as far as taking a bus from Beverly Hills and it stops a block away from the hotel. Cool. I think the metro was 3 blocks away - but close to a Ralph's. We had a door to an adjoining room which was kept locked. I guess the people in that room were on their honeymoon too. There was one little attention to detail that I appreciated. I often leave my reading glasses next to the bed when I fall asleep. Housekeeping folded my glasses and put them back into my case for safe keping when refreshing the room.

When you pull up to the front, you are directed to pull up and drive into the garage under the hotel. Make sure you factor in an additional $40 for valet (they gladly add it to the room).

The lobby is a three story atrium with people all over the place. Lots of airline workers, they must have a corporate rate here. The center is a round bar with giant pools of water and fountains. Dim mood lighting everwhere and four glass elevators on each corner. There are shops, restaurants, and lounges all around the sides. Couches and tables around the perimeter for free wifi access. After you check in you will be pointed toward your tower (red, blue, green, or yellow) I am not sure if there is any differences between the towers. I had the red tower which boasts a revolving restaurant on the 34th floor (I tried to grab a drink at the bar later that night, but they don't have a bar...only table seating) The rooms in the red tower are very nice. I had a great view of the city (floor to ceiling windows from side to side) as well as the blue tower's glass elevator which shoots up and down with passengers throughout the night. The bed took up most of the room and is super comfortable. The bathroom has all sorts of little amenities including the signature Westin Heavenly Shower head...the pressure was equal to a fire hose. The only drawback was an early morning powerwash of one of the roof's about 10 stories below my room. I needed to get up anyways. They have an outdoor pool located on the fourth floor roof. You can see it lit up at night from one of the red tower elevators. With my check-in I received one free glass of wine at the main lobby bar. I ate dinner as well..total tab $30.

Great architecture, the rooms are well laid out, and have great views, are clean and the beds are comfortable. Everyone on staff was very pleasant. A small annoyance: being a guy, I should not have to hold the toilet seat up with one hand while I'm standing there using it. I thought this was a problem unique to the first room I had stayed in there at the Westin, but apparently it's all of them. The marble shelf sticks out too far so the toilet seat cannot be put back to where it will stay up on its own. Not a problem for women, but a bit of an annoyance for us guys. And for the price I paid for a Friday night, I think all of the outlets in the room should work. On one outlet, neither plug worked, so I wound up unplugging something in order to charge my laptop.

The lights. The busy office people. The hustle and bustle. The sounds. Stayed at the hotel for one night. This place is HUGE! Really something to look at. Calming in a strange sort of way. I was one of the lucky ones and did NOT have a car to park. Avoided the $400/night parking fee. Ok, not $400, but not cheap. Hate paying for wifi at hotels, so I didn't. **I think the time has come for luxury hotels to STOP charging for wifi! The room cost should cover that, especially at these rates. If even a 2 star hotel can cover the cost of wifi for the guests as most do, pretty sure, Hilton, Weston, Marriott etc. can afford to do so. I had a King room. Small room, but decorated nicely. Flat Panel TV. Good coffee. FREE water (Good job on the \"free\" water Westin) and a small, but well appointed bathroom. Loved the leaf formed soap! The views from the 25th floor were OUTSTANDING. Open the curtain and you are faced with a sea of lights. Thousands and thousands of lights! Loved it. Even this high up in the sky, you hear a lot of city noise. But I liked the noise. Felt like I was in New York for a night. The only lights I did NOT like, were the lights in the room while I was trying to sleep. I like it dark when I sleep, but it seems more and more hotels are using TVs, Clocks, Phones, all with lights that emit all-night-long. A green light. A red light. My room looked like a lazer light show was going on! Had to use my shoe to block the green light from the TV. Had to use my other shoe to block the light from the clock. Had to cover the phones with books. Had to put a towel by the base of the door- you get the idea. What ever happened to dark rooms? In the morning I found USA Today at my door. I also found, at my door, 2 empty drinking glasses that had been there since the night before, when I checked in. I know the place is huge, but someone really should have picked those up. Overall, I really enjoyed the place. Felt very comfortable and clean. Was looking forward to taking a shower in the morning with the nice shampoo and soap. Bummer. The shower sucked. The curtain smelled of mildew and the actual space to take a shower could not have been any smaller. My arm kept touching the nasty curtain! Oh, and after 2 minutes, I was standing in about 5 inches of water. Gross. Horrible draining problems. But WOW! My hair smelled amazing after!

I have stayed there for many years, but the last couple of stays the old girl was starting to age a bit. Arriving in the underground carpark this time, I knew instantly that something had changed. It's been about a year since my last visit, and right off I noticed the proper desk for the valets and the fresh paint and wood accents. That feeling carried over up the series of escalators to the lobby where I felt like I was looking at an old friend for the first time and thinking something is different, then realizing that everything is different. Reception is a sleek desk of the same colors and wood accents used throughout the hotel now. It was inviting and chic, although the wood couldn't look anymore like plastic than it does. Check in was the usual quick en efficient affair, and then up in the famous glass elevators to my room. I booked a Tower Suite, which is love at the Bonaventure. They are two regular rooms adjoining through a sliding door. Both rooms are curved with stunning and iconic views of LA. I remember when the Bonaventure was the tallest building in LA. Now it's dwarfed by it's neighbors, but that just makes the views better, more dramatic. The Tower Suites have been completely refurbed, and look great. Still 1.5 baths, which is really handy, but everything has been upgraded and improved. The wet bar area is now attractive and useful, and there are shelves in the bathroom. The furniture is very comfortable, and the TV is now flat panel. The desk still faces the windows, so it's hard to work there because you end up staring at the activity going on below you. But it's a very useful desk, and there is plenty of light throughout the suite. My rate included breakfast, so down I went. The lobby restaurant has been thoughtfully redesigned and organized, and is bright, attractive, and welcoming. A far cry from the dark abyss of yore. And the food at the buffet was delicious, a big surprise and huge improvement from years past. Parking this time around was expensive, more than I remember from before.

I think they are exercising due diligence to keep the rooms spotless considering even a single and unconfirmed report of bed bugs can be a death knell for its business. The hotel has been the setting for several blockbuster movies too, including one of my favorites, In The Line of Fire. It was a real treat to be standing in the same elevator John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood were in for the elevator scene. Westin consists of 4 towers that are color coded. Once you know the color code of the tower your room is in, it should be fairly easy to navigate around. If you want to exit onto Figueroa Street, you will need to take the escalator up from the lobby, but other than that it was easy for me to get around. The rooms were clean and the maid service very prompt and thorough. Valet parking experience was acceptable, sometimes the attendees will be a bit harried and confused, but they're hard working and bring your car out quickly even when you don't call ahead. There are a few dining options on the 4th floor, but to access it you need to ride to either the 3rd or 5th floor I believe and then take the stairs, so it's a bit of an inconvenience, plus their opening hours don't usually extend to the evenings, so you'll either need to head out or order room service. Room service was for me was predictably expensive but actually pretty satisfying. The hot chocolate itself might have been the best deal: while it's $5, it comes in a huge pitcher and could easily serve 4-5 people. Delicious too. My major complaints had to do with Wi-Fi and the holds they put on my PayPal card. I was there for BlogWorld so it was expected that everyone in creation would be using their Wi-Fi, but I especially needed it because of having to get my iPhone replaced after the antenna stopped working. I was trying to do an iCloud restore which only works through wi-fi and despite being at the hotel for 4 nights, the wi-fi STILL wasn't good enough for me to fully complete my restore. There were times when the wi-fi disappeared altogether, leaving me to use my cell phone or a wired connection just to get online. To be fair though, the wired connection did work really well. Still, it was the wi-fi I desperately needed, and the hotel failed miserably there. Secondly, I understand that hotels will sometimes put a hold on your debit card if you opt to use that instead of a credit card. What I don't understand or accept is putting a $824 hold on my card. Seriously? Because I opt for the convenience of using a PayPal card (which I reserve for all my travel expenses) it was necessary to hijack almost $1000 of my money? This, despite the fact that the room had ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR. While I understand a hold for valet parking and room service, holding the cost of the room when it was previously paid for and debited already was ridiculous.

The location is wonderful- right in the heart of the bars, fancy places to eat, etc. The hotel itself is beautiful- rooms are found in different towers according to colors (red, blue, yellow). Inside the hotel there are little shops along with different restaurants depending on your preference. I liked the idea of different dining choices- most expensive being LA Prime located on the 35th floor with great views of LA. Other choices were a brewery (mediocre food), a food court with many different choices, the lounge/bar, etc. The room itself is very small- pretty standard. Open the door and there is your bathroom, bed, and TV. Other than that there isn't much room for anything else but I guess you're at a hotel to mainly just sleep right? The view of LA was beautiful we were on the 31st floor- LA lights are always nice. Downfalls were that on that morning there was a marathon going on so EARLY MORNING NOISE! music so loud to wake you up from a nice slumber. and $40 for parking- but there was a huge crowd and the wait for valet was 25 minutes! ridiculous. If they knew they were going to have a mass exit they should have planned ahead. Luckily they did comp the fee so I guess we couldn't be that upset..

I've been in love with this place since it was used as a futuristic backdrop set for NBC's Buck Rogers in the 25th Century shortly after opening in the early 1980's and have been coming back ever since. It's recently had a slight makeover to update the fixtures & look, but it's still a glass-tastrophe & crazy concrete cavern of a lobby. Phil Spector and his murder trial legal team loved it so much awhile back they rented a whole floor, ran up a huge bill in the 100s of thousands and then didn't pay...isn't that just so LA? I read other reviews and the things some people complain about, I find endearing or have just become used to. I consider this place my favorite 4 star budget hotel...and what I mean is that I usually get the rate reduced as much as half via a bidding site, and never park in the hotel's own garage which adds $40 to your bill a day (parking $8 a night one bldg over at World Trade Center garage)... I also rarely order anything from room service or the hotel's restaurant or bars...I'll buy beer at a little shop on the third floor for $2 and walk around drinking those looking at all the plaques from all the movies that have been shot here. It's a big busy place & after check in, no one is probably going to hold your hand, so just start adventuring and you'll figure it all out. It's in the heart of LA's downtown biz district, which can be a little boring or bleak if you don't know where to go for fun, but even if you don't leave the building their are worthwhile ways to kill time. Check out the actual beer brewing pub on the outdoor plaza, or go the top of the hotel for the rotating spinning bar with a view. I once got so buzzed at the center lobby bar before closing time, that I then got lost in this hotel and it took me over an hour to get back to the right tower and figure out on which floor was my room. The drawbacks are there is no free internet, that's pretty standard policy in most big-city big name properties, so bite the bullet and get used to it. The bedding, as in most Westin properties is always superior to whatever I sleep on at home.I like the baffling maze like winding stairwells that still disorientate me on my way to buy sundries, and cheaper quick serve food from the independent vendors that inhabit the third floor, which is absolutely inaccessible via any elevator I know of. If you find the weird little food court, you'll run into counters offering pizza, pasta, middle-eastern fare, salads and Asian dishes...and of course the food group known as Fried.

I would say give yourself an hour during rush hour to get there. Also, parking there is not cheap.

I recommend using a private transportation service like them if you are planning to stay at the hotel instead of driving yourself or a taking a taxi from the airport. One more item about the location, there isn't really much to do downtown. You have to head to West LA (Santa Monica area) to find more night life and shopping. Anyway, enough ranting about the location. As other reviewers have mentioned on here, the hotel is huge. I felt like I was staying at a hotel on the strip in Vegas...minus the casino.

Both times our room was clean and a decent size. The views from the rooms are good of the business district. Just down the road is a food court and also some shopping, macys is a five minute walk. It is also not too far from the airport, $50 cab ride. This is why we stayed there the second time. On the first occasion we did not have a good experience. We went to the hotel bar the night before so didn't get to bed till late. At 830am we were awoken by hammering from the room above. I can only presume they were having some sort of renovation. I rang the front desk to complain and was told that they would sort it out and call back. About 35 mins later it was still going on. We rang the front desk again and they apologised and said they would speak to a manager. The hammering did then seem to move to another room but we could still hear it faintly and never received a callback from reception. The second time we booked again in this hotel for two nights. Although we had a negative experience we felt this hotel was still good value (booked on hotwire) and in a good location for what we wanted. We were arriving from Cabos mexico and missed our flight (not our fault). We booked into the westin in cabos for the night and contacted LA to let them know we would not be arriving that day. When we did I spoke with the front desk about a refund for our first night and they explained that hotwire would be responsible. After speaking to hotwire I was getting nowhere so the gentleman on the front desk took over and spoke to the manager who in turn contacted hotwire for us and arranged for a refund. This was a big relief as we had spent so much extra on having to buy another plane ticket and booking the hotel in mexico. I really appreciate that they went out of their way to help us and thought this was excellent customer service. On this basis I can only imagine that our first experience was an unfortunate one off.

Overall, I had a comfortable stay, but the housekeeping could have done a much better job. I might stay here again, but for the price, I think the Hilton Checkers two blocks away is probably better. Check-in and check-out was quick; although there seemed to only two or three people at the front-desk at any given point despite there being at least 6 or 7 check-in counters. No one at the Starwood preferred guest check-in all the times that I checked. I got a room on the 27th floor, which was reasonably clean and large enough. The nicest thing about the room was the floor to ceiling view. The king bed was large and comfortable. The flat screen TV had a good selection of channels and movies. The bathroom was very clean, but the tub had a few stains - an indicator of the age of the place, more so than anything else. Plenty of plush towels and a complementary robe. The amount of hot water and shower pressure was also pretty good. The trash bins in the room were not empty on check-in which leads me to think that the room was hastily cleaned. I immediately checked the bed to see if the cleaning was superficial, but it appeared to be clean enough. Two of the pillows had a couple of small spots of blood, so I was worried about bedbugs. It took a couple of tries calling the front desk to get housekeeping to come and clean the room again. There was no complementary water in the room on check-in, but the housekeeping included this on the second day of the stay. The hotel complex is a labyrinth, and the concrete structure is reminiscent of a shopping mall, but I actually liked the architecture. There were some reviews about waiting ages for the elevators but this was not my experience. In fact, I felt that average time I needed to wait for was 30 seconds or less. I was given complementary internet access which was unexpected and pleasant - connecting to it was quick and it was fast. Parking and internet costs in general are somewhat astronomical in the area anyway. Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars.

The rooftop pool is clean, the perfect temperature, and quietly hidden above the bustle of the city. The architecture of the building is really interesting and the exterior elevators are fun to ride in. As other posters have mentioned, the $35 mandatory valet parking fee is kind of lame, and we opted out of the $13 daily internet to keep our costs down, but since we got such a good deal on Priceline, this hotel ended up costing about the same as our airport hotel the night before, and it was much of higher caliber. Also a note on the neighbourhood - we (small town Canadians) had been scared into not looking elsewhere for cheaper parking fearing mugging or break-ins, but we walked to Pitfire Pizza (about 6-8 blocks away) and back that evening, and although the neighbourhood does have some interesting residents, its quite busy and we felt safe the entire time. I think if your times worked out OK, you could find a deal on parking in one of the neighbouring office towers.

We thought we were clever, since we had rung a few days before and were assured that there should be no problems with an early check-in, and the request was in the system. So we went to the reception desk and were met with a VERY icy reception. The desk clerk told us that check-in was 3 pm and that the hotel was full. I asked to speak to the supervisor, and Sonya came out. She told me that there was a \"request\" for an early check-in, but that really didn't mean anything. I asked if there were any rooms where the guests had already checked-out and where we could get in early. Sonya was uninterested in checking for such a room and told us that check-in was at 3 pm and our \"request\" was really unimportant. We finally did get into a room at about 1.30 after annoying the desk staff every half hour to check on room progress. We ate at the lobby restaurant and again service was terrible. We had to request service, although there were many staff. The food was adequate but nothing special. Internet service at the Westin Bonaventure costs about $12.00 per day and starts at 3 pm -- not $12.00 for 24 hours!

Compared to other Starwood properties that Ive stayed at, this was a pretty disappointing experience. It started at the check-in counter on the Tuesday. The room with the king bed I reserved was not available so I was a given a room with two queen beds. No big deal until I got into the room and it looked as if the previous guest was still occupying the room (beds not made, towels on the floor, etc). Back down to the registration desk. I was given another 'wonderful' room next to one of the elevators on a lower floor. I had to adjust the AC fan to high in order to drown out the external elevator and guest noise. It did not help me the next day for my business presentation. The registration desk told me they would call me the next day with a new room assignment and never did. This is an older hotel and navigating around the 'cloverleaf' silos and outside crosswalks is a pain. The rooms are renovated but the wireless did not work for me, nor did the ethernet cable in the room. I was lucky I had an aircard with me. Also, the desks do not have powerplugs and are positioned too far away from a wall plug, so I had to relocate the furniture in order to even work on my laptop. Phone, ipad and bluetooth I had to charge in the bathroom. Staff are friendly (when you can reach them). I spent more than 5 min on the phone waiting for someone to pick up from the operator and the phone was never picked up when I was transferred to the registration desk. I had to call the operator back and have someone call me. I know folks are busy, but this was a little frustrating. I just switched to the airport westin instead, even though it means dealing with the LA traffic to get downtown. To add on the experience, as I was just wrapping up this review the room service staff entered my room even though I have a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. This place has been an experience.

By analogy, some ppl buy on eBay then expect to have the right to a manufacturer's warranty or perks at the store. It's ridiculous logic, regardless of one's SPG status.

Reviews were all over the board and it seemed unanimous that hotel was in serious need of renovations so I was not sure what to think. We arrived, and noticed this hotel is absolutely enormous and had a huge lobby. Most of it was already remodeled and very little construction going on. Check in was awesome and gentleman was very nice and gave me a newly remodeled room with 2 double beds. We took the lightening fast elevator up to the 19th floor (32 floors in all) and unpacked our stuff. Room was a little on the small side but it was just me and my sister so it was ok. Nice, newly done bathroom, plasma screen TV, coffee maker that makes 1 cup of coffee complete with condiments. Fridge, dresser, desk, iron board, closet, robe. TV had some very cool channels-Nat Geo, HBO, TLC, CNN, Fox news,WE, AP, etc.. This is the largest hotel by far I have stayed at. 20 restaurants in all and a huge food court/shopping area on 4th floor. In lobby there was a large circular bar, there is also a very busy bar/nightclub called Suede. Reasonable drink prices too. This is downtown so this is not the most convenient area if you go to Hollywood. Traffic is terrible an it is 30 minutes at least, to get to Hollywood area. There is a small Macy's plaza near by as well as many high rise buildings. Hotel was very quiet Fri night. However, Sat night hotel had a very large number of high schoolers there for prom. Every floor was like animal house and I had to call security twice before they came up and finally took care of the many teenagers who thought they were at a pep rally. Apparantly a large fight broke out on 23rd floor. My floor the 19th one was VERY loud. Noise appeared to be a big problem that night and hotel should have had extra security to keep the teens under control. The second time I called security the man was nice but said they were very busy with noise complaints and that they could not be everywhere at once. Luckily I eventually fell asleep. Be advised no free wi fi anywhere in hotel. I just used my sisters wi fi hot spot through her phone but I rarely stay at hotels with no free wi fi I only stayed here because of the great rate. Parking fee is absurd! so we did not have a car and just had our friend drive us around. This is typical of L.A. anyways.

There were no condiments in the room, and housekeeping didn't bother to refill our coffee during the day. Worst of all is the valet-only parking service - if they were fast, it would be OK, but we sat waiting over twenty minutes several times, once even after the valet assured me he'd park next to the door when I told him I'd be back in an hour. The $35 daily parking rate plus tips is outrageous for terrible service. There were a few good points, the rotating restaurant at the top floor was pricey but incredibly delicious food, worthy of fine dining and a great view. There was plenty of space on top of the 3rd floor to run around the park and swim,plus lots of low priced foodstalls in the hotel lobby (but nothing nice), even a hotspot on the weekends if you like a trendy crowd.

As other reviews have said, this hotel is showing its age. The room I stayed in had been fully renovated, as had the floor it was located on. However, I visited some other floors, and the hallways had not yet been renovated. I didn't get to look inside the rooms on those floors. I don't know if they were putting guests in those rooms/floors or not. However, even the renovated floors did not get their doors replaced. This may seem odd, and it is certainly nit-picky, but the doors into the rooms are very narrow, and seem to have just been painted over, rather than being replaced. Once inside my room, the doors were the only visible (and rather ugly) clue that the rest of the hotel was not as nice and modern as my renovated room was. The main age-related problem is the lobby and the 5 floors above it, which they call the \"Bonaventure Galleria and Food Court.\" During my visit, the lobby was visibly improved from recent renovations, and even more extensive improvements were still under construction. The Galleria was not getting any such special treatment at this time. As such, it just looked tired, and I found myself avoiding those floors as best I could. They were downright depressing! Anyway, my room was very nice. I had a normal room with a king-sized bed. It was large enough for me, and 2 would probably have been comfortable. However, unless the rooms with 2 double beds have more square footage, then I would imagine they would feel small. The recent renovations to the rooms produced an outstanding result, especially the bathrooms. My room felt comfortable, modern, and inviting. The views out the window were also great. Breakfast is, of course, not included, room service is outrageously expensive, and WiFi costs $13 a day. This pretty much seems to be expected of hotels in downtown LA. I will note that the in-room coffee maker includes complementary Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas. The housekeeping also provides 2 complementary bottles of water each day, though I found the tap water quite drinkable when those were empty. The service at this hotel was excellent. I never made any kind of hard-to-fulfill request, but everything I did ask about or request was answered well. The concierge and staff helped me find my way around LA, and housekeeping provided impeccable service. I used the laundry service as well. Ordinarily I wouldn't pay such high prices ($12.50 to wash and press 1 pair of men's jeans!) but I happened to really need the service, so it was nice to have. I simply hit the \"Service Express\" button on my phone, said I had laundry, and within minutes the staff were at my door to take the laundry bag. (A nice touch of Service Express is that they always address you by name every time you call.) The jeans were hanging in my closet when I returned to my room the next day. Though it does not excuse the exorbitant price, I was impressed by the impeccable service. The galleria area has several fast and fast-casual restaurants. Avoid them all as much as possible. (The Subway is OK if you must. I did not try the restaurants on the roof, which I'm sure are much nicer and way more expensive.) Across the street, there is an entrance to the underground \"505 Flower\" shopping center. There are TONS of good choices down there for inexpensive food, and you hardly have to leave the hotel to get to them. Try the cupcakes at the \"Lemonade\" restaurant! Overall, this is a very good hotel. The rooms look great, and I could tell that the nearly-complete lobby renovations were going to be superb as well. Though an online special, I paid $113/night (tax included in that price) for my room. I don't think you could find a similar hotel with a better price than that, so I consider it to be a very fair price for what I received. Do be warned if you are a light sleeper or easily disturbed- I could hear my neighbors talking (and they weren't even yelling) through the wall, and even on the 26th floor traffic was very audible. It did not affect my sleep or comfort one iota, but I know I sleep quite heavily. I would recommend this hotel, but because of the depressing style of the galleria area (which isn't avoidable) the Bonaventure isn't at the same level as Westin's other high-end properties.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAverage all around\u201d", "Author": "jrggilbert", "ReviewID": "UR104039811", "Content": "Recently stayed for one night at the Westin Bonaventure.

But the bed was a little hard and the fact they don't use a fitted sheet for the bottom makes it weird because the flat sheet crumples up under you, and I had to keep flattening it out to be comfortable. Lots of pillows provided. Mini fridge. Safe. Nice clean modern bathroom with more than enough towels. Complimentary mineral water bottles. Floor to ceiling windows which can look a little scary when you are on the 29th floor. However, great view of Downtown L.A. We could even see the Hollywood sign. Expensive valet parking: $35/night, but very helpful valets. Outstanding service in this hotel: the registration agent, was very welcoming and even provided us complimentary wireless service in our room even thought we were not gold Starwood Prefered. I looked so disappointed when she told us that our regular Starwood Preferred status did not give us free wireless, that she gave it to us. The bell service goes beyond the call of duty. My husband was waiting for boxes and they got them all, found them, took care of transporting them to the car, did everything right. Kudos to Calvin, the bellman. Duvon Collins, the concierge, gave us a great recommendation for dinner, two blocks from the hotel. In turn, we can recommend Maria's Italian Kitchen at 615 S. Flower St. It was copious, delicious and reasonable. We also ate at L.A. Prime, the top-notch steakhouse of the hotel on the 35th floor, and received excellent service from Robert the host and Mark our server. On our last night, the rain was torrential, we had forgotten our umbrella and Chaya, the restaurant we were going to have dinner at, was only a block away. However, it was raining so hard, we knew we would be drenched in water by the time we got there. We told the doorman we wanted to get a taxi, but he seems reluctant to get us a taxi for just a block. It just happened that a friend of his, one of the Japanese guides from the hotel was going home: he took us in his tour van one block down, dropped us off in front of the restaurant and even gave us both one of those little Japanese umbrellas that is practically disposable. Incredible service from the Westin Bonaventure all the way around. We will always remember it. They also gave us late checkout at 2pm. We also had purchased the breakfast buffet plan, and did not regret it. The buffet is very good and copious. You also can get made to order omelettes. A buffet offers lots of choices. Recommended.

Also, staying in downtown LA meant that while there wasn\u2019t that many facilities open after the end of business hours every day, it was handy for travelling to other places in LA when we didn\u2019t want to rent a car. There is a \u201crapid\u201d bus which goes from just up the street around the corner of the hotel through to Beverley Hills and Santa Monica (OK, so it\u2019s not fast but it does come very often); and the metro to Hollywood is within easy distance. Anything more off the beaten track would have needed a car; but being in a central hub for 6 days was perfect for us. The only complaint I would have is that one of the bell staff completely cracked our new hard shell suitcase on our arrival. Bummer. A security manager, Larry Corley, came to investigate. He was very polite, gave us a complimentary breakfast for the family to make up for the inconvenience (by the way, the selection and food was very nice) and even organised some gaffer tape so we could fix up the problem. No complaints about Mr Corley, but the damage to the case was referred by the hotel to the insurance agency \u2013 which hadn\u2019t called, even though we were still in the States for 3 weeks after the incident and we kept advising our contact details; and on our return home, has barely made contact (and that only after about six calls and three emails from me). Now more than a month and a half later, we still have a broken suitcase and no compensation. Maybe this is a way of trying to shake off all but the most determined of clients\u2026 anyway, I would have thought that a hotel of the Westin\u2019s reputation and standing would have done something to compensate us directly. Unfortunately, this incident and the handling of it has really damaged our impression of our stay at the Westin Bonaventure.

Check in took 5 minutes at around 4:00 p.m. that day (I was shocked how organized the front desk was)! The hotel really cares about its platinum guests as well ... always extending a courtesy drink invitation in the revolving lounge on the 34th floor. It was great up there with a DJ and a dance floor ... you couldn't ask for more. And, the lounge manager, Sonny, was wonderful. Without a reservation on New Years' Eve around 10:30 p.m. he found us a wonderful table ... thank you very much again Sonny!! The breakfast buffet is always wonderful and there is a great waiter there named Rehan we always enjoy waiting on our table. We also met Jennifer Nagao, the Director of Restaurants in the hotel and she was a pleasure to deal with. She is very hard-working and is really making great improvements to the various restaurants at the hotel (which are wonderful to begin with). A young \"star\" in the works for Starwood is Jennifer to be sure. Parking is at a discounted rate for overnight guests ($35/night) (and that is not so bad for downtown LA), but I have also found the hotel has a \"package\" rate at times which includes parking as part of the rate. There are many independent restaurants on the 5th floor of the hotel for mostly inexpensive snacks and meals and I have tried several and they were good. The hotel also has a very exclusive club on the first floor but generally not for us \"married guys\" (I will let someone else review that club). The hotel is also nicely located if you are going to the Music Center for a musical or a play, etc. We always walk right over (about a 15 minute walk). While we generally walk back to the hotel after the show as well, at that time of night, it is a short cab ride back if you prefer. The room was very clean and I had no problem with the internet at all. In house dining service was wonderful and even when I needed some champagne glasses brought to the room, they were there in a flash.

Be comfortable with your body if you plan to use the gym because it has see through walls and extra exercise equipment located outside on the bridgeways... we could watch the gym users exercising as we walked between meeting rooms on the third floor! Services seem much higher priced than average - many of my colleagues were complaining about printing costs and the paid wi fi connections are one per computer not one per room (the other person in my room had to buy a separate subscription).

Beds in the rooms were extremely comfortable with the usual US overabundance of pillows; bathroom was pleasant and very clean although one couldn't actually sit down in the shower bathtub.

The first thing I noticed when I arrived was that the room was much too hot. No matter how much I lowered the thermostat it was much warmer than it ought to have been, and never got below the mid-80s F.. The air conditioning maintenance man (the nicest and most helpful member of the hotel staff we encountered during our stay) came up, made a repair and some adjustments that he said should fix the problem, but nonetheless recommended we change rooms. We did. Next order of business was getting a local map. There were none in evidence at the front desk or concierge station, and the ubiquitous brochure racks normally found in hotels were stuck in an obscure corner where I wouldn't notice them until my departure from the hotel, when I had the opportunity to peruse the nooks and crannies of the lobby. Failing to find it, and after spending an hour unsuccessfully searching the area for a bookstore that might seel me a map, I ended up picking up a freebie in the lobby of the Hilton three or four blocks away from the Bonaventure. Inexcusable that the Bonaventure did not have any in its lobby, at least not in a place where a newly arrived visitor might spot them. The room was okay, but nothing especially luxurious. The bed was reasonably comfortable, the bathroom mediocre. The vanity in which the sink is situated is very inefficiently designed, with about 8 inches between the front of the vanity and the sink. Unless you are extremely tall, a real stretch is required to bend over the sink when you're brushing your teeth. Bathroom amenities were subpar for a hotel of this rating and price range--more like what you'd expect to find in a budget hotel. They consisted only of soap, shampoo, conditioner and some lotion--no shower cap or shoe sponge. There was a terry robe, but only one for the two of us. (Each deferred to the other, and neither of us ended up using it.) This hotel is very poorly managed. At night, all of the elevators in the Yellow quadrant of the hotel were all being cleaned simultaneously, with no one telling this to all of the people waiting to get up to their rooms. A passing hotel employee recommended we go over to the Red quadrant and take that elevator, assuring us that we would be able to get to our rooms. It would have made alot more sense to clean one elevator from each section at a time, assuring that there was always some way for people in that section to get to their rooms. Barring that, improved communication would have been helpful, rather than leaving people standing around the 3-4 elevators for the quadrant at 11:30 pm, wondering why no elevator comes. In-room internet is very expensive (around $20 a day, more or less, as I recall) and I didn't opt for it, so I can't comment on how well it worked. Even in the lobby, where there were computers for rent by the minute, it was quite pricey--$7.50 for 5 minutes, if I recall correctly, although it might have been for as long as 10 minutes. Since I didn't actually do it, I don't recall anything other than the price being outrageous. There are several restaurants located in the hotel complex, out toward the pool, including a Johnny Rockets and a Starbucks, but both were already closed when we got there sometime around 5 pm. I didn't notice that the bar in the lobbby sold also Starbucks coffee until we were leaving. Around the hotel, most of the restaurants closed earlier than advertised. A nearby underground food court open until 2 am had almost nothing open by 5:00 pm. The McDonalds, open till 6 pm, was open \"late.\" We had spotted a sushi place several blocks away while walking back from lunch at a great Persian restaurant a few miles away, and ate dinner there. But immediately around the hotel itself there wasn't much, except for the hotel's own overpriced restaurant. The hotel does have a night club with a rigorous dress code, rule one being \"Dress to Impress.\" As for location, I was unimpressed and can't imagine why any tourist would want to stay here if they knew more about this area. Nothing around but office building and other hotels. I guess if you are here for a convention and are busy with convention events all the time, you'd have what to do. The LA public library is across the street one block away. The LA Philharmonic is several blocks away, but it would be a hike and probably not one advisable to do at night. The area around the hotel seemed dreary and exhausted, as commuters frenetically piled onto their buses to leave their downtown drudgery for the suburbs, despite ongoing efforts at revitalization and reconstruction. Some \"brilliant\" city planners apparently decided these downtown doldrums would best be addressed by building huge mega-hotels like this one, where hapless tourists and conventioneers could be conned into coming to what they expected to be one of the most vibrant and exciting cities in the US. Parking in the entire area is extremely expensive, with short term parking averaging a dollar a minute. At the Bonaventure it's $35 a day for guests, with in and out privileges, which is a relative \"bargain\" for the area, I only stayed at the Bonaventure for one night (I was attending a conference at which I was giving a paper at 8:30 am), but it seemed like alot longer!

I was a bit nervous at the prospect of staying at a hotel with a pet, esp. after being assigned a room on the 28th floor but the check in staff assured me if it created too much of a difficulty due to dog walking, they'd be happy to change the room to a lower floor. The advantage, of course, was less traffic in the corridors which definitely in our favor; less noise, less risk of barking (gratefully, our dog is not a barker by nature anyhow). Fortunately, the elevator rides did not present a problem - we never had to wait long and puppy was well-behaved with his first experiences riding in one. What is not as pet -- or human -- friendly, as one reviewer previously pointed out, is the elaborate and confusing elevator systems, which beyond the color coding is the fact that they don't run to some of the floors most frequently used -- for instance, the 4th floor which has access to the pool and grassy dog-walking area. We found we'd either have to go to the 5th floor and walk puppy down a circular flight of stairs, or go to the lobby and use the handicapped elevator by the bell hop counter to make the fastest trip for a walk....which is really not so fast at all. In addition to the grassy area on the pool deck, there's also a park that's accessible from a pedestrian bridge which we never figured out exactly how to access. The run area by the pool deck was sufficient for all intents and purposes, although it would certainly be more pet friendly - and probably guest/cleanliness friendly - to have a discreet pet sanitation stand that offers plastic baggies and a trash container near the back - for guests who may not remember, or have enough, supplies of their own for disposal purposes. I had brought plenty of bags but felt awkward about depositing the soiled and tied up ones in the trash container I spotted not far from the outdoor cafe. I signed a general waiver upon check in for any pet-related problems that may occur, but overall I found the staff to be extremely solicitous, friendly and helpful when they saw the puppy. As a guest, I'd like to see more of that same friendliness offered to me from the staff who works the gift shop (the most I can say about the women I've encountered there during my stays is \"they do their job\" but if you're looking for a warm and/or pleasant greeting, that's not been my experience) or the sole early morning coffee shop open on Sundays that I've gone to. No smiles, good mornings offered - just a cup handed to me when I requested a coffee and a point in the general direction of the muffins when I asked if they had any. A little effort on the part of such staff to make a guest feel welcome rather than feeling as if one is intruding upon their day could make a big difference in customer satisfaction. However, the main point of this trip was to enjoy seeing my son who enjoyed seeing his dog who enjoyed staying at his first hotel.

The primary reason not to stay at this hotel - bed bugs. I suffered around 25 bed bug bites while staying at this hotel. I reported this to the hotel and they maintain that the room was inspected for bed bugs and that no bugs were found. I asked when the room had been inspected and I was told between the hours of noon and 5pm. Well, of course they didn't find any bugs. Bed bugs hide during the day and only come out at night. I question the inspection methods of Steritech - the pest control company that they use. If they didn't find bed bugs, then why did I get 25 bites on me while staying at this hotel? I asked if there have been other infestations of bed bugs in this hotel, and the answer was \"I am not authorized to answer that question.\" In other words, Westin is hiding a lot with their bed bug problem. Just read the reports from other travelers about bed bugs through TripAdvisor. Additionally, to make sure I do not bring bed bugs in to my home, I am now having to wash all my clothing on hot water and hot dryer cycles. Needless to say, this has ruined a few articles of clothing, which I am sure I will not be reimbursed by Westin. The second reason not to stay at this hotel - it's filthy dirty, and not up to Westin standards. Our room had dark stains on the carpet and the bedding - disgusting! The chairs in the bar on the lobby level are very badly stained and falling apart. Our room was not cleaned very well either. I noticed that our room was never vacuumed during our 5 night stay and the bathrooms were hardly cleaned. Upon entering the room, there was hair from the previous tenant in the bathroom and fingernail clippings were never wiped away. Absolutely, disgusting.

Super fast elevator service... with 12 elevators serving almost all floors, you rarely had to wait for an elevator. Don't be fooled by the color coding of the elevators either, they all go to some portion of your floor. The hallways are all very reasonable in length once you get used to the 4 pod surrounding a central pod configuration. The rooms were definitely on the small size for a Westin, but the bed was still Heavenly. Flat screen HD television but old timey alarm clock radio. Although I noticed plenty of other rooms got one, I never received a newspaper during my entire 5 day stay. I guess I'm not Starwood Preferred enough. Negatives include poor selection of food choices. You're left to choose between airport style fast food on the 4th floor or $60 steaks at LA Prime, A New York Steakhouse (we all thought that was a really weird name). The service was better at The Brewery and Angry Chef restaurants, but the food was very plain. The food was better at LA Prime, but the service was painfully slow and the price tag painfully high... save your money and go for Ruth's Chris or even Morton's, of which one is right down the street. The lobby restaurant, which seemed to only be open for breakfast, served a decent breakfast buffet, albeit for $20+ dollars. The lobby bar couldn't get a food order right and service was slim. Oh, and they give you a free \"day\" of internet if you come with a group, but watch out after that, $13 a day to get online.

Missing are the standard Westin amenities - no Heavenly Showerheads, no porcelain or glass in the guest rooms (paper and styrofoam only). Umplugged TV. An iconic architectural gem shouldn't necessarily have actual signage and furniture from the 70s. This is the hotel the cheap Asian tour groups frequent because it is so hopelessly unaligned with the rest of the Westin brand in the US. The lobby shops seem subterranean and remind me of a Blade Runner like underworld. Exorbitant prices, very poor quality. Same with room service. The standard Westin menu is used. \"Berries with Sabayon sauce\" means berries with yogurt, or berries with whipped cream. No one in the hotel's staff knew what Sabayon sauce was. Funny, because 10+ recipes abound when you search \"Sabayon\" on the internet, and it's a simple recipe. Obviously no one on staff thought to attempt this \"getting it right\" when implementing Westin's menu at this hotel. It saddens me to think the potential of this hotel is so great, but the reality is so awful. Starwood, please get your branding police on the job. This property doesn't cut it, and certainly wouldn't even make the Sheraton brand proud. In the right hands, this could be one cool W hotel, but is probably too big to have that intimate feel. Maybe go retro and be true to the hotel's grand era - like you did with The Palace in SF. I gave this hotel so many second chances by communicating with the staff, but sadly, it's going to take more than a few dissatisfied customers to get this place fixed up.

Beds were super-small, definitely not queen-size. Despite these issues, the room was quite, which was great. Also, bed and pillows were comfortable. At 7 am though the alarm went off (without us being even aware we had an alarm in the room). So, make sure you turn the thing off before going to bed. Morning shower got the entire bathroom fogged up ...

Many of my complaints are hard to address, since they stem from the ridiculous building with complicated elevator system, horrible \"wedge\" shaped rooms, and just hideous decor. Others are embarrassing, like the crushed french fry and filthy hallways, which clearly went my stay without cleaning or vacuuming. The entire lobby and hallways are a stained, nasty mildew smelling horror that reminds me more of a run down Embassy Suites than a high-end hotel like a Westin. As others have said, the rooms are very noisy. Even on the 27th floor, I had more traffic noise than I do in my apartment on 2nd Ave. in Manhattan. The room itself, despite the bizarre and uncomfortable layout to fit into a wedge, was fine. The rug, colored in 70s drab to match the rest of the 70s drag, was clean and unstained, etc. I normally wouldn't mention this about a Westin, since I'd take it for granted, but the rest of my review prompts me to at least acknowledge this.

That was impossible here because the hotel has been designed so that it is almost impossible to go anywhere outside if you are not in a car. The proximity to freeways where the traffic never stops makes the air quality disgustingly bad outside, and you can't walk more than a couple of blocks without coming to an uncrossable freeway or road. The hotel staff seemed to have no idea how to get to anything in any way other than driving and had no maps to give out to tourists. There were also no maps or city guides in the room. On Saturday I found that even the small cafes near the hotel -- all grotesquely overpriced -- were closed for the weekend and there was nowhere to go for breakfast except the hotel restaurant where the simplest meal on the menu cost $22.

This was a true suite with very complete living room separate from the bedroom and bath area. The renovated furnishings are nice and of high quality. The room cleaning was ok, not great, missing attention to detail. (One lamp was unplugged, a few lamp shades were cockeyed. The kitchenette area in the suite made no sense. They ran electric cords between a cabinet and door. (In other words the cabinet door had to stay open. They needed to drill a hole in the counter or relocate an electric socket to power a microwave and a coffee maker. (They clearly hadn't thought through their remodel.) However the bigger problem is that this hotel doesn't have honor bars. So if you want a coke or beer or drink or snack you have to order room service, wait 30 minutes and really overpay. Additional there is no sink in the kitchenette area. Now the problems: The drive-in for check-in is in an underground parking lot. It looks really bad. They didn't have enough attendants to get people out of their cars and avoid long waits. The common areas are really dated and need of a true overhaul. Not just paint, the lobby has pools or water throughout, there is splashing water noise and it is way too loud. It makes everyone have to speak loudly or not hear one another. The lobby is dark, dank and unappealing. The check in counter looks bad and you can see bare wood casing that supports the monitors being used by the front desk personnel. I ate at the hotel's LA Prime restaurant at the top of the red tower. Steak was a B-. No sizzle, not particularly hot, but properly prepared re: medium etc. Salad was a C. Wedge salad with blue cheese. One of the tomatos was so old it was shriveled on the edge and the dressing tasted like ok grocery store bought. Certainly not worth $12. Had a side of creamed spinach with bacon. This was the best thing served. However, the Cowboy fries were limp and not hot. My guess is they were prepared too far in advance. I will say the service in the restaurant was very good. Last nit. The elevators, which are glass and can provide great views of downtown LA are not ventilated. When it is 98 degrees outside in July this becomes an issue. All in all for $259 it was ok. Next time I need to be in downtown LA I'll try somewhere else.

Even though the furniture and countertops were \"new\", the doors and ceiling were very dated. The breakfast buffet was great. They open early at 6:00 which I like. Food was terrific and plentiful. However be prepared to pay, it is $22. The service there was great with the exception of the young female hostess. She had attitude. When I asked if there was coffee to go in the lobby as I was leaving the breakfast area she responded with a simple yes. As I got to where the coffee was, it turns out it is a Starbucks. I went back to her and let her know that I was looking for some that I did not have to pay for, after all, breakfast was $22. Wouldn't it have been easier and much better service for her to have simply asked if she could get me a cup to go? Anyway, overall the hotel was generally clean and safe, I slept well and ate well. Was it the best? Probably not. That said, I am not sure that there is a \"best\" in downtown LA. A good hotel to me is not having to ask for anything. I don't think I require alot, just basics.

In an attempt to improve the chances of a comfortable stay here's what I did: 4 days before arrival, I called the local hotel number, asked for the front desk, and they forwarded me to reservations to confirm my reservation. I pecifically asked for a renovated room. Though my original reservation was made for 2 double beds, I was told that the renovated rooms were only outfitted with king beds. No problem! I'll take the king. Then I was informed that they could only enter a request on my reservation and that the actual room assignment would be made upon arrival. During this time I also made sure that I gave them my Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) number and that I was staying for five nights. I figured every little bit helps. At 09:00, six hours before my arrival, I called the hotel front desk and was again switched to their reservations department. I again asked to be assigned to a renovated room, and when the reservationist opened my reservation, she said that they still had my request on file, but, as before, the room would not be assigned until check-in. When I arrived to register, my room apparently had already been assigned since the receptionist did not have to look for a room in the system. THE ROOM ITSELF I was ensconced in a 24th floor room in the yellow tower (there are 3 other color-coded towers). To my relief, the room was clean, looked and smelled new, and there even was a flat panel TV! In the bathroom I found two bars of soap, but I still got sealed-in-a-wrapper plastic cups. But what the hey, everything else was within expectations of a comfortable and clean room. TIPPING THE HOUSEKEEPER I commonly tip the housekeeper a dollar, but towards the end of my stay, I tipped $2 because she went to the trouble of arranging the toiletries that I left on the bathroom counter the day before. Later, when I returned to my room in the evening, I found that she had brought in and hung up a bathrobe and left an extra bottle of water for me too. I can only assume that she was expressing thanks for a tip that perhaps does not come that frequently.

We got our room, which a) turned out to be next to an elevator (many are since there are 4 circular towers), b) did not have shampoo or conditioner, c) did not have a guest service guide and d) had plastic cups in the room. I'm sorry, a 4 star hotel should have glass glasses. And normally I wouldn't care about the guide, but there are several restaurants, and I wanted to know about the pool and hours, etc. I called about the guide and shampoo - I was told there is no guide because they are being reprinted (why wouldn't they leave the old ones in the rooms if they don't have the replacements yet?) and someone will bring us the shampoo. While waiting for the shampoo (which took over an hour we had left, and they brought everything but shampoo so we had to call AGAIN), we noticed we could hear the elevator clearly! And it was a busy weekend, so it was dinging a lot. I tried to have our room switched - front desk service was nice, but could not accomodate us as it was sold out. This walls are not thick and it was busy busy busy - all night I heard not only the elevator, but every door that shut on our floor. We stayed 2 nights, so the next night they were able to switch us to a quieter room, (which magically had a temporary guide with hours and room service menus!) but we could still hear the doors closing all over the hotel. The concrete lobby is terribly dated, but there isn't much they can do about that. While at first, I thought the food court was cool since you weren't forced to go to a pricy hotel restaurant, it turned out the places were dingy, depressing, and overpriced.

When we entered our room, I immediately noticed the stains on the 20-year old carpet and the disgusting smell of cigarettes. I called the front desk to complain, and they sent up a gentleman to spray our room with air freshner(it may have been worse than the cigaretts0 :(:( The furniture in the room was at least 15 years old. The best part was the TV. It was the same television my parents gave me when i was 10 years old!!!(15 years ago!!)

I called the front desk again and I asked them about the web-site and how disgusted i was with the hotel. They explained that they were in the process of remodeling their hotel, and no new rooms were available. I was very upset because I was never told this prior to booking my non-refundable room!!

I dont use credit cards. What did I pay a deposit for if I couldnt use the internet or make outside phone calls. There were pay phones by the restrooms, which meant I had to go down the elevator again to the lobby to get to the phone.

The shops and the somewhat cheaper places to eat are on those floors. To get to these places and outside patios you had to walk and walk and walk. I ate mostly in those places as to eat in the buffet cost 15.00 each for breakfast and lunch and I dont know how much dinner was. The buffet seemed nice but too expensive for my pocketbook. The one restaurant I ate in was reasonable. It was on the 4th floor, and by the time I got to it I had worked up quite an appitite. To get to the pool patio area, you had to walk all the way around to the green tower. A long long walk. The food that was negotiated was good and the service was good, but when you have a handicap you need to lessen the walking. This is not a hotel for handicapped people. I walk with walker. I used valet parking and this was great, only had to wait 15 minutes to receive our car and the bellhops were at my room within 15 minutes for checkout.

I got out of the car to speak to the bellboy but he was too busy smoking and speaking on his blackberry to talk to me. Eventually he waved me round to the other side of the hotel and left the car with the valet. I went to the front desk and they checked me into a SPG room on the 12th floor. This room was despressing and had not seen a paint brush for 20+ years. The lamp shade was broken and was hanging off the wall and this room stunk of smoke. I called the front desk and was finally moved into a different room. This was no better and also stunk of smoke. Despite these being non smoking rooms the smell of stale smoke is clearly lodged in the carpets and curtains which have not been upgraded for many years. Again I asked to be moved and this time spoke to the duty manager who had no interest or care in the problems experiences so far. Fortunately they moved me into a renovated room the following day and this room did not smell. On the day of check out I explained to the front desk that I had a night flight back to the UK. I asked if there was anywhere I could take a shower before leaving for the airport and they told me that there was a shower in the basement below the swimming pool. So at the end of the day I tried to access this shower room but I could not do so using my key card. So I went back to the front desk and asked them to give me a key card so that I could get into the shower room. After much discussion with the girl on the front desk she reluctantly agreed to let me use the shower room but would not give me a key. Instead she organised for securty to let me into the shower room. I waited for a good 15 minutes for security to show up and then I had to go through the same explanation with the security guy before he would let me in.

The service was so bad that the person that was checking in next to me approached Dora and told her that this was the worst service he had ever seen at a Westin hotel. This was a complete stranger!! Dora got a call from the SPG people and ungratefully gave us a suite with a roll away bed. Why didn't she do that from the get-go?

Each time we have been unimpressed with the rooms - which are small and outdated (orange striped wallpaper, old green carpet, blue and gold upholstered chairs) - and on two visits have had ripped or very faded, mismatched furniture. When we checked in late at night ( I had called at 3:30 pm in the afternoon to confirm that we were arriving late and to please hold a room for us) we were told that the only room available was a \"handicapped access\" room which was not very nice (according to the front desk clerk) and they were sorry. They wondered why I had requested it. Of course, I hadn't. I had only made the reservation on Priceline and called in the afternoon to make sure a room was available, but had no specific request for a handicapped access room. The room was small as are all the rooms in this hotel and when we asked for two beds the clerk told us the hotel didn't have rooms with two beds- weird! Anyway, he apologized and said he couldn't do anything about it and he was very sorry. Since the hotel was full no upgrades were possible, either. We were tired so we didn't argue with him. He did offer us complimentary parking which was very nice since parking costs $35.00 a day. When we saw the room, we understood the caution: the bathroom had a very cheap hand-shower which only delivered a weak ring of water - damn near impossible to get warm or clean! And it had a huge special bathing chair which took up a great deal of space. It also had no closet and no safe and the area for hanging clothes was low so everything dragged on the ground. The bed, however, was a great Westin bed so that made up for some of the discomfort. Since this is the third time we have received what we considered a \"substandard\" room, we have decided we will never stay here again, even with the Priceline discount. We hate the lobby which has heavily chlorinated water and no place to gather. The elevators broke twice during our two day stay and the hallways and elevators themselves are not airconditioned so those areas get very hot and stuffy. Also, on Sunday morning at 8:30am we were wakened by loud drumming and music coming from an event at the lower level (near the pool) and we were up 24 floors!

The valet staff had my boyfriend retrieve his own car, going 3 levels down. Once down there, he saw that the keys of all the cars on the lower levels were just thrown on the hoods. Anyone could walk down there and steal a car. The room's floor was stained, and the sheets didn't look clean. We tried to get someone up there to clean it, but no one showed up. The room was tiny, and I mean tiny. There were four of us in the room, and we could barely move once you throw luggage into the mix. We would have taken a lost on the money and stayed elsewhere, but because it was the fourth of July weekend, we could not find another hotel.

I arrived by taxi at the front entrance in the early evening. There were no staff members in sight to assist with luggage and one must take an escalator down one level to reach the front desk. Although the hotel is noted to have an executive club level, that isn't true. There are floors set aside for Starwood Preferred members, but there is no club with the typical breakfast or evening snacks. I was given one of the Starwood Preferred rooms, which the front desk staff advised me was larger than the typical room, with more amenities. The room had a bathrobe and small refrigerator but I didn't see anything else that stood out as such. The room is somewhat dated, with numerous scrapes on the wallpaper, peeling of the paint on the bathroom door, and the pipe feeding the shower had broken loose from its attachment point. The soundproofing is not up to date and there was much noise from the nearby elevators and the traffic. The TV was an older 4:3 model Magnavox, perhaps 19 or 21\" with a fuzzy picture. The beds were comfortable enough and the HVAC unit was modern and worked properly. Internet was available through a provided ethernet cable at a daily charge. I didn't have any luck with the wireless. Getting around the hotel required some education as the elevators don't serve all the lower floors. Getting to the second floor requires going to either 3 or L and then taking the stairs or escalator. Getting to the fourth floor again requires going to 3 on the elevator, then taking the stairs to 4. There are four color-coded sets of elevators and each room is accessible from any of the elevators but it's often unclear as to where you are given the circular nature of the design. There are many restaurants but most of them looked empty or closed (though they were open) due to a lack of occupants even during lunch hour.

One thing to know is that this hotel has a mix of recently renovated and downright junky rooms. I found it really tough to rate this hotel based on how much it can vary depending on the room you stay in. So, I've tried to do with by mixing my experiences. Since this is the largest hotel in Downtown LA with over 400 rooms (unverified) and seem to always have a plethora of business, they seem to be lax on customer service at the front desk. Even if you have Platinum status, they usually don't go out of your way to ensure that you have a renovated room. So, with status or not... remember to ask in advance for a newer room, it will make all of the difference. Standard Renovated Room: On the small side, especially for the price... there really isn't much room to walk around in them due to the unique design of the building (five tube shaped buildings connected by walkways). Each rooms resembles a wedge of the tub and thus you really have most of your SQFT near the outer windows where there isn't much reason to have space. Size aside, the renovated rooms offer light modern but not flashy furniture with decent desk/work space. And of course, the heavenly bed/shower. The bathroom is decent and if you get a chance to stay in the old vs new rooms, you'll notice that they've addressed some of the awkward lighting issues found in the old bathrooms. Standard Non-Renovated: Old dark, smelly carpet and furniture. Less efficient room layout than the renovated rooms with no desk/workspace, rather an old awkwardly placed 3X3' marble table past the foot of the bed as a \"desk\". You still get the heavenly bed/shower, but overall the rooms stink and your feet stick to the floor. Heavenly Shower: If you've ever stayed at a newer Westin, the heavenly shower is usually an impressive sight. Both of the renovated and non-renovated rooms simple have a dual shower head and bowed out shower curtain which allow it to be called a \"heavenly shower\". Um... not so much. Pretty standard shower if you ask me. Restaurants: They boast over 40 restaurants/shops in the mall area from lobby to floor 5 atrium, but most of them are empty come dinner time. I never really ate in any of them because there are better options elsewhere downtown, and whenever I passed by there were only a few patrons inside (unless a convention was in town, then they'd be lucky to have a few patrons X3). The breakfast buffet is great, and the wait staff is friendly. Fitness Center: Just barely above average for the class of hotel and competition downtown, but for a \u201cWestin Workout\u201d it is sub-par. Overall this hotel just simply doesn't meet expectations of a Westin. For downtown LA it's not bad, because downtown LA is not known or great hotels, and there really aren't many to begin with but there are at least 5 other hotels that make a better option for the business or even leisure traveler.

Bathroom lighting is poor since sink is in the corner and the lights are along one side of the wall. The worse part of our stay was the Bonaventure Lounge on the 34th floor. The bar food is CRAP and very expensive. The $11 plate of french fries came straight out of the freezer into the deep fryer and not even hand cut.

The good: - Cool elevators appeared in \"true lies\" - Tacky fountains are a kid's delight - On-street parking available across the entrance. - Public parking lot across the building. - Very lively club downstairs for the active crowd. - Two-head shower is nice. The bad: - Generally old feeling of hotel - in need of an update. - Glass elevators stop right next to rooms. Close your curtains. - Not very friendly/outgoing reception staff. - Fountains in lobby/bar area are noisy. - Rather tired old bathroom. Very cramped entry area. - No free WiFi.

The hotel is a bit of a paradox. It is ranked as a 4 star hotel, and while it has potential, in most aspects seems more like a 2~3 star. I arrived fairly late and check-in went well. Took the well known hotel glass elevators (from movies \"True Lies\", \"In the Line of Fire\", etc.) up to my room on the 27th floor. The room and hallway interiors seem a little dated...they could really use a little freshening. The room itself was a little small, especially the bathroom. The only towel bar in the bath is inside the tub/shower...which has never made sense to me. Otherwise the bath was well appointed with granite counter tops, a real hair dryer, and a personal coffee maker and reasonably thick towels. The armoire that holds the TV, refrigerator, and a few drawers was falling apart from failed previous repair attempts. The wallpaper and carpets were clean but could use updating. There is a single table that could theoretically be used as a desk, but no good chair for working and no power nearby (closest required you unplug the alarm clock or lamp). And I don't understand why the alarm clock is across the room from the bed (I'd think there should be a plug behind the bed..but wasn't going to rearrange the furniture to find out). The \"Heavenly\"(tm) bedding was nice and comfortable, and I like how many hotel chains are moving to a more washable bedding ensemble. The full height windows looked out over the downtown area, and I could see the Hollywood sign from my room.

The Westin is quite proud of their fame. The question for the modern traveler...Does the fame live up to the Westin experience? The first question from many is...WHY would you stay in DOWNTOWN LA?? Downtown LA has a bad rap for being riddled with crime and homeless throngs roaming the streets. I went to school at USC just south of downtown, so I know the old reputation well. I also know that downtown LA has changed. It's the home of significant urban renewal...and renewal can't get more urban than this part of LA. The old garment district warehouses are now semi-luxury lofts. While it's no parade from the nearby Disneyland...Main Street LA is now in the overwhelming shadow of the gorgeous new Disney Music Hall. The theater complex and Museums have really taken root and make the area very enjoyable...and easily walkable which is a real treat in Los Angeles. But...about the hotel...the architecture was tres avant garde back in the day it was built. You're faced with basically 5 giant room-filled columns. From an architectural vantage, that was probably pretty cool. As a guest, it's not an age of architectural glory that you're trying to remmber. Instead, you're faced with sometimes challenging task of remembering which elevator ascends the column that will take you to your room, and if you're wrong, it may be a while before you find your heavenly bed. I read a lot of reviews about the Bonventure being dated, and I have to disagree. Our rooms were very nice. The toiletries in the bathroom were sparse, but I thought that the room was generally very nice. The trademarked Heavenly Bed was heavenly, and the decor wasn't dated at all. An odd function of the cylindrical architecture is that an elevator ran literally within an arm's reach of our windows. Noise was never a problem, but if you're not an exhibitionist, you might request a room away from the view of elevators. We didn't bother changing rooms, so read what you will into that. Finally, there's a rotating lounge and restaurant on the top floor... and it's really a must see.

The building is simply fascinating, and one cannot help but wonder how amazing it would be after a good remodelling of the rooms (and restaurants) and the installment of proper hotel management. At the same time, there are no excuses for: - rude and extremely expensive valet parking - terribly dodgy restaurants (i.e. snackbars) - duct tape everywhere to keep carpet in place - plastic disposable cups in room (instead of glasses); this is simply an example that shows the lack of TLC in the rooms - neglected pool area Hopefully this hotel will shake off its somewhat sad look and feel at some point, and fully use its potential.

We like the fact that there was an italian restaurant and a pub as part of the hotel for reasonable prices which we could go to easily as single young females. The pool is great as was the gym. In fact, it is one of the best hotel gyms I have been to for a long time. Downtown LA is probably not the best tourist destination but it is very easy to get from there to other parts of the city.

Thankfully, once I checked out of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, my vacation took an upward turn and became very enjoyable. The Bonaventure hotel caused me nothing but grief! At check in I was told that there was no room available. Then a king-sized bed became available. After much insistence, my reserved 2-bedded room miraculously appeared. A few hours later, I found out that my roommate had been placed in a separate room. Please note, that upon my arrival, I was told she had not yet checked in! Now, I was told to move my belongings to her room on a lower floor; no assistance was offered. Later, I discovered that my camera was missing. I called the front desk and was told to come down and get a new key to my old room, so I could search for my camera. Upon entering the room, I noticed that the toilet paper had been \"re-pointed\", soap replaced, and that the bathroom trash (my tissues and soap wrapper) removed but the room had remained unoccupied. Only the housekeeper had entered the room and my camera was nowhere to be found. Lost camera, I sadly returned to my room and notified security. Just as my roommate and I were about to fall asleep (2 AM), the phone rang. Scared to death, fearing bad news from home, I quickly answered the call. Thankfully, it was only hotel security, informing me that my camera had NOT been found...Could this not wait until sunrise? Next morning, securing my belongings, I called for the housekeeper. We had been told to phone, when we were leaving the room, or the room might not get made-up, as on the previous day. Around 6 o'clock the following evening (7/15/08), the fire alarm went off in our room. We called the front desk and were told that security would come up to check our alarm. Ten minutes later, when security did not arrive, I heard noises in the hallway. Upon peeking out of my door, I smelled strong smoke and saw many security men. One said to me, \"Ma'am, you'll have to evacuate the building.\" Strangely, nobody had bothered to knock on our door nor did the front desk advise us of the emergency. My roommate and I, plus a few others on our floor, were ushered by police into a hallway for evacuation. Unfortunately, the uninformed officer had placed us in a circular hallway without an escape route. Luckily, an officer was standing near the fire door and heard us banging. We were then escorted through the smokey building to an actual stairwell. We walked down the 14 flights and attended our formal banquet in our street clothes. Next morning, the alarms sounded once again. Again, we phoned the front desk for information/assistance...The phone rang and rang, never to be answered. In a few minutes, an announcement came over an in-room loud-speaker (where was it the previous night?). We were told that the situation was being investigated, to remain calm, and that we would be updated, shortly. Since we did not smell smoke, we tried to remain calm. The message repeated itself, numerous times, as we dressed and went to our Hadassah Brunch. We never received an \"all clear\" but the lobby seemed calm and quiet. This was truly the vacation from hell...And I have not even mentioned the food service; yikes...4 bagels for every 10 guests! Although I did not pay for my room (front desk comped for my troubles), the lost camera, which cost over $300, more than made up the difference. I could go on with this horrific tale but my blood pressure is going up...I will, however, mention that a microwave, as was promised, was not available during my entire stay. The good news is...NutriSystem meals are not bad at all, when eaten cold! Upon returning home, I found my camera battery charger, in my suitcase. Please inquire if the housekeeper would like to have it or has she already \"found\" a replacement charger for MY camera?!", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Italy", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "GiovanniFirenze", "ReviewID": "UR18170346", "Content": "PARKING TIP : park next door at the World Trade Center, overnight parking costs 9.90$ and you can pick up your car by 10:30 am!!!

We checked in at 2 am on June 30th, no line (of course!), the lady at the front desk told us the hotel was almost fully booked (I had a priceline res.) so she would put us in a wheelchair accessible room, right by the elevators. I knew from previous posters this is the \"standard\" priceline room, or at least is the same story they tell priceline customers. The room was larger than usual, which was a nice thing. The elevators did not bother us at all, we did not hear them, while we could clearly hear police and ambulances on Figureoa St. Everything was clean and spotless. We were located on the 25th floor, which is the first floor available to SPG members (remember to provide your SPG numer even on priceline reservations). The view was nothing special. The TV worked well. The only downside was the sink, it was leaking from both handles but we did not bother to call the front desk (we spent very little time in our room). Do yourself a favour and go to the Bonavista Lounge, the view is spectacular and worth every penny of the overpriced drinks (by US standards, by EU standards it was business as usual). The concierge desk was very helpful and directed us to a great Mexican restaurant a few blocks down on Figueroa. The front desk and security did a great job when I left my car keys in the lounge (it is closed until 6 pm), they helped me out to recover them, and in a matter of 10 minutes I was driving my car.

Besides all of the over-the-top excess this hotel offers, as just a hotel it was a very nice experience. I am a Starwood Preferred guest so the check-in line was short. This place gets a lot of tourists and groups so the basic check-in desk can get crowded For some reason their computer for coding your room cards was down so a bell boy escorted me to my room and said an active card would be delivered ASAP. I unloaded my 'stuff' went to the bar and pool and went to the concierge upon my return and got a new cardkey. Upon returning to my room another cardkey was under my door. For anyone who has never been here, the hotel consists of five circular glass towers. The first five floors are a shopping mall of boutiques, gift shops, and any type of food you can imagine, from fine sit-down, to quick take-away. This entire area is an open atrium of lakes, fountains, plants, trees, all done in an unfinished concrete style. Very nice and tranquil. Many seating areas, some open and some tucked away. There's a large open bar that wraps around a bit where you can people watch; and also another large bar/pub (Bonaventure Brewing Company) area a few levels up which opens up to an outdoor seating & patio area which also leads to the pool where you get a magnificient view of the hotel towers and a great deal of LA. All the way up to I believe the 35th floor of the central tower is a revolving bar coupled with a restaurant on the adjacent floor. Amazing views of miles of LA in all directions. As far as the hotel proper goes, all of the elevators are clear glass on the outside spines of each tower. If you have fear of heights just face inwards. They offer a fun experience and when you lower down to the fifth floor you 'go through' the roof into the glass covered atrium of the shopping arcade. It sounds like Disneyland, and almost is, but it's easy to find your way around. Just remember everything is circularly rounded, there are no straight corriders. The room I had was their standard room which I found very comparable to any other reputable major chain. There are some odd angles but nothing to write home about. They offer full room service well into the early morning, but with so many options available just a few floors below, save your money. Also a buffet breakfast is included but I slept in instead.

When we arrived late, I quickly checked in and did not use their $42 valet parking service. Instead I chose to park it myself across the street at the world trade center. The parking was only $9.90 with no in/out privileges if you arrive before 10 AM or after 4:30 PM and you could park for 24 hours until the regular rates kick in. This was fine with us since we only use the garage for over night parking. The hotel even has a walkway that connects the world trade center parking garage. Just take the elevator to the 1st floor and follow the sign to the Westin hotel, take the escalator to the 2nd floor and take the walkway to the hotel, which will get you to the sixth floor of the hotel. You will then need to go down a spiral staircase to the 5th floor to take the elevator to the room. It is inconvenient, but I am OK with a little inconvenience to save over $32 per night. The hotel has 4 sections (blue, orange, yellow, red) where the rooms are located. All the section are connected, it is designed like a rotary. So, if you go up the wrong color elevator, just follow the signs to the center and go around until you see the color you want. Each section of the hotel is shape like a cylinder, which is probably the reason the rooms are shaped like slice of pizza. The rooms are small and shaped funny that in order to open the refrigerator, I have to push the chair to the desk all the way in or remove it to be able to use the refrigerator. The room that we were first assigned had a stains on the carpet and seems dirty. We had a connecting room to a family that was so noisy that we had to request another room. The carpet in the second room was also stained and dirty, but at least it was quiet. The room has the air vent about a foot above the headboard, which I did not like. The bathroom sink was situated far in the corner, which makes it hard for our family to use the sink being only 5 feet and under. The edge of the sink was about 6 inches away from the edge. The shower had 2 shower heads side by side. We were on the 19th floor and had a nice view of the city. There were lots of shops and restaurants from fast food to high price restaurants.

As another reviewer mentioned, the staff is very nice---the bartenders in the lobby bar were great and the one night we went to the revolving bar, the lone waitress was very sweet and attentive.

The Bonaventure Brewing Company was closed for the first few days we were there due to a kitchen fire---not their fault, but just contributed to the feeling that while the seems to be lots going on in the hotel, there really isn't.

I paid $100/night the first time and $90/night this time. The major reason I didnt want to stay there was because the parking is $42.00/night, which is practically paying for another HOTEL ROOM at cheaper place. LOL TIP #1: PARKING - the Marriott hotel is right across the street and their nightly parking is only $16.50. Go there and tell them you want to use their valet but that you're stayin at the Westin. They will make you pay up front. Please keep up with all your receipts so that you can always validate that you paid. Its a short walk across the street. TIP #2: BECOME A STARWOODS MEMBER - If you become a Starwoods Member, you can get an upgrade to a suite (when available). TIP #3: DON'T EAT HERE - the hotel Breakfast buffet is EXPENSIVE without a cause. The food was SUBPAR! Save your money and go to McDonalds or Denny's which is several blocks up the street! TIP #4: INTERNET - The 24-hour internet Wi-Fi charge is $12.99. Either bring your own Wireless Broadband or go to Starbucks down the street. Don't try to use the phone in the room for dial-up. I almost got hit with a $60 phone charge because I didnt know they charged you PER minute PER call. The beds are some of the best around...they feel GREAT!!! The room was always clean and there is a mini-frig to keep your items cold. They have convenience stores in the building and its a nice hotel with easy access to major freeways. The service is pretty good - the only other bad thing was the ELEVATORS.

I will be the first to admit that John Portman architecture takes some getting used to, but I have grown accustomed to both the building and the location. That said, the Westin Bonaventure (a franchise hotel) is definitely not \"On Brand\". I find that the customer service is uneven and more focused on tourists than frequent business travelers. Maybe its a silly detail, but I was shocked to see that all glassware in the room was universally replaced with individually wrapped plastic cups (a la Motel 6). This is NOT the Westin, I thought. The smallish pie-shaped rooms are actually very nice and cozy if you get one of the recently renovated spaces. The furniture is more to scale and they offer a decent workspace and desk chair. Older rooms are impossible to work in. Unfortunately, they only renovated two floors and haven't made any new progress in 2 years or more. Even the renovated rooms have old style TVs rather than flat screens, which would open up even more space. Note to someone on the technical staff: PLEASE fix the wireless broadband service! It cuts in and out in every room every time. It is constant as the seasons and much more infuriating. Kudos to the gym. It is one of the finest free hotel workout facilities I have ever used and I make the most of it. The parking fees are OUTRAGEOUS! $42 for overnight parking in a city that turns into a Ghost Town after 5pm?? The Marriott across the street charges about $16.50 a night to park (and yes, they will let you park there even if you are a guest of the Westin). This is sheer extortion and its insulting.

However, as the years go by it is moving from being dated to retro and therefore somewhat trendy again. I've stayed here on a few business trips, and it takes a while to work out your way around the lobby (no straight lines) the four banks of elevators, the various shops and restaurants and so on. But it's a fun place and more interesting than your normal hotel block. The rooms are much like any other standard hotel business room, although they are wedge-shaped due to being set around the edge of a circular tower. Mine was a standard room with a large comfortable bed, a desk, TV and bathroom. The room has been refurbished, but some of the equipment in there (TV, ironing board) is pretty old. There is a fridge, but it's empty. The bathroom wasn't huge, but plenty big enough, and the room has the Westin double shower head, which is a great shower (although I did hear one guest complaining about wasting water as they were checking out). As a Starwood Gold member, I got free breakfast and free internet as part of the package. During the week, the internet voucher code I was given stopped working and I was told to buy a connection and they would take it off my bill. Needless to say, when the bill arrived the charge was still on there - a detail, but an irritating one. Also, due to various logistics my 7-night stay was booked in two reservations, one for three nights and the other for four. When I checked in, I was told that I could stay in the same room for all seven nights, but I had to call back into reception after the first stay was over to 're-check' in, give them my credit card details again, get my breakfast vouchers for the second stay etc. This seemed a bit odd as I was surprised that their check-in system couldn't cope with consecutive reservations. The breakfast staff aren't the most efficient ever, and people were frequently kept waiting for tables when I was down at breakfast. This seems to be a common theme in LA as while I was there, we encountered quite a few cases of inefficient waiters - much more so than other places in the US. Not sure if this is a trend or we were just unlucky. The breakfast buffet is good though as there's a wide choice of both hot and cold food. Even though many other people have mentioned it, the parking charges do seem high. I know it's a major city, but $42 per night? It has gone up considerably in recent years; about 4 years ago when I was there, it was $28 - and that seemed expensive then. I didn't actually have a car, so didn't feel ripped off by the parking charges, and the free breakfast and internet as a gold member meant that i got a pretty good deal overall. I think the breakfast buffet was $22, and internet $12.95 for 24 hours so you may need to factor these costs in. There's a well-equipped gym and two floors with various shops and restaurants in, plus other eating places within walking distance. It's a good location in downtown LA if you need to be in that area. There are other hotels around that offer a similar level of service, but go for the Westin if you want to marvel at the concrete design, lobby fountains, glass external elevators and other features of its 70s heritage.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurndale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooms, Rude Front Desk personnel\u201d", "Author": "Danarenaeb", "ReviewID": "UR14565606", "Content": "My husband and I were on our honeymoon.

It was built to be architecturally interesting and decades later, it still is. Just don't expect cookie cutter design. Clearly those that have had a problem with the 70's look to the architecture in the lobby areas (lots of concrete here) just want this Westin to be like all the others. The Bonaventure is a very interesting place if you look at it that way. Yes, this hotel was built in the 70's and was pretty bold in its design during that time. As noted in other reviews, the rooms are smaller by U.S. standards. They are pie wedge-shaped and the bathrooms are sufficient, but on the small side. Who wants to spend all their time in L.A. in the bathroom, anyhow? I had noticed that furnishings were getting a bit worn, but voila ... the last two times I've stayed here I've been put in one of their newly renovated rooms (see photos). The renovations and new furnishings are quite tasteful and make better use of the room's space. The desk is a great addition ... clearly a nod to the fact that hotel rooms are more like offices on the road for many more of us now, than when the hotel first opened. Colors are in the earth tones and the rooms are accented by some nice vintage photographs of L.A. There's new carpeting in the rooms with a modern design, set on the diagonal, which probably helps make the room look bigger. Every time I stay here, I eat dinner down in the lobby bar and, in general, I've been pretty pleased with my meals there. The halibut and chips is pretty decent. Plus, it is fun to people watch from that location. There are a couple of items that I feel compelled to nit-pick, even after the renovations: (1) My renovated rooms still had big, black, tube TVs. Surely they will replace them with flat-screen LCDs ... but then again, there's a new swivel stand beneath those black bulky dinosaurs, so that may not be in the works. Drat!; (2) The bedside tables are kind of built-in (or made to look like they are built-in) to the headboard surround and there are no electrical outlets bedside. You can move the bedside table and reach into the wall (or at least into the headboard surround ... see photo) and find an outlet there, but this is really poorly designed.

It is like no other Westin I have ever stayed in. We stayed here for seven nights for a conference. It is true that the hotel is located in the Financial district and the streets roll up after 4:00 and there is nothing to do unless you take a $60.00 taxi ride out of the area. The hotel is set up in the \"colored tower\" system and you get placed in one. You can get to any other tower from the one you are staying in, but if you want to get to an elevater to get to your room, that can be tricky. If you are on the first through the sixth floor you need to be on an odd numbered floor to get an elevator to your room; it is the wierdest thing I have ever seen in a hotel. If you want to go to dinner at the steak house on the top floor and overlook the city, you need to go to the red tower; it is the only elevator to take you there. You might want to bring dinner with you though, it took 20 minutes to even get a waitress to walk by to tell us she would be with us in a minute; we just wanted drinks and dessert; we walked out. The rooms can be small and we had one of the smaller rooms; two double beds up against the wall and the windows. With four people you will tripping over yourselves trying to move around. The shower dripped the entire time we were there even with three calls to the front desk. WE didn't HAVE ANY HEAT in our room the entire time we were there. I called for service five times. I finally stopped the service guy in the hall because he was working on the connecting unit next door. The heat worked for about an hour and then was blowing cold (in mean air conditioner cold) air the rest of the time. I did again tell them on checkout and got an \"I'm sorry\" from the clerk. I bought a new pair of slippers for the trip for the room; when I left, from the room only, they were black on the bottom; YUK. There is only one small outdoor pool and no jacuzzi anywhere in the hotel. You have to pay for internet service and to use the workout room. The downstairs bar and restaurant(s) are terrible and over priced. A child's order of pancakes from room service was $13.00 (tax, tip, delivery incl.). We did go to the garment district shopping. If you take the bus it is at 7th and Figeuroia and it is the E DASH bus. It only costs a quarter but the bus is always full and everyone pushes and shoves to get on it; it is the primary transportation system for the Hispanic population in LA and the bus driver was not fluent in Enlgish to help get off at the right stop; get a map from the hotel before you go. A taxi is $8.00 one way. The American Girl doll store is also located in LA; there are only four in the US and one is here. My girls loved the store and we took a doll home. It is about a 25 minute cab ride without heavy traffic from the hotel. The cab is cheaper from the hotel to the store than the cost for the ride back. You can take the metro bus 316 express but its a few blocks walk etiher way and not recommended at night.

He had read and heard that Westin is a very nice hotel. I have stayed at a few myself and have loved them all. He picked this one because it is in the center of downtown L.A. and thought the atmosphere would be good. I had nothing to do with the planning (it was all a surprise) so seeing his disappointment broke my heart! We were only staying one night because it wasn't far from home and because they are so expensive. He reserved a room one price level down from a suite, so he was expecting much more than we got. When we arrived they were doing some kind of remodel on the fountain so the smell of paint was everywhere. It also was a bit of an eyesore. My boyfriend was excited because he thought we had a really good view of the city in our room. However, when we arrived at our room it looked out across a street, nothing like what he was told. The room was big, it had a living room and a separate bedroom. But on the hotel's website it showed flat screen t.v.'s in every room. We had 2 20 inch regular t.v.'s, nothing like what the website said. Also, the bar area was old and paint was chipping off it. Maybe our standards are too high, but the little things do make a difference. Anyhow, we ordered room service which was pretty good and then went out for the night. My boyfriend surprised me with Cirque du Soleil tickets! The next morning we awoke and went downstairs to eat breakfast, which my boyfriend had bought a package for. However, when we arrived and gave the breakfast coupon to the waitress we were told it was only good for one person. We were told when we checked in that it would be good for 2 people. I was very upset at this point because of all the money and thought my boyfriend had put into this so I went to the front desk to ask why we were told one thing and now were being told another. They told me that when my boyfriend bought the package he bought he didn't put down that there was 2 of us. However, the package says a continentel breakfast for 2. They wanted to charge us an extra $20 for another coupon. I was irate at this point and almost in tears so I stormed back to the restaurant and was just going to order from the menu and pay the extra money. The only good thing about this hotel was the waiter who felt so bad for us that he bought my breakfast for me! I was very grateful to him.

I had to reject the first room I was offered because of the strong mildew / sweat and faint smoke smell that pervaded it. The second room smelled strongly of something I could not place, but wasn't as offensive so I kept it. Other than the room, I was not pleased with the fact that spa charges and charges at most restaurants on the 4th - 6th floors of the hotel could not be made to the room, and had to be settled via credit card at the time of the transaction. On business, this makes for lots of little bills to add up. (That said, the massage I received at the Spa was tremendous, although the spa facilities / procedures are a bit strange. I don't know the last time I had a spa hand me disposable underwear, for example.) Parking was expensive as others have noted, but the valets did a good job getting the car pulled up and ready with a phone call in advance. I did not use the pool, as getting to the pool area required a walk through the food court and out across the terrace. If there were pool-side changing / bathroom facilities, I did not spot them. I may be forced to stay there again, as the location is too central to my business activities in LA across the street. If it were not for the Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bath, though, I would not even consider doing that much, and would walk several blocks from a better hotel.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san antonio, tx", "Title": "\u201cwonderful convention hotel in downtown los angeles\u201d", "Author": "trinity-tiger", "ReviewID": "UR8665082", "Content": "i attended a very lare conference (3700 people) held at this hotel - the rooms are tip top - the adjoining galleria with shops and restaurants was handy - the food at these restraurants was less expensive than those owned by the hotel - the meeting rooms were wonderful - the main ballroom, the california ballroom, was large enough to accomodate most of the attendees for the main saturday night event - only a few had to go to the overflow area in the santa barbara ballroom - the pool deck was nice i would recommedn this hotel for anyone, especially those who are organizing a convention for more than 2000 people", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Beds but Noisy!\u201d", "Author": "snorklewoman", "ReviewID": "UR8588751", "Content": "The Bonaventure was offering a great rate this summer and the \"heavenly\" bed and the view with the floor to ceiling windows were spectacular.

Check-in was quick and the staff was exceedingly accommodating. I gave them my SPG number at check-in, knowing that it wouldn\u2019t get me points for my stay, but would, as others have noted, get me an upgraded SPG room. Judith moved us from a queen room to a king room on an upper floor and was eager to meet any needs we might have. The lobby is typical John Portman concrete circle madness and was enough to confuse a seasoned plan reader. The staff was very helpful in pointing out the specific elevator bank we needed of the multiple sets on the first floor. Though some described the space as dated, I didn\u2019t find it to be shabby \u2013 just dated in it\u2019s styling, in my opinion. Being from Atlanta, I can say that Portman was always ahead of the curve initially, but his designs become outdated very quickly. Our room was clean and simple with a great view of LA. The bathroom was small and strangely shaped, but was adequate for the two of us. The SPG rooms come with a free large bottled water and a refrigerator. On our first night, we went to the 4th floor looking for dining options \u2013 none of which were described in any of the literature in the room. We found one tired restaurant after another as we walked the perimeter of the floor. We tried our luck on the 6th floor, without further success and finally decided to go back to the room and order room service. When we got back to our room, I picked up the cordless phone next to the bed to call Room Service, but the phone was dead. After some scrambling around under the bed, we found the phone base to be unplugged. I went back down to the front desk, as they had been so helpful before, to inquire about ordering another way. The front desk staff was helpful and apologetic and insisted on compensating the room service charges, which went a long way to alleviating my frustration. Room service was fine, but not phenomenal. The location is nice \u2013 not exactly in the heart of tourist LA, but close to a few downtown attractions and a simple on/off from the CA-110. We ate at Caf\u00e9 Pinot one night, which was nice, but not exceptional. Internet access carries a $13/day charge and the valet parking is another $35/night.

His attitude was very condescending and racist, the food portions were extremely small and overpriced (we paid $100 for two people and were still extremely hungry afterwards). On top of his awful attitude he quietly slipped himself a 20% tip without telling us (in fact he would not even hand us the itemized receipt to look at, he just asked directly for our credit card), so when we unknowingly added gratuity to the final credit card receipt and a few minutes later went back to him asking him to remove the extra gratuity since we had not been able to check the itemized bill earlier, he got extremely angry and offensive, and called us all kinds of expletives in a foreign language.

At a shocking seven feet, the ceiling height increased the sense of claustrophobia any guest to this room is likely to have.

Other hotels in LA provide complimentary internet access (The Belamar in Manhattan Beach), so why can't the Westin? Instead it seems they are into nickel-and-diming their customers.

The valet parking was a disaster. In addition to costing $35 per night, they routinely parked our car off-site, meaning that we had to wait 20-30 minutes after trekking to the garage for our vehicle. The front desk service was poor. Our folio showed a balance of $300 notwithstanding that we had provided our Aeroplan certificates at check-in. I called the front desk and was promised a return telephone call, which never came. Eventually, I trekked down and had the issue resolved but wasted 30-40 minutes correcting the hotel's error. The Bonaventure Club spa is not a Westin spa. Though the massage I had was very good, the spa was weirdly appointed. It was a cross between a golf club and a Roman spa. Very strange. The concierge did give me a $10 gift certificate when I called down looking for a spa menu. Our room rate was $156, which is probably not bad for downtown L.A. That being said, I'm unlikely to stay at the Bonaventure again.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cOk for the money we paid\u201d", "Author": "max3743", "ReviewID": "UR8117682", "Content": "Booked hotel on Price Line.

Bit of a downer after staying in lux conditions. Arriving at the Westin was a little painful. The valet parking in underground and the signage was very poor. After cirlcling the block 2 times, finally made it down. You have to take a series of elevators to get to the lobby from the garage level. Check-in was very smooth. They offered warm cookies and pink lemonade to all new guests. The lobby area was a bit of an oasys with vegetation and water all around. The center bar area looked like a nice spot to grab a drink. The 2 levels above the lobby were shopping areas which give it a mall type feel... I got a room on the 30th floor of the yellow tower with an east facing view. the view was excellent. The room left something to be desired esp after the FS stay. The bathroom was small. The fixtures were dated and bathtub slightly discolored. there were some stray hairs on the bathrrom floor when I first walked in... I'm not too disgusted by this but others may be. The room itself was very small, just enough room for the bed, TV, and a small table. The lighting fixtures were almost dangling and in need of repair. The carpet was stained in areas. The best part of the room was the bed, which was indeed Heavenly. The sheets were also very nice. Beware, there is a ledge behind your head on the bed. If you're not careful, you can bang the back of your head on it's edge... There was options for both wireless and wired internet in the room. That was very convenient. The things that annoyed me most about the Westin was not being able to contact Valet to retrieve my car. At $35/day, pick up the phone!!! I never got through to them so had to go down and go through the motions. I had to wait ~30min because they couldn't find the car... The gym facility was nice and open 24hours. Not like I'm gonna work out at 2am, but good to know it's open. All in all, the hotel was just ok. It was what I expected. best of all, it was 2 blocks from my meeting. I would only stay here again given similar circumstances. Privacy Alert: The cylindrical nature of the towers means that some rooms face others. I had the nice treat of catching 2 lovebirds in their morning mating ritual in another tower. It went well with my coffee and muffin.

I have a good understanding of hotels all over the world, the different chains and what level of services they offer.

After making my online reservations, I requested a credit card authorization for be faxed to me to cover the room charges in advance, as not to inconvenience my travelers. After numerous calls to the Westin Bonaventure with no response, I emailed the Starwood corporate customer service to request this basic, generic form. It took 10 business days for corporate to even respond. I was shocked that their answer was for me to tell them which hotel I was referring to (which was stated in my email) and that they'd be glad to give me the hotel's phone number.?. Talk about a useless response and a waste of my time. I called the hotel again directly and got an accounting person who finally faxed me the form. I emailed to advise that this form was to cover multiple rooms for multiple guests and was assured that they'd notate each account... this (of course) didn't happen and they made my attendees use their personal credit cards to secure the rooms, saying there was no credit card authorization on file??? Come to find out- they got the form, and put it in one of my employees file and that was it. So the rest of my employees' rooms were left \"unpaid\" despite the Westin already having the payment. I had two employees call me in a panic because the front desk / reservations people weren't allowing my employees to check in (on their arrival date) or check out (on their departure date) saying the rooms hadn't been paid for. It was a fiasco from start to finish. Booking hotel accommodations isn't brain surgery. A hotel's employees should be able to follow it's own policies and procedures without me having to constantly be in contact with them from across the country. Bottom line- I got nothing but hollow excuses and absolutely no service what so ever from corporate.

The hotel is right in the heart of downtown Los Angeles which, as other reviewers have pointed out, can be remarkably devoid of life after business hours and on the weekends. The architecture is indeed very unique, and as I'm from Detroit originally it feels a little bit bizarre to spend nights in a hotel that seems to be a quarter to half size clone of the downtown Detroit's Renaissance Center. It'll probably take a new visitor a day to get accustomed to how things are laid out. On the reception level, there's a cafe on the main floor, as well as a bar hugging the center core of the building. The 3rd floor has a pretty complete gym and they've turned the area around the center core into a running track, complete with exercise equipment in overhanging pods. I'm sure the architect would be spinning in his grave if he saw this, but it's nice payback to what he's forcing hotel guests to go through. The fourth floor has nifty shops and restaurants which make nice alternatives to the expensive hotel restaurants, but the fourth floor is inaccessible from the guest room elevators. You'll need to take an escalator or go up one of the spiral staircases to get up there. Our package came with a choice of breakfast buffet or room service. We opted for the buffet both mornings we were there. They had made-to-order omelets, scrambled eggs, different kinds of hot meats, plates of cold cuts, little boxes of cereal, cut up fruit, bread and pastries. Our \"upgraded\" \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" room was pretty small, but I was very thankful that the air con/heater unit had a nice loud fan, which helps me to sleep. Along with a complimentary bottle of water, there was also a fridge in our room (other reviews point out that SPG rooms have the fridge), where I was able to store some of the perishables we bought on the 4th floor's \"French Market\" (they sell cheeses, bottles of wine and soft drinks, and other assorted foods and collectable knickknacks).

It is about a 10 minute walk to the Metro 7th Street Station, where you can catch the subway/lightrail to Hollywood and other locales without a car.

The Visitor Center is also located very close by, and the library is 5 minutes by foot and you can use free Internet for 15 minutes without having to register or anything. Walk up the steps (or if you are really tired, take the escalator) of Bunker Hill, and then find the guideposts for a walking tour of the area. We enjoyed the hotel because of its location and comfort. We didn't use any business services, but I did see the business center and it seemed useable. The room service menu or breakfast delivery is a bit expensive. Each morning there is a breakfast buffet for something like $25. Save some money and go across the street to the Undeground Mall and you can find a McDonalds and 4 other little quick service restaurants that can get you a great morning breakfast for under $8 a person including coffee.

The location dowtown is convenient to freeways and pretty central if you need access to several parts of the city. But you should absolutely know that parking is valet-only in an underground garage, and the hotel charges guests $35 a night to park here. When you enter, the lobby is impressive in a \"Secret of My Success \" (80s Michael J. Fox movie) sort of way.

The rooms are very small, but typical city hotel room size. Decor is dated, but the room was clean and pleasant. I had a room on the 28th floor, and the view was spectacular. It really made the room. Signature Westin Heavenly bed is here, but I was disappointed. It seemed really firm, and I didn't sleep well. Bathroom was clean and re-furbished, and nothing was too scary about the room or bath. My biggest complaint is that for such a large hotel, it really lacks any good fast and healthy food options on-site. I did realize on my last day, though, that there is a walkway that connects the hotel to a little strip mall with a Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Chipotle and some other choices that are waaaaaay better than the choices you'll find inside.

So if you're looking for a decent place to stay for under $150, this place beats most of your other options in that price range.

Could hear one of the hotel's trademark outside evalators from within the bathroom, but not in the bedroom fortunately. Enjoyed my stay then and thoroughly enjoyed my return visit. Judging by the carpets, the place has been refurbished recently. Bedroom was large in my opinion, with plenty of space around the king-size bed. The famous \"Heavenly Bed\" was just that. Temperatures rose outside while I was there, so I had cause to use the air con. This was very quiet...the quietest I've ever experienced in a hotel...so kept the room chilled at night, but without disturbing my sleep. Bathroom was a good size too and the double-headed shower was a bonus. Clever idea that delivered a great shower experience. I was on an SPG floor, so not sure if the wide range of bathroom products is normal. Impressed to find not only a toothbrush but a small tube of Colgate toothpaste and a small canister of shaving foam. If I had one negative comment to make, it would be that the bathroom could have benefitted from one more light above the sink, but that's a personal perference matter. Minibar was really only an empty fridge, in which I put my SPG complementary bottle of water. Used the wireless internet connection which cost \u20ac13 per day. The system did suffer from some reliability problems. Every now and again, the connection would be lost altogether, but would either correct itself within seconds or, if it didn't, I was able to \"repair\" the connection quickly from my laptop without any problems. It was only a minor inconvenience....\"niggling\" more than annoying. I ate breakfast in the atrium poolside restaurant. Wide choice, piping hot food and beverages and a chef on duty to prepare eggs and omlettes. The $20 buffet was good value, when compared to ordering off the a la carte menu. Friendly wait staff too, although the one on the first day did slip in a pre-filled out feedback form with my bill, that needless-to-say gave her a glowing rating. I would have marked her highly anyway, but it was still a bit cheeky. I also had a meal one evening in the lobby bar area. Not a wide choice from the bar menu, but good value and very tasty. Hotel is on the edge of the downtown area. I wanted to be close to the opera house and it was just a 10/15 minute walk (uphill). Superb fish restaurant (McCormick and Schmick's) around the corner, at the top of a staircase feature (Bunker Hill Steps) on 5th Street.

I'm also a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold member. The conference rate was $130/night and because of my elite SPG status I was upgraded to a \"tower suite\" in the Green tower. The two rooms and 1-1/2 baths were probably created from two original individual rooms, which by themselves would have been quite small. The room was very nice with Westin's \"modern\" furnishings and, of course, the Heavenly Bed, which is truly fabulous. I had two televisions--one each in the bedroom and living room. Everything was clean and well-maintained. Broadband internet in the room was via wireless or direct Ethernet connection. The Bonaventure is a product of John Portman, who loved atriums, fountains and pools in the lobby, and it's very 1970's. Lots of concrete contribute to a rather sterile feel--sort of like the outside brought inside. The Westin, of course, really can't do much about the dated design short of destroying the building. The arrangement of separate towers clustered around a central core makes for a rather confusing layout. You're OK once you've figured out the color-coding and which floors don't have elevator service. If you want a more \"intimate\" or \"classic\" feel to your hotel experience, don't stay at the Bonaventure. Dining options either in the hotel or downtown area are either very cheap or expensive. The Bonaventure has LA Prime Steakhouse which is as pricey as any national chain steakhouse (Morton's, Ruth Chris, etc.). A \"food court\" has several fast food venues (Chinese, Korean, pizza, etc) at which you can get something for $5.00. The Bonaventure Brewing Company is available for \"moderate\" prices. I didn't try it, so I can't comment on quality or value. Just around the corner and within steps of the Westin is Cafe Pinot, one of Joachim Splichal's restaurants. Wonderful \"cutting edge\" cuisine with entree prices in the upper $20's. My partner and I went there and it was truly worth every dollar! The fitness center at the Bonaventure is great! Contrary to a few previous reviews, I thought the equipment was very up to date and well maintained. Cardiotheater is available at every station. Access is available anytime with a room key, and there is no charge! There's also an indoor track with a special running surface that encircles the central tower on the same floor as the fitness center. You would feel like a hampster after going around the short circuit more than a few times. The lighted heated outdoor pool may be just short of twenty feet in length and is quite adequate for lap swimming. This is also available anytime. The water is clean and clear.

The air blowed right over my bed so every morning I woke up with a stiff neck.

One tip, the bar near the pool, it only has local beer and not to our taste... on the 2nd night we discovered the off licence, bought bottles of beer for 1 dollar and sat outside in the patio area, everyone else seemed to be doing it as well. Beer much cheaper that the bar prices. Meet lots of flight attendances and pilots, nice to get chatting to them and here of their experiences. Taxis are reasonalbe, went to Universal Studios & Paramont Studios. Walked down Hollwood Blvd and the Walk of Fame. Hollywood was fab!

The location was away from some tourist attractions, it is hard to stay anywhere really convenient the city is pretty spread out. The freeway is right by the hotel so it took less than an hour to get to the places we needed to go.

I have stayed at a number of hotels that have been poorly reviewed on this site and never had a bad experience at any of the ones I've ended up staying at. As for the Westin Bonaventure, for $60-$70 per night, this place is awesome. Yes, the parking is high, but with a priceline rate, you're still staying in downtown LA for under $100/night. That's pretty good. One warning--be careful if you check in late. The Westin garage is full every night and if you are not a hotel guest who has managed to get in earlier in the day, they will send you across the street to park, which is $50/night. Try to get there early or pick your rental car up when you can park it early in the day. Once you get your car registered with them, you can get in even if the sign says the garage is full. Yes, the rooms are a bit on the small side, but for a couple, this poses no issues--at least not for us. The rooms are well appointed, and the bath was bigger than the larger Westin room we stayed in out at the airport before we left. We had a room on the 30th floor with fabulous views, great air conditioning and a heavenly bed! Housekeeping was great, and everyone we dealt with was courteous. The location is totally convenient--a good section of downtown with super-easy freeway access. Room service was surprisingly good, the brew pub had decent food, though service was a bit slow, and there are a ton of food options to choose from in the area, so you aren't stuck with hotel priced meals. It's a walkable area, at least during the day and early evening. The pool is fine, with big fluffy Westin towels, but keep in mind it is a \"rooftop\" pool and a bit on the small side. Also, wear your flip-flops--the concrete gets hot and is pretty sooty from being 5 stories above downtown and near a freeway. Not a luxurious pool by any means, but kind of cool to lay out and look up at the surrounding skyscrapers. We had quick and easy check-in and out, and while our experience with the concierge wasn't the warmest, he was efficient and courteous. This hotel is enormous and busy--I'm sure they do their best. Bottom line, the hotel is convenient, more than comfortable, and if you get a decent rate, you should have no cause for complaint. in addition, this hotel has been in a ton of movies, so you'll probably recognize it.

We then get to the room they gave us and the floor is soaking wet from a leak in the bathroom. We call down to the front desk and let them know about the problem and they send someone to look at the wall and floor and they end up needing to move us to another room, that is ok not a problem but when they go to move us they call up to our room and tell us a manager is on the way with new keys to take us to our room, a bell boy shows up 45 minutes later and requests the old keys then gives me the new ones and walks away. I ask were is the new room located and what is the new room number and he replies i dont know call the front desk. as he walks on to the elevator.

We had our appatizer and our empty bottles of watter and wine left on our table the entire dinner, they even went as far as to empty our wine into the water glass and not even notice they had mixed the water and wine together. The next day we get woke up at 7 am to the punding sound of hammers and drill guns, they are replacing all the air conditioning units on our floor and our new room is leeking like the 1st one was.

The hotel is clean and professionally operated (with the exception of when we opened our night stand drawer and found a wrapped condom there, obviously the previous inhabitant of that room had stashed it there and housekeeping failed to open and check the drawer). The rooms are small by Westin standards, the unique design of a rounded building actually takes away square footage from the room layout, so it's a bit cramped for more than one person in a standard room, and if you have three (like we did with my teenage daughter) it gets downright packed! Like all big city hotels, the Bonaventure offers an overpriced restaurant and cocktail lounge. However, they also have a \"food court\" level (level 4 of the complex) with some small \"mom & pop\" type sandwich shops and a couple of restaurants not operated by the Westin. This is where the trouble comes in. One of the restaurants is called the \"Bonaventure Brewing Co.\". This place is simply AWFUL and you should avoid it at all costs. Just by their name, you would possibly assume they are indeed part of the hotel's management, but they're not. I entertained a party of 6 last weekend. They sat us in an area where the overhead fan wasn't working, and offered to \"open a window\". What was ironic, the room was practically empty (perhaps that should have given us our first clue), and they could have set up a table under a fan that did work, but this didn't occur to them. We ordered, and after about 10 minutes, our server returned to inform two of my guests that the kitchen didn't have what they ordered and they'll have to order something else. No apology, just a flat statement of tell me what you want instead. The food was not bad, but certainly nothing to rave about. It was like pulling teeth to get our server to return to the table to re-fill water glasses, etc. The final insult was when the check arrived, they INCLUDED a 18% tip. I've heard of places stating how they do this to parties of 10 or more, I've even heard it for parties of 8 or more, but NEVER to parties of 6. I think the server may have heard some early complaining from our table over the broken fan business and thought his tip was in jeapordy (which, given the lack of service we got, it certainly WAS).

When I\u2019m in downtown LA, I prefer to stay at the Omni because it\u2019s a classy yet affordable hotel with great perks for its preferred guests. But I thought I\u2019d give the Bonaventure a try, given its illustrious history and solid reputation. From the outside, the Westin is quite impressive. The architecture is still futuristic to this day and I can see why many movies have been filmed there. The lobby area is like a cross between an airport terminal, mall and Vegas hotel lobby. It\u2019s large and bustling like an airport terminal, has several food courts and shops like a shopping mall, and features ponds and fountains that resemble a half-hearted version of the Bellagio\u2019s atrium. Check-in was a breeze and valet parking was prompt as well. The $25-plus-tip-cost for valet is typical of most downtown LA hotels. The famous Bonaventure elevators are definitely the best feature of this hotel. The elevators are speedy and offer great views of downtown LA. Depending on which elevator you take, you\u2019ll get a unique but equally breathtaking vista. The rooms, however, are a different story. Despite the modern outside appearance of the hotel, the drab interiors show its age. Each room\u2019s spectacular views make up for the tight space, but the bigger problems are the peeling wallpaper, crumbling ceiling corners and worn furniture. The air vents were quite noisy, as were the neighbor\u2019s water pipes, which we heard at all hours of the night. The bathroom was also a major problem \u2013 when we first turned on the sink tap, BROWN WATER came out of the faucet! The bathtub didn\u2019t drain properly and we were ankle-deep during showers. The water temperature was very volatile, constantly changing back and forth from very hot to very cold, and the towels were stained. A fine layer of dust covered the counters and coffee maker. Keep in mind that this room was on the Preferred Guest floor, but it looked no different from the 21st floor room that we had originally been given. Although the hotels boast many stores and restaurants, I found that most of them had closed permanently or by 8 p.m., which was when we wanted to eat. The stores also seemed a bit cramped and like they carried old merchandise \u2013 think Chinatown. The gym was all right. If you\u2019re brave, you can exercise using the machines right outside the elevator that are actually in the \u201challway\u201d and overlook the lobby atrium. There is also a workout facility in an enclosed room on the 3rd floor, with individual screens for each cardio machine, towels and water. The pool is small and at an odd location on the fourth floor.

First, the service is great. I'm in the medical field so I don't get perks like business people. So, try to get a good deal on priceline. Shoot for $65-ish for weekdays. Little touches like the Hotel Operator greeting you by your name on the phone was very nice. The hotel has a lot of choices on food. Most open until 8pm-ish but I can tell that they make most of their business during lunchtime with all the LA downtown business workers strolling in. I ate most of my lunches in the hotel and only 1 dinner on the top floor Japanese restaurant. The japanese restaurant was overpriced and didn't have much of a selection...but the service was excellent. Gym: Those little 'pods' off of the track displayed on Expedia/Orbitz, etc aren't the only machines. There's a separate room with more machines and free weights. The running machines had TVs. Towels and disposable headphones are supplied. Free weights are good but only went up to 50lbs. No bench press. Internet: High speed is offered for $12.95/day. Easy to use. Parking: $25/day. The parking staff is probably the nicest on the property. The first night, I tried to look for a cheaper alternative, but most places within a 2 block radius had similar prices. There is a place called Pershing Square Parking that charged $14 overnight...but no in/out and it was 4-5 blocks away. I decided to pay for the convenience and parked at the hotel parking. Safety: I have to say, I lived in NYC for 4 years and I'm from Chicago....LA downtown is DEAD. It is perfectly safe during the day but the streets clear out at night. I felt safe on the big streets but I noticed a lot of homeless people on the sidestreets. It's ok if you're a guy but just be careful if you're a girl walking alone. Pool: Layed out twice. The pool is privately gated, but anyone can use it if they stick their hand through the gate and open it from the inside. Perfectly safe though...I'm sure 100% of the people at the pool were hotel guests. The poolside chairs/beds were very comfortable. Not your ordinary cheap poolside chairs. Other: One day the bathroom light bulbs went out. Got too lazy to tell them and decided to just use the alternate light source in the shower as the bathroom light....When I got home that night, room service had fixed the problem w/o me reporting it.

The rooms are small but beautifully renovated - Westin really has it going with the Heavenly Beds and Baths - really, really appreciated after a long day of touring the LA area.

She didn't have any upgrades available for me, but suggested I check back the next morning. I was given a code for free internet access and a small can of jelly beans, which was a nice touch. The lobby does have a bit of a Disney / Vegas touch to it. Very 80's classy with lots of pools and fountains, including several that shoot water over the walkways (for a peak of this take a look two reviews down where the guy got several shots of the fountains, along with his hootchie - who I would rate as neutral / average). Anyway, you immediately get that large / convention hotel feel from the lobby and it rings true as this is quite a large facility. The elevator ride to the room is very enjoyable as you're transported to the exterior of the building after the 5th floor and get to enjoy some amazing, glassed-in views. My first room was a bit on the small side, although well appointed. Some of this is the result of the building being cylindrical, which causes all of the rooms to be slightly pie shaped. There are just a few hints of dating, most notably the wallpaper and carpet. The furnishings appeared to have been updated though. The Heavenly bed was great with new linens and a duvet - made for a good night's sleep. I was pleased to find a bathrobe and slippers laid out and waiting on the bed. This was a nice touch that you rarely see in hotels below the luxury level. The bathroom was clean and well appointed. The one drawback is that the countertops are built over the toilet in such a way that the seat can't remain up. The showers included a standard tub with the Westin Heavenly Shower double shower head. The following morning I checked with the front desk and was given an upgraded room to a suite. This two room, 1 and 1/2 bath had a lot of space. Again, some signs of dating in the carpet and wallpaper, but otherwise the furniture was fairly updated. The living room has the desk, TV couch and coffee table and a wet bar. The 1/2 bath is located off of this room as well. Both rooms had nice large floor to ceiling windows and great views. The bedroom was about the size of the 1st room that I had been assigned so combined with the living room I had plenty of room to move around. I ordered room service on several occasions and found that they were reliable, quick and of good quality so there were no complaints there. The menu was very standard for this type of hotel.

Think \"The Mirage\" in Vegas or a Benihana restaurant. Glass elevators featured in many movies makes for an interesting ride up. Revolving lounge on top floor harkens back to an earlier decade. To me, it all elicited a cool retro vibe that seemed to fit with L.A. Service was good, especially for a large hotel. Valet parking, while $25, was efficient and easy -- never a problem to get my car regardless of time of day. Bed and shower were top drawer. Starbucks coffee in room was complimentary.

The hotel itself has that late 70's-early 80's futuristic style going for it - which you will either love or hate.

Now, that you realize this, don't reserve the hotel and go somewhere else! What mattered to me was the room was quiet, clean, well furnished and to the standards of a Westin hotel.

I got a package deal on Expedia with air for this hotel. The hotel is downtown with easy access to highways and to the more popular areas of LA like Santa Monica, Hollywood, and other beach cities. You can take public transit but we had a car. We had a standard non smoking room on the 14 floor in the red tower with 2 double beds. What to expect Hotel -the hotel is huge with 4 towers accessed by 4 elevators to each tower although you can take any elevator to gain access to your floor/room as they are all connected though the center -lower floors of the hotel have a food court although when we were there most of them were closed. There are also stores but as another reviewer pointed out, it does give the impression of a lower end mall. -the gym is nice. There is an indoor running track and a well appointed fitness room that was in use constantly. -there is an Enterprise Car Rental Agency desk on-site in the lobby of the hotel. We rented from the airport. -the pool is outdoors on the 4th floor and is just that, a pool. It was heated though. We didn't spend too much time at the pool but when on the elevator during the day, it seemed like the building shaded over it. -the lobby is a little on the dark side as there is very little natural light that comes through the concrete building. There is a glass roof in the center but it really doesn't allow for much natural light. -buffet breakfast is $17.95+ tax which is a deal when you look at their a la carte menu for breakfast in comparison. The buffet offered a wide selection and variety such as coffee, tea, orange juice, pancakes, waffles, omlets, french toast, sausages, smoked salmon, cheeses, toast, cereals, eggs benedict, The fresh fruit offered included blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, pineapple, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew melon. We would have a big breakfast each morning that would hold us over until dinner each day. -food portions are HUGE so be warned when ordering. We had a ceasar salad with grilled chicken one night at the hotel in the cafe by the bar and asked to share it and there was enough there to feed 3 of us! -parking is valet only and costs $25 per night for hotel guests which includes tax. This is outrageous and quite frankly a money grab by the hotel. A lot across the street charged $8 per day although I am not sure if they allowed overnight parking. -rooms are relatively clean and spacious. The bathrooms are nice with granite counters and floors -towels for the most part were thick and absorbent but during our stay we had a few that although clean had awful stains on them ICK! -a robe is provided in each room but they didn't replace ours when it was thrown in with the towels after the 3 day. -the maid wasn't always consistent - sometimes the number of towels she left were more and other times less. Also it was a crap shoot when she'd put a new liner in the trash cans in both the bathroom and in the room -there is no bar fridge in the room but there is a safe -lighting is very dim, especially in the closet area where the full mirrors are located. We had dim lighting in the bathroom the first 2 days but they changed the bulbs without asking Downtown -a few Starbucks located within walking distance but only open during business hours. -restaurants within walking distance Cafe Pinot and Stef and Nick's Steakhouse which we went to - both very nice -there is not much to do or see downtown - we knew that going there but we decided to take a walk there during the day and we were not impressed at all. The downtown core is pretty run down and rough looking in comparison to other downtowns we've seen like Chicago or New York. In addition, we went for a walk downtown the first night we arrived and cut it really short as we didn't feel safe. There are ALOT of street people roaming the streets and hanging out in Perishing Square. We didn't feel as unsafe in the daytime but if I was traveling alone as a woman, I wouldn't feel safe. Getting Around -highway access is right there. You can get to anywhere if you have a car and a map. We did day trips on our own to Sequoia National Park and to San Simeon to the Hearst Castle with relative ease. Locally we visited the Queen Mary which was a waste of time, Santa Monica Pier, Hollywood (we were there for the World Music Awards 2005 and got to see a few stars walk the red carpet and be up close, Universal City Walk (for dinner), 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica and of course Venice Beach. -Wilshire Blvd which is a few blocks over from the hotel takes you to Rodeo Dr, Hollywood, Century City, Venice Beach, Santa Monica (about 15-20 minutes with traffic) - ask for a local map at reception or you can get one at a car rental agency.

The hotel is very similar to the Westin in Atlanta. It's a round hotel. Since it's round I was unable to see any other rooms of the hotel which was nice. I loved my view of downtown, and I bet some of the other rooms had even better views. - My favorite feature was the gym. They have one part where there's a running track with little balconies with weight equipment in the open atrium, and then they had a separate newer \"Reebok\" workout room with really nice new equipment. The cardio equipment had personal TVs and they give you headphones with replaceable earpiece covers. The whole setup was slick, and even though it's a large hotel, it was never too full. There's also an outdoor pool, but I never used it. - There's also lots of little shops and take out restaurants in the atrium area, but it all seemed like a low-end mall. So I avoided it.

We got a great rate through Travelzoo for $99, which included the free valet parking (normally $25). Our experience was mixed. I lived in LA in the '70s, when the Bonaventure was the coolest building around. I stayed there for the first time several years ago on a business trip and didn't think much of it---it was dated and appeared to be abandoned. It felt pretty much the same on this visit. If you are bringing your own car, be advised that it can be a nightmare to get to the garage. Even though the hotel has what appear to be manned entrances on Flower and Figueroa, you cannot get out at curbside to check in. You have to drive into the garage to valet parking, then walk down a long corridor and up two escalator flights before getting to the lobby. Definitely not a great introduction to the hotel. To get to the garage on subsequently days, we had to drive around the block because of the one way traffic. Getting to the hotel from the freeway was also a problem. We never could figure out whether there was a straightforward freeway exit for this hotel. It usually took at least 5 minutes to get from the freeway to the garage, even though the 110 freeway entrance is literally on the next block. We were initiallly assigned to a perfectly dreadful room. It was very small and right next to the elevator (with no view) and we could see the circular glass elevators hurtling by our window every 30 seconds or so. It looked as though the elevator occupants could see into our room if we didn't keep the drapes shut. (Although I think the chances are very slim--the elevators move very quickly). We then asked to be relocated, and were put in a much nicer situation, on the 27th floor (the preferred guest floor). The room was better furnished, with a view, and an upgraded bathroom. It was still small, but there was sufficient storage. No frig, but there was a coffeemaker and microwave. It reminded me of hotel rooms we've had in Tokyo. We had high hopes for the Heavenly Beds because we are in the market for a new bed and would have purchased one from their catalog (a king costs $1300) if we liked the beds. Were we ever disappointed! The beds certainly looked heavenly, but they turned out to be too firm and we did not sleep at all well on this trip. I realize that many people love these beds, so I can only say, to each his own. We bought our breakfasts from the take-outs on the 4th level. (By some oddity in planning, it is not possible to get to the 4th level on the elevator. You have to take a flight of stairs or the escalator to complete the trip). The prices at these places were extremely reasonable (considering they are located in a 4 star hotel). You can get fruit, a cooked American breakfast (though it's only fuel) and sandwiches. We took out one dinner from a Korean BBQ, but my husband had a bad reaction to the kimchi (which wasn't very good anyway). The hotel is in a good location if you want to do things in the city or in the general vicinity, such as Pasadena or Hollywood. The Central Library is right across the street (quite interesting and open until 8 during the week). Shopping is so-so. The area is primarily high-profile office buildings. We drove to other areas for dinner, although there are restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The area appears to be perfectly safe. We like to vary our locations on our return visits so it is unlikely that we will ever return to the Bonaventure.

Yes - the hotel is a little too \"urban\" and can come accross as very crowded. But at the same token, the floors were quiet. The check-in was fast and efficient and we got both of the rooms on one floor, close to each other. It is true that you could potentially lose your way around the floor because of the different towers, but it's not THAT big of a deal. Both rooms were great, clean and well decorated. They were a little small and oddly-shaped but not to a point where it bothered us. The view was beautiful, especially at night (well, we were lucky to be up high in the building).

Airconditioning worked well and was easy to operate. There was no refrigerator in the room; when I requested one, I was put on a waiting list. The coffee pot's lid kept coming off, but the machine did produce coffee. I did not have time to check out the TV, nor to try the fitness center or the various items of physical training in small areas along the center. Nor did I have the opportunity to visit the restaurant on the 35th floor, atop the tall tower. Energy conservation policy is in effect; if you want the sheets washed, leave the official note on the bed. If you want the towels washed, leave them on the floor of the bathroom. Otherwise, they would not be changed during your stay. Unfortunately, our convention occurred over the 4th of July weekend. Most restaurants were closed on the 4th and 5th. That meant only two workers on duty Monday morning for 2,000+ hungry people who had to catch a bus by 7:30 AM. Breakfast of low-fat granola cereal, a 2 oz container of milk, one glass jar of juice and 1 medium coffee cost $14.24. The banquet, for the most part, was well done; at my table one person collected the tickets reflecting choice of entree; two other waiters seemed terribly confused as to the number of chicken and beef dinners desired. The outdoor reception (for which convention guests paid $15 each) left something to be desired. The champagne flowed freely; reaching the hors d'oeuvres required standing in a long line. Price for convention goers was $155 per night for 1 or 2 per room, plus 14% tax and 0.8% surcharge. If you want downtown location, you have the choice of the WB or the Wilshire Grand.", "Date": "July 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at the Bonaventure\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2228423", "Content": "We stayed for one night in June 2004 at the Bonaventure on a Hotels $100/night room rate. Overall, our stay was good - the bed was amazingly comfortable and on the 25th floor, we had a beautiful view of downtown (and all the lights at night). I had the SAME problem as another reviewer - I reserved and pre-paid for a king sized bed online, and arrived to find we had been assigned a queen sized bed, right next to the elevator (like someone mentioned - anyone in the glass elevator could see right in our room if our curtains were open). I called the front desk and asked to be moved to a king sized bed room, and the woman was very friendly and accomodating and told me to come right down to get a room change. But when I went downstairs, I got a bit of attitude from a different front desk attendant, who said, \"What? You don't like your room?\" and sort of acted like I was being funny to request to move to the type of room I had pre-paid for. I wish I had known about the $6 parking around the corner! I did pay $22, but the staff was very nice and let me stay more than 24 hours (From 11:00 a.m. to about 4 p.m. the next day, and I was charged for only one day/overnight stay.) The rotating rooftop bar was a cute place to see the downtown buildings while drinking fruity, pricey drinks. The \"mall/food court\" part of this hotel is pretty cheesy, 1980s style (orange plastic tables with chairs bolted to the ground) and depressing, but there are plenty of better places to eat outside the hotel. I was very happy with my re-assigned room - great bed, pillows, shower, and view, and no one from the elevator could see in after I moved. I would stay here again. Also, it's close to the Standard, so you can stay in the Bonaventure (if you're a bit older or not up for a party atmosphere all night), and just get a couple drinks at the Standard to check out the action there.", "Date": "June 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sao paulo, brazil", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, especially if you are running the marathon...\u201d", "Author": "claudiaspiandorim", "ReviewID": "UR2222224", "Content": "we stayed at the westin bonaventure for 5 nights in march, with our 4-year-old daughter. as soon as we checked-in, my daughter was offered a nice kids bag, containing a cup with straw and a cap. my husband was running the marathon, and the hotel was right between the start and finish lines! the staff was nice and attentive, and the concierge always happy to help.

Hotel: Very good price (100 per night) for the quality of the hotel. Rooms are a good size. The view is really great. Service is good / average. The disappointment was the Heavenly Bed (way to soft, it hurts !) and the supposed restaurants and shops of the lobbys. There is barely one \"Sub-way\" open, which has not seen one client for a while and two gifts shops. Apart from that, do not expect a shopping center within the hotel. Neighbourhood: Empty on WE and evening. Plenty of shady people and homeless. The only great thinks is the very impressive art deco buildings and the mexican market on Sundays.
