It's a no-frills, clean hotel in a safe area so my I pick them up in the morning and after spending all day at our house or running around in DFW, I drop them back off in the evening so my wife & and and my in-laws can both have some privacy at night.. I love my in-laws and they love me but after a full day together, I think we all agree that the inexpensive rooms are more than worth the price. After all, it's just a place for them to sleep before we do the \"family thing\" again the next day. I'd also recommend it for business travelers that are just looking for a clean, comfortable place to sleep instead of a place to entertain clients.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cI love Priceline...\u201d", "Author": "SeattleRedBear", "ReviewID": "UR123651853", "Content": "...because I end up in hotels like this. This is a very well-managed HI Express property and I was happy to have gotten this for an excellent rate on Priceline. Staff Uniformly excellent...some a little more friendlier than others, but always had good information and took care of any questions I had (especially regarding billing...I had pre-paid through priceline but still got a bill slipped under my door with the priceline account info on it...reception assured me no problem). Receptionist even got me to sign up for reward program. Room Large room, decent bathroom, walk-in shower. Large desk (always good for business travel). High bed (which I really like) and nice firm (but not hard) mattress. My only complaint is that the TV system (dish) is way more complicated than it needs to be. Accidentally ended up off network twice and had to fiddle with the TV itself to get back on. microwave and mini-fridge rounds out the room. I was in room 217 so on the back side about three doors away from elevator. I heard occasional foot traffic, but no traffic noise or trains that others talked about, so being on the back side of the hotel does make a difference. Housekeeping Uniformly excellent. vacuumed and cleaned every day. very clean bathroom. the only oddity was that my ice bag was never replaced. Location Very convenient, right off I-30, if no traffic, 12-minute drive to downtown. Located across from a mall with a wide-range of dining options and a WalMart so you could pretty much get whatever you needed across the street.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNeeds some improvements\u201d", "Author": "WorldTravellerMan", "ReviewID": "UR123628548", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel about 6 miles west of downtown Dallas for 4 nights in Jan. 2012.

This place we found at under $100 and would the best value for money place we have ever stayed. It was super clean and well located to all attractions of both Dallas and Fort Worth. We usual visit 5 star hotels and don't believe it warranted the price difference given the little time we were here and in our rooms. We booked a double suite but they end up giving us connecting rooms as they were over booked. It also is well located across the road to a mini outdoor shopping area. Beds are comfy and breakfast is very basic but enough. I would recommend asking for a room facing away from main road and not on ground floor (where we were) as there can be some noise.

Best decision ever! We arrived here and couldn't have asked for a better location, hotel, or staff experience. Valmarie is great!

Five of us stayed in a queen suite and the room was spacious and nice. The only complaint I have is that the night we stayed there seemed to be a staffing issue as there were A LOT of military guys staying there and only one person working the front desk. There weren't enough towels in the room and when I went downstairs to request some (I had to go downstairs because no one was answering the front desk phone) I was told they were out and that housekeeping would bring some up in the morning (they didn't). The one woman that was there was doing her best, but it was obvious she was overwhelmed. That was frustrating, but overall, we had a nice stay and would consider staying here again.
