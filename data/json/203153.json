The Accademia is a fine hotel really, and is called so because of its address, Piazza Dell\u2019Accademia di San Luca, which is a very small square - more of a triangle really - just off the Via del Tritone, where there is a busstop almost right at your doorstep, number 175. The Via del Tritone connects Piazza Barberini with the Via del Corso, if that means anything to you. Roman busses at rush hour \u2013 and at any other hour - are sheer tragedy, so I took a taxi from Termini and paid 8 euros. I had a good room (luxury level though, it seemed), streetside but quiet, with a very modern bathroom for which I paid 150 instead of the normal 200. It wasn\u2019t very large, but adequate and clean. Service at the desk was friendly, but it might have helped that I speak Italian. Breakfast next morning was okay, especially if you consider the normal appalling level of breakfast in Italy. The hotel advertises itself as a three star, and they are right. And yes, 200 would be expensive, even for Rome. The only thing I didn\u2019t like about the hotel \u2013 but for which it is praised by many on this site \u2013 is the location. And I suppose that accounts for the price. I myself would never willingly accept a hotel location so near to the Trevi fountain. It means that hordes of people will be passing by from dawn till nightfall, and that, if you buy a cappuccino on a terrace at the Via del Tritone, you pay 5 euros. Two days later, on a terrace at the Via Merulana, I paid 1.50. At Campo dei Fiori you will pay 3. The area around Trevi is heavily tourist infested, noisy, full of cheap shops and (mostly) bad restaurants, where no decent Italian would ever care to sit down. Like the area around the Spanish steps it is a circus. People who live there are complaining for years now about the mess that is made by \u2013 especially \u2013 younger visitors. Apart from the heavy tourist traffic in the direction of the Trevi fountain, I have always found the area around the Via del Tritone dull. If you want to be chic, choose Via Veneto, if you prefer oldfashioned Italian charm, choose the area behind Via Arenula and the Tiber, or the area between Navona and the Tiber, or settle for Trastevere, which is lovely too. You won\u2019t avoid the tourists there either, and you never will in Rome, but it is much nicer and much more Italian. And if you \u2018d like to stay for a week or longer, rent an apartment.

We were given a newly renovated room on the third floor (315). Tight, sure, a rock hard bed (even for Italian standards) but a very contemporary and nice design that really appealed to us. The big problem was that the temperature in the room could not be controlled. Rome was cold, our room was not. We averaged 25-26 degrees centigrade. As the air conditioning was turned off, the only option available to cool the room was to open the window. However, given the scaffolding outside the staff recommended us not to leave any windows open. The staff really tried solving the heat problem but eventually we were moved to a new room (306). Now that room was a completely different story, loose carpet on the floor, cracked tiles in the extremely small bathroom, a very worn sofa etc etc. But we did not care, the room had a normal temperature and a somewhat softer bed, we could sleep again.

We showed up at 2:30 AM after a night out and there were still people sitting there. We asked the bartender what time they closed. He said they closed a half hour ago but he invited us to sit down and have a drink anyway. And with a friendly smile! Breakfast: All you can eat which is always a good thing. The hot items were eggs, bacon and these tiny sausage things. The sausages were pretty good, the eggs nothing special and kind of wet. Not runny, really, but almost watery. They had a selection of good cereals, pastries, yoghurt, fruit, cold meat and cheese, so I never felt hungry after breakfast and everything was very good. My husband said the coffee was excellent. The beds and the room: Yes, it is true what the other reviews have said about the beds being very hard. If you like a firm mattress, you won't have any problem here! But after long hot days of walking around Rome, I never had any trouble sleeping! The room was very clean. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was fantastic with great water pressure!

On checking into the room I found an extremely dusty window which did not lock, and scaffolding outside, making the room vulnerable to intruders. To give them credit, the hotel staff moved us to another room in the hotel which was much, much better, and so the problem was solved. My only remaining concern is when I specifically asked the question 'What time do the workmen begin?' I was told 'around 8.30' by reception. Had he said '7.00 o clock' I might well have moved hotels, but that was the time that drills, electric saws, and hammers began each day. Once the renovation is complete (August) this hotel should return to the establishment that we have loved in the past. Until then, please heed my warning; don't expect to lie in, and don't expect to be able to open your window without fear of a workman walking past, even on the fourth floor!

I had orginally wanted another hotel but it was not available so I selected this one based on the trip advisor reviews. We arrived early around 11am and we were afraid we would have to wait until the 2pm check in time but we got a room right away. We asked for a nonsmoking room (as per their website) but the desk attendant said all rooms are smoking but they clean them every day. Well we were given a room in the Superior Wing, which I think is a new part of the hotel. GREAT room, clean and most important quiet! Only drawbacks were it could us more lighting, as it was rather dim, and then the major drawback - the beds were hard as ROCKS and took some getting used to. Really uncomfortable the first few nights, but once you get used to them and because you are so tired, you do eventually fall asleep. Another perk to the hotel is that they have internet access that only costs 5 euros and you can use it as much as you like during your stay. This is great as when in Paris, it was like, 5 euros everytime you used it and we shelled out around 20 euros alone for this. So that was great as it made it easy to keep in touch with home. The hotel is located near the Trevi Fountain and yes, it gets very crowded around that area, but it is not right outside the hotel so you do not get a lot of noise from it. Probably rooms on the other side may get street noise. We used ear plugs at night so that the sound of people's voices or flushing toilets did not bother us that much. Ear plugs in any hotel is a must. Plus, once you get your bearings, there is no need to walk through the Trevi crowds to get to the hotel as you can come from the opposite direction as well and avoid all that, which we did all the time. Other times we did walk through but no one bothered us, and if they did try to sell something we just gave a firm no and kept walking and were left alone. Also the hotel is in a great location for walking. We walked to everything with the expection of the Vatican (took the 62 bus up the street) and when we went to Ostia Antica (closer version of Pompeii but less crowded, a bit smaller but still huge, and only 40 minutes away from center Rome) for that we took two subways and then a train. Otherwise Pantheon, Forum, Villa Borghese Park, Colosseum, many piazza, Traveste area etc. all within walking distance (though you can take subways and buses if you want). Plus the hotel location enabled us to go out in the morning, come back for a nap, and then go out for the later afternoon/evening activities so we were well rested the entire vacation and out feet didn't hurt as much from all the walking. I should mention there is construction going on at the hotel, but we only heard it in the morning and we were up so it did not matter. Also, the breakfast was plentiful and good - pastries, eggs, bacon, little sausage things, yogurt that my sister loved, granola and other cereals, breads, coffee, tea, fruit. Way more choices and heartier than the breakfasts we had in London or Paris. Saves money too.

Only drawback is we had to exit the hotel from a seperate entrance to find the breakfast area as the main part of the hotel in in the adjoining building.

I think the rooms are quite small in this area of Rome but you are only needing them to sleep and shower. There was air conditioning which was needed at this time of year. The breakfasts were good and available from 7.00 to 10.30 and had a good selection of hot food, cereal, yoghurt, pastries, rolls, cheese and ham, etc. It was good and set you up for a day of sight seeing. The hotel is in an excellent location for seeing Rome. The trevi fountain is less than a minute walk from the hotel, Within 10 minutes walking you can be at the Spanish Steps, The Pantheon, Piazza Navona and other beautiful sights in between. You also get a voucher for a 'buy one get one free' drink at the bar attached to the hotel which was great for sport and a drink when you returned back to the hotel. There are great restaurants and bars around the hotel and little streets that open up into another fountain, great building etc. There is a bus tour that stops at the top of the street and it cost 13 Euro's for a ticket that lasts 24 hours. The tour was excellent and you can get on and off when you want. This is the way we went to see the Colliseum and the Vatican on the second day. You can walk everywhere and the Vatican took about 30 minutes but the tour was great to get your bearings. I would definately stay at the hotel when I return to Rome for the location. The Trevi Fountain was always busy but we went down at 5 a.m on the last day (we were getting picked up for the airport at 5.35) and it was amazing as we were the only people there.

The hotel is easy walking distance from the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Spanish Steps et al. It's a great location without a doubt, which compensates for the relatively high price. We stayed in a superior room, which I think has a higher standard of decor. Very clean, everything worked (as far as everything ever does in an Italian city!), and was quiet, being situated at the rear of the hotel. No pretty view, but peace and quiet is preferable after a hard day walking the frantic streets of Rome. Only downer was the startlingly noisy plumbing from the room above, which might be a concern to the light sleeper. Room 353 - bear that in mind. We encountered very pleasant and helpful reception staff. Breakfast: I can't let a previous review go without comment. Of course they don't do breakfast for the British - the hotel is in Rome, and it's run by Italians. If they did \"British\" breakfast, they'd have to do American, Japanese, French, German and no doubt Martian breakfast as well. In reality, breakfast was just fine, with the usual range of continental choices at reasonable quality. Note: the hotel does a private car hire deal to the Rome airports for only 40 Euros. This is considerably cheaper, quicker and easier than using the Leonardo Express (9.50 per person) from Fiumicino plus a cab from the Termini (lots of Euros!). Highly recommended.

In general we found the staff to be very helpful and polite, the location was excellent and the breakfasts were good, but our room had an awful smell of damp carpet and we were given an air freshner for carpets to spray every time we entered the room! However the main reason for this review is to advise others of the disabled facilities in the hotel (which we found hard to come by when we were looking for a hotel). We were advised when we booked that the hotel had a disabled room & adapted bathroom and was fully accessable in a wheelchair. After check in we were shown to a seperate entrance to get to the Superior wing (there is only one disabled room & this is in the superior wing). This involves swiping through a door, then one small step into the hall then one larger step (which would require assistance) to get to the lift. Alternatively there was a fire exit door which could be opened to avoid these steps. The bedroom was a reasonable size but we found that the bathroom, although large enough to accomodate a wheelchair, did not have any grab rails or even a seat in the shower. We were given a plastic garden chair to put in the shower when we complained about this. To get to the breakfast room we had to go back down in the lift, out of our seperate entrance, walk outside the hotel and into reception then up a small ramp to the breakfast room. This is because the lift that goes direct to reception is up four steps from the disabled bedroom. Overall it was manageable but not the best hotel for someone in a wheelchair, and we felt that the room should not be advertised as a disabled room. Other tips for wheelchair users in Rome - The buses are accessable but the ramps do not always work when you try to get off!

The hotel staff is very friendly and they had a stash of umbrellas for use in the lobby which was an extra nice touch that we took advantage of one morning. The hotel breakfast was the best hotel breakfast we had during our trip through Italy. We had a Queen bed and the room was nice. It faced the back of the hotel so we didn't have a great view, but it was quieter. The room was a little small, but expected. Very nice bathroom. Included a hair dryer.

We were off the main road which meant we didn't have any noise and cars didn't seem to drive past the hotel unless they were doing a drop off. The hotel is over a 'news cafe' which is basically a bar in the evening. Although I'm not sure it's a problem past midnight (at least not from our experience). Room - we were given a free upgrade from a standard room (paid through expedia) to the superior wing (room 353). We had booked a double but got given a twin bed and the in room safe door didn't shut. We could have argued this out but didn't feel it was worth it and locked our valuables in a bag every day. The room wasn't particulary big and the bathroom was very small (struggle to fit two people in at the same time) but who's spending all their time in their room? Toiletries are provided (LUX combined shower & shampoo fixed on wall of shower cubicle) cleanser, body lotion, cotton buds, shoe shine, shower cap and soap. These were not replaced when used. Minibar was kept in a small cupboard and as a result didn't keep anything particulary chilled. The maid doesn't make a note of what's drunk everyday and so you tell reception when you check out. No tea or coffee facilties so bring your own kettle, adapter and tea bags. Milk can be purchased for .80 euros at a supermarket (we bought ours from L'Antico Forno at Piazza Trevi) and kept it in the mini bar. For your reference, red carton - skimmed, green is semi-skimmed and blue is whole. Service was good. The maid forgot our bath towels one day and within 5 minutes of calling reception we had some brought up. The terrace was next to our room (we also saw one next to the 4th floor superior rooms). We seemed to have it to ourselves which was nice. Breakfast was fine. Scrambled eggs and bacon (didn't try so can't comment), pastries, muffins, toast, boiled eggs, meats, cheese, juice, tea, coffee. Self service. HOTEL TIPS I've read the 1st floor isn't the best and to request the 4th floor when booking. The hotel has three seperate lifts which made us think it was different buildings made into one hotel. The 4th floor superior wing is on the safe floor as rooms 309-312.
