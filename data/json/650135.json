It was an ideal location. Very close to the to stations. The lifts up to the rooms are tiny and the rooms are small and basic but if its just a place to rest you want then its perfect.

My husband and I took the train from Charles De Gaulle Airport to Chatelet Les Halles train station (8 euros each) and the hotel is 2 blocks from the train station. We have rolling suitcases and this trip was a cinch. There is a metro stop 1 block from the hotel. And rue Montorgueil is 2 blocks away. Rue Montorgueil has an abundance of food stores - from famous patisseries to dried fruit and everything in between. Also many good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. It is a small hotel with rooms not large but big enough, clean and quiet. It also has an elevator. The staff was courteous and helpful and the cost was reasonable for Paris.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAverage, good location, no frills, new staff/hotel that need more experience\u201d", "Author": "onceayeareuro", "ReviewID": "UR46628669", "Content": "The hotel is located 1 minute from Des Halles so is a perfect location in the middle of the 1st er. Ask for a room on the 4th or 5th floor, otherwise I would imagine the street noise would be too loud for a comfortable stay. There is no lobby or restaurant and the rooms are cramped (small) which is typical for Europe and esp. Paris, but we were on the 4th floor and there were only 2 rooms, so we could hear everything in the room beside us. The staff is friendly and accomdating, but the cleaning staff stops at noon and because it was Nuit Blanche, we didn't leave our room before noon 3 of our 4 days, so our room was not cleaned. All in all, if you want to stay in the 1st, this is a good bet, but if you'd rather any of the other arrondissements, then stay at another hotel.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cbig room with a shower/tub\u201d", "Author": "Datsdawey", "ReviewID": "UR35394903", "Content": "the only reason i think this hotel is any more expensive than other two star hotels is probably the location. However, i wasn't really blown away by the location, and please note that less than a block away, there are tons of sex shops and prostitutes. There was an elevator (that barely fit me at 5'6 130lbs and my duffel bag). The shower had a tub, which, after staying at two other paris hotels made the shower feel gargantuan. What was most appealing, though, was the plethora of places you could walk to (Marais, Louvre, Picasso museum, Seine river bank). ALSO it is steps away from a metro stop and about a 2minute walk to the RER B, which is the train that takes you straight to Charles De Gaulle Airport. There are restaurants open 7 days a week very close by.
