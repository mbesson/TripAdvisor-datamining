The cost was \u00c2\u00a329.95 per night - Bargain price for London. Getting to the hotel is easy, get off at Canning Town tube (Jubilee) and then get DLR towards Woolwich Arsenal. Get off at London City Airport and the hotel is a signposted 10 minute walk away. When I arrived there were two customers in front of me - one had no pillow, tea/coffee or spoons in their room, and the other had no pillows. Took 10 minutes to check in but the advisor was helpful. I requested a room on the top floor and the request was met. The corridor to the room was rather run down and smelly. I entered the room and was suprised - very clean and generally very good for the price I paid. The TV had 6 working channels, the radiator kept the room very warm, and the bathroom was again very clean and functionable. The view was the airport, and over the docks towards East London. I spotted West Ham United stadium in the distance along with what I think is the Olympics site. I slept very well, the bed was very comfortable. No noise heard over night, no traffic from outside and no idiots walking past the room at 5am! The shower had plenty of hot water, I purchased shampoo and shower gel from a shop 5 minutes walk away. In the morning there was a slight funny noise when planes landed and took off, but its not a problem as the airport is closed in the evening and the noise should not keep you awake. Did not try the food, but menus were in the room and there was a lot of choice. The lifts are a bit slow and run down as well, the lift on the left had two floor Ground buttons, one opens up to the waiting area while the other is the chambermaids area. Maybe a sign should be put up in the lift saying not to press the button that goes to the chambermaids area? So I would stay here again if the price is cheap, paying under \u00c2\u00a330 is amazing value but if I paid the \"normal\" rate of \u00c2\u00a369 I would feel that it would not be value for money.

ROOM: We were allocated a big family room which was quite clean but it was on the ground floor next to the reception, a bit dark and with a view of bushes and factories. We knew the hotel was almost empty so we asked to be moved. The reception staff were accomodating and gave us a better room on the 5th floor with a spectacular view of the river and airport where you can see the planes taking off. Despite the airport being so close, there's hardly any noise. 5 stars for view. Room was clean, bed comfy and we had a pleasant stay. Small flatscreen tv available but some of the channels were scrambled. Plenty of towels were in the room upon arrival. Because it was very cold we asked for extra bedding and pillows and the staff were more than obliging. One of the lamps had no bulb but we never bothered to ask for a replacememnt because there were several lights in the room anyway. Tea and coffee facilities available in room. FOOD: We had booked inclusive dinner with an online discout, however the food wasn't that great, it seemed and tasted like frozen food that was microwaved. Dinner menu is reasonably priced but not very diverse. The beef rib and noodles are quite nice. On some nights the things we wanted from the menu were unavailable. Also due to using microwaves for cooking my mum's Indian nan bread accompanying her curry turned rock hard a few minutes after she got it. The breakfast is very basic scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and beans + cereals, yoghurt and muffins, but there was plenty of it. I would recommend eating out...or take away..its cheaper and probably better. Bad bits: The toilet was a little difficult to flush on day 5 but it wasn't too bad coz we were leaving the next morning but it made life a bit difficult as one had to fight with the handle for it to work. Two of the staff members were a bit moody but overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was a bit sporadic maybe it was because of the Christmas break, don't know...but when the guys did it the bathroom wouldn't be very clean after they were done. The females were far better in terms of cleaning.

The staff also seemed very clueless, if you're needing information about the airport try check online before you get there.

We went to the 02 for a concert and was advised to take the 474 bus to Canning Town from right outside the hotel and then get the DLR to North Greenwich for O2 which was quite straight forward.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gillingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBasic\u201d", "Author": "gales72", "ReviewID": "UR119304989", "Content": "We stayed here whilst attending Peter Kay's tour at the 02 in June. It is well located for the City Airport, and the transport links are great to the 02 and into town. The hotel appears modern from the outside, but it is already looking tired on the inside. The staff were very friendly, check in was fairly smooth - neither of the automatic check in machines were working, but the wait wasn't too bad. The room was dissapointing, very sparse and clinical. It doesn't generate any kind of atmosphere - certainly not a destination for a romantic break! The bed linen was clean, but there was no mattress protector, just a flimsy sheet. The noise is not too bad, we were on the side of the hotel adjacent to the DLR, but it never really bothered us. Breakfast was adequate but nothing special, the ingredients appeared cheap. The breakfast staff were not that adept at cleaning tables, just smearing the dirt round a bit - much to the disgust of some foreign tourists staying at the hotel - who attempted to take the staff to task about the standard, but without much luck. I don't think I would rush to come back to this hotel, but it is convenient for the airport and good links to the 02 and ExCEL. I read alot of reviews after I had booked the hotel and would like to add my comments to some of the issues mentioned on other reviews. Firstly, proximity to the airport. The hotel is very close to the airport and with just hand luggage to carry is an easy walk. With suitcases it would not be recommended - better to catch a bus or get a taxi - it is only a 10 min walk, but not ideal if you have a heavy suitcase in tow - but anyone who says that the hotel is not convenient for the aiport is clearly incorrect - you couldn't get much closer without building it on the runway! Safety walking at night - we walked back to the hotel from the DLR station at the Airport, at around midnight and felt safe, there is good lighting and we didn't encounter anyone during our walk back - there is still some traffic around which helps to the feeling of safety. Security of Car Park - this was my biggest concern after reading the reviews, but I suspect that the worst of this issue is over as we didn't witness any cars having been broken into. I'll admit that I followed some good advice that I read in here, locking the sat nav in the boot and using a wipe to erase the tell tale ring on the windscreen. However I think that this is fairly sensible whenever you are unsure about the area you are parking in. In summary this is a cheap hotel to crash in if you are using the airport, attending an event at 02 or Excel. It is basic and functional, the staff were friendly and helpful.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWorked for me\u201d", "Author": "Flois", "ReviewID": "UR119302202", "Content": "I stayed one night here for a function at the Excel centre - just the job.

With luggage, car seat, buggie etc, we needed to have the car with us so we decided on London City Airport Travelodge as it had parking outside. We booked 2 rooms at a good rate, we arrived on Sunday evening, Stephanie from Brittany was on reception,lovely girl, having booked online we had our rooms in just a couple of minutes, both family rooms on the 3rd floor rear, they were clean, warm and everything you would expect from a Travelodge, no problems. whilst my daughter got our grandaughter to sleep, my wife and I went to the bar/cafe to eat. Stephanie who was very pleasant and happy at all times was serving in the bar and took our order which was a Combo for two and taking the advice of another report on this site 2 bowls of chips!! I had a pint of Stella which was served perfectly in a Stella glass, \u00c2\u00a33-30 (London prices). The cafe was busy and there was a good atmosphere, the food arrived in about 10 minutes and was really nice, the chips were perfect, dry and crisp. we could have ate more!! the meal was a reasonable \u00c2\u00a310 for the 2 of us, no complaints at all. Up early the next morning to escort my daughter to the DLR at Pontoon Bridge about 10 minutes walk away, (\u00c2\u00a310 for the return ticket into central London be warned) yes the area is a bit cold and industrial, but on the way back there is an ON THE RUN service station which has a small cafe and they do the best take out bacon/sausage/egg baps, really nice and a morning newspaper. They are open 24/7 and breakfast starts at 5am!! The reason we stopped at this Travelodge was the car parking, which costs \u00c2\u00a35 for overnight parking and YES that do have people come around and check you have a ticket!!! be careful!! We found all the staff most pleasant, but having a 3 month old baby with you rather changes peoples attitudes, I think!! The room cleaning staff we met we young Asian lads and they could not be more helpful for pillows towels, etc, as I said you could not fault the rooms which we large and they were excellent for our needs. Finally I know that this site is monitored by Travelodge Head Office, could I say thank you to Marc in the Customer Service Team for the way he dealt with my mistake in booking the wrong date for one of our nights stay in London, he sorted it out and provided a voucher which I can use again with Travelodge soon. I know there are some comments about poor service, but having got contact via E mail with Marc, the problem was sorted out in a couple of minutes to my satisfaction, so well done Marc, from another happy customer. Overall we had a very good stay at the Travelodge London City Airport, ask for a room at the back of the hotel away from the plane noise and you will not hear a thing, promise.

I'd done the research in terms of transport links (DLR and 24 hour bus stops right outside the hotel) and what's nearby (not a lot), and had no problems whatsoever. Just be careful if you stay here without doing some planning, you may be surprised! To say the hotel is next to the airport and has a DLR line going right past, it was remarkably quiet. I was given a 1st floor room which faced the DLR line. Typical large Travelodge room with a big bed and a decent shower. The window was triple glazed, to isolate the noise. In my room, I did not hear a single plane taking off or landing. I did hear the DLR going past, but it was quieter than a car going past my house at night, so it didn't bother me. I booked early during a sale, and got a four night stay for an average of under \u00c2\u00a330 per night. At this price, I got amazing value for money! The hotel was clean, the bed was comfy and the shower was hot and powerful. I didn't eat in the hotel, but did use the bar and the prices for beer and snacks were reasonable considering the location. Here's a tip for food, there's a nice little cafe in Thames Barrier Park within ten minutes walk from the hotel, serving good snacks and light lunches. No problems whatsoever, and extremely pleased with this hotel for the price. If I'm in the area again, I will certainly consider staying here again.

There are a few other hotels in the vicinity such as a Premier Inn Etap hotel and Ramada. There is a daily \u00c2\u00a35 charge for all day hotel parking so have some coins handy but you can also pay by credit card via your mobile phone. Previous reviews have mentioned car park security problems. It might had been an issue in the summer where daybreak is early. During my stay it was dark until about 8:00 am and got dark again at 4:00 pm and it was sub zero temperature at nights. I did park near reception and I also notice there were CCTV cameras around the car park. However I also believe that parking near reception is a false sense of security as I think that reception is not manned during the night and after 11:00 pm you have to use the buzzer to enter the hotel. Checking in was quick with our printed Internet confirmation. As we booked a family room, we had a double bed and a sofa that could be turned into a bed and a pull out mattress to sleep our two kids. We had to convert the sofa ourselves. The room was of a good size and equivalent if not slightly larger to the HI Express hotels we have previously stayed at in London. We had a LCD tv and for the first time in years a tv in a hotel in the UK that had decent reception. The bathroom was again of a decent size with a bath/shower. You have to bring your own toiletries to a Travelodge this includes shampoo and soap. Do not worry towels, sheets, blankets and pillows are provided, even a kettle with tea and coffee. I do wonder how they get away in not providing soap for the bathroom for hygiene reasons and is unnecessary penny pinching. The bed was comfortable but we were tired after a long journey so slept well and the room was warm even though it was freezing outside. We heard no aircraft noise during our stay. There is a DLR station about 10 mins walk away (just follow the DLR bridge) and we could see the DLR trains go past from our rooms. There is also a bus stop outside the hotel. Apart from the airport there is not much there. I noticed a petrol station with a mini shop nearby. We were a short drive away from Greenwich and West Ham, two areas which we wanted to fit in during our stay. We opted for the buffet breakfast option. Although I felt the price per person was expensive, it was worth it as kids eat free and it would amount to very much the same price if we went to the nearest Starbucks for a cup of coffee and a croissant per person. This Travelodge offers a cooked breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon as well as croissants, toasts, Kellogg's cereals. The orange juice was disappointing, it tasted like watered down squash and the coffee machine disappointed as well. I tried the cappuccino and the white coffee but it never tasted right to me. The service was efficient and you were encouraged to eat as much as you want. Generally we were impressed by our stay. Travelodge works if you book early and grab the best deals.

I had no complaints about the hotel on my first few stays - I don't expect luxury at a Travelodge, and I found this hotel entirely adequate. Clean, well-maintained rooms. A bar serving basic but entirely palatable food. My one complaint was the fact that they don't start serving breakfast until 7 am, which is far too late for an airport hotel. However, on my last few stays I noticed a distinct deterioration - the hotel wasn't as clean as it used to be, and both food and service in the bar seemed to have gone downhill. And when I stayed there last week things had got so bad that, despite the convenience, I seriously doubt I will ever stay there again. There were hygiene issues - we had to get the quilt exchanged because of stains (disgusting-looking stains!) both on the cover and on the quilt itself. The bar was filthy - none of the tables had been cleared, and there was food on the floor. When we asked staff if it would be possible to clear some tables (there were several people waiting to sit down) the reply was \"No, we're too busy\". And they clearly were... from what we could see there were all of four people on duty, to look after a large hotel that was fully booked and man the bar and restaurant. When we asked to speak to the manager we were told that she wasn't available to speak to customers because she was busy cooking! To top it all, when we were finally able to order food (we had to wait about 20 minutes to be served at the bar) we were told to expect a wait of at least 90 minutes - and this was well after 9 pm. We ended up just ordering a glass of wine and a bag of crisps. Staff attitudes also left a lot to be desired - the receptionist was brilliant, but everybody else seemed surly and rude, especially the guy behind the bar. But maybe they were just overworked?

I was looking for a hotel conveniently close to London City Airport so I could easily catch an early morning flight. It is located 5-10 minutes walk from the airport (depending how fast you walk); but too close to take a taxi. However, not a pleasant walk, mostly along dimly lit footpaths and under railway bridges. I wouldn't recommend it at night to people with a nervous disposition. I checked into the hotel about 7pm. Only one person on reception, and a queue of 5-6 people which it took about 20 minutes to process. Not sure why but the check-in process was very slow. When I got to my room the first thing I noticed was the smell of wet carpet; seems like someone had tipped the contents of the kettle onto the floor. Under normal circumstances I would have asked for another room, but was in a hurry to go out to an evening function and could not afford time to wait in the reception queue for another 20 minutes. When i got back to the hotel later that evening (about 11pm) my card key no longer worked. Again only one person on reception and only one person in front of me, but it took 10-15 minutes to \"process\" him (part of the problem was that the hotel had run out of card keys) before I could get my card key re-set and to get into my smelly room.

(Travelodge policy is they will cancel your booking if you have not checked in on the first day of your booking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if it is a non-refundable booking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c learnt that one the hard way).

Due to it being basically in the middle of nowhere, we had breakfast in the dinning room every morning and had no complaints. One morning we chose to have a sleep in and only went down 30 minutes before breakfast finished and they had run out of bacon, but other than that can not fault the breakfast at all.

We decided to give it a try on our last night and it was a bit of a shambles. To start with, the computerised cash register was playing up and had to be rebooted, so they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take orders for about 15 or 20 minutes.

We were so tired and hungry we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care, but some of the other customers were getting quite irate with the staff about the lack of available menu items. When the pizza did arrive, it was obviously straight out of the freezer, so it still amazes me the rest of the menu items weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the freezer as well. The dinning room manger (if there was one) would have been better off collecting up the menus and just putting up a sign listing meals that WERE available. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real shame, because everything else about the hotel was great and it certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to stop me from returning. Just find somewhere else for your evening meal. Transport links are good. The Thames Barrier is just a few minutes walk away (we could see it from our room) and is worth a look.

All in, I was there for 45 minutes, and didn't see a single saussage. The member of staff in charge was constantly running around like a headless chicken, whilst actually doing very little. Over 4 days, nothing ever got replenished unless somebody told him that it had run out, whereas a competent member of staff would have monitored supply and replenished without being prompted. I.E. on day 1, I had to ask for bread. 5 minutes previously, there had only been 6 slices, and a crowded dining room, so it was obvious that we were about to run out. Day 4, I had to ask for cups, then when they came, I had to ask him to fill the coffee machine; I saw another guest requesting more BUTTER, and then having to explain that what was currently available was MARGARINE, which is not the same thing. Also, for reasons best known to the hotel staff, the butter and margarine were always at the opposite end of the bufet to the bread and the jam, which was inconvenient as well as illogical. The man \"in charge\" kept coming and asking if everything was all right; in principal, this was a good thing. However, if you came to breakfast at a quiet time, he would come round aproximately every 2 minutes, which was extremely irritating The menu was: Cereals Fruit Juice Tinned Oranges & Grapefruit, although on day 4, they had completely run out of oranges. Bacon Saussages, although not on day 1; they were pretty inedible the rest of the time. Scrambled Egg, which tasted like it was made from powder. Baked Beans, Tinned Tomatoes and Mushrooms (boiled?) Bread (Propper loaves, brown only on day 1, white as well on other days.) Butter, Cheap Margarine and Tasteless Jam. Croissants Chocolate Muffins (not on day 1) Tea and Coffee; there were 2 machines, one of which was permenantly out of order, besides it would have been completely inaccessible if anybody had been using the other one. From the items not present on certain days (white bread, saussages, oranges, chocolate muffins... I would guess that the kitchen's ordering policy was \"Don't even think about ordering more until we've completely run out.\" Not good when people are paying for the service.

I asked the receptionist at the hotel about alternatives and she game me this gem of a tip. Get the day travel passes for the underground/DLR/bus (on day one go to a station information desk and buy them in advance for the rest of your stay but get the DAILY ones not the 3 or 7 days ones which work out more expensive). Once you have your daily travel cards: every time you go out walk to the car park barrier and there is a bus stop, get on the 474 bus (every 4 minutes) and go to Canning Town which is 5 minutes on the bus. Canning Town is a three-in-one self contained station - tube, DLR and bus. At Canning Town you can access the tube and DLR and the bus when coming back. When coming back get off the DLR or tube at Canning Town and get the same 474 bus which again will go past the entrance to the hotel where there is a bus stop on either side of the road. Get off at the entrance and walk back inside the hotel!! It's so simple and a great service all included in your daily pass at \u00c2\u00a35.70.

I found it a better walk for to go to Pontoon Dock.

Despite its very close proximity to the airport and the DLR rail link there is very little disruption to sleep from either side. We had a room facing the DLR so that may of helped damp down the airport noise but i dont htink it would have made any difference. The hotel is very clean and the staff more than helpfull. Breakfast is a buffet style, sometimes you have to wait for more food to be sent from the kitchen but most of the time there was planty for everyone for the \u00c2\u00a37.50pp charge (kids eat free) cant complain. In general i would recomend this travellodge for the price and location especially if you have no kids, it was a bit of a struggle on the DLR with the pram and kids in the late peak rush hour.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Travelodge London City Airport Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d594943-Reviews-Travelodge_London_City_Airport_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$95 - $238*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Hartmann Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Silvertown</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">E16 2BZ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "594943", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9b/eb/9beb451f1d469b8b41f9bf11eabc40f61large.jpg"}}
