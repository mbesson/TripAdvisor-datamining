All 6 rooms which were booked were on the same floor, and all were booked as non-smoking double bed accommodation.

Familiar with Montreal but had never stayed here and many of the reviews kept expectations way low. The location was central and convenient. Parking is $18.50 a day, pretty standard for the area, with in and out options available but with the metro stop right next to the hotel didn't need the car at all. Check in was friendly, fast and no Hotwire snooty stuff. Thanks to a tripadvisor review tip, we called a few days earlier to request a non-smoking room and this was granted at check in. The room up on the 23rd floor was comfortable and very clean. Everything was a bit dated, carpets and one of the chairs was a bit worn, tv was an old one, but not a big deal. The bathroom looked like it had been refurbished a bit, and it was also very clean. The water pressure was kind of weak on the shower but it got the job done. The location is great and not sure where all of the safety concerns are coming from. Montreal is a major city and the hotel is located next to a park that can be sketchy at night. But the sketchy people in the park are pretty contained and keep to themselves other than some pan handling near the street. You don't have to give them money but treat them with respect and they will do the same. None of this spilled over into the hotel or the parking garage on the weekend we were there. It would probably be a bad idea to wonder around in the park alone at night, but that's general urban common sense. We'd gladly stay here again.

We drove up from New York, and arrived in the evening after the rush. The desk clerk was polite and professional. When I crossed the lobby a little later, he addressed me by name asking if everything was ok. The parking garage is currently undergoing some sort of renovation. It is open, but its a bit of a mess, and finding a spot can be a bit of a hassle I think we paid 19.00 per day. ALSO..look for the signs that will guide you to an elevator that will take you into the hotel lobby. We did not, and ended up in an adjacent office building, and then had to walk outside to get to the reception area of the hotel. The room itself was clean. However, I must agree with the reviewers that state everything is old. Indeed the TV s a bit bulky, and the furniture has seen better days.The bed was ok..but just. Te room had a coffee maker, but no room safe, which is something I like to use. We were on the 11th floor with a view of Mount Royal, and a park below, that had interesting colored panels. The location was well suited for tourism, being right on top of a subway station (We left our car in the garage the whole time) Several reviewers commented on the panhandlers. I did not see any directly in front of the hotel. When we got into the subway, my son (age 12) summed it up perfectly.. \"Music and homeless people again\" We do a fair amount of travelling, so obviously this was not a new concept to him.

Comparing this hotel as a 3* or 4* to another 3* or 4* is the wrong approach. Look at this hotel for the price paid and compare it based on price paid in other stays regardless of star level. We paid $72 for a double \"classic\" room via Hotwire blind buy. Even in this Feb. low season that's literally half of the AAA rate of a global chain in Old Town and probably upwards of 70% off of the unrestricted rate of some downtown properties. So, let's pause for a moment and realize that $72 is a steal for almost anything these days. For that price, as a blind item, I say no problem. I would never choose the property, on my own, however, and I don't think I'll be a regular Hotwire customer as a result (but that's a discussion for another forum thread). Pros: 1. Location just east of downtown at UQAM and edge of the Latin Quarter. I disagree with earlier reviewers who said that panhandlers were problematic. Sure it was present in the walkways of the Metro. It's a major city, people. Tell me where there isn't panhandling in the downtown of a major city and then we'll talk. We are family with 12-year old and we didn't feel unsafe for a second. 2. Metro and small shopping area is downstairs--you need not go outside. Really nice upscale grocery adjacent to the hotel when you enter the underground are from the hotel lobby. Banque Nationale on the same block for currency exchange. In no way is this a commercial for them, but their exchange rates were quite fair and fees for the exchange nominal $4 or $5. Just FYI on that. Several restaurants within walking distance that appeared decent. 3. Hotel itself, rooms and pool were all clean and housekeeping is adequate. Our bathroom had stained grout and peeling wallpaper but that was the worst offense. Clean carpets, no nightmare stains on linens, etc. 4. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Cons: 1. Old. I mean, old old. As in worn out. As in threadbare. This doesn't mean it wasn't clean, it was just beyond old. Furnishings were 30 years old if they are a day. See attached pictures. 2. Room was small. Not intolerable. But small. Obviously, we were in a \"classic\" room, so I can't comment on any higher offerings. Forgive me but I'm actually a little obsessed with this \"old\" thing. Like it's a puzzle. I don't know the Gouverneur (Canadian) chain, but I'm wondering if this is their \"clearance\" property? You know how department stores send their inventory to some far off store in a strip mall somewhere in the suburbs? That's kind of what this was like. Or, you know how you can wait 6-9 months after a movie is new and go see it for a $1 or $2 at a far off theater that is worn? That's kind of what this was like. Was the mortgage on this building paid off so long ago that everything is pure gravy now so why invest because of competition? Or, they could truly be serving the \"B\" list market (which I was a part of with my Hotwire buy). Looks like tour groups come through here also. I really think that this hotel makes an effort to keep it old. It wasn't that things were broken. Everything worked. Rather, it's like anything that needs replacing is tended to with inventory that is from some hotel clearance world. Bamboo-themed lamps? Must have been flown in from a Waikiki hotel that was redone. Beds with dips in the middle and yet I slept ok. The Zenith TVs from 1985 you have seen mentioned in other reviews is true. I mean, they have to be buying these wholesale from some chain off an interstate highway that got rid of them. I don't think you can get the cathode tube parts for these things anymore so my guess is that when the TVs start to go, they'll pick up another lot from a hotel that was renovated and put them here. Wall sconces in the hallways that are the kind from Home Goods or Home Depot that look like candles where the paper is wrapped around the front and is peeling. It's still a conference center hotel, so you look at the old felt board in the lobby with gold letters and you have to laugh a little. If you read my other reviews, I don't pick apart wall sconces. Rather, I have this list here because it can't be an accident. You have to try hard to have stuff this old. To reiterate, at $72 we were placed in safe, dry, clean surroundings with amenities.

It is situated right on the border of what is called the Quartier Latin and Le Village.

He then told me that they had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sup\u00c3\u00a9rieur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with two beds, but that I would have to pay an extra $20 per night. He told me that if I had truly wanted a room with two beds, I was required to call the hotel directly after making the Hotwire registration. I found this outrageous, but because I had already paid for the room through Hotwire, I was stuck. If the hotel had advertised a room on Hotwire for $20 more per night, I would not have made the initial reservation. This is a disingenuous business practice. Furthermore, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sup\u00c3\u00a9rieur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd simply meant that the hotel had refurbished some of their rooms and was charging extra for the ones that had been redone. Because I refused to pay the $20 upcharge for all the nights I stayed there, my colleague and I were obliged to change rooms after the first night there. Normally, when a hotel creates inconveniences like this, they offer something to thank you for your trouble. Far from doing that, this hotel charged me extra for my inconvenience. I have had the experience a few times in my life of a hotel overbooking rooms and not having the room I had reserved available. In every case, the hotel made an effort to accommodate me, including putting me up in a comparable hotel nearby. Never in my experience has a hotel forced me to pay extra in order to get the room I had reserved. In this case, when the hotel overbooked rooms and gave the room I had reserved to someone else, the right thing to do would have been to put me in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sup\u00c3\u00a9rieur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room without charging me extra for it.

I had never been to Montreal before and when I phoned to book the reservation months prior, I was told it was a 4 star hotel. Upon arrival, five of us were checking in at the same time. All of us had made reservations more than 3 months in advance. Every one of the reservations was wrong and the poor gentleman at the check in counter was trying to fix things. After awhile he was able to change the rooms to what we had originally reserved. Two of the people in our group were talked into upgrading their rooms. I was in the upgraded room and it was no different than the regular room, other than it having a mini bar fridge. The air conditioning worked great and was a god send with the intense heat there that weekend. The room itself was pretty large with two queen size beds, more than ample closet space, and a small sitting area. The bathroom was on that needs some attention side, as there was mold and the tub took forever to drain. So when you showered, you were getting ankle deep in water pretty quickly. To me they put a lot of money into the lobby, which is absolutely beautiful. It is unfortunate that the rooms look like they have not been touched since 1976. We had breakfast in the restaurant which was a really nice hot and cold buffet. The price was really reasonable and the service was excellent every time. I didn't use the pool or gym facilities, but those who did said the pool was great. The hotel itself is two sided to me, the lobby area, restaurant area is beautiful and very welcoming. The rooms however are nothing to write home about, and I would hope that they would put some attention to the rooms to bring them up to the same quality as your initial first impression. It was disappointing in that I've stayed in 4 star hotels before and this one can't even compete in their category. So something a lot nicer was expected, but it wasn't unlivable. The hotel is located in a particularly depressed area of town. There were many homeless and panhandlers around.

Some hotels also have a channel guide for the television but there wasn't one that I could find at the hotel so I scanned through the television stations to try to figure out where my favourite channels were located. - There is no ice machine on my floor but that wasn't that big of a deal since the ice machine was just 1 floor up What I liked about the hotel: -The location (near Metro/subway station and near Montreal's Grayhound/Voyageur station). In fact, you don't have to leave the metro to get into the hotel (it is interconnected) -There were lots of restaurants in the food court also near the hotel (interconnected) -There was a supermarket (IGA) near the hotel (interconnected) The area where the hotel is located isn't the best but since I was only staying there for 1 night, I didn't really have to go outside since the subway/metro was connected to the hotel.

The hotel enjoys possibly the most central address in Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere the Quartier Latin and the gay village adjoin at a right angle. The trendy Plateau district and Old Montreal are both within ten blocks, and what isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t within walking distance is a short train ride away, as the two main lines of Metro intersect right under the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dguests needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even walk outside as there is a connecting passage through the mall adjacent to the hotel lobby. And since the hotel is a few blocks from the central business district, on the eastern edge of downtown, the rooms on the west side of the hotel on the 10th floor and above have amazing views of the skyline, the mountain, and St. Lawrence River. The city 747 bus from the airport drops just a block away, and even the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bus terminal is across the park. All of that said, the immediate blocks can be a bit destitute, and the stretch of Ste. Catherine just west of the hotel to about St. Laurent can be rough\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough the city is doing some street improvements that might help improve things. The hotel started its life in the 1960s as one of the three highrise Holiday Inns in the center of the city. One remains\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Holiday Inn on the 400 West block of Sherbrooke, and this one became a part of the Gouverneur chain some time ago. I doubt in its current condition it could still be a Holiday Inn, to be frank\u00e2\u20ac\u201das the interior and the rooms appear to have been last renovated in 1989. My room\u00e2\u20ac\u201d1204--overlooked the skyline and mountain\u00e2\u20ac\u201drooms ending in even numbers have the advantageous views, even if the front desk tries to protect/upcharge for those. Be insistent. Then again, the windows were caked in dirt. Despite being a solo traveler, my room had two beds. Few hotels are doing bedspreads anymore, and these were shiny and unattractive. Then again, they matched the rather awful d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the rest of the room. Beds, once you get rid of the nasty bedspreads, are comfortable. Internet is not great\u00e2\u20ac\u201drather slow and flaky\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it is free. Oddly, the outlets are so old that plugs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in the wall. There is a business center, but only business level guests\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe facility is on the 30th floor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhave keyed access. Go figure. If the room d\u00c3\u00a9cor was dated, the bathroom was just gross. The grout in the bathroom was stained in places, mold was growing on the edge of the wallpaper as it met the ceiling, and the bathtub, shower curtain, and straight rod were ancient. The bathroom sink had a bite taken out of it the size of a half dollar or CDN loonie. On the plus side, the amenities are from Neutrogena, and the shower pressure is great\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmakes for a very enjoyable shower. Makes sense in a hotel where you likely feel the need to take a shower frequently. The fitness center is in terrible shape. There are two treadmills\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth out of order the weekend I stayed here\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand four exercise bikes. Then there is a weight machine in clear need of maintenance. The pool is adjacent, and usually filled with screaming kids. I got the room through a Priceline bid for $68 a night, and it was about worth that.

The good part of the stay at Gouvereur Hotel is that is strategically situated in the Latin Quarters and almost in top of a mayor METRO station and next to a Bus Terminal. The hotel is not a bad property, my disappointment is mostly with HOTWIRE as they sold it as a 3.5 Star when is nowhere near that rating. When I send them my concern, all they had to say was that they visited thousands of properties a year and that they were confident on their ratings. Well... that certainly closed the book for me on any posibilities of HOTWIRE as I find their rating far from true and sad n a way as they just confirmed they have no idea of how to rate a hotel. HOTWIRE relates HILTON, MILLENIUM CROWN PLAZA and similars to a 3.5!!! You be the judge! I would visit the hotel again if I got it at half the rate or way under a hundred dollars. The Gouverneur Hotel is more of a MOTEL than a Hotel. But I would recommend it as a 2 Star. You are better off paying $20.00 dollars more and a known brand hotel.

The subway station is next block (actually there is entrance from the downstairs food court; three of the four subway lines of the city pass through this station); there is a very nice shopping area across from the lobby area (supermarket, clothing stores and many restaurants, etc) and; it is next to the pedestrian shopping block, and so on. We stayed here for four nights, and did not have to drive at all. If you are a tourist, you would fall in love of the location. The receptionist staff was super friendly, the room was clean and spacious; and the bed was very conformable. Additional details: (1) Pick the even numbered rooms as they have a much better view. (2) Subway ticket is about $3 each way, $7 for all you can ride for 24 hours, and the best deal is the $14 for all you can ride for three days. (3) Chinatown is only two stations away on the orange line. (4) Wifi signal in the room is pretty good if you have your own computer. Using the computer at the Business Center will cost you a bundle. Notes to the hotel administration: (a) Although the room was very clean, you may want to remind the staff to wash the nice bay window better and more frequent. I enjoyed the beautiful city and park views, but the finger print marks on the inside and some dirt and spider web on the outside distracted from it. (b) The room furniture is well made, but you may want to start thinking of renovation as some people may think it starts to get outdated. Changing the TV to flat screen on the wall and free up some table top space will be helpful. Adding a safe in the room can be a bonus, and increasing the fan strength of the bathroom will help.

I know this is part of the CRAZY policy of giving prices excluding tax in both USA and Canada ( and nowhere else for obvious reasons, cos its stupid). But I would recommend using a site that includes these charges or contacting the hotel directly to find the final bill. 2nd They charge separately for breakfast depending on wheather you have a cold or hot buffet breakfast, This might be ok in a cheap hotel but feels very nickle and dime when you have to bring a voucher for breakfast each morning. Which if you forget, as i did, you will have to go back to your room like a bold child and get it, seriously at $200 a night. they can't check a computor in the restaurant or better still have on charge for breakfast and avoid these problems. god forbid someone should eat a hot breakfast when they've only paid for a cold.

He is cheerful, attentive (crisped my bacon at my request because the buffet bacon was underdone to my liking) anything I asked for he quickly and cheerfully attended to. The Gouverneur should be proud to have such a dedicated employee. Had a great rate 115$ CDN including breakfast buffet, 3rd night was 1/2 price! Parking $16.50 per 24 hr period.

I've also tried various other hotels in Montreal over the years. This is a large hotel, and the location is ideal for some people -- right on the edge of the Gay Village, convenient to the Metro, and within a long walk of Downtown Montreal. St. Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Street in this area has an impressive array of restaurants, clubs, bars, shops. Rue St. Denis & Rue St. Laurent, with dozens and dozens of wonderful restaurants, are close by. So in my mind, the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis has a very desireable location. Keeping this in mind, I do think that the hotel has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cruising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its location. Over the years, I think that the quality of the rooms has not kept pace. The rooms are now quite dated, and the entire hotel could use a complete renovation. The shower really needs to be upgraded. Everything still works, but the rooms seem to be from the 1970s, not from 2006. To compete with more modern hotels, this hotel should consider a major upgrade. If the hotel is not upgraded, some better amenities should be offered, such as free breakfasts (we were offered $5 breakfast coupons, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the entire cost of breakfast, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them), free Internet access, or free parking. The front desk staff was polite enough. The hotel garage is not at all user friendly, and I'd be concerned if I were to try to drive a SUV, or a car with an antenna. In any event, this hotel will probably continue to be very popular among select visitors, mainly because of its location, but next time, I think I'll stay somewhere else.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201cThe WORST hotel I've ever stayed at!!!

It was rated as a 4-star hotel on the website that I booked it through (Hotels.com) but it should have been more like 1-star! My whole family went to Montreal for my parents' 50th Anniversary celebration, which SHOULD have been a pleasurable experience. We all stayed at the Gouverneur Place Dupuis, and it turned out to be a nightmare! It was not in the best neighborhood. The fire alarms kept going off (sometimes in the wee hours of the night while we were sleeping); homeless people and drug addicts freely walked into the hotel to accost the guests and beg for money; the toilets, sinks and tubs all backed up in every single one of our rooms; we didn't always get the complimentary soaps and shampoos everyday; and the staff weren't exactly the most friendly. When we complained about all the problems, the front desk didn't accomodate us in any way... in fact; the manager we spoke with was quite rude! They basically didn't want to hear about any of our inconveniences! Customer service is dead at this hotel! You're definitely on own here. The parking garage is a joke too... the ceilings are so low. If you stay here, you'd better have a strong antenna on your vehicle. You have to crouch over to get out of your car and the spaces are so tight! Also, don't expect to find a spot in the garge if you spend a day out on the town and come back after 10:00! Nor are the valets there when they're supposed to be there 24 hours a day! Finally, I had booked all the rooms under my AAA membership to get a discount. I received an e-mailed confirmation of all the rooms and the discounts we'd all be getting, which I even printed the confirmation and showed the front desk upon check-in, but they told us that the hotel would only honor the AAA discount for me since I booked the rooms -- the others in my family all had to pay full price! Sounds awfully suspicious. Avoid this hotel at all costs! I can't think of anything nice to say about it.

I have stayed four times so far since last summer (the last time being 3 weeks ago) and I have a VERY hard time believing these people stories (minus maybe the fire department?). Yes, some of the lobby's fixtures might not be the most up-to-date but again, you're paying a rate of 149$ MAXIMUM on weekdays for a still pretty central hotel. Besides, the furniture, carpets, wallpapers and lighting fixtures are all updated, the elevators are fast and the pool is clean so what's the big deal? Gouverneur doesn't pretend to be a luxury Westin or Omni hotel. I never thought I'd find myself here defending a hotel but after reading the latest reviews, I felt compelled to write based on FOUR good and consistent stays over a little less than a year (and more If you include those of 2003-04). So at the end of May, a group of friends decided to go and celebrate my birthday in Montreal. We booked two rooms at the same time (standard rooms) for the Saturday night and we planned on going out. To make it convenient, I asked If it would be possible to get adjacent or communicating rooms. The lady at reservation said she would try her best and put up a request with the reservation. We arrived on the Saturday a little before 1 p.m even though check-in time is not before 3 and check-out is actually late, 1 p.m at the Gouverneur. To my surprise, they had our 2 rooms ready, on the same floor and actually adjacent! The check-in staff was pleasant and the whole process was quick. Our standard non smoking rooms on the 18th floor were clean and as advertised, just partly renovated. Obvious with the new carpet smell and the actual brand-new look of the carpet. Drapes, bedding and all lighting fixtures all brand new. Mattress was super comfortable, it actually reminded me of the Hyatt Grand bed... so being curious, I lifted the blanket a bit and it is the exact same Sealy pillowtop that the Hyatt Regency Montreal has that I love. I slept very well. The bathrooms have not been renovated yet but were very clean If a little outdated. No trace of mould in our bathroom. No plumbing problems in either room (or in any room I had in fact at this hotel so far, maybe I have been lucky?). We had all the necessary toiletries: soaps, shampoos, lotion, shower cap and even mouthwash, a toothbrush, a sewing kit and a shoe sponge in a standard room! The usual three clean large towels provided and I made a mess not realizing part of the shower curtain wasn't completely tucked in the tub. When I called for towels, three more were brought up (even though I had asked for one) within 10 minutes. Powerful shower. Basically, I really have nothing to say for the price paid. We went to swim before dinner and the lifeguard was very pleasant. The change rooms are clean but outdated. Breakfast: I did not feel rushed by the staff. Our waitress was pleasant and fast in her service. The buffet was good and filled with every possible choice as usual. She did not rush us out like mentionned previously and to be quite honest, I have never skipped that buffet for three reasons: the food is always good, the service is equally up to par and for a downtown Montreal hotel, at 12$, the price is more than reasonable for a buffet. To summarize it, this was another good stay at the Gouverneur. Rooms are always clean and I've never had any sort of plumbing or coffee/toiletries supply problems. Staff is pleasant, particularly Judith at the reception and the young Concierge (can't remember his name). When in the lobby, he overheard me trying to explain to my friends on how to get out back on the 40 and he offered a map and to take over so I could get out of the hotel. I thought this was very nice of him. They have never refused to honour the different rates I have booked and I have trouble believing that they would let punks and beggars in. How is that possible when there is a visible security guy in the lobby both during the day and at night? I can certify that I have never seen people from the park in front of the hotel come and trouble guests inside the lobby and even at the doors. I am sure with the firm alarm, some kind of compensation was offered or given. I am sure they could have done something given I always have been replied to when giving comments on their comment card. They seem to value their guest's feedback. The parking garage? Well, seriously, the ceiling is low that's true! But the Place Dupuis mall and office complex was built in the 1950s. What do you want the hotel to do about that? Dynamite the building so they can increase the ceiling by 2 feet? You're never more than 45 seconds (no exaggeration!) to the elevator. I'm 5'9 and I don't have to bend to walk. And finally, YES, the hotel is in the GAY village. It is a member of the IGLTA and it's even on their website. So expect to see homos. Unfortunately, yes you see homeless people in the park up front but you also have a beautiful view of the downtown Montreal skyline. It's not a dump nor a depressing hotel but don't expect the W!

As 'Drop the Stars' mentions in their review, some of the staff at the front desk (not to mention some of the dinner wait staff) are not very friendly or accommadating. They did not honor the Triple A pricing for 4 of the 5 rooms. They did not want to help their guests with anything. (As if they had a 5 point checklist stuffed in their front pockets. Anything not on that list they could not do) The hotel has very bad plumbing. In the 3 days we were there, the toilet in my room backed up 2 times. Two other rooms toilets backed up as well. Need I go into any details as to why this could be an embarrasing situation? The room next to mine had the sink clog twice and the room across the hall had a clogged bathtub. Cudos to the maintenance department? Does management intend to address this plumbing problem? The hotel's competition must own major shares in Canadian Roto Rooter stock. Then there is the issue of the fire alarm sounding off at 4:00 a.m. It was going for an hour. When I called the front desk to ask if everything was all right, their response was in a monotone voice only Dick Cavitt could imitate in one of his monologues. \"Please stay in your room sir, it's a false alarm. We are having trouble resetting the alarm.\" Meanwhile, the wide eyed guests from the upper floors are frantically herding down the stair wells in what I would say was not an organized or calm fashion. After an hour or more of this, the alarm quiets, but you can still here it on the upper and lower floors. After another hour those alarms quiet down. Everthing is now quiet........so we think. Now a different alarm sounds off much louder then the first (similiar to a W W I I Air Raid alarm). Am I supposed to trust the person at the front desk who happens to be on the ground floor, that everthing is OK? That alarm finally quiets down. Oh, look at the clock, it's time to get up. The day before we walked into the hotel lobby only to find out we could not go to our rooms. There were about 30 Canadian firemen blocking the elevators. They were checking for smoke with their meters. This ordeal went on for hours. It ended up someone released pepper spray. Toiletries, what can I say about toiletries? Will I get my soap today? What about my complimentary coffee packets? Or will I have to ask one of the other rooms for theirs again. One room requested toilet paper the night before, they called 3 times and finally received it at 9:30 in the a.m. There were 4 people in that room. They had to use toilets from some of their travel mates rooms. The parking garage is a joke. If you stand taller than 6'-2\", I hope you have a good back, because your walk to the elevators will be in a crouched position. The locals seem to use the garage too. You may be forced to use valet or another means for parking. The parking attendants don't speak English or French. When I went to the front desk to complain , they basically didn't want to hear it. They offered no comps or price breaks for the miserable stay. I could continue on about this frustrating experience, but instead I say this. Don't stay at this hotel unless you look into it thoroughly.
