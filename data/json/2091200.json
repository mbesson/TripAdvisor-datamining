Let me first start with the positive. The hotel is a very nice boutique hotel in the center of the tourist area. You can walk to all of the Old Town attractions, Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, etc. That is where the nice comments end. First, the hotel highly recommended a tour company for a Spice Bazaar/ Bospherous River cruise which, I thought would be nice. Well, it was great until I was left at the Spice Bazaar by the tour company, and had to find my own way to the river boat (5 other tourist were left in the middle of the Spice Bazaar as well). Once we met up with my tour company, there was no apology issued (I let it go at the time because the cruise itself was lovely); however, after the cruise I literally, was dropped off in the middle of the street at least 10 miles from my hotel after the tour was over and told to walk to the end of the street where my hotel was suppose to be and wasn't. When I called the hotel to find out why I wasn't dropped off at the hotel like I paid for, I was. When I got to the hotel, the front desk reception called the tour company after much prodding from me. I was outraged that he wasn't outraged that a \"professional tour company would just drop one of its guest off miles away in the middle of a street. Secondly, I came back to the hotel with a guest to have a drink in my room that I paid for; however, I was told that my guest could not accompany me upstairs. I told them that my guest was not staying the evening and they should even get a photocopy of his passport, but I was told he was absolutely not allowed upstairs. Now, I paid the two person rate when I made the room booking; however, I was the only person staying in the room, so if I wanted another person to come to my room, it should not have been a problem. I understand that this is an Islamic state; however, trust me when I say, there are plenty of non-married couples shacking up together in rooms...all I wanted to do was go change my wet shoes and have a drink! Thirdly, I have found some of the male staff member to be very rude and condescending towards me. I don't know if it's because I am a single woman traveling alone or if I am of a minority race, but I find it very distasteful. In particular, comments have been made about me in Turkish while blatantly looking at me and I have heard things being said under the breath. The particular staff members names I could get were Furkan and Abdullah. I reported these incidents to the GM, Arzu, and she was nice enough to listen and offer me the number of the booking company to see if I could get a refund for paying for two people instead of one...I couldn't. I don't want to end this on a sour note because there have been a few staff members who have been extremely nice, like the bell men and restaurant staff. I really like the hotel, but for overall service, I would pick somewhere that you and your guest would be welcomed and appreciated!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean & affordable\u201d", "Author": "farrahmu", "ReviewID": "UR127154932", "Content": "I was in Istanbul, Turkey for two nights recently and wanted to stay centrally.

The staff do not really know much english and they tried to make us pay for our room twice! Also do not book a taxi from here as they get a kick back on it.
