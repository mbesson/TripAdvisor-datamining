If you love Warhol and his art, this is the place to be. We love the cool image that this reflects on the entire hotel. Its Popi, artistic, fresh and young with young staff, good looking energetic and attentive. You can think that you are more in Manhattan then in Germany which is a great plus. Not that I have anything against German hotels, but you can agree that Manhattan has invested the cool style hotel that all are trying to copy. The hotel has also a cool bar into the night and I have notices the hotel guests socializing and mingling, I guess its the right mood the design puts you in...however the breakfast was just right with big choices and all fresh and tasty. This hotel offers excellent value for money,and I certainly recommend it for business travelers and tourists,who would like to be in the center of Berlin west side and close to all its attractions.short walk from the famous Kudam street and it famous department store and shopping . The room was spacy,open windows, with large bathroom, huge shower for two , bath tab and all amenities of five star hotel. You feel that you are in a large museum showing Andy Warhol art without buying ticket and waiting in long ques. We love Warhol art and I am sure that if he was alive he would love to stay here as well. Its such a great concept, I dont know why you don't have more there hotel like this in other cities.

I was inspired by the reviews from previous guests plus attractive price for a double room, and decided to book a room. The personnel at the reception was kind from the start, although always very busy and a bit stressed. It is true that it's well located, if you don't mind walking10 minutes under the rain to get to the closest metro station. It is only 100 meters from one of the most well-known shopping streets in Berlin (K-damm) if you're interested in that. The rooms were very clean, and with all the comfort expected in a 3 stars hotel (and nothing more, nothing extra, nothing \"luxurious\"). The TV was very old (not flat screen) and had only German channels. The WI-FI connection was excellent, and I was on the 6th floor. .. All in all it was ok, except from one episode: the room was very cold at night. The first night I tried to check the AC and adjust it myself, but to my surprise I found no \"switch\". I called the reception and they explained very kindly that the whole heating system is centrally managed for all the floors (thus one cannot regulate the temperature as desired) and that I should understand that it is hard to please everyone's needs. \"Some find it too hot others too cold\" (Exact words). And thus what they usually do, when enough guests complain at the same time, is to switch it on and high for some time until the guests call back complaining because it's too warm. She promised they would do that again. Moral: I slept with a sweater, socks and double cover (and I swear I'm not someone that usually suffers from being cold!) Close to the hotel (like 10 minutes walking) it's Savignyplatz, a beautiful and charming area full of cozy restaurants, cafes and small designers shops. You should check it out, especially at night! And for breakfast I'd recommend you the cafe that it's right underneath the entrance to Savigny train station, next to a bookshop. Actually, you shouldn't pay for having breakfast at the hotel, as it's plenty of beautiful cozy bars all around where you'll have a lot nicer breakfast at a lot lower price. Also, if you're going to Berlin for a Fair at the Messe Berlin, this is the right place to stay since it is very close and easy to get both with public transportation and by taxi (only 8 euros).", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful staff and great hotel\u201d", "Author": "Louise M", "ReviewID": "UR123168861", "Content": "Excellent hotel.

Firstly, we paid extra for a large room, which upon arrival was two beds pushed together, not a double. We asked for a double and were given a key to a room the size of a shoe box that stank of smoke. Hence, we went with the large twin bed room. The room was nice and big and furnished with average furniture (nothing like the one on the groupon picture). No double duvet; two single, pillows were old and lumpy, towels were grey and threadbare. The bathroom was clean with a bath and shower which was very powerful, but the shower screen was tiny, and as a result the floor became waterlogged after every shower, which made it very dangerous. First night we had our three course meal. Starter was rocket, paramasan and balsamic salad. This was rocket leaves, with a spoonful of grated parmesan and was drenched in balsamic which made it virtually inedible. Main was pasta with a chicken breast with a slab of mozzarella grilled on top of it. The pasta was so over cooked it was waterlogged and just disintegrated in your mouth. Pudding was berry compote with custard (packet) on top this was ok. Basically on the whole it was revolting. If you read other reviews, many people say this. The hotel responds by saying the issue has been sorted. IT HAS NOT. The food is dreadful, and they are still serving the same rubbish they have been serving for ages. So, off to bed, only to be woken at 7,30am by drilling and hammering (please follow links for some footage, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxw6fsw-5QQ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zencFZjkPc) It was unbearably loud. We asked at reception what was going on and were given some excuse about the building next door, and how it might be part of the hotel but they weren\u2019t sure so it wasn\u2019t really their fault. Now, for building work that wasn\u2019t part of the hotel, the builders used the lift, the hotel lobby, the floor we were staying on and one even went behind the reception desk \u2013 hummmm. I think we may have been fobbed off. So, then to breakfast. Tried the sausages and what I thought were hash browns (they were actually mini burgers) and the scrambled egg; all pretty horrible. Next day opted for fruit and yoghurt and a croissant; this was fine, but in fairness it would be harder to get this wrong! There was also the usual cereal, bread, ham, cheese, smoked salmon etc. Next morning, woken again but drilling, but this time they managed to hold off till 8am. We then hired bikes and had them charged to our room. We packed, came to reception and stored our bags, my partner paid up the hotel bill and off we went on the bikes. We returned at 3pm and sat in reception, in full view of both receptionists until 4pm when my partner went to get some cash for the taxi. We then walked across the road to the taxi rank, with just enough cash for the fare and a bite to eat at the airport. We were then stopped by a panting receptionist who had chased us across the road, asking for 20 euros for the bikes, 20 euros that should have been charged to our rooms. We paid, which then left us short of the taxi so we had to stop enroute to get out more money, at an additional cost, to cover the fare. This hotel could be good, but it wasn\u2019t.

The stay was to include breakfast. 3 course dinner on one evening, a bottle of wine and a packed lunch on one day. The hotel itself was cool, in a great location and the staff on arrival were very friendly. We were told when checking in that the meal was from a set menu. We arrived to dinner and again the service was faultless but I can honestly say it was some of the worst food we had ever tasted. So bad that we just had to laugh about it. Breakfast was fine and served in our room (which was meant to be included in the deal but which we saw they'd tried to charge us for on check out and was quite a palava to get it taken off). All in all (despite a pleasant stay and loving the city) there was absolutely no way that our stay was worth \u00a3425!!! We had been uttterly duped there. The main issue has been since returning having found that the hotel have made another pending transaction of \u00a3255 to my account (despite my having paid for the hotel upfront via Groupon). It has now been two weeks and despite the twoing and froing with the hotel (who initially blamed it on my bank) I still haven't had the money returned to my account. I have been going back and forth with the hotel owner Katja and found her totally unwilling to accept any blame for this and has even gone as far to claim that many hotels around the world take such 'ghost transactions' from your account to secure the booking. This is total nonsense and I have never heard of any hotel taking money provisionally for a room that has already been paid for. The saga continues!!! Based on the latter, I will never stay at this hotel or any of it's chain again.

Other things that brought this hotel down somewhat was the fact that our cleaner didn't bother replenishing our complimentary teas/coffees in the morning, and initially when we asked for more we were told to go and buy one downstairs in the bar. This was however rectified on day three when we spoke to the reception staff who shortly came up and refilled our supply. Although the cleaner had put the cups and spoons back in their places in the cupboard they hadn't washed them, there were still chocolate on the spoons! The cleaner also didn't bother giving us more shower gel/body lotion on day two, simply filled up the slots with shampoo, the one thing we actually had ourselves. Although the booking on Expedia said the hotel has free wireless access, and there is a sign in the hotel, the wireless simply wouldn't connect and we ended up using the expensive internet PC in reception which wasn't very fast.

Near the hotel are loads of excellend places to eat and drink - the nearby wine bar and sushi places are excellent, as are the traditional German places to eat. Another plus point about this hotel is that it is very near the U1 train line, which takes you to the centre of Berlin very easily- a good tip is to get travel passes from tourist information - 24 euro for 3 72 hours unlimited travel is a bargain.

She chose this hotel from a search on the web of the variety of hotels available in Berlin, then booked a flight with Ryanair and we made our way to the hotel via the rail link from Schonefeld Airport to Savignyplatz Station, a short walk from the hotel. We had read the reviews about this hotel on the web, which in certain cases gave some back feedback, unfounded in our case. I can honestly say we were apprehensive on arrival but on walking through the door, we were greeted by very friendly staff, who were professional in there approach to us and certainly went out of there way to make our three day stay a joy to behold. We booked breakfast for each morning (buffet style) the variety of food on offer was excellent and plentiful, (they had a special offer on at 8 euros each). We asked for a quite room and received one on the top floor (6th) to the back of the building facing a court yard. On walking in we were delighted with the colour scheme and the Andy Warhol theme, which is present through out the hotel (no we are not Andy Warhol fans). We found the whole of the hotels decor to be very pleasing on the eye. Cleanliness and comfort was first class along with TV and the usual mod cons. No tea/coffee maker in the room, which wasn't a problem This hotel is not central in Berlin but we walked right across Berlin, from the hotel in the west to the East Side Gallery (Berlin Wall). I work as a freelance in the Tourism and Travel sector as a Photojournalist so this was a great opportunity to capture many images of life around Berlin.

Picked the Art'otel because had stayed at other properties and liked them. The property is unique due to the Warhol theme. Get prepared for some bright purples and greens. It's all in fun though. I would stay here again due to the surrounding neighborhoods As usual, the good, bad and ugly. The Good - Room was clean and fairly-well kept (a new paint job could be used). The room had essentials and was fine. Nothing too amazing - everything fairly standard. Room had good size closet along with a sizeable enough room. It had bed only and no room for separate sitting area. - Bathroom - sizeable and clean. Had decent shower. - Location for the price. The location is about a 10ish minute walk to city-center (West Berlin). The subway could be had in about half that time. - Neighborhoods surrounding the hotel. We ate each night in the neighborhood at great restaurants with good value. Do yourself a favor, and branch out around the hotel and find some of these jewels. - Front desk arranged van service to airport for 15 Euros. Pick up was on time and the ride was quite pleasant. The Bad - 16ish Euros each for breakfast. Too high priced in my eyes. While there was a decent selection of OK food, close cafes made it a no-brainer for following mornings. - Check-in. While the hostess did a nice quick job, she assigned a smoking room after asking for a non-smoking. When I went down to inform her, she was waiting for me. My thought is she could have met me on the floor, admitted the mistake and gave me new room keys versus waiting for me. There were multiple people behind the desk so leaving the front area should have been fine. - If you are planning on spending most of your time in \"East\" Berlin, this may not be the best place. While the public transportation system was excellent, it took us 40ish minutes to get from hotel to Alexanderplatz including one metro line change (bus system was on strike). - The towels. The smell of the clean towels was absolutely horrid. The typical vinegar-like smell is horrid. I do not understand why hotels do not spend a bit more to ensure fresh smelling towels or have no smell at all. The Art'otel is not the only hotel with this issue. The Ugly - Nothing.

The only downside was the overpriced and lackluster breakfast. Having stayed in many German hotels, the usual breakfast fare was much better at other places. In fact, most of them were punishing in their many choices! If you stay there, plan on tourist activities in central Berlin and outlying areas via Bahn/U-Bahn. Don't expect anything extra. It's a bare bones place with fun, modern design.

We were a group of 6 women. The restaurant area is quite stylish, though empty apart from at breakfast time. We had one breakfast there which was good, but expensive. Better to go somewhere else to eat. Recommend the Twelve Apostles for breakfast which is an Italian restaurant about 10 minutes walk away. Reception were friendly and helpful, and in fact it was them that recommended the Italian restaurant. The rooms are very clean, well-equipped and generally comfortable. It was very hot at night, and there the air conditioning didn\u2019t seem to work. The standard is a double rather than a twin bed, and even though we had specified twins we got doubles. After the first night, they were able to find rooms with twin beds. Location is good for shopping and eating out, but the main sites are not walking distance away. However we found taxis cheaper than in the UK. This is a Warhol themed hotel, with many prints and photos. I liked the prints but could have done with less photos ;-)", "Date": "July 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cIt's fine, but is basic and not customer friendly\u201d", "Author": "LinnyUKNZ", "ReviewID": "UR3504892", "Content": "The hotel position is alright and reasonably close to a train station - which you will need to use to get around to see the main sights, which are mainly centre East. Upon arrival our room was not ready and we were offered a larger room for an extra \u20ac10 per night. For the sake of convenience we said yes - guess they bank on that. The room was fine, clean, but very basic. There wasn't even tea / coffee making facilities, something I expect as standard and have always had, even from lower star rated hotels. I enquired at the hotel desk about this and found that it was available, at an extra cost of \u20ac8 per day. I guess they want to encourage guests to use the hotel's bar / restaurant facilities. Whilst staying there I wasn't aware that any of their recreational facilities were on site - I think they had nothing and that everything must have been in the vicinity of the hotel. When we checked out there were 4 other sets of guests at the desk and all had problems. One lot had been 'upgraded' but hadn't been informed that it would cost them more money - luckily we were told of the extra cost. One lot had a baby and were put in a room which had no bath and so they couldn't bath the baby = they wanted to move rooms which seemed to be a problem... I think that showers were standard, rather than baths. The others were also querying their bills as they were checking out. Basically this hotel is fine, but I think you could probably pay the same money for somewhere better or for a better location. Somewhere that is managed better and is more customer aware and friendly, that isn't constantly trying to make more money out of you - I know that all hotels are trying to do this, but not all are so blatant about it.", "Date": "May 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cLocation was not the top\u201d", "Author": "manhattan74", "ReviewID": "UR3471702", "Content": "First of all, beware of the gym : THERE's NO GYM, in despite of what they say in their brochures.

The staff is correct, but dont expect too much from them... ordered a wake up call and they forget it, placed a dont disturb signal in the door, and housekeeping was entering in the room every half hour the same.... There's a internet point in the lobby, but 5 Euros/hour doesnt seem to be any good deal...(no fraction time) The location is not superb,.. the main touristic spots are far far far away from there... if i ever visit the city of berlin, i ll be for sure in Mitte, which is the area to stay for the first time when on tourism in Berlin. Got a rate of 68 Eur nite (excl breakfast) and at that price is okay...
