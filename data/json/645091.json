I was asked if I wanted a shower. This should be a basic part of the hotel set up and checked to be working properly. In the morning we went down to the basement for breakfast, no cornflakes, not cordial drink all which only cost a couple of pence to buy. I fork that was lighter than a feather. We had a choice of fried eggs on toast or scrambled eggs on toast and coffee and tea. I am ashamed to say I paid to stay in this filthy hole.

Where to begin ... the first thing that we noticed was that the sink was permanently running. I asked the man running the place at the front desk (sadly, I did not catch his name, but he worked the night shift on August 11th, 2007) about what he could do. He lied to me on several occasions about what could be done. The story changed each time that I asked. We later noticed that the heater could not be turned off and that the room was permanently at a temp. approaching 80F (on a cool London night of about 55-60F). He replied that it is a UK thing that people like to have their rooms at that temperature and that it is that way in every room. Having stayed in the UK the two months leading up to this visit, I knew that he was simply continuing with his morally bankrupt manner as he was with the running sink. When I mentioned the sink again, he said that no one had actually ever complained about it before. I find it hard to believe that no one had ever complained about a sink running, that is 3 feet from your head as you sleep in a room that is 7 feet by 7 feet. The next pleasant surprise came at around 2am when the heater began making a load moaning sound. My girlfriend and had to wake up about every half hour for the rest of the night to kick the thing to make it stop. Long story short, avoid staying here at all costs. If London has anything similar to a better business bureau, this hotel should be reported and the deceitful man should be fired, fined and shunned from decent society. How he sleeps at night is a mystery, both with respect to the horrific conditions of the hotel and his complete lack of moral character. If no other place is available, as was the case in my situation, I would suggest sleeping at the Queensway Underground stop, or in a park, or on a sidewalk. At least you wouldn't have to be angered by blatant lies, unpleasant heat, and moaning noises all night. I'll risk being robbed over that any day.", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAwful, awful, awful..

We were in London for a wedding in August 2006 and the groom very kindly arranged accomodation for all the guests..at The Queens. When we arrived the outside looked nice enough, however the receptionist was grumpy and sour. We were made pay cash on arrival which should have been the first clue. I had to change for a wedding, however as we arrived at 11.30 we were told that I would have to change in the cubicles in the toilets. My partner put his foot down and we were grudgingly given a room on the ground floor, we had explained that we didn't mind if the room wasn't made up and would be willing to wait. On the way we passed a trolley full of linen. The room smelled of smoke, the decor was peeling and the carpet was dusty. We returned later that night after the wedding. The bed was lumpy, the numbers were missing from the room doors and it was just not clean. We didn't bother staying for breakfast for the next day as we just wanted to leave. The only good thing about the hotel is that it is located to some nice cafes and shops so we found a lovely place for breakfast, but please, do NOT go here. Friends of ours had another room and noticed that there was an active trade going on at 2am...so be warned.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cNightmare in Queen's Hotel\u201d", "Author": "anonymous1985", "ReviewID": "UR7835954", "Content": "You can hear the toilet flush next door in the middle of the night.
