Most of the staff was nice (minus one particular lady that's at the front desk in the afternoon) and I found that only the man on duty at night speaks English. Our reservation was messed up so we had to move twice in 5 days. No big deal. One room was had no windows with no fans, and got musty quickly. One single room actually shared a balcony with another room\u2026odd. Rooms that overlook the street get noisy, smell a little from the sewage outside, and windows provide no noise insolation. Bathrooms are clean but smell like pork from the restaurant downstairs. The rooms also have carpet, which kinda grosses me out. Great location, near some good food options and between 2 metro stops. Great location, clean, and safe. Overall, good budget choice.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san miguel de allende", "Title": "\u201cSolid Budget Choice\u201d", "Author": "susanmex", "ReviewID": "UR110285526", "Content": "I've stayed at the Hotel Washington several times now. The location is outstanding, one block from the zocolo, across the street from the Juice Bar Canada, just a few feet from Cafe El Popular and La Blanca for late night eats. Clean, small rooms, tiny bathrooms but everything one needs. The towels and bedding have been recently upgraded, and the city is in the midst of renovating the colonial facade.

Located one block from the Cathedral, just behind the Monte de Piedad. The building is late 18th century, but the rooms are modern and spotless. A single, at time of writing, costs USD $26 per night for one or two sharing a bed. Corner rooms with two balconies are a bit more, at $30. Most rooms have balconies overlooking the street with big french doors. The beds are clean comfortable. The bathrooms are very clean with ample hot water (you may have to wait a few minutes). The rooms all have TVs, (with cable) and phones. Next door is the venerable Cafe Popular, with 24 hour service. A breakfast with eggs scrambled with bacon, a plate of fresh fruit, a bun or two and yummy traditional Mexican cafe con leche cost USD $4.50. The hotel, as I mentioned, is one block from the Zocalo, and from Mexico City's phenomenal subway system (fare USD $0.20!!!) which will take you practically everywhere in town. The lobby is very simple, but the staff is very friendly (they remembered me from my last visit 18 months ago!) Downside: It can be noisy during the day (the horn is the Mexican brake pedal) but, mercifully, the traffic dies down around bed time, so as long as you re not one to sleep late, you'll be OK (or bring earplugs.). I warmly recommend this hotel!", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Washington", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1020686-Reviews-Hotel_Washington-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av Cinco De Mayo No 54</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">06000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1020686", "ImgURL": ""}}
