We were there 4 nights and every day they promised to fix/replace broken hair dryer and it was not done until the last day. I am not sure what the maids did, other than remake the bed....dirty tea cups and trash was not removed....wet towels were not replaced, bathroom was not cleaned. Shower had only a half door so bathroom floor was flooded after showers and no bathmat or anything other than towels to mop up... toilets had to be flushed 3-4x.....the list goes on. Worst part was the staff was completly unconcerned and did nothing they said they would, in fact asked us to leave early so they could get someone else in the room. We were on the top floor and could hear the subway rumble every 5 minutes as it shook the whole building, I can't even imagine what it would be like on lower floors trying to sleep under those conditions.

Well thats the good points out of the way and here is why you shouldn't stay here, firstly when we arrived the receptionist was taking two personal calls on his phone(s) whilst checking us in, before passing us a key and gesturing downstairs. We had a basement room and within 5 minutes we realised that the hotel is located directly above 2 tube-lines, why the hotel decided to use the basement rooms knowing that sleeping in them before 1 am and after 4:30 am would be impossible I don't know. Secondly, we had booked a double room, we got two poor quality single beds pushed together with a rather large ridge between them. We asked to be moved to another room but the receptionist said \"no\", clearly this hotel has caused them a lot of stress in the past because he didn't even bother to ask what was wrong with our room. Also, if you are planning on arriving late (after 9 pm) then good luck, one man had booked a room only to arrive and be told that all the rooms had been booked up, a clever tactic by the hotel since they know many customers will end their stay early. After approximately 3 hours sleep we went upstairs with our bags packed and told the receptionist that we were leaving, he did offer us another room (which was on a higher floor, but filthy, and you could still hear the tube underneath), we said that we didn't want to stay in any of their rooms. One more plus point is if you shout at them then they will give in and only charge for one nights stay.

Not sure if it is still in business, though it's website is still up and running. The 18th Century Victorian is a beautiful building in a fantastic neighborhood. My room was on the third floor and there was not lift. The clerk helped to carry my bags upstairs, thankfully. I got into the room and the double bed nearly took up every square inch of the room. \"Oh well,\" I thought. \"This is London. Rooms will be small.\" I had just flown in from the US and after taking the train from Gatwick, then the tube, I was plain exhausted. I laid down on the bed and was lying in my...well...my underwear (it was record heat in London that summer and no air conditioning in the room), when someone tried opening the door. It apparently didn't lock! Not just that one time, but it DOESN'T LOCK. I had to stack my suitcase and carry on bag in front of the door. The bed was dismal. It looks like they got the linens from a second-hand store. The bathroom light fixture was hanging out of the wall on it's poor electrical wire. I was spending the first 5 days in London solo and then I was rendezvousing with a suitor who would be coming in from Scotland. \"Holy cow,\" I thought to myself. \"This place looks like a pay-by-the-hour dump.\" I was mortified. Apparently, the Tube was underneath our hotel and even though I was on the third floor, the place shook like crazy and it sounded as though I was right on top of the train. But the absolutely most priceless part of the whole thing was the fire alarm that went of FOUR TIMES DURING THE NIGHT and stayed on during the day. This went on for TWO DAYS. Management told me that there was a problem with the fire alarm and they were trying to get it fixed. Breakfast was paltry. Cereal and warm juice. It was meager and just plain sad. What makes me chuckle is that my first morning there, there was a long line of people (myself included) waiting to get on the computer. We were all looking for another place to stay. It was tough. Wimbledon was going on and The World Cup was going on in Europe that year, so there were more travelers than usual in England. (sigh) I did find a place in the same neighborhood--The Lennox Hotel--which was significantly more, but I needed a place...ANY place that wasn't the Blue Bells Hotel. But let me tell you the one bright spot about Blue Bells Hotel. The management did not charge me a penalty for leaving early. I went in on Wednesday and said I was checking out the next morning (I had it booked through Saturday). They were amazingly accommodating and even offered to help me with my bags. When I left the morning I checked out, it was a bit drizzly in the morning. I walked out with a big smile on my face, knowing that I was going around the corner to a much better hotel when I slipped on the steps and fell hard on my bum.

We asked for a room on a lower floor because of my mum's back problems, even though we've read that the Underground was \"unbarable\" lower down. We got a twin room on the first floor. We didn't mind about the Underground, sure, it made some noise but on the evenings the trains didn't go very often. The room was quite small but ok, I mean, you don't go to London to sit at the hotel all the time. We had a window with a view of a brick wall, again, we didn't mind. At least there was a window! The bathroom was clean and modern and we also had a bathtub. The thing is - we couldn't use the tub because we could only get water from the shower thing and while filling the tub from the shower the water almost got cold. There was a rather large color tv in the room, hairdryer, telephone and coffee- and tea making facilities. The room was overall a bit worn out but the beds were comfortable. It was very hot in the room, we tried to turn down the heat but it didn't work so we kept the window open which was a bit of a challenge but the room got cooler. There was also free wireless internet access that I could use in the room and not only in the common areas. All of the staff was nice and friendly. One thing was a bit odd - when you left the room you had to leave the key at the reception and then get in when you came back. They said it was for safety reasons. The hotel had a luggage room where you could leave your luggage before checking in and after checking out which was very good so you didn't have to carry it all around! Breakfast was totally ok, toast with different sorts of jam, cereal, milk, juice, tea and coffee. There could've been some cheese too, but other from that it was good. Location of this hotel is excellent - just a couple of minutes walk from Notting Hill Gate, shops, food, parks and of course Portobello Road.

Having a very tired 4 year old with us, we decided - after having argued with the receptionist for a while, to go to the other hotel - Chelsea House Hotel. We had deliberatly booked at Hotel Blue Bells because of the excellent location, so it was quite a dissapointment to be taken to a whole different area of town, that didn't at all live up to our expectations.

But then we realized that most of the reviews on the other hotels we were looking at were also negative so it seems that people are quick to complain, but do not always take the time to compliment. So here is a different opinion of Blue Bells: We stayed for 6 nights, and we had a room on the top floor. There is no elevator, so getting the bags upstairs was a bit of a struggle, but lack of an elevator is common in European hotels in this category, so that was not an unexpected problem. The room was large with 2 twin beds and a television. Both the room and the modern bathroom were very clean and the towels provided were as large as beach towels, much better than you find at budget hotels in the US. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom, so no need to bring one from home. There was also a refrigerator in the room, and the staff was more than accommodating in providing glasses for us take to our room so we could enjoy cold drinks. There was an electric pot for heating water, which was helpful when my companion caught a cold and needed to take medicine dissolved in hot water. All in all, the room was very comfortable and perfect for our needs. You do hear the Underground from time to time (even on the top floor) but it does not run all night, so it did not bother us. I can imagine if you were on a lower floor you might have more of a problem with that. Surprisingly, the walls are not soundproof, so we could hear quite a bit of noise from our neighbors. But that is not the fault of the hotel, that is the fault with people not being considerate of others around them and being too loud late at night. But again, it was not that much of a problem. About the only complaint that I would have about the room was that there was not good lighting by the beds. The only light in the room was the main overhead light. It would have been nice to have a light by the bedside. The breakfast was simple but satisfying (toast, cereal, orange juice, tea/coffee). If you are looking for more than that, you would have to go out. But it was typical of a continental breakfast in many hotels and the service was always prompt and friendly. The staff at the hotel was helpful and accommodating. There is a computer for guests to use in the breakfast room, so we were able to check online for tours and activities. That was a big surprise as most hotels in this category don't have internet access for their guests. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to go back. We definitely got our money's worth. At the rate we paid, we were not expecting a deluxe hotel, and it is certainly not in that category, but for a moderate hotel, it was great. The staff did admit that some of their rooms are not as nice as others, so you would want to be sure to request a room on the upper floors. It was worth climbing the stairs to get to a better room. Oh, and they do have a room for storing luggage if you arrive early or leave late.

The first set of nights, we were put in a tiny room, (#32) which I expected without a refridgerator, like I had requested, and we were on the 3rd floor. The bathroom, while slightly grimy, was okay and even bigger than I expected. The bedding was clean, as were the towels, which were quite large. The tv worked and we felt we had enough room for our luggage(2 large suitcases, 2 carry-ons), we just had to be creative about it. The water was generally hot. The things that went wrong were as follows: Broken hairdryer - I was given one that did work, however, the phone doesn't call to the desk, so down the stairs I went. No heat - we did have two space heaters, one was broken. Outlets - one did not work, and the other one blew my adapter up. Water pressure - If you got in early enough, no problem. Sometimes we were lucky enough to get no pressure for about 5 minutes. The one phone to call out on in the lobby - did not work, supposly was to be repaired. Our second stay there, we were given a much bigger room (#22), with a smaller bathroom, but with a refridgerator. However, the beds were two twin sized ones, but we were able to push them together. The hair dryer and heat worked in this one, plus we even got a table, and more outlets. Wireless internet even worked on occasion in this room. What went wrong: The toilet seat was wooden...gross. The shower...my poor husband got a really cold shower with little to no water pressure on one occassion. The lamps - they could really use some lamp shades. Carpet - little bit dirtier than the first time. The one phone to call out on in the lobby - STILL did not work, supposly was to be repaired. Overall, the staff was mainily all foreign and generally not very knowledge of London sites and the hour of operations for many places. Wireless internet was free in the breakfast area. Breakfast was ho-hum. Cereal, coffee, tea, warm orange juice (which that's pretty much how it is in Europe), toast and jam. Nothing exciting there, but it was nice to grab something to eat and the lap-top and plan out the day. You basically get what you pay for, and in all honesty, we weren't traveling to stay in a hotel. We were hardly there, so it worked out okay for us. I wouldn't ever stay there again though.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGrotty, noisy and insecure\u201d", "Author": "whymeSydney", "ReviewID": "UR11980710", "Content": "Bed in twin room let as a single was comfortable and sheets and towels clean - which was just as well as they were not changed during my ten day stay.

They are price and location. If you are expecting anything more, stay elsewhere! The hotel is very basic having been converted from a large private residence. It is relatively clean and functional. Sufficient for sleeping, bathing and marginal continental breakfast. We arrived at 4:00 pm and our room was not : \"ready Yet\". We left our luggage which we had been told would be placed in our room. We left until 9:00 pm and our luggage was still in the office. So, I retrieved luggage and brought it to our room myself. Beware of the bathroom tub, There is no hand rail and the bathtub is slippery. My wife fell hard in tub. Thank God she did not break a leg. The splash guard on side of tub is not designed to be hand guard and gave way on her way down. Also, ventilation in bathroom is limited to small window out to breezeway. The tubes run underground. Every 15 minutes, sounds like a roller coaster runs in basement. This keeps up until 11:00 pm and starts again about 6:00 AM. Ear plugs made this manageable. The continental breakfast is very marginal . I was not expecting much and I was correct to do so. I had a much better included contentient breakfast elsewhere in London. The room where breakfast was held was tiny and too small for the number of travelers who filed in waiting for breakfast. The 2 ladies who worked there were alway very busy but little seemed to get done. I think this was their extra job before going elsewhere for their day job. Orange juice was served warm. Toast is your best bet although toaster was semi broken and only produced 3 slices at a time. I seemed uncomfortable asking for 8 slices for my family of 4. This was not adequate as 20 people filled the room and some were waiting in the television area waiting to get one of the too few seats... you get the idea. There is a free internet in the breakfast room. It is only 8 minutes brisk walk to tubes. Staff were helpful in calling taxi. Do remember ear plugs, beware of the bathroom as you might slip without tub handrail. I found Days Inn Westminster to be more modernized with better breakfast, but pricier.
