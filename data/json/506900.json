However our experience I am afraid directly contradicted this. Hotel des Arts is located in a narrow, steepish street, bustling with people at all times of the day and night. The reception was friendly enough, the room was very small and dark with poor lighting - quite claustrophobic; the shower even smaller (perhaps the smallest cubicle I have ever used). There was no mirror or proper lighting in the bedroom so we had to share the mirror in the bathroom for hair, shaving, make-up and every other luxury! The room overlooked a very small dark square of a yard. The daylight was somewhere up above. This wasn't a problem; what was a problem was that during the night the moving of what we think was rubbish bins in the yard below exploded into our consciousness at least twice on each night, giving me quite a fright the first time it happened; the noise was so loud that even ear plugs had no effect. People talking in the lobby at all times of the night, woke us and kept us both awake. Then at 6.30am on the first morning we were awoken by a member of staff shouting \"taxi\". Wrong door; wrong people. The second night the chamber maid unlocked the door and made to enter our bedroom whilst we were both in bed in the morning; she thought we would be at breakfast. We were not amused. In all the hotel was very expensive (in our view) for what it provided - minimum additions; even the one bottle of water on the desk which we drank the first evening was not replaced for the second day. The old bottle was simply left there. We could not help reflecting that this would never happen in even the most basic of bed and breakfast accommodation that we have experienced elsewhere. We are sorry but we were somewhat disappointed over all.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cHotel des Arts\u201d", "Author": "LukaMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR126803469", "Content": "A very pleasant hotel located in a great part of Paris near Sacre Coeur on a decent hill.

Both the staff and the information desk had a good range of information available on Paris in general and Montmartre in particular.

Our third floor twin room was clean, with nice silky curtains and matching bedspreads, a good size closet/wardrobe, flat-screen TV, small desk, free WiFi (that worked well), small in-room safe and a single window that faced a tiny courtyard -- hence no view or daylight. Bathroom was cramped but very clean and stocked with good toiletries. Breakfast is served in a small, tidy room in the basement, from 7am. I did not like the coffee. Food was okay -- the sort of bread and croissants that French supermarkets sell. Nearby bakeries offer much tastier treats (Les Petits Mitrons on rue Lepic and Le Grenier a Pain Abbesses are a couple of favorites). Charming Coquelicot bakery/restaurant, at 24 rue des Abbesses, serves breakfast and has some tables outside too.

OUR ROOM: We got to stay in room 60, it is on the last floor, bigger than the others on that floor. When you look out the window, you can see the Eifel Tower. The bathroom is not small at all, and in the room there is more than enough place for all your stuff. To get to the room you can use the elevator to the 5th floor and than go up the stairs once more. The room was really clean, the cleaning lady visited every day. It was very quiet, the bed was comfy. THE HOTEL: The hotel stuff is very friendly. All walls have pretty pictures. The atmosphere is really artistic and cosy. BREAKFAST: We didn't get breakfast at the hotel, because there are so many amazing bakeries around. We loved getting our breakfast from \"Le Grenier a Pain\" (http://www.legrenierapain.com/en/) - a price winning bakery, 1 min. walking from the hotel, normal prices.

The bedroom was small with space only for a double bed and a desk, but it was very comfortable and with all you might need including a safe box, extra covers and tv. Only negative is that it had no AC which its not needed in November because its cold but you need to open a window which allows for noise from the outside. We had a view of the Eiffel tower from our room. The bathroom had a hand shower which made it a bit difficult to bathe, it has hot water and the bathtub is big. We only got one soap bar, but they also had shampoo, conditioner, lotion and shower gel. The staff is available and courteous all the time. They arranged pickup from the hotel to the airport and kept our luggage after our check out so we could go sightseeing. Wifi: free!! Location: two blocks from a metro station from which you have access to the city. Close to Moulin Rouge and lots of cafes, pattisseries, creperies and small markets.

The staff who all spoke great English were helpful and informative. Our room on the 5th floor was delightful facing inwards .... Not exactly a courtyard but facing other windows and very quiet. Our friends on the 2nd floor faced the street and it was a bit noisier but quite interesting to watch the world go by. Our superior twin room with very modern bathroom was quite large enough with flat screen TV and more than adequate. The weather was unseasonably warm so it did get rather hot with no A/C and there was not the usual tea making equipment. A new twist was a plastic baggie with the invitation to take our soap and toiletries home with us. We heard some guests complain about small, noisy rooms so when booking make sure to ask which room you will be getting. The breakfast room down the spiral staircase was lovely and a very adequate breakfast was served. One problem was that it only opened at 7:00am and we left one day before that on a great trip to the Normandy Beaches. They were unwilling to give us a boxed breakfast to take with us.

Breakfast was nice, small eating area but we always got a table around 8.30am - busier around 9.30am. Choice of cereal, breads/toast, butter/cheese, juices, tea, coffee, Danishes, yogurts, boiled eggs. Worth \u00c2\u00a310 per person/day for this buffet breakfast - elsewhere one drink and a Danish would cost \u00c2\u00a35 or so.

Montmatre: Loved it, good atmosphere, great restaurants and cafes. Abbesses metro is good to exit via the lift, but to enter you have to use a spiral staircase 100+steps... instead walk down hill to Blanche metro, outside the Moulin Rouge, easier with a suitcase. Gare du Nord: Be very careful of the nasty ticket touts trying to help (interfere) with you at the ticket machines. Buy from the Ticket Office Desk, despite the queues. We purchased a 3 day pass for travel in the 3 main zones. Sacre-Coeur... we visited from the steps at the bottom of Montmatre hill, be very careful of the illegal street traders trying to temp you with their crap. We were stopped and they were reasonably forceful - having some rough neck pressing his finger into your chest because you won't give him the time of day... had to push him away with equal force. Perhaps visit Sacre-Coeur from the top of Montmartre hill via all the nice shops and markets to avoid these nasty low lives. Note: don't promise presents to anyone, painfully expensive in Paris...

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but in the cafe's at Rue des Abbesses, we loved to look at the people and the shops and enjoy our breakfast with fresh croissants. The area was lively, there were loads of bars, restaurants and cafe's, narrow streets and loads of steps, many people, small shops, some bohemic feeling mixed with tourists, music and artists, students and people of all ages. The atmosphere was awesome, you could listen to live music on the corner of the streets, buy antiques on the weekend market and climb up to see maybe the best view over Paris. The subway is fast but if u have time, take the bus when you can and see the city while you go. In Paris I would recommend the Louvre when it's open late and has less queues and Arc de Triomphe at night when the sun is going down, great views! Luxembourg Gardens are perfect for a picnic & siesta and Champs Elysees is something to see. Those and some great food & wine and your trip to Paris has to be a success :)", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taichung, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cJust What We Needed!\u201d", "Author": "JohnTaichung_Taiwan", "ReviewID": "UR116059325", "Content": "A wonderful little place!

Lots to choose from, juices, cereal, yoghurt, toast, pain au chocolate, croissants, baguette, cheeses, jams, etc etc. Hotel has a (small) lift which is handy, and they are happy to store your luggage on your arrival/departure day until check in/check out.

I had remembered it vaguely reading about it in one of Tripadviser's reviews but did not consider then to be a major consideration. So before checking in, I had bought Chinese takeout. Then when I read about the hotel policy, I quickly had to leave the room and walk 3 blocks to Sacre Coeur to have the food as I was afraid it would stink the room.

A 5minute walk from the hotel is the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret theatre where we had an enjoyable, if over-priced, evening.

The windmill \"Le Moulin de la Gallete\" could be seen from the balcony. The room was adequate size for 2 people which can be unusual in Paris. Ensuite bathrrom was clean and compact.

I went by reviews on trip advisor and I was not disappointed. A stunning, boutique hotel filled with character and set in a fantastic location on the cusp of montmartre, a stone's throw from sacre coeur. Less than 5 minutes walk from Blanche, Pigalle or Abesses Metro stations (don't take the stairs in Abesses!), even the street on which the hotel sits is everything you would imagine Paris to be. The rooms had an antique style, in burgundys and golds, topped off with a stunning juliette balcony overlooking the charming, quiet side street (although there is a bar right opposite which got a little loud at night). The bathroom was glimmering white, very clean, all with the expected facilities and a lovely shower. The twin room was a nice size, perfect for the two of us, not at all cramped, with two single beds. The staff were extremely friendly and highly accommodating, although there was a small slip up with a couple of the tips they gave us, one of which telling us that Versaille was open on May 1st, now if i've learnt anything from my trip to Paris, it's that nothing in France is open on May 1st, not even Versaille! We still got to see the stunning gardens though and it was a beautiful day for it. But just make sure you double check these things. If I was stretched to give one, my only complaint would be the size of the bed, a twin bed would not suit anyone over 5\" (which is why my mother was perfectly comfortable, whereas me, a healthy 5\"5, seemed to fall out every once in a while - although my mum did mention that the bath was a little on the small side). But for two days, after some ruthless sightseeing, sleeping or bathing was not a problem. Overall a wonderful trip, made perfect by staying at this wonderful hotel, i'm recommending it to all my friends (not the tall ones!), it really is a find and we both agreed that we'd definitely not hesitate to stay there again.

Paid \u00c2\u00a3300 each including flights, accom b&b from Manchester UK. Got RER from CDG Airport to Gare Du Nord, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.70 each one way, a bargain particularly if you get the express. We walked from the Gare du Nord to Hotel des Arts, which was ok as we got into CDG 08.30 local. Stopped off for coffee & croissants on route. Hotel a bit tricky to find as our map was crap, but if you prefer, take the Metro from La Chapelle which is part of Gare du Nord to Blanche (just near Moulin Rouge), turn right once on ground level, head up Rue Lepic, across to Rue Theloze and you are there. Hotel very nice. Small, but clean, friendly, attentive and modern. Only criticism is via my other half who is a very light sleeper...thin walls and can be noisy if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep the same hours as some of the other guests. I can sleep thru an earthquake so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really comment. Hairdryer in small bathroom, nice firm bed, TV with limited channels mostly European but 2 English News channels, but no tea/coffee facilities in room. Room attended everyday, breakfast is continental...juice, coffee, teas, toast, croissants, muesli, fruit, french bread, cheese, preserves, etc. 7.30 to 10 30 so more than adequate. Can be problematic getting a table to yourself unless you go down ultra early or late, but promotes conversation if you have to share a table. Met some lovely people this way. Re experiencing Paris, get a ticket on the Open Top Tour Bus. Jump on opposite the Blanche Metro station on Rue Clichy. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac32 for 2 day pass; 4 different routes taking in all tourist areas of Paris; hop on, hop off where you like, spend some time, jump another bus and explore another route. A brilliant way to explore the city. Your are given headphones which you plugin with multiple languages onboard providing a running commentary of the sights and history. The Metro is fabulous, cheap and quick but you miss the vistas and commentary provided during a similar journey on the Open Tour buses. Oh, get the bus and you will get to experience the lunacy that is the Parisian traffic! There appears to be no other rule than every man for himself! Bicycles, scooters, cars, delivery vans, buses, coaches, all aiming for the same piece of road at the same time!! If you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experienced it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scary. Watch from the top of the bus while you try to claim a piece of tarmac around the Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde or crossing one of the many bridges!! Food & drink was great eating out. Stay away from the frontline tourist places if on a budget; go a couple of streets back for better value. Look for \"Formula\" , \"Fixe Pris\" or \"Menu\" deals to keep costs down. We paid no more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 each plus wine for very commendable 3 course meal. Now, things to be careful of... Pigalle, Moulin Rouge area is a big red light sex shop area. In our experience it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a problem, just another aspect of a foreign city but may offend some people. Walked past the establishments and working ladies every night on way to dinner or hotel, but not pestered...don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if that says more about us! Sacre Coeur. If you walk thru Place du Tertre, look out for primarily pick pockets as the square is crowded with lots of brushing past/body contact. Also lots of attention from portrait/caricature painters or silhouette artists mithering for a commission...even if sat in one of the overlooking bistros you are not safe from their persistence. At the front of the Basilica, watch out for African guys trying to get you to sick a finger out for them to tie a friendship bracelet on your hand, then ask for money. A loud \"Non\", or some firm \"Anglo Saxon\" is usually enough to dissuade them. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pressured. Make noise and they will leave you alone. The Louvre: Girls asking you to read and sign a clipboard for deaf and dumb charities. Again, a total scam so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pressurised, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make eye contact, push the clipboard away if thrust at you and a loud \"Non\" will suffice.

We had a room on the 5th floor, room 54 which was supposed to be a superior room, i have no idea why, the room measured 12' x 10' with twin beds and a view from the window of room 53 and the back of the lift. Storage space was almost nonexistent, 2 single wardrobes either side of the beds, which consisted of a hanging space which was just about tall enough to hang a shirt or a skirt and 3 narrow shelves, one of which had the room safe fitted into it and the other 2 had spare pillows and blankets. So the blankets and pillows had to be put on the floor with our cases so we could store our clothes away. All around the room was notices to the guests.. \" for hygiene reasons no eating in the room\" \"for safety reason do not put anything on top of the cupboards\" \"for safety reasons don't put anything on the window sill\" However the room was spotlessly clean although the colour scheme of nicotine yellow did make it look very drab the beds were very comfy and with sheets and blankets which made a nice change. The bathroom was a good size and with a nice selection of toiletries however these were not replenished during our 4 night stay. The breakfast room was ok but too small for the number of guests, breakfast is served from 7 till 10 and when we went down on the first morning at 8am we had no trouble getting a table but from about 8:30 onwards you will have to share your table and on the second morning of our stay we went down at just after 9 and by 9:30 they ran out of food and only had cereal and coffee on offer, We had just finished by then and we left some very angry guests arguing with the staff.

Whilst this did not cause any immediate concen, after the third day of no turn-down service (clean towels, sheets etc...) we were forced to return our own dirty laundry to the reception desk and request clean replacements (including more toilet roll!). When we first used the shower there was a problem in that the temerature was fixed at scalding hot. When calling the hotel to ask if they could help they weren't forthcoming with a solution (besides adjusting the temperature dial) until we had left for breakfast and on our return they claimed the problem had resolved itself. This was untrue as the boiler had simply run out of hot water! Fortunately this problem did not continue past day two of our five day stay. The apartment itself was self catered and well equipped (microwave, fridge, kettle, toaster) but did not provide anything more than the equipment. Fortunately there were convenience stores nearby for us to buy tea/coffee etc. As the apartment is on the ground floor we were awoken early every morning by the sound of the postman, people recycling bottles in the backyard of the building and the residents of the apartment building. It must be said though that the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast is served between 7 and 10 in the hotel building. The room is quite small, and on two of the four days we had to share tables with other guests (again, this was not a huge problem for us). On our last day, however, we entered the reception at about 9am to be confronted by a group of agitated guests, who were waiting to go downstairs for breakfast, but there was not enough room. We were asked if we could come back later, which usually would be a problem for us, but as we needed to pack we agreed and went back across the road. Once we had finished packing (and were constantly looking though to the reception area to see when there was no more queue) we went back to the breakfast room at about 945, where there was no food left (other than preservatives, which were useless without anything to put them on!) When we asked if there was any bread, we were told that there wasn't, and no effort was made to go and acquire more (it should be noted that there are numerous boulangeries near the hotel). We mentioned this again when checking out of the hotel, but all we were told was that they were sorry, and made no effort to compensate us in any way (we had paid extra for the buffet breakfast when booking). As we are a young couple none of these points (besides the lack of breakfast on the final day) caused any major problems for us. We simply felt that the hotel did not give us the kind of service which was expected considering we had booked a hotel room with buffet breakfast, instead of us booking a self-catered apartment for a week. The location of the hotel is good, being within walking distance of the Moulin Rouge, two metro stations and the Sacre-Couer.

No free WiFi either, you may buy wifi access from the reception, but quite expensive.

The tickets said be there at least 30 mins before the 1900 show time - we got there on the dot of 1830 and there was already a queue around the block - dont be put off ! so long as you have a ticket the doors open at 1900 and you are generally sat at your table with a glass of champers in hand by about 1915 - Pleasant walk back to the Hotel via a couple of Bars....again no feeling of tension in the area, certainly when we were there felt perfectly safe and amongst similar minded people Sunday Lunch - Le Basilic ( 4mins from the hotel on the corner opposite Zebre) - After a morning at the Louvre and with a taxi booked for 1600 to take us back, wanted somehting nice but close to the hotel - had seen the name of the place in Zagats and had spied the sign when we were at Zebre the day before so tried our luck ...really glad we did! best meal of the weekend and a lasting memory of the perfect french Sunday lunch - relaxed yet slightly more upmarket than Zebre this relatively small space was crammed with smiling faces and french voices - food was very definetly a step up also and whilst the prices were higher the option of Prix Menu or al a Carte covered all the bases both from a price and qulaity perspective - Grandmas poached egg starter with Garlic shavings was a highlight as was the Hay Roasted Lamb Rack, classic Rossini filet and duck done only the way that the French seem capable of doing.....rolled back to the hotel and onto a cab back the airport and home sharing tales of glutiny and excess but everyone agreed we were very lucky people and wouldnt living in an appartment in Montmatre be a realy good thing to do !! In summary - if you have read this you are probably at that stage of just about to committing your credit card details to the vagaries of the internet. From our experience I would suggest you swallow hard and just go for it ......Hotel Arts is a great little 3star in a lovely part of town....besides just how much time do you want to spend in your room?...even in the rain just wandering along Rue Abbesses stopping off for a glass somewhere (not because you want to get drunk but because you want an excuse to stop and watch other people walk by) is a truly soul affirming experience that should not be missed......Enjoy!", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAlways a pleasure!\u201d", "Author": "MarkAlder", "ReviewID": "UR97216497", "Content": "Stayed here twice now & we've loved it both times.

It seems they have a hard & fast rule about check-in: not until 14h or 2 pm so we left our luggage and walked around and then took the Metro to one of our favorite restaurants for lunch. We returned about 15 minutes before 2 and had to wait, but we were the first allowed to check in. Our room was on the top floor, but the elevator only goes to the 5th floor so we had to walk one flight of stairs-no big issue. Our room was named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gazi Le Tatar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All of the rooms were named, and each floor was decorated with a Montmartre/Paris theme. Hotel is family run apparently and very clean. They were dusting the lobby while I was waiting to check in. All staircases were winding so there may be an issue if the elevator was out of order for some. Staying on the top floor would also be difficult, if not impossible, for people with walking disabilities or difficulty. Our room was spotless just like everywhere else in hotel. One issue was heat: It could be adjusted but did not go down rapidly due to method of heating-hot water. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any evidence of a/c so room could be hot in summer. The room had two windows: a regular one and a smaller one near the ceiling and heater. We kept that one open most of the time to offset the heat. From our room, one could see Sacre Coeur clearly. Looking right, one could see the Tour Montparnasse, weather permitting. I wish we had been on the other side to see the Eiffel Tower, but I have no complaints since I requested a higher room and got exactly that. The room had two twin beds, also as requested. They were pushed up together, of course, as is the custom in France. I saw them adjusting mattresses across the hall so the room can be made up with one double or two twin beds. How efficient! There were very small ledges on each side of the bed. The one by the window had the telephone. The only available outlet in the room that I could find was beneath the other ledge on the side closer to the bathroom. There was a desk with a stool as well as a small garbage can. Another lamp was on the desk plus bright lights above the head of the bed and one on the far wall above the desk. There was a nice but small, maybe 20 inches or 50 centimeters diagonally, television. There were about 25 channels. All were In French except the Arte channel which sometimes was in German. Reception was spotty on about 1/3 of the channels due to satellite signal. They need to add some English news channels such as BBC and CNN; however, one is not in Paris to watch tv, but sometimes it is nice for those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak French to have some. I speak French and German so not an issue for me. Next to the small ledges by the bed were two narrow closets. One had extra pillows and a blanket; the other had a very small safe. My little notebook computer was too big for the safe so I kept it in my suitcase and trusted them. The bathroom had a sink, toilet, and tub. There was a hair dryer on the wall and 3 mirrors of various sizes. The one that bothered me was the one on the door so I could see my fat self on the toilet! There was no mounted shower but a shower cord. Unlike most French tubs, there was no half glass door so one had to be careful when using the shower extension to rinse off so as to not flood the bathroom. They had very nice amenities which seem to be custom made for the hotel. There was soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand cream, and a shower cap. One minor complaint is that they did not replace them the second day. I did find the maid to get another bar of soap, however. Everything worked fine. My only comment would be that they should add some safety bars to help getting up and in and out of tub. Tub was not slippery but could be if one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rinse it off before standing up. There was also another small garbage can in the bathroom. As others have said, breakfast area can get crowded. We timed in just right on both days. They had cereal, bread, hard boiled eggs, juices, yogurt, water, coffee, and tea. One addition that could be made would be a few cold cuts such as ham, but no complaints because they probably would charge more than 10 euros if they expanded the selection. The hotel had no wifi although they told me at the desk that some rooms were wired for such based on how they were booked. I am not sure exactly what that meant. There was one terminal in the lobby, but it was often busy. I was able to quickly check my email a few times, but some lingered as if they were extra special. Also, there was a problem checking AOL mail except in the mornings for some reason. There was an error message so not sure why I could not access it during afternoon and evening. I had a family emergency in the US and had to phone for more details since I could not send or receive emails for almost 24 hours. I am not sure if it was the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s connection, server, AOL, or exactly what. In summary, the hotel deserves its high ratings. All of the negatives were things that could easily be fixed. The biggest negative was the heat. I realize it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old system, but it would be nice if there was an off switch rather than just a knob to turn so one had to guess if it was on high or low or wait a half hour to see if it cooled off or heated up. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like paying a booking fee (5,50 euros here) but would not let this be a reason to not stay here. The rate of 85 euros for a top floor room with a view and enough room to move about was a real bargain for Paris. This was the third hotel where I have stayed near Montmartre. This hotel was much better than either of the others, the Villa Van Gogh (formerly Best Western d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Esteres when I stayed there in 2001) and the Tryp Blanche Fontaine (see my review for the details), and would definitely be my first choice when I stay in this part of Paris again. I do like to stay in different parts of Paris on my many visits and rarely stay in the same place again, but I would here. Access to the metro was about 200 metres, either east and flat to Abysses or south and downhill to/uphill from Blanche. There were many great restaurants nearby including one of our favorites, Le Buffet on Rue des Trois Freres, where my pictures are on their wall by the wine racks since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten there about 20 times and am considered family. Bottom Line: Hotel was quiet and provided a safe, comfortable night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep.

Every single one of the staff were pleasant, multilingual and and helpful if requested. The rooms were about the same size as others I've stayed in while visiting other cities and towns throughout Europe - efficient, but smaller (or larger) than some travelers may be familiar with depending upon their experiences. My room was very clean, and had hand painted art work on the walls. The location was excellent - this was the first time I stayed in Montmarte, and I was glad I chose to stay here and will definately again. I was especially happy with the heating system - I was always warm - something which I cannot say for some other hotels I've visited during the winter months. My only suggestion would be to add shower curtains and a hook for those guests choosing to bathe this way rather than seated or kneeling in the tub. Some suggestions for others - if you will be visiting a number of museums, consider a Paris Museum Pass, which you can purchase online, or at the airport when you arrive or at an Information center. It has many advantages. There are numerous foodstores and supermarkets nearby. As for restaurants, you can turn either right or left as you leave the hotel, and find many excellent places to eat. In Paris, it is common for restaurants to offer 3 courses - entrees, \"plats\" (main dishes) and a dessert course. Typically, you may choose an entree and a plat, a plat and a dessert, or (for a few euros more) an entree, plat and dessert. You may also choose a bottle of wine or a carafe of the \"house\" wine - white or red. In the cafes, they may have beer, either draft or in bottles, usually in view in a cooler along with soft drinks and bottled water. Be aware - food is more expensive in Paris than in other parts of Europe. My favorite restaurant - Les Dix Vins (The Ten Wines). Exit the hotel and turn right. The next intersecting street is rue Abbesses (with MANY restaurants and cafes in either direction). Continue to the next street, rue Veron, and turn left. After 100 feet or so, you'll find the small, storefront Les Dix Vins - often filled with locals. Take your menu decoder with you, because it is a family restaurant and they speak French. The menu is on a small handwritten blackboard and the wines are on a handwritten blackboard on the wall. Everything is delicious - so be bold! As for breakfast, I did not eat at the hotel, as it was a little more expensive than I wanted to pay. However, other guests mentioned that it was good. Local cafes have breakfasts available for a little less money, but you will not have the variety and the coffee will be limited (if you order a black coffee (cafe noir) you will get an expresso. In Paris, it is unusual for breakfast to be included in the price of a room.

Hotel des Arts is cute, extremely clean, the staff is very helpful and the location is perfect if you want to stay in Montmartre. There are however certain things that obviously do not bother many satisfied customers and that I want to mention. First of all, even though the area is very quiet, and the vast majority of clients are polite, you will hear whatever happens in the hallways and in other rooms so prepare to be interrupted in your sleep even if you use earplugs. I rated the sleep quality as poor also because the beds are small and not so comfortable. They also slide left and right but the main thing that bothered me was that there was something about the bed linen (or the bed itself) that would make you sweat, i.e. some fabric did not breathe there. The breakfast (that is extra 10 euros per person btw) is very average, nothing special in it. I also did not understand why the hotel had only a computer with free internet and no free wireless access (you had to pay extra for it too). To conclude: even though it is not an expensive hotel, there are many other hotels in Paris that offer more or less the same package and that cost up to 30% less. I had the feeling that I paid extra because of the high rating here and not because there is more value in this hotel.

We chose it as it was affordable and with my husband being a keen artist it seemed fitting with our visit. The hotel was lovely and exceeded expectations. There are 6 floors and we were on the 6th floor! There is a lift up to the 5th floor and only a small spiral staircase to the 6th so no problems although if you are like mt husband and don't do small lifts then the 5 floors of spiral staircasing can make you a little dizzy! Although a stop on each floor to admire the artwork on each lift door is worth the climb! It is a quaint hotel (although it has 64 rooms!) and has nice little touches like each room is named after a famous artist. We had a relatively small room but there was enough room for the two of us with hanging space each side of the bed and 3 shelves each, a large desk, bathroom with a bath/shower, sink and toilet which was very clean and looked quite new, also a hairdryer but it was one of these attatched to the wall so ladies if you have long hair I'd suggest bringing your own! There was also a free safe which you programmed your own pin number into (very easy to use and had instructions) and a flat screen tv which had BBC world news. There was also a reading room downstairs with daily papers in most languages, free internet access and a free jukebox! so when you come back after walking all day you can take a paper, sit back in the comfy chairs and listen to a bit of louis armstrong or duke ellington (or one of the many other musical masters!). Breakfast comprised of croissants (and other pastries), toast, jams, bagguette, a selection of cheeses, yoghurt, cerials, orange/apple juice and tea/friut teas/coffee - only continental served but was always plenty of choice and you help yourself! The hotel was situated perfectly for us. A few minutes walk up hill and you were amongst the street artist of place du tetre and the cafes and restaurants and little trinket /souviner shops and also the sacre-coer. A minutes walk down hill from the hotel and you find youself in a bustle of cafes and restaurants and at the moulin rouge! It is also well situated for metro and bus travel but as we only made one trip out of monmartre during our stay to visit the louvre and champs-elese for 10 Euros each we got a taxi as it worked out cheaper and easier! if you do want to use the buses be prepared to change as not all sites such as the louvre have direct bus access. The staff were all very helpful, spoke fluent English and very friendly. Our flight was in the evening so we made use of the luggage room at reception and there is also a trasnfer service to the airport - we booked ours with a separate company which cost 115 euros for return for the two of us but the hotel have a transfer service at 17 euros per person so worth looking into using this - I wish we had have! All of Paris is quite expensive in comparison to the UK, the average pint is 9 Euros and the main street restaurants charge around 17 Euros for a main course but a lot of bars have happy hours between 2pm and 10pm when beers are half price and try and look at restaurants down side streets if you are on a budget as many do 2-3 courses for 10-15 Euros and a carafe on wine for 8.

Yes the view from our room was a small service void, that most of the rooms backed onto, but it was a lot more quiet at night than having street noise outside! Our one complaint has to be the Shower.

There are two nearby metro stops, Abbesses and Blanche but mostly we used the buses from the main road at the bottom of Rue Lepic.

The location is great because you can literally walk out of the hotel and into a street with wonderful cafes and bars, shops etc and then down the road about 1-2 mins is the Blanches Metro station which takes you everywhere. The room was very clean and up to date with a lovel fully opening window. The bathroom was excellent and very modern. For some reason there was no shower holder or shower curtain, but all the bathroom fittings were very modern and worked well so as long as you are careful in the shower that this is OK. They even give toiletries which is a nice touch and not given in all independant hotels. Check in was nice and friendly, you need to give in your key each time you go out here, but thats fine. I also used as much french as I could when staying here and they appreciated me trying as many other cafes, shops and bars do, which adds to the fun being away from home. Otherwise there is no point being away! Breakfast was OK, I wouldn't go mad about it but what you do get is pretty fresh and as much as you want. The coffee was not so good but then it was from an urn. For the second day we had breakfast in a bakery. Oddly the hotel at check out said we had breakfast both days! This however was taken off the bill when we explained we didn't eat it both days. The TV in the room was nice, a medium size flatscreen, only french channels, so Americans will be disapointed, but then you have to bear in mind you can always stay at the Marriott if you want to imagine you are in Dixyland. Bed was comfy, nice sheets and pilllows good, with a room safe and hangers and closet space a pleanty. This hotel does not have a bar but there is a small vending machine with soft drinks and Toblerones! We went to shops nearby for wine etc anyway. There is a lounge area off reception, really lovely with leather armchairs, large flatscreen tv and jukebox with CDs, free of charge, also a free of charge I-mac for using the net. This was very useful for going online. All in all we had a great stay here and would come back in a shot. It is very hard finding a hotel in Paris that is central and has good standards at a reasonable rate. We did use the booking.com website and this gave a good rate. The Zebra of Monmatre bar and restaurant at the end of the road was fantastic, also there were some other great restaurants further down the road which we visited. Just take a look in the window for the menus, if they seem very french in their approach and full of French people, you are onto a good thing! Avoid anywhere where the menu is translated into several different langauges, you will get ripped off and be eating gunk.

At least 10 short flights of stairs! Tough enough just walking up them let alone bogged down with luggage although this is the closest station and only 1 block uphill to the hotel. We mostly used the Blanche station at the bottom of the main street. Was much easier to navigate. We didn't find the distance to the main attractions an issue at all.

It's a great spot between the Moulin Galette at the top of the street, and the Moulin Rouge one street down. In a very real part of Paris, Des Arts used to be a dormitory for the Can Can girls of the Moulin Rouge. Within walking distance are the Place du Tertre, the Sacre Couer, Le Lapin Agile - and a choice of two metro stations not far away (don't use Abbesses loaded with suitcases) and we thought it was a great spot. The staff were friendly and helpful, before and during our stay - and the dog is gorgeous! There are plenty of local cafe's in the streets up to and in the Place de Tertre (beware the artists - and flower sellers - pushy doesn't begin to describe it!) and along the Rue de Abbesses. It's not close to the Seine or Champs Elysees, but you can walk it. It is a very compact city and is fun to explore with a map. We walked (mostly) from our hotel, to Sacre Couer, to Notre Dame, the Latin Quarter, to the Louvre, the Place de Concorde and up the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomph in one day. It was cold, it rained, it snowed and we loved it! (We did get the metro back!) It is on a steep street though so if you have any problem with knees or fitness - go elsewhere. We loved that it's a busy street, it felt 'French' and that's what we wanted! We were in a triple - and granted the rooms aren't big - but unless you pay way more than we could ever afford, all rooms in Paris are small aren't they? We've stayed in smaller rooms in Paris - and on our honeymoon had the worst bed in the world - but it's Paris! We loved it at des Arts and would love to go back - but next time on the top floors so we can have a view. It seems to me that the main complaints come from USA.

Better to change to line 2 at Pigalle and get off at Blanche. Or just get off at Pigalle and walk - very interesting stroll along Blvd. de Clichy. Our room was quite spacious by Parisian standards and the hotel was very clean and well kept. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, each morning we would go to the creperie at the bottom of the street where my wife would have chocolate crepes and I would have a \"super antipaso sandwich\".

As our flight arrived quite early, Alain was very kind to have us leave our bags until our room is ready for check-in. After walking around the streets of Montmarte for awhile, the hotel allowed us to check-in before the actual check-in time. Honestly, my expectations for hotels in Europe are low as most would tell us that they are quite expensive, basic and small. However, when we entered our room, I was very pleased and happy with what I saw. Well actually, I was more excited like a wide eyed child seeing a big box of chocolates. The room was very pretty, charming with two windows where all the sunshine went through. And then I saw the big arrangement of flowers and the bottle of champagne that my husband had secretly requested from the hotel before we left for Paris. I actually made the reservations for our whole trip so I'm not sure how Karine and my husband managed to pull off the whole thing without my knowledge, given that I could be quite nosy at times. We were given a beautiful room, a great surprise treat on our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful stay. The hotel also has a small area where you can lounge or use the internet which is very helpful. I had also booked the stay for my mother, grandmother, aunt and uncle whose stay at the hotel was a week prior to us. My mom would communicate to me via email (using the hotels computer) and was very pleased because the neighborhood is safe, close to everything and yet the hotel was situated in a quiet location. There are two metro stations close to the hotel which would be Blanche and Abbesses so getting around the city would not be a problem. Sacre Coeur is also a few minutes away which is situated at the top where you can see Paris and all its glory and of course, the Eiffel Tower. One tip that you shouldn't miss though is that starting around 9:00 every hour thereafter (or maybe earlier in late fall and winter). The Eiffel Tower shines with glittery white lights like fireworks (apart from its usual yellowish light) for about 10 - 15 minutes. Where would be a better location to view this spectacle from but from Sacre Coeur. It was our first time in Paris and the stay at the hotel surely made our wedding anniversary trip memorable.

The rooms are small but adequate; the bathroom facilities are excellent, but take note that there is no shower fixed to the wall; it is a hand-held shower head. There are no \"do-not disturb\" signs for the rooms, so expect the cleaning staff to barge in on you if you decide to sleep in past 9am. The continental breakfast is adequate, but it can be hard to find a seat in their small breakfast room. They charge 10 Euros for a continental breakfast. For 14 Euros, you can get a full breakfast at one of the many cafes just down the street on rue Abesses. There were two major annoyances with this hotel: 1) They prohibit the consumption of food in the room, apparently for \"hygenic reasons.\" This is a real shame if you want to sample cheeses, baguettes and other take-out food from some of the excellent shops and restaurants in the area - in the comfort of your hotel room. 2) Our travel iron disappeared on day two of our visit, after the room had been serviced. We thought we had misplaced it. After searching around the room, we went to the reception. Sure enough they had it. They took it because they have had four room fires, caused by travel irons, over the past year.

We stayed in Room 21 overlooking the narrow and attractive Montmartre street in early September 2009. While compact, the room was not too small. It was in almost pristine - certainly immaculate - condition, and very clean. Perhaps indicative of the long-since gentrified nature of this beautiful hill-side part of Paris, there is absolutely nothing down-at-heel or bohemian about this hotel. Which is not to say there's no character (though it doesn't have a great deal) - it just doesn't have an iota of the usual grime, wear and tear that passes for character in some hotels! The lobby, funky little lounge, spiralling staircase and surprisingly light and airy basement dining room (in spite of what the photo shows) were in similarly pleasant and appealing condition. There was no air-conditioning that I could see, which would only pose an issue if the weather was oppressively hot - leaving the window that overlooks the street open would mean intermittent noise of occasional passers-by or mopeds. Location-wise, it's just a few minutes walk up to wonderful Sacre Coeur and a couple of minutes to La Blanche metro stop (right by the Moulin Rouge). Within falling distance there's a wealth of bistros, bars and street-side cafes (including the fun and relaxed Cafe des Deux Moulins - which featured in the film Amelie, and does a great burger and fries). The staff were extremely helpful, with one searching the internet for the details to Paris's flea markets for me (there is an online Mac in the lounge for anyone to use, by the way). There is a strange rule regarding food being taken to or eaten in the rooms - so there's no room service. However, we snacked and drank what we liked in our room, unaware of this rule until the last evening without so much as a friendly word from the staff. Two issues I noticed, neither of which annoyed me but I guess they could be noted: in the spotless bathroom of room 21 there is no shower - there is a new showerhead on a flexible tube but nowhere on the wall to which it could be attached and no shower curtain to suggest that it once did hang on it. There wasn't any particular reason that I could see for this arrangement, but at the end of the day, it wasn't a problem in the least. Secondly was the safe. Digital and seemingly new, it was however fitted onto a small removeable shelf within the wardrobe and so would have been easy to take. Fortunately, this shortcoming was irrelevent as security at this hotel is not an issue - it feels and is quite safe.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood Location & Value\u201d", "Author": "harmul", "ReviewID": "UR39929123", "Content": "A very good value for money Hotel, good location near to two Metro Stops(Abbesses & Blanche).

(In other words, no overhead showerhead.) (All rather odd.) We pushed the beds together, reworked the sheets, and voila, we had a double bed. The hotel itself did that the next night.

Everyone at the hotel was accomodating and friendly. We had no trouble with our internet reservation. The room was clean and the bathroom was more than adequate. There was a retractable line over the bath tub for wet laundry and a hair dryer was installed on the wall. (There is a laundromat in the neighborhood if you need one.) Our room had an armoire for our clothes, a small televison mounted on the wall, as well as black-out curtains. We booked a superior room for 3 people. We got a room on the second floor that had 3 twin beds (one had been brought in) which were comfortable. Even though it was a bit tight with the extra bed, that wasn't an issue since we were hardly there. The problem was the street noise. There is no air conditioning. It was hot during our stay and keeping the windows open at night was impossible if you wanted to sleep. Part of the charm of this neighborhood is that it is very lively. We were there over a weekend so naturally the crowds were making a lot of noise as they strolled - perhaps stumbled - around. I used ear plugs to get a good night's sleep. Here's my advice: This is a lovely little hotel that is run by a good staff. If you come in warm weather, get a room in the back or on the upper floors and, by all means, bring ear plugs just in case they can't accomodate you any where else but on a lower floor facing the street. We really enjoyed the neighborhood. The cafes are OK and the restaurants are fine in this area (hey, it's Paris!). If you want something more, there are 3 Metro stops in the general area - Blanche (closest to the hotel), Pigalle (sex shops and strip clubs - ooh la la), and Abesses (lovely square filled with children on the weekend). We so enjoyed exploring all the back streets and small cafes. We've been to Paris numerous times but had never stayed anywhere close to the 18th. We both would stay there again. For Paris, it's a good value. Some additional thoughts: We took the Eurostar into Paris and used the Metro exclusively for our transportaion with no problems. During the ride, you can buy a set of 10 tickets at the Eurostar's bar and avoid all the crowds and the resulting confusion at the train and Metro stations.

We went with Thomas Cook who had free nights offers with most of their hotels and it was a tough decision to decide which one to go for.

We saw little point in having a flashy hotel when we were going to hardly be there but the hotel was far better than we expected. We had TV and a fair sized en suite and the bed was lovely and comfy. In room safe was great for storing all our tickets, and the room was furnished wonderfully. The hotel itself is family run, very friendly and really quite cute and set in the heart of Montmartre. It is literally down the hill from artists square and there are an abundance of small cafes on the main street that the small street the hotel is on runs off. The street itself offers peace and quiet from the bustle of the city and is only a five minute walk from the Abbesses metro station. I felt the only thing that kind of nagged us about the location was the fact that you usually had to change on the metro to get to the main attractions, usually after only one or two stops and after taking the RER from the airport we had to change twice with our cases, but other than that, a wonderful location. Also, on our first sight seeing day when we went to the Louvre we got talking in the queue to a single man and a family from England, both staying at different hotels closer to the Louvre in the centre of Paris and both complained about the cost/ lack of value for money that the central hotels offered. The single man had less facilities than us but was paying double the price per night for his room, all to just eradicate five minutes off his metro journey time to the heart of Paris!!!

At the top of the street is one of the two remaining windmills in Montmartre and then a very picturesque street leads to the Place Du Tertre where you can admire the work of the local artists keen to sell their latest masterpieces. Amble round the corner and you arrive at Sacre Coeur with its marvellous views over Paris. All this, only minutes away from the hotel! This neighbourhood was our favourite place to eat,drink and relax at the end of a busy days sightseeing. No problems with our early arrival at the hotel - luggage was stored in a secure room and English was spoken. Our bedroom and bathroom were both larger than expected (room12). They were clean and had recently been refurbished. The room is on the first floor, directly above the hotel entrance but we had no problems with noise. The staff were polite and helpful. We cannot comment on the breakfasts as we chose to eat out - lovely boulangerie/cafe just around the corner on Rue Des Abbesses with a good menu at half the hotel price. Also on Abbesses, lots of tempting places to eat and drink although more expensive than Place Du Tertre. In conclusion a much better than expected (from the outside) small hotel in a great location.

As I am a travel agent this did not instil me with confidence, anyone who works in a service industry should at least have the courtesy to reply. On arrival we were given the key to room 20, made our way up and found this to be a very small drab room, the view was the wall opposite so there was no natural light. I would have put up with it for 1 night but not for 4, so I went down to reception and asked to be moved. Eventually offered room 4 which overlooked a courtyard and we could at least see the sky.

One of the greatest pleasures of being in France is to buy a baguette and make your own sandwich using the good local produce on offer..,,,or a midnight feast after a few drinks in the local bars. By now we were really beginning to regret our choice of hotel. We went down for breakfast (it was included in the price) on the first 2 days of our stay. Bread, croissants, cold boiled eggs, cereals, yoghurts and tinned fruit salad were offered but were neither inspiring nor plentiful. No eggs or croissants on arrival on day 1 and no one seemed to be in a rush to replenish. The latter 2 days we got a Panini down the road for les than 5 Euros which was delicious. On our return to the hotel after our second day of sightseeing we asked for the room key and were told some items had been removed from our room as they had had problems before and would return them when we left. They had removed 4 nightlight candles from the bathroom which I had left on the tiled area of the bath having had a relaxing candlelit bath the previous evening. There was no shower curtain and they were at the opposite side of the bath to the towel holder. What a pathetic attitude towards guests. This is certainly how to ensure you do not get any repeat business as I for one will not be back, even to collect my candles! Oh yes and I did witness guests being told there were no rooms available, not sure if they were overbooking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or people trying to book on spec.

The hotel is an easy walk from the charming Place des Abbesses metro station and the main street that you walk up (Rue des Abbesses) has lots of bakeries/shops/bars/restaurants and is quite lively till late in the evening. I know some parts of Montmartre are quite seedy but staying at Hotel Des Arts you would never know you were near the red-light district (Pigalle, Blanche etc.). I was staying here by myself and felt safe all the time. The last remaining windmill Moulin de la Galette is just up the street and the whole area is so picturesque and lovely. The hotel itself is great too - my room was clean and comfortable with a big double bed and bath. The only problem was i was given room no. 1 which is literally right next to reception, which was a bit uncomfortable.

At the bottom of the road near the Moulin Rouge there is the metro station and buses to the city centre.To get around use the metro and buses but buy 2/3 day ticket as you can go any where on the Ile De France all day ,great value.

But the hotel is 2 blocks up the hill and the immediate area is surrounded by your average bakeries, butchers, etc. The hotel itself is nice. We didn't get breakfast so I can't comment on that. The room was quite large, especially for European standards. The heater didn't quite get as warm as we'd liked but it wasn't too bad. They have a bunch of rules like no drying clothes on the radiator, no hanging clothes off the balcony, no eating in room, etc. We broke every rule. I could understand that they didn't want us hanging our clothes on the radiator due to fire hazards and eating would make a mess, so we only hung our clothes while we were in the room and cleaned our mess after eating. We later took a walk down by the red light district but didn't feel fearful at all. There was a huge crowd of tourists waiting to get in Moulin Rouge and we got some attention by some guys near a porno theater but nothing threatning. It's an all right place but the only thing of interest near by is the Sacre Couer which is beautiful but I don't have to be staying near it again. Oh yeah, be wary at Sacre Couer. There's all these guys trying to stop you on the way up and trying to tie bracelets on your hand. I'm not sure what they were doing but we just ignored them and walked away each time.

I booked directly through their website, one day before I travelled, and got an immediate email confirmation which I printed out as instructed. They offered me a discount rate - 58 euros per night for a single room, although they sneakily added on a 5 euro \"booking fee\" (a common scam for all kinds of internet business, as it costs them next to nothing to take internet booking). When you add in breakfast - which is often included even at budget hotels - you're not saving a lot of money compared to nicer Montmartre hotels - such as Regyn's or L'Ermitage. I took a risk with this hotel because I knew there were other hotels in the area with rooms available - and I would be arriving early enough to walk out and find another if they tried the swap scam. I arrived in Paris exceptionally early - 7.30 am - and decided to test their reaction by going straight to the hotel. Alain was a bit surprised, but after a bit of negotiation he offered me a smaller room that was already empty - if I would pay an extra 29 euros as an \"early check-in fee\" (they do like their extra fees....) I could have waited until 2 pm for a bigger room - but the offer was too tempting after an overnight journey. In the end I was never charged the extra - Caroline checked me out and I think its obvious they have a communication problem. Clearly it sometimes works to the traveller's advantage! Interestingly, at check-in Alain sifted for ages through several piles of paper and asked me when I had booked (\"Was it two months ago?\"). The same look of slight surprise when I told him I had booked the day before. The room itself was fine but nothing amazing. A comfortable bed, warm and clean, the nice bonus of a television with English channels. My view was of a ventilation shaft, the bathroom was incredibly tiny with a few cracked tiles and a useless hairdryer, although very clean. More or less what you would expect from any decent budget hotel in Paris. Breakfast is a bargain - worth the extra 7 euros as you'd never get so much choice for the same price at a cafe. And the lobby IS very pretty, and the location is excellent. But I'm afraid to say that there do seem to be some dodgy practices going on there. If you are coming to Paris at a busy time of year, or after a long trip from America - or if its a special occasion or a romantic trip - don't risk it. If you have your heart set on staying in Montmartre, save your sanity and book at the slightly more expensive Regyn's or L'Ermitage. I haven't tried Hotel du Moulin or the Utrillo but they're more reliable and the same price as Hotel des Arts. If you don't need to be in Montmartre, try Hotel Chopin - its lovely.
