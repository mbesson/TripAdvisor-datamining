It is very disappointing to say we have yet to receive a reply from them. 'I would like to give you feedback re accommodation I had booked for four of us on March 22, 2012. My husband and I have stayed at the Oaks in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide. On all of our stays, we were impressed with the quality of our accommodation and the hotel itself. Thus, when it was our friends' anniversary and we decided on a trip to Sydney to celebrate, I said I would look after the accommodation and book us a two bedroom apartment at the Oaks Hyde Park. The photos on the internet looked wonderful, as I assumed they would. When we arrived, I was disappointed to see the state of the reception area, it look tired and not up to par with other Oaks. The reception staff were friendly so I looked past that. When we got off the elevator at our floor, the smell of chemical cleaners was over powering. Once again, I let this go knowing our room would be wonderful. Then it only got worse! The state of the door to the room itself was old, worn and dirty. When I opened the door, my heart sank. The room was awful. The furniture in the lounge was worn, walls covered with black scuffs, curtains filthy, kitchen sub-standard and hairs on the floor in the bathroom. I could only apologise profusely to my friends and stated straight away I would go back to reception and see if there was a better room. This I did and the receptionist had a look on her computer and gave me a key to another room. To my further disappointment, that room was worse than the one we were booked in.' Later in day we found much better accommodation. 'My friend and myself went back to the Oaks, gathered our cases and went down to reception to check out. Initially, the receptionist said we would have to pay a cancellation fee, but thankfully after explaining to her our situation and the fact our room looked nothing like the photos on the internet, the room wasn't up to our standards and the smell of chemicals was overpowering, we weren't charged.' We all were truly disappointment with this hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgreat room , good location\u201d", "Author": "robert d", "ReviewID": "UR126814463", "Content": "we stayed here mid feburary and had booked a room for 3 people and found the room to be modern and clean with good views ,the only complaint was the sofa bed our son slept on was very hard ,our king size bed was comfortable, we asked for and got an early check in.

When we arrived, none of the Oaks concierge staff would help us with our simple enquiries such as where the nearest bus stop was. When the apartment owner showed us to our room, she was extremely rude. She told us to make sure our apartment was spotless, take out the trash and wash the dishes. For a serviced apartment, that didn't sound right. She treated us like we were a bunch of kids on schoolies. The room itself was very basic and old, the floors and walls stained and the glasses in the cupboard dirty. It did not match the photos on the website at all, so it was very misleading. We had booked for 6 people, but the apartment was only 2 rooms - a tiny bedroom and a combined lounge/kitchenette. She told us we could fit 2 people in the bedroom and 3 on pull-out couches in the lounge. We asked about the 6th bed and she told us to put a spare mattress in the kitchen. She wanted us to pull out the kitchen table ourselves and put it in the hallway OUTSIDE OUR ROOM so we could fit a mattress on the floor. Considering we had paid a lot of money to have 6 people in (what we thought was a large) apartment, this was disgusting. She already expected 3 of us to share a fold-out sofa and then put people on the floor? How were 6 girls meant to lift a kitchen table out of the room anyway?? They should have arranged this for us and there certainly shouldn't be anyone sleeping on the floor. As it was, there was only enough towels, pillows and sheets for 5 people, so the birthday girl slept on a dirty, stained mattress on the floor with no pillow or blankets. Now for the state of the room; each mattress was disgustingly dirty complete with hairs, stains and a wretched smell of sweat. The bathroom had giant cockroaches in it. None of us could use the bathroom during the night as it was blocked by mattresses on the floor because there was no room elsewhere. We left in the early hours of the morning and moved to a cheaper and much cleaner hotel. The apartment owner only gave us half the money back despite us only staying one night.

The Thai restaurant is part of the building, but we noticed no food smells other than in the restaurant, which I thought was good value by the way.

I was very excited until I read the reviews a day later and to be honest, they really freaked me out! I was very worried about the room I was getting etc and a couple of times rang the reception to make sure the room was of good conditions and everything in there worked fine. The staff was very patient with answering and following up my enquiries on the phone. When I got there, I was relieved that the serviced apartment was MUCH better than what I expected after reading the reviews. I agreed that the building was relatively old compared to other serviced apartments in the CBD, but it appeared that the inside of the rooms had been refurbished. The lift was normal, not super slow as quoted previously. Maybe it was just really busy when it was super slow. The reception/ staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and spacious and had a very artsy interior. Although it was only on the 3rd floor, we had a great view with the living room facing Oxford St and our bedroom facing Hyde Park. The kitchen was modern and sleek. Everything (TV, air conditioner) worked fine. Fresh towels provided free of charge if you put them on the floors before the cleaners came or you could collect them at the reception at any time. I really loved their shampoo/conditioner/body lotion packages (not important, but still a plus). At night it was not noisy at all (unless an ambulance passed by) and we had comfortable sleep each night. Also, if you are not an early bird like us, make sure you contact the reception/ cleaning service before 2 pm as they are only around between 10 am - 2 pm. The pool/ spa was good with great views although I think the pool needs to be cleaned more regularly. The internet/ Wi-fi service is pretty expensive but hey if you are here for some retreat/ get away, who really needs internet!

This hotel has definitely seen better days. There has been some attempt to renovate some of the rooms but the real problem here is the lack of maintenance and care. The lobby is tired and smells of mould and the reception chairs are stained. We had booked a Visa VIP special 4 star studio and arrived by shuttle from the airport. The receptionist, when he appeared, was pleasant enough but he had no real answer for the worried guest who couldn't get out of the parking garage. When he turned his attention to us we were quickly signed in to room 1010 and directed to the small, tatty lifts - one of which was out of order. We chatted to two visitors in the lift who complained that in desperation they had given up waiting for the one working lift and had taken the service lift which had promptly broken down and left them stuck between floors for 15 long minutes. We found our way to our room down a gloomy corridor. The battered and scratched electronic card lock finally gave us entry after several attempts. The room at first seemed OK and it was kitted out in a sort of urban minimalist chic but it quickly became apparent that things are not as they should be at OHPP. It's all in the detail and this place isn't coping. I can forgive the lousy view of the backs of buildings - that happens in cities - but the general lack of cleanliness was depressing. The bed headboard was hanging off the wall at a crazy angle, there was a tangle of wires under and around the TV unit, there was gross mould at the back of the sink, a lamp was broken, the toilet paper roll was hanging off the wall, there was a dent in the fridge door, the cooktop was chipped, the toaster was broken, the table and chairs were marked, unpolished and scratched. There were scuff marks on the ceiling(!) and threadbare patches on the carpet and chips in the bathroom tiles. The balcony door lock didn't work fully, the balcony tiles were loose and a badly repaired drain pipe constantly ran water onto the balcony floor. The bed was comfortable though and the shower was excellent, although incredibly badly designed, so that you were in constant danger of grazing your shins against the bath faucet. One morning, housekeeping came by and I think I found the reason for the lousy presentation. A team of two people came in after several attempts to gain entry with the still malfunctioning lock. I had shouted NO, GO AWAY to them through the door because we were dressing and showering. They came in anyway. One barged in on my wife while she was showering. Neither of them appeared to speak English at all. I mentioned the broken lamp only to be met by blank stares. After some mime games I managed to get my position across. They then mimed that I should ring reception. I didn't bother. Could all the problems of presentation and maintenance be put down to the simple fact that management just can't communicate with the staff? So there you have it. This hotel is incredibly handy. Right in the heart of the city at the bottom of Oxford Street and a healthy walk from Central Station. Cabs and buses and even trains are at the door. There are lots of eateries around the corner in Stanley Street and Oxford Street. Bohemian Crown Street is just up the road. It's a great spot - if you can cope with the tattiness. I'm just glad we didn't pay full price. Lord only knows what the 3 star rooms are like, but reading the reviews I think I can guess. Would I stay there again? Nope.

We booked a renovated studio 4.5 star room on the 4th floor through Wotif. Check in was quick and the staff pleasant. The front desk and lobby is very plain and spartan. There is no restaurant or room service as this is a \"serviced appartments\" property. The location is very convenient to the CBD, Museum train station, and busses. Our room faced east, which while had no view and faced away from Hyde Park, was very quiet. I do not know how much noise you would get facing the park and busy College Street. The room was actually a decent size and very clean. They have done a nice job renovating it. We did not find the problems that other reviewers experienced with mold, stains,tiredness, lack of hot water, rudeness of staff etc. The room while not huge, was well appointed with new furniture, beds, a good kitchenette for self catering and the bathroom was spaceous (although anyone over 6 ft may have to stoop a bit in the shower)! We actually found there was lots of hot water, although the drains were a bit slow. The air con was the ducted type and somewhat noisey, but you could turn it off, unlike some climate controlled places I have stayed at elsewhere. Basic TV channels were free. No satellite channels which I thought was a bit cheap. The 2 lifts are very small, hallways are very narrow and the hall decor looked dated even with a new coat of paint. There is a smallish hot tub and pool on the roof which we did not use due to the unseasonably bad summer in Sydney this year, and there is an on site parking area which is difficult to enter and exit (little space to turn, 2 way traffic in one lane of space etc) When we left, the automatic door failed to open and we noticed someone had actually ripped the wires out of the intercom to contact someone to let us out of the carpark. This made for a very inconvenient and interestingly convoluted trip to the front desk to open the door. I got the impression that this may have been broken for some time as the front office person just tiredly pressed the button without a sorry or any other comment, not that I could pay much attention as I scrambled up the lifts and through the carpark to jump in my car before the car park door shut before I could get out. It may well be that all rooms in this property are not created equal. By many of the other reviews, we may have been lucky. The room was good, and while the hallways were a bit tired, we only found the car park issues to be annoying. I would call the room rate as \"upper budget\" and for that I felt I got my moneys worth. The Marriott next door is much more up market and the price very much so. I would not call the room at HPP a 4.5 room though, and I can not comment on the 3.5 star or 1 and 2 bed rooms. If you are looking for a budget place and are not too bothered with a pool, hot tub, dont want a full kitchenette or on-site parking, then you may find the YWCA (across the street) or the Travelodge Wentworth (1/2 block walk) cheaper and better value for money. We have stayed at both places as well and have had no dramas, although both have also had some negative reviews. Would we stay here again? Well, we got a good deal here which represented good value for money. If we had the same deal which put the HPP into the same price range as the Y or Travelodge, then probably.

I booked one of the large refurbished one bedroom apartments on the corner of the building on a high floor with two balconies. One balcony overlooking Oxford Street, the other overlooking Hyde Park. I thought it was a fantastic deal, and from my memories of the place, was really looking forward to 'living' in my apartment. I checked in and was happy with the service from the Front Desk. When i arrived on my floor (7) i couldn't help but be 'overcome' by the strong musty smell in corridors. Opened the door to my room, and POW, the musty/damp smell nearly knocked me out! The apartment was refurbished, but it looked like it was done on the cheap. The white walls were full of marks/scuffs, and there were stains on the sofa and chairs. The Bedroom was tiny. It just fitted the Queen size bed. The Musty smell was WORSE in the bedroom. The balcony door was stiff to open and you nearly gave yourself a hernia trying to open it. The apartment had two wall air-conditioners, that could not cope cooling the place properly. The bathrroom had mould on the tiles, and the exhaust fan was dangling from the ceiling. It was not looking good for my stay! Night came, and after being out all day because i couldn't face that musty smell, i could hear the loud noise from a busy intersection below. I just wanted to get out of the place, but thought i would consider next day after a night's sleep. Now, the final straw. The matress was like a rock. Honestly, if i went outside and layed on the grass, it would have been more comfortable! At 10pm i went down to Reception and told them i can't sleep on that bed, and if there were other beds available. Guy at Reception told me that, that was the standard hotel bed for one bedroom apartments. He then told me TO PUT SOME TOWELS OVER THE TOP TO MAKE IT COMFORTABLE. I then said i wanted out.

We then called the reservations department of the new hotel and they said they were waiting on confirmation from the Oaks. We had an appointment to go to so we left and then came back an hour later only to find out the manager of the Oaks had now left for the day and we did not have a confirmed booking anywhere. And to make it worse, the hotel we were transferred to was twice the price we originally were going to pay. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that the manager at the Oaks had left for the day without contacting us or confirming a booking for us, seeing his hotel could not fulfill our confirmed booking with them. We went back to the Oaks to try and sort this out, only to be treated like a nuisance. The hotel desk staff were so rude to us, it was shocking. They would not agree to pay the difference in costs for us upfront and confirm our booking at the new hotel. The transfer process between the hotels was not handled well by the Oaks. Basically they left us without a place to stay. We spent 71/2 hours at the Oaks trying to get them to agree to pay the difference in hotel costs, which they should have done when they transferred us originally. The only thing they could come up with was that we could travel back to the new hotel and get our bags, stay a night crammed in a 1 bedroom apartment and then go back to the new hotel in the morning and they would sort out the transfer. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do this because of the absolute rudeness of the staff at the Oaks, as well as hearing from other hotel guests who had been treated unethically. We had spoken to 2 separate lots of guests staying at the Oaks Hyde Park plaza and they had returned to their rooms during the day to find that the Oaks staff had packed up their belongings and moved them to a new room. This is totally illegal and should never be done. We ended up staying in the new hotel. The transfer was never sorted out by the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza. We had to confirm a booking for ourselves, luckily there were rooms available in the new hotel, but we did have to pay twice the price that we had originally booked for. The Oaks kept promising to sort out the transfer and pay the difference in costs so that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be out of pocket, however, it took a week after we returned from our trip for them to send us a check for the difference in accommodation costs. And this was only after we sent a letter to the head office explaining the situation. Basically the Oaks ruined our holiday and left us out of pocket. I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. It may be cheaper, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth the hassle, when you probably will be shipped off to another hotel anyway.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "mermaid waters", "Title": "\u201cbeware\u201d", "Author": "rockymermaidwaters", "ReviewID": "UR11473273", "Content": "I booked two weeks ahead,only to turn up and be told that no room was available and they were going to send me to another hotel completely distant from my expected location.

It was survivable and not as awful as some cheap hotels in NYC, but not nearly as nice as the 15th floor. Instead of a sofa there were two twin beds in the living room. Everything seemed a lot older.

Upon entering my room, which was booked as a 4.5star studio apartment, I was confronted with a shame of a room. Yes, it was decorated with modern colours, relatively new furniture, and quite clean. But that was where it ended. The extractor fan in the bathroom was hanging by a thread. The TV didn't work - both a poor picture quality and the remote control did not work. Two cushions on the sofa were split and the stuffing hanging out. The bathroom smelled of stale water... the list went on. I called to speak to the manager, and was *rudely* told that he would call me back. 30 minutes passed, and I left my room and went back to reception where I was told the manager had just left for the day by the same person I had spoken to earlier. I listed my complaints to the recption staff. There were around 8 other people in the lobby, all of who were dealing with similar problems, and all of whom were similarly disgruntled. After a further 15 minutes wait, I was handed another room key, this time room 1402. I travelled up to my floor and whilst walking down the corridor, I was confronted with a strong smell of paint. When I reached my room, the door was propped open and inside was a construction worker busily painting the room! There was dust everywhere, paint tins, brushes etc etc. I called down to the reception to inform them of their mistake, and was told to hold on again while they tried to rectify the problem. After a further 10 minute wait, the receptionist arrived at the room with a key to yet another room. this time it was room 709. I was assured it was a great room, a 1 bed apartment and was definitely ok. This it was, and after over an hour of messing around, I was able to settle into my home for the next few nights. I find it absolutely shocking that any hotel can advertise, yet alone be rated by AAA as being a 4.5star property. In the state that this place is in, even after a lick or two of paint, I would rate it at no more than 3.5star. Sure the facilities are useable, but they are DEFINITELY not \"Excellent quality accommodation, furnishings and facilities.\" as described by the AAA ratings. And this is what I am supposed to have paid for - I chose to stay in a 4.5star facility and yet received more than sub-standard accommodation.
