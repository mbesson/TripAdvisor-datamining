I was very much satisfied with my stay at hotel Esposizione Roma. It's in the BEST LOCATION CLOSE TO ALL, WALK EVERYWHERE! I was alone so I had a twin size room with a large armoire (that had a safe in it), flat screen tv, desk and chair. The bathroom was the perfect size for me I loved that it had a bidet and the shower was amazing. Yes it's small but how big do you want it to be for a cheaper hotel. It's a stand up shower with glass door and the best hot water pressure of life! I think I'll miss that the most. The bed was a little hard but I slept on top of the bedding and used my own travel blanket so I didn't mind. I could hear the people above me at times but not overnight so I wasn't disturbed. My room had no view but Rome is to be viewed from outside on the street not from the hotel! The only problem I had was that the phone in my room wasn't working and although I requested it, no one ever came to fix it. But I didn't care I had bought an Italian sim card for my cell and used my iPad for face time anyway(saves u $$$). If I did need the front desk I went to them as I came and went, which was rare. I recommend taking an airport shuttle as your cheapest option to find the hotel easiest because the drivers know where they're going, it is a little difficult to locate if you haven't been there before. The door you need says \"Esposizione 2\" and reception is on the 3rd floor. The elevator is tiny so be prepared to wait or just use the steps. By the way the best way to the Vatican is the termini train station 10 minutes from the hotel it's only 6 stops. Overall I had a great experience and yes I'd definitely stay there again.

The location is brilliant with all the major sights, restaurants and railway station in walking distance. Staff was friendly although we only had more contact with them during arrival and check-out. I don't know if we were just lucky and had silent neighbours but we hardly heard any noises during the night. During daytime instead, you could hear people walking in the corridor through the door. Anyway, I think I've never slept this well in any hotel. The hotel reception is located in the third floor and there is just a small sign outside, so it's not so easy to find but shouldn't be too hard either if you know the street number. The room was ok and they come and clean it every day.

Really big and powerful. Bathroom a big bonus. + Good location, 10 min walk from train station, 10 from Trevi fountain, Piazza Venezia... to be honest we took taxis to the Vatican and Pantheon, as I found the maps a little confusing and it wasn't too expensive anyway! - The walls are too thin!!! Sat up with friends about midnight having a conversation, with no music on, and was complained about by neighbours and accused of having a party! When reception knocked there was a child happily asleep in our room, yet we disturbed numerous guests and had to whisper. Also, when next door used the bathroom you could swear they were in your bedroom! It's a really big problem, I've never known anything like it and it put me right off, I felt on edge speaking in my own room after 10pm incase people complained. - The shower, even though it's really cool, flooded our room and ended up with a lot of wet clothes! We told reception though and they did come to fix it. - No wifi signal in the room so had to walk down a very big corridor to get a signal, which was annoying. -Beds were uncomfortable, even though they looked nice. The hotel was convenient, clean and pretty, and we got a good price, but the noise is a really big problem and made me feel very uncomfortable! If you plan on having conversations past 9pm I'd be prepared to be assaulted by neighbouring guests and reception.

I will even ignore the extremely disappointing fact that there was no kettle or tea-making facilities in the room. We walked from the train station, which took about 10 minutes, and the hotel was right on a main highstreet with many shops and restaurants. While me and my boyfriend were there we walked to most places just because everything was so near. The Colosseum was literally down the road, and the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps where across the street only a few miles away. Do take a map though because the streets are abit like mazes, but once we'de been there afew days we knew our way around and ended up going back to most of the attractions. The metro was extremely handy aswell. We took the metro to get to the Vatican City, but we ended up walking the way back which wasn't effort at all as we got to see the Pantheon and the beautiful bridge infront of the Vatican.

The street outside the hotel was very busy however the noise didn't carry to my hotel room. The room I was in was right behind the reception and noises did echo in the corridor, there is also a buzzer for having the street level door opened at night which was quite noisy too. But I did still manage to sleep easily enough and I'm a very light sleeper. The room and hotel was very clean and well furnished, the bathroom was modern and spacious. The hotel also left a bunch of flowers and cake in my room on my birthday after my mum emailed them which was a lovely touch. I would happily return to the hotel and would recommend it.
