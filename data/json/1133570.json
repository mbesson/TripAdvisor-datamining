Then they kept opening and shutting the fire doors and talking loudly. I was angry but knew there was nothing the hotel could do because of their lack of insulation in the walls. By 2 am the loud neighbours left and then by 5 am they were back turning on the bathroom fan. The next morning, I politely asked my neighbours were going to be back and if so could I please be moved. Sure enough, they claimed they did not hear the loud party and did not understand why I did not register a complaint. Ok so if I were to register a complaint, most likely they would not be able to stop the noise, esp. if they are renting their rooms to college age students. They kindly moved me and put me in the basement in a room facing the street with a single pained window so I could hear all the cars driving by, slamming their doors, and the click clack of people walking.

Sound good... I went to the suggested hotel (which is financed by the same manager) and I discovered a very small room, smaller than the room #26!!! It is for rats not for humans. And the worst was the receptionist: coarse and threatening, UNBELIEVABLE!!! After this new very grueling experience, coming back to Notting Hill Gate hotel: Of course, no solution provided, as I have to stay in room #26 with SLUGS for an other night. The last night they finally changed it for an other room, it was the room #1. OK, can I breath and sleep?!... NO, it was in the basement, strange smell, very noisy, no WiFi signal, NO INTERNET ACCESS. I would prefer SLUGS in room #26?! It was an UNBELIEVABLE experience.

The location was good but as soon as I arrived I had concerns. Before anything else I was being asked to pay and informed that my room would be small and the toilet was down stairs next to Reception. This was pointed out in the small print, clearly something I'd overlooked. When seeking clarification from the man at Reception over entering my credit card details onto their paperwork he sarcastically spelt out the word S-A-M-E ie if the card is the same you dont need to re-write it? Funny as English is my first language and I didnt appreciate the rudeness at the start of my depressing stay. I dragged my heavy suitcase up the stairs (without any offer of help) to my \"room\" and just couldnt believe what I'd paid for. A converted broom cupboard is the only way to describe Room 26. You can stand up and touch both sides of the wall with your hands, the bed is a small single that dips in the middle, the walls are scuffed & filthy and there is a small narrow window that opens behind your pillow. So freezing head if you fancy some fresh air. I asked for an upgrade but was told they were full and had a look in the area but couldnt find anything so resigned myself to staying in this hovel.

The room they gave us when we arrived was a tiny and hot one in the basement, then we compalined and they gave us the nightmare room 6 which is close to the brekfast room. We could hear everything from outside and so impossible to sleep well. Then thy moved us to room 20 which was better. Bed had wheels and moved far too easily. Bathrooms are tiny. Nowhere to hang towels. Breakfast area was very very tiny. A joke... we could not move!!! Breakfast was far too simple and even the coffee was cold. We (couple) paid \u00c2\u00a3110 pounds for 2 days. After all that was mentioned above, this price was far too expensive. Ah! They charge you if you pay by credit card and this is not mentioned on the website.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cNice clean budget hotel with a few creases to iron out\u201d", "Author": "jmel08", "ReviewID": "UR50709460", "Content": "I stayed here on the basis of other people's reviews and the hotel's proximity to the tube station, and I was not disappointed. The hotel is in a nice little street off the main road and there are lots of shops and places to eat nearby. Notting Hill is a lovely, quirky area and I would probably stay here again as it is convenient for everything, especially the tube. In all I had a pleasant stay and would recommend it to others, but there were a few little issues, which I think it's only fair to mention. If the hotel ironed these out I think it would be a really good place to stay, as it's pretty good already, it just needs a little more attention to detail and then it would be great. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful and the room was very clean and had fairly modern decor - particularly the bathroom, which was tiled and had a reasonable sized shower. My only slight quibble with it was that there was no towel rail or a hook to hang up a towel. In fact there were no hooks in the room at all, which meant I had to drape my wet towel over the sink, which wasn't ideal, but not the end of the world. I was travelling alone but had a double room, which was quite small but suited my needs perfectly. However, I think if there had been two people in the room, or if you were staying there for more than a few nights, it would have been a bit cramped. There were only four hangers in the wardrobe section (which was really just a rail with a wooden frame around it) and the only other drawer space was in the bedside table, which was small and there was only one, so if you had a lot of luggage I think you would struggle. On the plus side, there was a desk, a flatscreen TV (but only had the standard five channels) and free wi-fi and the window opened, which was nice to get some fresh air. The breakfast was simple but pleasant - there was corn flakes, muesli, apple and orange juice, tea, coffee, toast, jam, butter and boiled eggs. The hotel has no lift and there are LOTS of stairs and nobody to help with your luggage - there is a lovely grand staircase as you go in, but it's not so lovely when you are trying to carry heavy bags up it! I was staying on the fourth floor and it was quite tricky trying to negotiate my bulky suitcase up the narrow windy stairs to my room. Also at night the lights were not working on the fourth floor and the only light came from blue fire safety lights, which looked a bit like cat's eyes, low down on the wall. I had a bit of trouble finding the key slot for my room as it was so dark. But like I said, these were only small issues and wouldn't put me off going back. I'd just try to stay in a room on a lower floor next time or bring lighter luggage!", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara", "Title": "\u201cvery small room with smiling staff but not understanding you\u201d", "Author": "gezginlady", "ReviewID": "UR50214802", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks.

We (three adults) stayed there for 5 days. We got the room on the 5th floor and there was no elevator so the trek upstairs with our three luggages was not fun. Location was very convenient - about a 3-5 min walk from Notting Hil Gate Station or the Queensway tube station. Just steps from the hotel is a bus stop, so you are only a bus ride away from places like Oxford Street and Picadilly Circus (take bus 94) and the British Museum (bus 390). It's also within walking distance to Kensington Garden and Portabello Road. Breakfast was provided in the morning but don't expect anything fancy. It was hard boiled eggs, toast with jam/butter, milk, fruit juices, coffee and tea. Breakfast room is really small, and depending on when everybody else gets up, may get a little crowded, so you may have to line up to get into the room. And even if you get sick of their breakfast there are decent places around the Notting Hill Gates tube station (ie. Pret-a-manger, EAT) just down the street. The room was a little small, but at least everything was clean. We were mostly out and about and was mainly looking for a place to crash after a long sightseeing. Staff was friendly and helpful. The street was a dead-end street so there isn't as much traffic as a main street, so it was pretty quiet at night. Our only complaint was there was no remote control in our room on our arrival and it took a while to figure out which remote control worked in our room. Overall we are satisfied with this place and would recommend this to others.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201cnever will stay at this hotel again!\u201d", "Author": "Single_traveller_9", "ReviewID": "UR43887063", "Content": "Booked a single room.
