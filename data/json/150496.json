The service in the hotel restaurant (breakfast) was extremely poor, the older gentlemen that was talking care of me, was not happy I did not choose the buffet, he really did not want to refill coffee , etc. if you watch, most of them just stand around and chat.

Had a great time in the casino, the roof top pool and sauna were perfect after a long day, the breakfast buffet was tasty. The worst problem we had was with housekeeping. As in there was none. We got in on a Monday. Tuesday no one came by. Went to the front desk at 5pm, told them no one stopped by and we really just needed coffee and towels. No one ever showed. Had to call down at 6am to have coffee brought up. Left Wednesday morning for a zip line trip, stopped at the front desk and AGAIN requested housekeeping to come by with a minimum of coffee and towels. Again, nothing. Had to swipe towels from a cart in the hall just so we could take showers when we got back. Thursday, they came by at like 4pm. I'm not sure if that is standard, but I was not pleased with that at all, especially after saying something twice on two different days to the front desk. Overall, I would stay here again.

It was recommended by a travel specialist since it was close to the cruise ship piers. We paid a premium price at nearly $300 per night. We would have been treated better at a $99 per night Courtyard Marriott. I suppose the big difference is the level of service customer service expected of Marriott Franchisees as opposed to Sheraton franchisees. Upon check in the staff was immediately put out with the fact that we did not have a \"voucher\" from our travel agent. Keep in mind I had called two days prior and to confirm our reservation and get the hotel confirmation number directly from them. All this information I had and I was made to feel that without the voucher I may not get the room that I had already paid for. Never was I told on the phone when I called to confirm my reservation that I would need to provide a voucher to check in to the room. After much rumbling and a check with the manager we were allowed to check into the room we had paid for in advance. To say the least it was NOT a warm welcome to our $300 per night accomodations. The room was mediocre at best. The furniture and surroundings did match the pictures on the website. However, the bathroom had not been updated in several years. At the rates they charge, a modern bathroom should be standard. This was not even up to Interstate Express hotel standards much less hotels charging much more. The elevators looked like a horse race had taken place inside of them. Not sure they had ever been cleaned touched up or updated. The real attitude and lack of concern by the mis-informed staff came when we returned from our lovely seven day cruise. Since we had a large amount of time between our disembarking from the ship and our flight times we thought it would be nice to re-visit Old San Juan for more shopping and dinning. Since we had stored our luggage at the hotel after we checked out to take advantage of the time we had before boarding the ship and saw they had a VERY LARGE luggage storage area we figured we would do the same thing before heading to the airport. Upon arriving at the hotel from the pier via cab I asked the bellman who was standing there like a statue doing nothing if we could check our bags into storage. He asked if we were checking in and I said no we had been guest a few days ago and wanted to use the baggage facility while enjoying Old San Juan before our flights. He informed me that they did not have a sotrage area for bags. Really??? Mind you this was the SAME bellman who had stored our bags before we left. I pointed out that I knew where the room was and it looked ample size for our bags. No he said hotel policy we do not store bags. Apparently bellman are paid better here than any other hotel in the world because even the offer of a substantial tip for the services was met with more rudeness and disconcern. I thought bellman used the assets at their disposal to make more tips and to not cause a scene, I was proven wrong at this hotel. I went to the front desk where again I was told by the very unfriendly female desk clerk that there was no room for our bags and it did not matter anyway becasuse we were not hotel guests. I explained that were had spent very good money to be hotel guests before the cruise and she quickly, and in a tone I have never experiecned by anyone in guest realtions, that \"Sir we accomodated you while you were checked in as a guest and your accomodatoins ended when you checked out\". She said there were other options. When we checked the other options they were closed. She did not even know the facts of the \"options\" she was suggesting. Well she was exactly right about one thing. My accomodations with Sheraton and Starwood brands did end that day. NEVER will I spend my money with a company that cares so little and is focused so much on policies that in no way help current or previous guests of these hotels. Please stay away from the Sheraton Old San Juan. The staff is the worst I have seen in any hotel, the policies are very unaccomdating, and the rooms are expensive and mediocre at best. Thanks to a very nice Taxi driver who took us to a RESTARAUNT in old San Juan that checked our bags while we shopped and contributed nearly $1000 to the local economy. How much did the restaraunt charge??? NO CHARGE..it was suggested a $5 tip (total not per bag).

I phoned VISA who also did an enquiry. The hotel came up with a story that AirMiles did not honour our AirMiles certificates from 3 months earlier....soooooo, I phoned Air Miles, they told me that indeed the Hotel got their money back when we checked in. Thankfully, VISA reimbursed our card. Upon phoning the hotel again, they apologized and said it was an accounting error......

To me the amenities are usually not important as I like to go out and explore the area, so it is just a place to sleep. Unfortunately on this trip my wife and I have not had a single night of good sleep. The walls of the place are so thin that you can hear everything that is being said. The first night we had some group of girls on what must have been a spring break arriving to the room at 1:30AM (after clearly having a lot of fun at local bars) and having loud discussions of boyfriends etc using a lot of profanity (yes, I really meant that you can hear everything). The sad thing is that the front desk nothing about it after my call even though they said that they will send security. After my second call they said that sent some one up as I heard them coming from all the way down the hall as they (the security) were talking on the walkie talkies (as I mentioned you can hear everything) so the girls got quite. Security leaves and the party next door continues until I had to call the front desk again. Keep in mind that it is lose to 3am at that point. The similar thing happened two more nights, although I figured out that knocks on the wall were effective tool to keep the next door parties in check. On our last night we were awaken at 3:30Am by a TV and some loud talking in Spanish. THE WALLS ARE VERY THIN. There are some GOOD things too. The hotel is generally well maintained and the location is just perfect. There is a car rental right in the hotel so you can rent the car and go visit El Yunque or explore a little bit. The local bus termInal is a block away so you can acces a lot of beaches and other areas without a cab if you want to. Everything is in walking distance. There are a lot of restaurants in the area for any taste. In my view this area is much better than Isla Verde or other aras with bunch of resorts stuck to each other unless you just want to lie on the beach all day long.

Let me say that again. They raised the rate to $289.00 plus taxes, not just for the weekend, but for the days I had already booked, because I was staying the weekend. I found that very strange! Walked into the room and noticed that not only was there no balcony, there was no big window. The window was about 3 x 3 and was covered by plantation shutters. The good news was that the shutters were there to prevent prying eyes from looking into the room. The bad news was that, when I opened the shutters, I found I was looking directly into the middle of a 12-story parking garage, and that was the only view. The room was freezing cold and I tried to modify the temperature setting (bear in mind this is all happening within 5 minutes of walking into the room). When I moved the temperature up or down, it simply returned to the setting it was initially at. I couldn't adjust it at all. So, I went to the phone to call the service desk and find out how to do that. The phone was dead. Didn't work. Couldn't dial out. Went out into the hall and used the hall phone. Found out the temperature can't be adjusted. The system is either on or off. Can't modify the temperature in the room. (And the voice on the phone promised to check on the telephone.) Went back into the room and began to unpack. Needed to use the phone, so after about 30 minutes, went back outside and used the house phone again.

Not my idea of a fun place at which to lose my money. We ate here on the night of our arrival, not feeling like exploring after a long day's air travel. OK, the best I can report is that we did not go away hungry. Stomachs happy, taste buds wondering what the heck happened to them.

Especially disappointing given hotel is quite far from a beach. we got upgraded to a junior suite, which was great in terms of the space and the balcony with partial ocean (and cruise ship) view. But the carpet was stained and the paint was chipped along the baseboards... it's clearly been a while since they've updated the rooms. irritating that they charge a 10% resort fee on top of $220 room fee (which was apparently a deal...) so with tax we paid $250/night and I didn't see any resort amenities to justify the charge. also worth noting that they often sell out completely to people getting on and off cruise ships so you may have to wait well past the 3 pm check-in time for your room. don't be one of those sad looking people sitting on your suitcase in the lobby -- drop bags with bellman and go explore.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnaby, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOnly good for convenince of going on a cruise\u201d", "Author": "vacationlover2012", "ReviewID": "UR124995382", "Content": "I would only recommend this hotel if you are going on a cruise and need a place to stay that is close to the pier, walking distance.

We got a good price at the Sheraton on Priceline. I was a little unsure of the location due to the proximity to the cruise ships. and the possibility of being overrun by passengers every time we stepped out the door. It never was a problem. In fact I enjoyed looking out and seeing which ship was in every day. I found the location so central to all of old San Juan that I'd choose it again for just that reason. Every staff person we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. We had a standard room, and it was fine. It isn't shiny new, and the furniture was dark old wood of the West Indies style. I liked it all. The beds were very comfy and house keeping did a good job of cleaning and fulfilling any requests we had. In the room, I never heard other guests except the ones in the halls who appeared to be returning from late night partying. It feels like on weekends all of the island comes to town, so there is probably noise everywhere. My suggestion would be to join them and walk around the old town as late as you want. Around the hotel feels very safe, as does all the town within the confines of the tourist areas. The gym was adequate. It was nice to look out over the sea from the treadmills. The pool is small, as others have reported. Not having gone on vacation to swim, I didn't mind. I felt I could have done some laps had I been inclined to -just short ones.The few times we went up to sit by the pool there were chairs open, and it was peaceful. I imagine if a large family came in it would feel a bit crowded. I do like a bit of slot playing, but it didn't take more than one night to find I wasn't going to be lucky in the casino. It's small, and has less choices than I'm accustomed to. Maybe give it an evening if you like. The locals go there and are fun to chat with. I learned from them that while playing the machines, you can order not only free drinks, but free sandwiches as well. They were having some sort of ham and cheese cooked things that might make a nice snack for the price of a tip. If you aren't driving, skip this part...We rented a car to get out and see more of the island. To avoid the $21.40/nt valet parking, we parked on the street. Coming back in the day time, there was usually a spot within a block of the hotel. You have to look closely, because it's illegal to park where the curb has yellow or blue paint. You will see many people park there anyway, and I don't know how many tickets were written. At night, there are various fellows who stand on the curbs and direct people into parking spaces. They will guide you in as if they are teaching you to parallel park for the first time, then they stand near waiting for a dollar or two tip. We questioned one man after we parked and realized the curb was yellow. He assured us the police didn't give tickets at night for parking there. We moved the car shortly anyway, and soon saw a ticket being written to someone else nearby, so - do it at your own risk. On the weekend, the city seems to fill up and make street parking at less available. We ended up valet parking Friday and Saturday night. There are 2 or 3 parking garages near the hotel. Short term, they seem like a decent price, but it's unclear about the pricing for 24 hr parking.Check before you enter and have to pay to leave if you change your mind. We didn't find a garage that was less than the valet for our needs. We did do some driving in and around town. I wouldn't have had the patience for it had i been on my own, but my friend drives regularly in London and found it manageable. If you can't decide about getting a car, you can walk all over old town and just rent when you want to get out of town. The major touristy sites out of SJ also have tours to take you if you don't want to drive.There's a Hertz office in the Sheraton. We took a taxi to Coronado one evening so we could drink, and it was $12 one way and $15 back. Taxi to airport from the hotel was $21. If you are going to the Sheraton pre-cruise, do your research and see where your ship docks. You may be able to just cross the street and board, but if it's farther down the docks, you may choose a short taxi ride. As for the restaurants in the hotel, there were so many others we wanted to try, we didn't eat there except for a quick burger. It was just that - a burger. Nothing more. I recommend getting up and walking the city early while it's cool, or near sunset. There is so much to see and if you get lost, just head downhill toward the docks and you'll find the Sheraton. No matter where you choose to stay, do get out and soak in the charm and color of old San Juan.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia, United States", "Title": "\u201cA lovely experience\u201d", "Author": "Ty Xavier W", "ReviewID": "UR124823712", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for about 4 days, it was my first time there.

There was nothing in breakfast that would make me have dinner here although we did have burgers and a beer on the front terrace which were normal US fodder.

The last trip to PR we stayed in Condado, but found we were always coming down to Old Town for the great Restaurants (Dragon Fly, etc) and night life. This trip we chose to stay downtown. Location: The hotel is a short walk to the Carnival ship dock (not RCL). We dragged our bags the ~400 yards. It was hot, but no big deal for anyone in decent shape. Any closer and you would be on the boat. It is a 10 min walk to the Grocery store (beer, snack run), and maybe 15 to the fort. Hotel Staff: Great attitude, very friendly. I travel a lot and would be hard pressed to find a friendlier helpful front desk staff (especially the nice lady who checked us in and upgraded the room). Pool: Small, warm, but considering you are downtown it was good enough for a couple of nights to cool off. They did not hassle us at all for bringing up a few beers. Rooms: The standard rooms are on the small side, but clean and comfortable. The JR Suites are not that much more and give you twice the space, very nice. Elevators: Not enough, and you cannot take the stairs all the way down (we tried, and then had to walk back up a floor)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.so you just have to wait. When the rush was on it could be 20 min, but other than that most of the time it was not an issue.

I didn't select the hotel. The rate at the time was $179 USD without the taxes and resort fees. Expect this to add another $20+ to the nightly room rate. The room we had was adequate with a comfortable bed and clean linens with extra pillows. There was a dresser and wardrobe tha accommodate the two of us fine. There is a desk with lamp and internet cabling. In-room coffee and a daily (almost) bottle of water grattice. My room had no wirless internet. Get your room activated by contacting the front desk. I have an iPad with Verizon data plan. No data service in SJ but the phone worked fine as well as email and texting. Basically you get \"1X\" service with good signal strength in most places. Wi-fi is available in the meeting rooms. I don't know how much it cost as someone else set up the service. The resturanrt on the second floor was good. Breakfast could be obtained from the full buffet consisting of both hot ($15) and cold ($10) options. You can also order off the menu if you have special dieteray needs. The coffee in PR is stronger than on the U.S. mainlaind, so you may want to get a pot of hot water and cut it accordingly. Warm milk is a standard accessory. I had dinner there two nights and breakfast every day for 5 days. Never a problem and the wait staff was courteous and professional. We also used a couple of the larger meeting rooms for our function. They were well set up and accommodated us well. The hotel also provided the a.m. and p.m. snack breaks daily. Food quality was very good. The hotel provided A/V screens and cords and podiums. It all worked well. The fitness center appears to be fairly new. It is equipped with 2 bikes, one recumbent and one upright by LifeFitness, also by LifeFitness, 3 treadmills, 3 ellipticals and a rack of dumbbells from 5 to 50 pounds. There is also a weight machine that will accommodate activity for a couple muscle groups. There is also a flat bench that can be adjusted to tilt. Stability balls also were on hand. It's all installed in a fairly small room, given the amount of equipment but they seem to make it work. I used the room 4 times during my stay. On my last day the room was way too hot. The fitness center and pool are located on floor 9. There are locker rooms on this floor so you can lock up your stuff if you have a lock to apply. Somewhat disappointing here was the fact that both the men's and women's rooms on this floor were almost always out of towels or the dispensers were not functioning properly. We tried on numerous occasions to get extra towles but that didn't always work. I don't know if it was a language barrier or not, but they seemed to understand but then when we came back from an outing we rarely got them after they cleaned the room. You need to use your room key card to access floors 3 through 9. The 9th floor is as high as this hotel goes. If you are on any of these floors, you must also use the card to traverse between floors as well. You do not need a card to get to the ground floor. We had a particularly bad time with the key cards on our last night here. For unexplained reasons they both stopped working, even after being reprogrammed. Then we got news sets of keys TWICE. Neither elevator would read any of our keys. Other guests started expereinceing problems but it was intermittent. After getting a fourth set of room keys, we finally got things working. This is when all you want is a simple elevator that does not require a room key to access your floor. Apparently all this is done in the name of security. It was a hassle and was among the only low notes on the stay. San Juan is a party city for many people. That said, yelling, screamining and running through the hotel's halls at 3:00 a.m. by some of the most discourteous obnoxious \"guests\" resulted in my calling the hotel front desk TWICE Saturday night. By Sunday night these jerks were long gone, presumably or perhaps thrown off the property. THAT episode was awful. Overall I give this Sheraton a 3 out of 5 because nothing really stood out to validate a higher rating. If you soend your time here on vacation you will probably be fine.

The lobby is all the time crowded and filled with cruise passengers trying to store or retrieve their luggage from bell man. The casino is very good too compared to other casinos in old san juan. We booked our hotel room with Priceline so priceline already already charged for 2 nights stay. After we checked out and came home, I saw that their accounting department charged my credit card for the 2 night stay again. So I was charged first time by priceline and second time by Sheraton Old San Juan's accounting department for the same stay. I called their accounting department and they say they got my message and would call back but nobody ever called back or e-mailed me on the incorrect transaction. I had to loose my peace of mind on this and finally a lady e-mailed back after some days saying that it will be refunded back to my credit card in 10 business days. I got the money back.

I arrived WAY earlier than they did - around 6am to be precise - and we couldn't check in until the afternoon. So I spent a lot of time in their lobby. I'm happy to say that the lobby is comfy and a good people-watching spot. I spent part of my time looking into the casino which opened at 8am. (Yikes!) It has a couple of restaurants, including one on the ground level right by the casino. The location is wonderful if your cruise happens to be leaving from one of the ports it's across from. Ours didn't so we had to take a taxi over but the location is also excellent to explore Old San Juan from. This is a beautiful section of the city and one you should not miss. Since I was playing the waiting the game I interacted with a few of the staff members. They were all very nice and helpful. The breakfast buffet was a little steep at $15. It didn't really have a selection of food that would merit that price unless you ate several plates of it. And it was too much of traditional American breakfast. I ate there because I didn't know where else to go at 6:30am! I was a little concerned about the noisy restaurant in front of the hotel which was going full force by the time we returned to our room to sleep. We were only on the 4th floor and I though its sound might travel up. I was so happy to be wrong and we didn't hear a thing. The room although very basic in its decor - white comforters and curtains - was comfortable and clean. The beds were great and covered with wonderfully thick and plush comforters which just make you want to sleep extra long. The location is great too for touring beautiful Old San Juan. There are cruise ships right across from the hotel. Ours, unfortunately, was a taxi ride away. But hey, you may get lucky! My only complaint is the sensor on the lights.

It is across the street from San Juan bay. A short walk takes one into the heart of old San Juan and all the caf\u00c3\u00a9s, restaurants, night spots, small museums and historic spots. The problems with this hotel are mostly due to historic reasons. The fact that the building in which its housed goes back to a different area and wasn't meant as a hotel means that it has no parking of its own. There is, however, a municipal parking across the street at the side of the building, and another a block away. Rates are quite reasonable (Don't use the hotel's valet parking. They use the very same municipal parking, but charge four times as much!). Also because of cramped space, amenities are on the smallish size, but quite adequate. For example, the pool is on the roof and not large, meant to dip in, not swim. On the other hand, they've made it pleasant. On the bright side, they've used their imagination to squeeze in as many amenities as possible in the cramped space. Thus, in addition to the pool, the hotel has a comparatively large fitness room, a restaurant, conference rooms, a bar-and-burger joint and, of course, the casino. The decor is simple, but nice. Very simple, the color schemes being bright pastels (Y'know, the whole tropical thing). Room furniture is on the theme of the austere, dark Spanish colonial look, simple but quite adequate. I personally liked it. The room is comfortably sized. Air conditioned worked fine (A blessing in the tropics), the bathroom larger than in most hotels and well appointed. The whole of the hotel was kept very clean. Tickets were given to me when I checked in for a full buffet breakfast free, with waffles and omelettes cooked to order.

Hint - unless you really can't manage it yourself, don't pay the baggage handlers to cart your stuff for you. It's not a long walk. The hotel was clean, and the staff were very nice. You can walk all over Old San Juan from the hotel, even up to El Morro. There is a CVS and a Senor Frog's right next door, but I recommend the Old Harbor Brewery, a few blocks away. They have good food and interesting micro brew beers. We arrived in San Juan just after hurricane Irene, so a lot of things were shut down. The rainforest was closed, and many of the local activities, like horseback riding and ATV's, were not running. Electricity was intermittent. But the concierge helped us find something to do, and gave us a contact where we could ride horses and ATV's in the same place not too far away. She also helped us get a car for the day, which is a good idea if you're traveling any distance. Taxis are very expensive, especially since there were 5 of us - they charge per person. The hotel was fine for what we were doing, but if I were going back to stay in San Juan, I'd go back to one of the bigger hotels on the beach, like one of the Marriotts. They are a short cab ride from Old San Juan ($10), and they have much nicer facilities. The Sheraton has a casino, which we did not visit, but there is no bar or lounge area, and the pool is a small rooftop pool. We only went there once, because if 6 people show up, it's crowded. My family did use the gym facilities, and seemed to enjoy them. It's a small space as well. Overall, if you plan to spend all your time in Old San Juan, or if you're heading out on a cruise and only need to stay a night or two, this is a good choice.

After all, you can't control much of what you encounter in this world, you can only control your reaction to it. The staff at the Sheraton Old San Juan went well above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. You could really tell that they genuinely cared that we had a good time at their establishment and were willing to do whatever they could to make that happen. Hotel manager Alejandro Rios especially, was a literal calm during the storm, patiently listening to our and other guests' complaints and then doing the best that he could under the circumstances to satisfy our needs. He and the majority of the staff were truly exceptional and they should be commended for their performance in what was certainly a less than ideal situation. General notes: Location is great. Walkable to everywhere in OSJ and a bike ride or taxi ride to the beaches in Condado. The excercise room is awesome! I took advantage of it every morning (barring the days there was no power of course - I was reimbursed the service fees those days as well, because we could not take advantage of the majority of the services!)

First, the pluses - it was pretty easy to get to and had easy access to cruise ships with cab fare, which is great. The casino in the ground floor was a nice touch for those that wanted a shot at playing a game and winning, as opposed to cruises, which are notoriously harder to win odds-wise. The pool on the rooftop was nice to be outdoors and not have it be too noisy, and same with the rooms where it was in a busy area but sleeping was no problem. In addition, Old San Juan is great and classic in terms of walkability and things to see right out the front door, so location is perfect. The negatives, the casino was small without a bunch of options and was very crowded the night I was there. The pool was nice as I said above, but being on the rooftop, you would have thought better views, and for safety reasons, it meant the views just weren't there. The pool was small though, smaller than the website makes it appear, but again, still nice. I didn't like the fitness center very much at all, but overall it was a pretty good looking hotel. So not really blown away either positive or negative, but it served its purpose. Old San Juan is a nice area, we never felt like it was dirty or unsafe like I have heard other people claim, and this hotel is right in the middle of some fun activities. I don't know if there are better options in Old San Juan, and I doubt it, and better options may be more out on the outskirts and in \"resort areas\" themselves, meaning why spend one night there. For spending one night, I would consider this a good option, as there are some good food options within walking distance, and it isn't great, but isn't bad either.

Overall the hotel was very good. I decided to stay here AFTER my week long cruise on Royal Caribbean. The taxi fare from the Royal Caribbean pier (which is the Pan American pier on the other side of the bay - NOT the piers in front of the hotel) is $10.00. It will cost $19.00 from the hotel to the airport. If you are cruising on Carnival - then the piers are directly in front of the hotel. The best attributes of this hotel were: 1. Location, location, location! Its right off the water in OSJ. Everything is within walking distance. There are dozens of shops, bars, and restaurants within a few blocks of this hotel. OSJ is very pedestrian friendly so you won't have any problems getting around. 2. The staff! Very nice and go out of their way to help you. The front desk people remembered my name for my entire stay there. 3. The beds in the room are very comfortable. I would have liked to have taken one home. Linens were good too. 4. The air conditioning - you can get your room to locker room cold if you chose. The a/c comes from a vent near the ceiling and not a window unit. This is a big deal to me. It doesn't blow over you while you are in bed. 5. Large rooms with big bathrooms. Overall, very comfortable room with safes to keep your money and valuables while you are out or at the pool. 6. The pool is nice and on the roof top. Its fairly small but adequate. 7. The 3 internet computers in the lobby were nice. Free of charge for hotel guests. Here are a few things the hotel could improve on. 1. The rooms could stand some painting. The ceiling had some dark spots on it. 2. The carpets are not terrible, but not all that great. I saw a few spots and the carpet didn't appear to be too new. 3. The room could use some \"softening\". There was only 1 picture in the room and 1 in the bathroom. Lots of bare wall space. Also, some drapes/curtains over the patio door would be a great touch and make the room a bit more inviting. 4. I saw some mildew problems in the bathroom (room 809). I bit on the shower curtain towards the top front and some on the tile in the shower and the grout in between the tiles. 5. The grout in the tiles in the bathroom flooring are in dire need of attention. Its much darker in traffic areas then what you see under the sink. The hotel was clean overall. I noticed though the maids left a bit of trash on the floor after they left. That was only one day however. Hotel restaurants.... Overall very good! Chicago burger was my favorite. Very tasty food and the price was not expensive. The main restaurant on the second floor had very good food too but was overpriced in my opinion. I did not try the casino but it looked very busy. The hotel is very busy on Sundays - major turnover with all the cruise ships. If you are arriving on a Sunday you will have to wait until 3PM until your room is ready. The hotel will store your bags. Actually my room was ready around 2:30PM so I was happy. A few other tips.... 1. If you are in need to do laundry - there is a laundromat on O'Donnell Street about 3 blocks from the hotel. Very reasonable there.... 2. I found a deli called the Old San Juan deli on Tetuan street across from the big banco Popular. Great food and cheap! 3. Make sure you visit the old Spanish fort on the northwest side of OSJ. Great! 4. Hotel El Convento - I believe - was featured in the Flying Nun. Its a nice area....a lot of pictures of the area around there as well as the cathedral were taken for the series....sorry I'm a Sally Field fan! The wide stair case that you see at the end of each episode on the Flying Nun are to the left of the hotel. I'm not too sure about the hotel being in the series but those steps are definitely the ones you see Sister Bertrille walking up. Would I recommend this hotel? Definitely!

The sitting area has the bayview bathroom in the middle and at the end is the bedroom with no view. Check-in was a breeze but if you get there early there are no rooms ready, not available until 3 pm. Asked for a late check-out and got it w/o charge. Nice and friendly staff, didn't have problem at the front or check-in. Didn't have time to do much but found good restaurant at the back of the hotel and go up the stairs there are a couple of nice restaurants and Starbucks. I would recommend to stay here on the weekend, a lot of things to do and a lot of people. If you like to be on the beach and a big swimming pool, this is not the hotel for you, no beach and a small pool on the 9th floor with limited lounge chairs maybe only 12. The bedroom has nice comfy bed and nice pluffy king size pillows, but the comforter is way too heavy so I got rid of that. Didn't try the restaurants in the hotel because of the reviews I read.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service and Convenient Location\u201d", "Author": "live2travel808", "ReviewID": "UR108008980", "Content": "We stayed a couple of nights at the Sheraton Old San Juan before our cruise on the Carnival Victory.

They were upgraded to a suite with an ocean view which included a bottle of champagne and chocolates. My parents were very pleasantly surprised! The hotel was very nice and the staff was very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. We took advantage of the free internet access and use of computers in the lobby. There is also a casino, small pool, fitness room, and rental car office on site. Shopping and restaurants were all within walking distance as well as our cruise ship dock. We were a little concerned about being so close to the dock, which was right across the street, but it was not a problem. The location was nice and we felt safe walking around, even at night. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to those going on a cruise as well as people who want to be in the heart of Old San Juan. Just be prepared for large crowds on the days the cruise ships arrive in port. There was a very long line at the front desk and with the bellhop. We checked out over the phone and called the bellhop to take our luggage instead of waiting in line and that worked out very well. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sail until late that evening so we had the hotel hold our luggage for us until we were ready to check in at the ship.

George Rodregiez should not be in the hotel business. The other two front desk agents were friendly and helpful but Geoge was such a petty and miserable man that he refused to allow any check-ins before 3:30 pm. What kind of service is that? This is the closest hotel to the cruiseship terminal in Old San Juan so they should be used to the high turn-over each Sunday. We check-in at 8:30 am, on a Sunday, after a 2 week cruise, we were told we were 3rd in line for a room and we be assigned a room as soon as one was available. My cell phone didn't work in San Juan, so we went for breakfast, a walk around and checked back at 10:30 am to see if a room was ready, that's when we encountered \"George\". He basically told us that rooms would not be ready before 3 pm, and not to check with staff anymore in a very unpleasant, arogant and dismissive manner, even though other staff told us that we would be contacted as soon as a room was available. We were also waiting in line for our car rental at Hertz (that we reserved,) which was also not ready. At around noon, my husband checked back at the front desk (after waiting in line of course) and was told that a room was still not available. I also asked if we could pay for an upgrade for another room that may be available, but was told no rooms were available. We needed to leave the hotel at 2 pm to drive to an excursion on the other side of the island so we checked back again for an available room before leaving. We were told that George was at lunch and that George told them they were not allowed to assign any rooms until after 3:30 pm, AFTER he returned from lunch. We retrieved some items from our stored luggage and left for our excursion (returning at 11:30 pm). The port staff were pleasant and helpful, dispite the kaos. We ran into other cruisers from our ship on the excursion who went to the \"other\" Sheraton and said they were checked-in and given a room right away. I have to say, I've stayed at many Sheratons, Hyatts, Hiltons, Fairmonts, etc, and have never ran into such an un-service oriented hotel worker. The lobby was crazy (far too small) most of the time we were there, you'd think they would want to get as many people into rooms as soon as possible. Of course, we were unable to use the \"free internet\" or pool before being assigned a room, so needless to say, we didn't get to see or use any of the ammenities. If this hotel wants to discourage cruise ship passengers from staying at this hotel, they are definitely on the right track -- actively keeping ALL guests from being able to check into rooms early, even Starwood members like me. The rooms were basic, no shampoo/conditioner, etc. but comfortable.

The best things about this hotel is its location in Old San Juan and the staff. You can walk everywhere in Old San Juan easily and the hotel is right on the bay so some rooms have nice bay views and the patios of the restaurants have great ocean views of all the cruise ships coming and going. The staff overall was wonderful, friendly and very helpful-especially JANMARILY at the front desk and ALEX and LUIS who worked in both restaurants. The housekeeping staff was wonderful as well and if you put the sign on your door that you weren't interested in service, they actually respected that and did not come in. Often I would pass them in the hall and they would offer extra towels or see if there was anything we needed. Top notch housekeeping and I felt very comfortable that my things were safe in the room (unlike other places I have stayed in Puerto Rico). Negatives were there is no real hotel room service, only from the restaurants which are at the hotel, one being a burger place (mediocre at best) and one a more expensive Italian restaurant. The room service food available during the day is very limited and they stop at 11pm at night. Both restaurants are also pretty slow so don't go if you are starving. However the happy hour offered at the Italian restuarant, Il Palacio I think it was called, is great-VERY affordable drinks and appetizers. My other complaints were the water in the shower never held its temperature- it would go back and forth between hot and cold during every shower (and we stayed in 3 different rooms) and also half the equipment in the gym was broken or needed maintenance.

Then they got us a cab to the airport to meet some family then we were going on to Culebra. I left my purse in the cab and it had cash and credit cardsand expensive cell phone along with id etc etc. We filled out a missing report with transportation at the airport .(everyone was very helpful there too ) We were hoping that by some miracle we would get my purse back. (There are over 1,000 cabs in SJU) We had 3 hours to kill before going to the small airport so we all hopped in a cab and went back to the Sheraton. Everyone there was so sypathetic and tried to help us. My husband was talking with two gentlemen at the Sheraton who help with the cabs. They asked for a discription of the driver the best thing could think of was he played Air Supply cd and we all sang \"I'm All Out Of Love\" while he was driving us in the van. Then one of the guys said \"that's Santiago, he plays that all the time!!!!\" He knew another guy who had Santiago's cell and he helped us get ahold of him. Santiago had already gone home but found my purse in his van and drove it 25 minutes to us. We tipped him handsomely and the gentlemen who helped us. That gave me such a good feeling.

Our \"water view\" room was actually facing Senor Frogs restaurant, with a sliver of water - and the windows don't open to let in the water breezes. The window was tiny and the room was cramped, with not a lot of space to put your clothes. Really nice bed, though. Also, the breakfast is overpriced and eh - although the room does look over the water.

When I had a health emergency and needed to find a doctor, the concierge argued - and then finally gave us the main number of a hospital switchboard.

The hotel is older so the elevators are small, there's only 2 and they are slow. Be prepared for hordes of pre and post cruisers checking in with tons of luggage into the really small lobby, but considering the amount of turn over and 1 night stays this hotel has, I think they do a pretty good job. We checked out the casino which is small but ok for trying out a couple of slot machines. The only other thing is the hotel is impossible to find if you're not familiar with the area.

Before going on a cruise that leaves from San Juan I made reservations at the Sheraton Old San Jual for 3 nights. My husband and daughter were expecting some rest and relaxtion from the holidays - NOT. I called and confirmed our reservation two days before arriving. The reservationist told me that we had a Starwood Preferred Guest Double room with a \"CITY VIEW\" - and that I should check with the front desk at check in about getting a Harbor/Bay View. When we checked in I did just that - and the gentleman that checked us in told me that we are on the highest floor with a city view. Valerie was also at the front desk and with a straight face - said, \"You even have a balcony\". The bellman brought our bags upstairs and when we walked into the room - it smelt DAMP and Moldy. I walked over to the wooden shutters that covered the \"Patio Door\" to see our \"city view\" and the \"Balcony\", From our room our view was a 9 floor parking gargage that was across a narrow alley. THE BALCONY was 1 and 1/2' wide (and I am being generous) I asked the bellman about the view and she said let's call the front desk In Spanish - he told VALERIE that I was not happy with the view (this is the only side of the conversation I could hear) and after years of Spanish in HS and College and living in NYC - I understood perfectly what he said. Valerie had him put me on the phone and said \"What can I do for You?\" - pretending like she had no idea what I was talking about. THE WORST THING A FRONT DESK CLERK can do IS PLAY THE GUEST FOR AN IDIOT. She told me that all of the double double rooms faced the parking gargage and that if I wanted a room with a view I would have had to reserve a King Bed and have a roll away brought into the room. She also told me that the room would be smaller (if that was possible). THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART WAS THAT I SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT THE SIZE AND VIEW WHEN WE CHECKED IN AND WITH A STRAIGHT FACE VALERIE TOLD ME I HAD A CITY VIEW WITH A BALCONY. IN ADDITION THE CAR ALARMS FROM THE PARKING GARGAGE WENT OFF ALL NIGHT LONG. I KNEW WHEN I BOOKED THE HOTEL THAT IT WAS IN OLD SAN JUAN - AND THAT IT WAS IN THE CITY - WHAT I DIDN'T EXCEPT WAS A VIEW OF A PARKING GARAGE AND THE SOUND OF CAR ALARMS.

It is only a couple of blocks from the pier that our shipped docked at, so we were able to walk our backs from the hotel directly to the ship at boarding time (saving an extra taxi fee). Pros: Great beds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very comfortable and large. Good air conditioning in our room. Very close to the free trolley pickup (which can take you around Old San Juan). Close to some of the better restaurants. Close to Senor Frog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a CVS drugstore. Has hard-wired internet service. Hertz rental car facility in main lobby. Cons: A little noisy at night (depending on your room location). No continental breakfast. Casino is pretty small but takes up a good bit of the lobby floor space. Brumbaugh Street (in front of hotel) is completely congested with traffic at rush hour and cruise docking times. It can take 20 minutes for a car to travel 200 ft. at these times (including the free trolley). Not much parking space. If you have a car, I recommend using the parking garage across the street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much cheaper than the valet service. When we arrived, the reception desk was very friendly & helpful. We arrived at a slow time, but I assume that if you were to check-in at the busy time (when the ship is boarding/docking), the friendliness would be replaced with more of a hurry-up attitude. They were very busy on Sunday morning between 10:30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1:00. We had called the hotel in advance and asked them if we could check-in early (normal check-in is 3:00). They noted this and allowed us to check-in around 12:30 when we arrived. The entrance to the hotel is on the side of the building. Check-out is 11:00, but the official boarding time for the ship was ~ 2:30. The bellhops will watch your luggage from 11:00 to whenever you want to board (suggested tip 5-7$) which gives you some extra time to see Old San Juan before you have to board. Hotel has a nice sized exercise room and pool on the top floor. You can see a lot of the harbor and city from the top floor lookout. Although the hotel was nice, it was barely worth the above mentioned Hotwire price ($125 and no continental breakfast???). I certainly would not pay the $200 normal price.

Second, is that the decor and furnishings were in my opinion not up to \"Governor\" standards. The furniture was a bit worn and some of it really did not match with the decor, minor point no doubt.

I had a King-sized bed on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor with a living room attached to it. The best thing about the room was the modern comfy bed with nice white sheets, white blanket, and white comforter and plenty of pillows. There was also a widescreen TV (it was probably about a 32 or 40 inch). The decor of the room and hallways outside looked worn and outdated, as was the furniture in the living room attached to my room. The room had a strange musty smell that I couldn't tell if it was from cleaning solution. I almost called the front desk to complain but I got used to it, and it seemed to fade. The bathroom was huge with two sinks. All-in-all, it was pretty average but comfortable. The casino inside the hotel is on the ground level and is small and generic looking. I didn't give it a try. There is a restaurant called Chicago Burger attached to the hotel that is surprisingly good, as it doesn't look like much at first glance. I recommend getting the Jabirto burger that is made Puerto Rican style (with salsa, puerto rican cheese, and plantains...so good if a bit messy to eat). The fried pickle chips are really good as long as you don't try to eat too many. There is a pool on the roof with a heated whirlpool next to it. It's a small area but OK if you just want hang out. You can see the ocean from this area, but you have to stand up (it's a not a forever pool). There is also a small gym room near the pool that I used. There is barely enough equipment to do a full set of weight training exercises, but there are a couple pieces of cardio equipment like a bike and a treadmill. I did some weight training but chose to do some jogging outside the hotel. There is a CVS just down the street with reasonable prices on everything (a large bottle of water was around $1.50). The best thing about the location is of course Old San Juan. It's basically on a peninsula that you can walk from seaside to seaside in about 20 minutes. You literally can't get lost in Old San Juan, as it's not that big. I recommend walking to the old Fort Morro and also checking out the walls around Old San Juan that used to protect it from invasion in yesteryears. Walking around the town is fun for about two days, although there are a few too many tourist traps selling Puerto Rico coffee mugs and the like. There are no beaches within walking distance, but you can take taxis or a bus to nearby ones. I didn't have an ocean view, but I went to the pool on the roof to check it out, and it isn't really an impressive view for an \"ocean view\" as you can see the other part of the island on the horizon. There is construction going on all around the hotel (they're building more hotels and docks for more cruise ships). The mammoth cruise ships are neat to see in dock, but things get very busy in the lobby of the hotel when the ships are in and the cruise patrons are out. My check-in was a snap because there were no ships at the time. Old San Juan is not a fully developed resort town, as there weren't a lot of upscale restaurants or places to go. It has an old romantic feel, with its narrow streets and closed-in buildings very much like a Spanish town with pastel buildings everywhere. The sidewalks are so narrow there is only room for one person to walk on them. There are many abandoned buildings and lots of construction. I was disappointed by the restaurants in Old San Juan (I tried about 5 of the highly recommended ones), and I recommend eating outside of the area. There is a place behind the hotel called Latin Roots that has some sexy salsa dancing on the weekends with really good local bands. Really enjoyed it and can recommend it if you know how to sasla. Some good looking girls were there when I went. In terms of beaches, a local recommended Isle Verde for going to a beach because the water is calmer on that part of the island and better for swimming and wading. Everyone around the hotel and Old San Juan spoke decent English (I can't speak a word of Spanish and made out just fine). Overall, I felt the Sheraton Old San Juan Hotel was just an average hotel experience, with my only complaint being a musty smell and a noisy air conditioner. Staff was nice to me.

The rooms were nice, beds comfortable, rooftop deck/pool/workout room great, and service mostly good. We were moments from the heart of OSJ, which was great. We walked out into the shopping district, great restaurants and more. There were a few things that were not as great: 1) The concierge - As a Starwood (Sheraton, Westin, W, etc.) hotel loyalist, I have gotten used to great concierge services at their hotels. This one was not so good. The two tours they recommended were classic \"tell you what you want to hear\" cases. Our tour of El Yunque was a 4 hour shuttle ride with less than 45 minutes of walking around the rainforest, even though the concierge indicated it was a 2 hour hike to a small waterfall. It also ended an hour later than promised. Several others on our tour had been similarly misled. Similarly, our bio-luminescent bay tour near Fajardo had incorrect times (told 4:30 leave-8:30 return, actually 4pm leave 10:45pm return), inaccurate info (what it would be like, were promised there would be bug spray there and there wasn't). Similarly, restaurant recommendations made no sense. They did not know about popular Trip Advisor restaurants, and recommended several with terrible reviews. Makes you question their motivation for recos. I would NOT TRUST their concierge. Book your tours directly with the tour companies recommended on Trip Advisor: http://www.elyunque.com/about.html - pricey at $300 for 2 people (if you don't have a group) but the reviews are good. http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g612474-d653791-Reviews-Kayaking_Puerto_Rico_Adventures_Inc-Fajardo_Puerto_Rico.html - gets good reviews and you'll save $20 pp booking directly with them... They will pick up in San Juan and bring you back (if you do this, wear swim shorts, bring bug spray, and I'd consider a headlamp :) ) http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147320-d584016-Reviews-Legends_of_San_Juan-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html - nice tour of San Juan, but a little rough around the edges... My review is posted there. and use Trip Advisor and other reviews for Restaurants (we loved Marmalade, liked Dragonfly and Cafe Puerto Rico, Raices was a bit touristy but decent). 2) Be careful leaving or arriving on Sunday - Sundays they are mobbed with cruise ship people.

We stayed here for 2 nights because we were taking a cruise out of Puerto Rico, on celebrity cruise line. I thought the hotel would be ideal for us, being that it was in walking distance from the port. Well apparently it was the wrong port. While there are cruise ports near the hotel, the one we left out of was on the other side of the harbor. This was a total bummer. There was no transportation from the hotel to the port, which really was a deal breaker for me to stay here again. I thought the hotel was nice. Like I said it was in a good location to tour old San Juan. It has a very nice rooftop pool, and you can over look the city at night which is great. The rooms were average at best. Nothing fancy, nothing impressive. Parking near the hotel is a nightmare. There are some paid decks nearby, but you seriously feel like you're in Gotham city trying to park in some of these decks. I think our stay would have been significantly better had we had a less complicated way to get to the ship port. I ended up renting a car at the airport and using that to get around for the 1st day. The hotel actually has a hertz rental facility there at the hotel. So what I ended up having to do to get to the ship was drive to the ship, drop off all our luggage, and then go back to the hotel, drop off the car at the hertz facility there (which has terrible service that takes forever), and then literally walk the 4 miles back to the ship. So if you're crusing Royal Carribean or Celebrity, make sure to have an arrangement to get to the ship. It's too much to walk. And if you walk into San Juan, make sure to get a churro from the street vendor.

Almost all of the attractions of Old San Juan are within walk distance of the hotel. However, the inside needs a little work... Service was mediocre at best. We called to ask for a hairdryer to be delievered to our room as there was none inside. They agreed to deliver it but it never came. Then the next day, we called ahead to get our car ready from the valet parking ( @ $21 per day) but when we arrived the car wasn't there. So, we waited for 5 minutes for the car to come around when it should have been there. Cleanliness was average. We ate lunch at the restaurant called \"Palio\". The server gave us a high-chair for my 2 year old son. I saw what appeared to be circular liquid stains on the chair. So, I wiped it using a wet napkin and it turned black. It was quite disgusting. And, in our room the carpet was stained with all kinds of colours. The washroom's tile grouts were very discoloured. We also experienced the same issue as the previous member regarding the pool.

They also gave us a late checkout (2:00 p.m.) on one of the rooms, which made it convenient for our departure to board the cruise ship. I over heard other people in the elevator complaining because they were denied a late checkout request. My only negative comment regards the pool, which is located on the roof. It is small, and the seating area around it is limited. The cement walls surrounding the pool area are high enough that it is hard to enjoy the view while sitting down.

Just too tempting to pass up. Unfortunately the negative reviews were spot on in this case. Our pricier \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe bayview\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was completely forgettable, similar to any cheap motel along a U.S. interstate except that it had no closet but instead, a 24\" wide armoire, insufficient for most couples taking a cruise; our clothes sat wrinkling in their suitcases for the stay. The photos on Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website showed our room with a large window, beautiful ship in full view, beckoning to you. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure that room exists somewhere in the hotel, but it certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ours.

The main component of our room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view was a giant inflatable frog head perched atop the debris cluttered roof of an unfortunately placed (for us, anyway) Senor Frogs. The poor thing leaked. Each morning, it would be in a green heap, but when we returned in the afternoon, it would be reinflated and proudly ribbiting over San Juan bay. The all night commotions in the hallways (doors slamming, yelling, elevator chimes) were probably due to the proximity of this establishment as well as the hotel casino. This went on during each night of our stay. It also turns out that ships which are homeported in San Juan don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dock across the street, but instead depart a few miles away.

What I hated about my stay in this hotel was: The amount of dogs during my stay, guests can have their dogs in their rooms, unfortunately the corridors were not very big so when a guest with their dogs walkied down the corridors, you feel like you are going to be ambushed. On certains days you could small the odour of dogs or see some faecal matter on the carpets, which the poor maids would have to clean up. The breakfast on offer is the hotel was not worth the price tag at all. There were 2 options one cold, price $15 for cereal, fruit, cakes, bread etc and one for $18 which would include pancakes, which were so hard they were more like rock cakes, and eggs and bacon. These were rather greasy so not worth the $3 dollars more. Two days of this was too much so we went to Starbucks instead. The hotel tax: We had to pay a fee of $88 at the time we went.

We went on this cruise in 2007 and stayed at the Condado Plaza and paid a lot more for our room and we felt the Sheraton was much better and in a better location for pre cruise. We paid $155.00/night before taxes and we booked direct with the hotel via telephone. We arrived at 1:30pm via taxi from the airport (taxi fare is a set rate for all taxis-$19.00 for a trip from the airport to the Sheraton plus $1.00 extra per suitcase). Greeted at the door by doormen and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough for us. Everything was taken care of. We went to the desk and there was no problem that check in was not for another two hours, are room was ready and we went up immediately. The desk staff was very friendly and helpful, check in was a breeze. We asked for a recommendation for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real local Puerto Rican food\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for dinner. They recommended the Raices, two easy blocks from the hotel, he even drew a map. The hotel is very nice, decorated plain but elegant. Everything was clean and in good repair. If you are very critical and choose to look for imperfections, they are there but you really have to look.. Ex.: some worn spots on carpet, evidence of previous paint layers etc-but they were hard to spot. Our room had a King bed which was very comfortable. The air conditioner is controlled in the room and worked well. There was a desk/chair- good size. An extra arm chair and foot rest that could easily sleep a child up to about age 7. The TV was new and a flat HD model with cable TV 30 channels and a pay per view movie channel, safe, ironing board and iron. Bathroom was standard for this type of hotel with the usual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goodies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was a hairdryer and coffee maker in the room. Our room had a large window overlooking the port where the cruise ship would pull in. This hotel is in the middle of Old San Juan and close to the free trolley that runs all around Old San Juan on a regular basis. We walked to Raices as recommended and we were not disappointed. It is small, caters to locals, delicious, excellent service, and not too expensive at all (dinner for two with a beer/dessert came to $45.00 with tip.) As a nice touch, everyone dresses in authentic Puerto Rican dress. They spoke English well and all the dishes were Puerto Rican and not just the usual tourist dishes. Back at the hotel, they have a nice pool on the roof, small but adequate and very nice to swim in, there was also a Jacuzzi. The exercise room was with the pool and it looked well equipped. The machines looked new and they were in good repair. You do have to use your room key to access the elevator to the hotel rooms and pool area. The casino was on the small side but looked adequate. Saturday we ate at the Sheraton that has a breakfast buffet in the Palio Restaurant. Nice complete buffet and very good\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the drawback was expense. It was $18.00 per person which we think is a little steep for breakfast. Luckily there is just two of us but, if you are a family with children, eat breakfast else where. We took the free trolley which runs all around Old San Juan. (Stop at an info booth to get a trolley map with all the trolley stops on it) We ate a late lunch and the Burger company which is also at the Sheraton-great food here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6HUGE hamburgers and portions. $9.00 for a burger bigger than a Whopper, and fries that were too much for use to eat and we shared one order of fries. In fact this held us for the rest of the day and we never had dinner. Of note we saw A LOT of people waiting in the lobby today with luggage. All seemed to be pre cruise guests. I would recommend coming two days before the cruise and not the day before. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the people waiting a long time in the Sheraton lobby would not give it high marks for checking in. Checkout was easy although elevators got very crowded in the morning due to the crowds of people trying to leave and get to their cruise ship. The Sheraton will keep your luggage for you downstairs and next time we will bring our luggage down VERY early, say about 6 or 7 am and store it downstairs so the wait for elevators a couple of hours later with tons of people will luggage can be avoided. Another tip, forget valets for your luggage, it take them forever to transport the luggage in the elevators too so peak \u00e2\u20ac\u0153time to go to the cruise ship time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you will wait forever for a valet and cart. Overall, this was a wonderful hotel and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more convenient for pre-post cruise stays. The staff was extremely helpful and we would stay here again regardless of what we had to pay. POST VISIT: addendum - When checking in for the Carnival cruise, we had packed in our checked luggage a hammer and screw driver because we were having trouble with one of the wheels on our luggage. We packed it just in case, it was my husbands \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favorite old screw driver and pliers. Unfortunately, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tools of any kind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are contraband on cruise ships and we got called down to open our luggage. They also decided while the luggage was open to disallow my very good computer breaker/extension cord \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire hazard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in cabin. I could not bring these on board but could throw them away or mail them home. Carnival said the Sheraton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mailed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd things. Well it was Sunday and we could FED Ex it for a ridiculous expense or wait for Monday and sent it US mail (cruise ship was leaving-not an option) In steps the bell man Alex and he offered to hold it for us while we were gone and we could stop at the Sheraton and pick it up -no charge (We gave him a tip when we picked it up) Alex saved the day for us as well as saving us from throwing away some items we wanted to keep.

We found the hotel to be of about a 3 star standard. It served the purpose we wanted it for but I didn't see it as a hotel you would spend more than a couple of nights in. We arrived at the hotel at about 11pm after a long flight. The taxi ride from the airport didn't take long although the traffic around the hotel was very bad and we were stuck in a queue for about 15 mins. We checked in smoothly and were given a free upgrade to the 'governers suite' which was nice. I feel bad passing comment as we were upgraded for free but I will mention a few things about the room in case you are thinking of booking that room. The room was huge with a seperate bedroom, bathroom, big lounge, dining area and 3 large balconys with a great view. It was nice but VERY dated. The decor was very tired and grubby and I wouldn't have been happy if i had paid extra for that room. There was a lot of traffic noise outside the hotel and we could hear car horns from the room at night. The pool on the roof of the hotel was small but we didn't have time to use it anyway. I felt that the hotel was nice and friendly but in desperate need of a refurbishment. As i said ,if it's only for one night it's fine and it was clean! We ordered room service as it was late when we arrived, the food was nice but expensive! The whole hotel including the room rates are very pricey but I think this is common for San Juan with it being a cruise port. The hotel was positioned right near the Carnival Cruise pier which would be ideal if you were cruising with carnival. The Royal Caribbean pier was over the other side, which we knew before we booked but it wasn't a problem to get a taxi and only took a few minutes. The hotel is ideally located if you want to explore Old San Juan, like we did! We had a full morning before our cruise to look around and found it to be very charming. We explored on foot and visited one of the forts and walked to the cathedral and round the brightly coloured houses and shops. San Juan is really a beautiful place to visit. The only major problem we had was when we arrived home and checked our credit card. There was a \u00c2\u00a316 charge on it which we had no idea what it was for.

Everything you want to see in OSJ is right outside the hotel. It was great watching the ships sail in and out from the 9th floor pool. Although lacking a much needed mini-fridge, the room amenities were surprisingly good quality. There was a 32\" flat screen TV, coffee machine, shampoo with conditioner, lotion. The sheets were high quality, as was the pillow top mattress. We had a room with 2 doubles. Four pillows on each bed (2 firm, 2 soft). Really plush comforter made sleeping wonderful. Taxi from the airport to the Sheraton is $19.00 plus $1.00 per bag (plus tip). Check in desk was fast and friendly and our room was ready for a 2:00 p.m. arrival. Bellmen were funny and concierge helpful with any questions. There is a casino on property which was very busy on Friday night. There is also a Chicago Burger and an Italian restaurant on site. We ate at the Chicago Burger Friday evening and for $15.00 a plate we had an enormous burger with all the toppings, fries, and a drink. Not bad given tourist town pricing. Starbucks is right around the corner, as is the Eden Spa and numerous stores. There is an information stand just outside the hotel (look for the green roof). The free trolley stop is an easy one block to the east. There are two trolley systems. The open air trolley goes all the way to El Morro fort. You can get off/on at various stops. There is also an enclosed bus that runs an inner loop around the store front areas. This was nice when we went to get our soda and water for the ship, because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk all the way back with the heavy packages.

I am a Starwoods Guest Rewards member, and booked my stay using points, and paying a discounted rate. That was my main factor in booking the hotel. The hotel's location is really perfect, it's right off of the dock in what I guess is the southeast corner of Old San Juan. I was not travelling on a curise ship, and was entertained/annoyed by the constant stream of tourists flocking into the street in front of the Sheraton. If you are on a cruise and don't want to walk much (let's be honest, a lot of people on cruise ships don't want to walk), this location can't be beat. Old San Juan is a fairly small and easily navigated city, we were able to walk every where we went, to San Cristobal and other attractions in the city. There is a Starbucks right up the street, and many bars and restaruants right around the corner that are worth visiting. Besides the location, the hotel itself is nice, but not amazing. The only casino in town is located in this hotel, and it is a pretty nice casino, but was usally pretty crowded. There is a burger restaraunt attached to the hotel which is small and overpriced, but serves decent food. I was in a room with a king sized bed overlooking the port. It was a standard room, not too large, but definitely adequate. The gym is nice, it has everything you would expect in a hotel gym plus some extra equipment like a captain's chair and good selection of free weights. The pool, however, leaves something to be desired. It is a rooftop pool, but it's so small it barely qualifies as a pool. I laid out one afternoon, and as the sun starts shifting, there are only 3 chairs on the deck that continued to get sun past about 3 PM. Definitely don't chose the hotel for the pool. Even though I got a discounted rate, the percentage of taxes tacked on to the room was absurd!

We stayed there, prepaid on Orbitz, before and after we went on a cruise, for some $360 a night and it was in no way worth anything like that. The biggest problem with this hotel is that their casino is obviously much more important to them than their hotel. The casino takes up most of the space that otherwise would be devoted to the lobby. The result is that the tiny, tiny lobby is way too small. It only has a few chairs and is most of the time a mad house of guests squeezing into that cramped space trying to get to the desk. Another result is that desk clerks are swamped and do not have time to be particularly polite or attentive. For instance, my wife made the mistake of standing behind another guest at the desk. The clerk snapped at her to get back behind the line at the end of the rope waiting line and was not a bit nice about it. The toilet in our room was stopped up the first time we stayed there. We called the front desk, which never did answer. I finally went down to the lobby. After a very long wait in a very long line, they told me they would send somebody up to fix it. They did not. The next morning, the front desk did actually answer and this time they did send someone who fixed the problem. The second time we stayed there, upon returning from the cruise, there was no remote for the television in the room. When the porter arrived with our luggage, I mentioned this to him, while tipping him generously. He said he would get us a remote. A couple hours later, no remote had arrived. So, I tried to call the front desk again and again it did not answer. So, I again went down stairs, waited in a very long line to tell them about it. Finally, we got our remote. The room was not cramped, but it was not spacious or $360 a night luxurious either. The room in any Red Roof Inn would put it to shame. The two double beds were uncomfortably small and uncomfortably hard. The second time we stayed there (after the cruise), they had a power failure about eleven that evening. The result was no light, no running water and no air conditioning in tropical San Juan. When I went downstairs, I was amazed to see that the casino was lit up like a Christmas tree and was operating full steam with all the machines whirring and clanging. That is, they had auxiliary power for their casino but not for their hotel guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rather clear sign of where they place their priorities. When we checked out the next morning, there was still no power and no water. When we suggested upon checkout that we had not gotten our $360 worth, they said they could not compensate us for our very sweltering, miserable, nasty toilet night, because we had booked our room through Orbitz. However, if we wanted to pay for two more nights, they would give us a third night free. If I ever stay at another Sheraton, the Devil will be right behind me in an overcoat and an icicle will be hanging from his nose. We have visited San Juan many times and it is about our favorite travel destination. However, always before we stayed at the Hilton, which is much less expensive and a much nicer hotel. The reason we choose the Sheraton this time was that the Frommer travel guide for Puerto Rico said it was in Old Town and was close to where the cruise ships docked, supposedly an easy walk. There are two tourist areas in San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Old Town, which is historic part of San Juan, with the nicest tourist shops and Condado, which is a more modern tourist part of San Juan. The parking is much better in Condado. The restaurants are far better and far less expensive in Condado and far less likely to be tourist traps. For instance, we had a meal at Senor Frog's, which looks like a kid friendly place, about a half block from the Sheraton. Every time one of the children's sodas got anywhere near empty, they would grab it away and shove another in front of her without asking. When they gave us our bill, they had charged for every one of those unordered drinks at a very high price per drink and they got really nasty when we complained about the fact that we had not ordered those drinks. What can you do? We paid it. The final blow was that the Sheraton was not close to where most of the cruise ships dock. That that turned out to be a long way away on the far side of the harbor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a $25 cab ride each way. The good hotel, the Hilton, is between Old Town and Condado. You can imagine the teeth gnashing that went on when our cab passed our beloved Hilton, both on the trip to and from the cruise ship. My advice. Avoid the Sheraton. Go to their casino, if you like, but don't stay there. Stay in the Hilton or in one of the many less expensive hotels in Condado. However, don't avoid Puerto Rico. It is a wonderful, safe place to visit.

The hotel is in a good location for those wishing to spend a day or two visiting old San Juan on their way to either other islands or to other parts of the island (we were pre-cruise). It's near the entrance, so the traffic isn't too horrible coming in. Some other old San Juan hotels (such as El Convento) are a bit of a nightmare to get into by car or taxi. Basically, all of old San Juan is walkable, and there are plenty of good eating places nearby. Notwithstanding one of the member pictures on this site, our cruise ship was docked a couple of miles away, by the executive airport. Our room was across from a nightclub, so I was worried it would be noisy, but it wasn't (on a Friday night). The living room of the suite was next to the ice machine, which was quite noisy, but the noise didn't carry into the bedroom. The TV's are flat-screen but not high-definition. The casino is nice and friendly, but has no craps table (one has to go to the Marriott in the Condado neighborhood for that). The pool is fairly small, but with a view--and probably the best for Old San Juan. My main complaint relates to the elevators. There are only two and they are small. They were jammed-packed and we couldn't get in them in the morning when we were checking out. We were finally able to squeeze into an elevator going up, then had to go up and down the hotel, to the glares of frustrated guests. This hotel is probably a good choice for someone who wants to spend a day exploring old San Juan prior to a cruise or to a trip elsewhere in Puerto Rico or the Caribbean.

So if you want to be within walking distance to all Old San Juan has to offer, this is the place to stay. I just have to say a few things to those of you who mentioned the staff or the pool in a negative connotation. First, the hotel is very very busy. They are directly across the street from the harbor, so they are booked solid a lot of the time. They have many many guests to attend to, and I think as long as you are patient, they will be patient with you. Second, for the hotel to even have a pool is a pretty great thing, considering they are in the middle of a very busy city.

Pre-registration was done and we were told they \"start giving out keys\" at 3 PM. We moved to the restaurant Chicago Burger and had a decent lunch while we waited. Food was good - service was a little slow. At 2:50 we got back in the dreaded line and were told rooms were not ready. OK - wait some more - at 3:30 we are back in line and once we reach the desk we are told \"Nope - still no rooms\". I very calmly said that was fine - I would wait at the desk til one was ready, as I was not going through that line once more! They told me I could not wait at the desk and since I refused to move they did call security! Fine - he stood behind me but I did succeed in getting one of our 2 rooms. The very rude front desk staff did promise our luggage would be brought to the room and another room key would be delivered within 10 minutes....whatever....they just wanted me away from the desk so we all got our wishes. The security guard did promise my husband that he would stay on it and true to his word we had our luggage and another room within 10 minutes. Our room was on the 9th floor - near the roof top pool. It was very dark and had the appearance of being clean but I'm not totally sure. The lighting was very poor - not even a lamp on the desk. No closet - just an armoire - that's OK because we're only staying one night. Happy to see an operating safe in the room as I have learned to trust no one! The bathroom was very large but once again I wasn't sure about the cleanliness and thought I saw a bug in the corner - it turned out to be fluff but why was it there in the first place? The bed was very comfortable and we did sleep well. Enjoyed a nice breakfast in Pallio the next morning - the staff was friendly and the portions were large. The final insult from the front desk was that they could not - or would not? - make change so we could tip the valet. We were told the hotel check-in nightmare happens every Sunday so beware - you could spend hours trying to get a room. Other guests told us the hotel has a practice of allowing guests to enjoy a late check out, for a fee, and this is why rooms are not ready at the prescribed check in time. Whether this is true or not I do not know. I only know we will never stay there again no matter what the price. The location is perfect - the one true plus for this hotel.

We flew into SanJuan a day early expecting to have a great weekend and enjoy SanJuan prior to boarding our ship. However, we had much disappointment! CHECK IN/ROOM: As for the hotel, check-in was very slow, our room was not ready, so went walked around the city for a bit. After a few hours, they notified us that we could check in. Upon arrival to the room, we noticed a terrible smell along with black mold growing on the ceiling and one of the walls was saturated with water, I'm guessing there was a leak somewhere. Now, to give the hotel some credit, it is VERY HUMID in SanJuan and therefore, the mold/moisture issue is not all their fault. BUT, I called the front desk to complain and was told \"all of the rooms are full\". So, I then requested a discount or refund as the room was seriously in bad shape. They told me that since I PREPAID for the room, I could not be discounted or refunded, Go figure, you pay as instructed and then are punished. Then, I continue to ask to speak with management and they state, \"there is not management on the weekend\", interesting. At this point, I was calling the 1-800-sheraton phone# found in our room to complain, when the conceierge showed up and noticed we were unhappy, he was the ONLY person that went out of his way to make our stay more enjoyable. He quickly noticed how bad the room was and called downstairs immediately and got us a new room, which was ready in 10 minutes. As for our 2nd room, it was better, no mold/water, but still not great, it was fine for the night, but thats about all I could have handled. It was still very humid and damp in the room, once again, due to the weather and not the hotels fault, but I dont think the A/C could keep up w/the humidity. LOCATION: It is very convenient to the pier if choosing this hotel for a cruise. And it is a great location in Old San Juan, walkding distance to the Forts, etc. HOTEL FOOD: We ate at a Burger place in the hotel which was actually pretty good, would recommend it, if you are in the mood for a burger/fries, etc. We also had breakfast at the restraunt in the hotel and the food was average for a breakfast buffet, not terrible and not great, but definately edible! CASINO: We only used for about 15 minutes. It was a pretty nice casino, and lots of people in there, but we didn't use this facility much. OVERALL: Would not return to this hotel as the rooms need some updating and the staff was not helpful. Good luck.....we spoke with tons of other people that stayed in New San Juan prior to departure, and their experiences sounded much better and the location was still not very far from the ship's port!

Location: This was my favorite thing about this hotel. This hotel is ideally located in Old San Juan. It is the only major hotel right in Old San Juan. You can walk to everything in the area so a car isn't necessary. Beware if you do get rent a car, it is $20 per day to park. A car is not necessary unless you travel past San Juan itself. A cab should cost you only around $50 round trip with tip to go to the airport or the new San Juan area. If you are adventurous, take the bus. It is 50 cents and not all that bad on a raining day. Directly outside the hotel is where you can catch the ferry to the Bacardi Factory. the cruise ships dock right in front of the hotel so at times it can be a busy area. When the ships are in there are plenty of street vendors and local foods. Every type of restaurant is available in the area and they are all trendy with good foods and fair prices. Outlet shopping is also available within walking distance. Senor Frogs is literally outside the side door of the casino. Hotel: Casino is great. Friendly staff and the free sandwiches and beverages are delicious. It was clean although it could use some new carpet. The rooms were very clean but very basic. All you need is in the room but if you are looking for luxury, try a hotel in New San Juan. Some rooms have a water view. The rooftop pool is small but clean, comfortable, quiet and a view to kill for. Room Service was great. Food was very good. A decent amount of channels on the tv. Staff very attentive. FYI this is a non-smoking hotel. You cannot smoke anywhere, even the casino. Puerto Rico in general is smoke free. A couple of disappointments was there was no bar or a hotel shop, if you should need buy something such as toothpaste, toothbrush, etc. in a pinch. There is a walgreens in the area.

The checkin was very slow. The room was a disapointment. The hotel, especially the hallways are in need of an update. The Bathrooms are dated. The bed was comfortable. I requested a deluxe room with a view, but a deluxe rate only gives you a window with a shutter that will not open. It also fogs because of the AC. You will only get a balcony with a port view if you book a suite, so their room rate descriptions were deceptive. You only get a view of the side parking lot for a deluxe rate. The workout room was adequate, but one of the guest had to come in to ask us to turn down the TV as the walls are very thin.

We arrived mid-day on a Friday. Check in was a little disorganized due to simultaneous, convoluted problems with two group check-ins. However, our king suite was exactly as billed and our Starwood points were properly credited. We were on the 4th floor and had a great view of the bay and any cruise ships that came in. I would note that the balconies that come with the rooms are tiny. One or two people can stand outside the doors; otherwise you need to leave doors open if you want to have a chair in the balcony area. Our suite was spacious and very clean, with the usual Sheraton bed and amenities. We set out to hit the town right away, and discovered the biggest drawback of the hotel - - the elevators. The one on the right only worked intermittently, and they both were pretty slow. We tried to use the stairs with mixed results. One stairway led us to the street; another required us to exit through the restaurant's kitchen. The Sheraton's location can't be beat. We were a half block from Senior Frog's. Given the strength of the drinks there, that is the maximum you should try to walk afterwards. P.S., while Senor Frog's makes a lot of of drinks with a specific purpose in mind (incapacitating the customers), I got a great 1800/Grand Marnier tequila there, and thoroughly enjoyed the antics. A lot of locals go there, and I noticed most of them wisely stick to beer. Some of the best restaurants, Parrot Club, Aquaviva, and Dragonfly, are only a couple of blocks away, and we walked virtually everywhere in Old San Juan, including the El Morrow Fort. There is also a nice brew pub/steak house (Old Harbor) that is only a few blocks away. Cafe El Bombenara was an amazing old school place, with fantastic cafe con leche and great malloracs. We stayed here three days and I can't imagine a better place to stay to explore this area. There are also taxis aplenty, so commuting to other areas is easy as well. I enjoyed the Sheraton's Casino a lot. The drinks are free and they have abundant and vibrant live entertainment at night. Also, there are a lot of locals who come here and the scene is great. I just played slots and found them to be pretty fair. The pool is small, but it's located on the roof and has great views. It is a fun area during the day, and you pick up on the excitement of people waiting to go on cruises and get advice from those who just came back. Our favorite nightspot was the Parrot Club, which had the best drinks in town (we put this matter to the test). The signature Parrot Punch was very good, but the mojitos were beyond compare. Our bartender, Anthony, could well be dubbed the Ambassador for Puerto Rico. My wife and I have never met a friendlier person in all our travels, and he made fantastic drinks and guided us through the menu with aplomb. His insights on both the area and country were much appreciated. We loved the food at Aquaviva. This is a great seafood place with an intimate atmosphere and good vibe. Check out was a breeze, and our bill was accurate. Enjoy this place. I have tried to accurately convey the details, but really the overall experience was great.

The bar and gill attached to the hotel and casino is great. They have great drinks, but the service is slow. Its a nice place to read a book or lounge around and people watch (when you aren't in a hurry). We actually ended up spending about 3 or 4 hours there after we checked out of our room (and we didn't want to wait in line to get on our cruise).

ID!\" and then when I said I was staying in the hotel and started to look through my handbag for my ID and room key, he \"Puh!\"-ed me away and shoo-ed me.

By the way the carnival port is directly across the street however the Royal Caribbean ship that we were on was about a 10 or 15 min cab ride away. Don't expect early check in. I assume the hotel is usually full to capacity and if many guests are not checking out until noon to get on their cruise there is really no way that I could imagine early check in. This creates a little congestion in the lobby as the people getting off the ships do so early morning. We had the bell hop keep our luggage and went to see the town, eat lunch. Upon our return we were able to check in. We were assisted by a gentleman at the front desk who was very very nice. There was a woman at the front desk who my husband said was a little rude so we just made a point to talk to the guy. The free high speed internet in the lobby and on the second floor is very fast. The \"high speed internet\" on our ship was so slow that each time my husband tried to log into his bank he timed out. Check out was simple. We left at 4:45 am for our flight. Our express check out receipt was already under our door and we just went downstairs. Bell hop got us a cab and we were at the airport within 25 min. Our room was on the 9th floor.

Old San is Old thus the hotel is old as well. It has been updated but don't expect everything to be perfect. My guess is that it is as nice or nicer than most of the hotels in the area. It is not a resort. It is the location that made our stay a five star. We had several family members who stayed here pre cruise in regular rooms and were satisfied. We were very tired and almost did not walk up to the fort but then talked the kids into going and were not disappointed. The fort is a must see. The walk up was not bad and it was hot and muggy. We were so taken with the charm that before we knew it we were there. There are free trollys that will take you but we opted to see some of the town. The traffic is conjested and streets are narrow blue brick. I would not dream of driving there. We were only in Old San Juan for one day and so did not spend much time at the hotel. We ate lunch and dinner in Old San Juan and spent much of the afternoon walking around the fort and town. At night the town comes alive and has an exciting feel. Of course we fell asleep early but the kids had fun watching all the action from the balconies. We saw the pool and work out area. Neither were crowded but we did not use. They both looked clean and nice. Of all the ports we visited on our cruise we were most impressed with the history and culture of Old San Juan. We were there on sunday, Dec. 30. Many of the people in town were not tourists, just residents enjoying thier day off. I would highly recommend for one or two nights stay.

However, I have only one day to explore and Old San Juan and this hotel seems to be the best place to stay for one night. After a $20 cab drive from the airport to the hotel, seeing the long cab line to get into the hotel front entrance, I decided to get off and take the 10 meters walk to premises entrance instead. I was offered to take my suitcase which I declined. As reported, the lobby entrance was not large and was being occupied by flowing baggages on one side of the door. Thankfully, there was not a line at the check-in desk. My SPG status was quickly recognized and I was given an upgrade to one of the suites on the 6th floor, a voucher for breakfast at the restaurant as there was no executive lounge and two other vouchers for drinks and chips at the casinos. As reported one of the elevator seems to have a mind of its own and quite slow. My ride to the 6th floor seems to be an exercise of leisurely watching the numbers increasing and everyone who got off seems to sigh in relief. Suite 604 living room has no windows except for the lone double door that opens up to the tiny balcony facing the cruise ships docks. The lack of windows means that there are not enough daylight and the living room is a bit darker than I would have liked. Still the room is nicely furnished with a business desk a nice sofa and twins ottoman. There are two small bottle of Spanish red and white wine for sale on the lamp desk. The bedroom is a large room with a king bed, the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper which is one of my favorite bed. A drawer-desk with a 32\" TV on top and an arm chair with ottoman wrapped up the furniture in the room. A closet with the usual ironing board and mini-safe are provided. A lone window looked out into the concrete lobby roof is better left shut and provides minimal daylight. The two bed lamps provided more than enough lights to compensate for daylights. This room has adequate noise isolation for me but maybe because it is away from the streets and my neighbor is the quiet type. The bathroom was a large room by Sheraton standard. The issue with it is that it feels a bit empty as there are not enough furniture in the room. The bathtub also tends to leak water to the floor every time that I take a shower. I also have issue with getting enough hot water, in fact both of my showers were border of the cold side. The breakfast buffet was really good with lots of choices. It was too hot for me to have the breakfast out in the terrace so I stay inside. The service was average. Some people may dislike the location of the Sheraton due to its proximity to the docks but I find it very refreshing. Its downside is when the cruise ships rolled in, the traffic jam can be a killer if you want to get in or out of Old San Juan. The Sheraton is right in the middle of the action: restaurants and attractions are just blocks in all directions. If you want to explore Old San Juan, this is the perfect place to be in.

I chose to stay at the Sheraton Old San Juan because all of the reviews on this site were very good. I had originally thought to stay to the east along the coast, but am so glad now that I stayed here. Not to mention so many of the reviews for the other Sheraton properties on the coast were terrible. First of all, the location is perfect if you want to truly explore all of Puerto Rico since it is in a very central location and easily accessible to all freeways and tollways. You can also easily walk to both forts from this central location. Also, I went down by myself for a four day weekend so I wanted to feel safe wherever I stayed. Each night, I felt completely safe leaving the hotel and walking only a few streets over to where all of the restaurants and nightclubs are. All you do is walk out by the valet, turn right, walk up some steps and you are in restaurant central! All very good restaurants too. As for the restaurant at the hotel, I did make one visit there on my last day for a late lunch. The menu was not impressive but I asked my waiter if they had crab cakes and when he said yes, he readily agreed to make me a crab cake sandwich even though crab cakes were not even on the menu. It was very good! I'm not a gambler at all, but if you like casinos then this is definitely the place for you too! Each night, I walked right by it but on the last night I walked in and it reminded me of what you find on a cruise ship -- maybe even better. There must have been several hundred slot machines, several black jack tables and roulette tables. The place was packed! You won't hear the noise at all though from your room. The rooms are exactly what I had hoped for. I stay at W properties quite a bit as a business traveler and this was a better room than most W properties. Plus, I used my hotel points for the entire stay. Water was hot, nice shower head with the new rounded shower curtain rods, lots of counter space in the bathroom, very comfy beds, nice flat screen tv and plenty of room to move around. I didn't bring my laptop but I believe they have free wireless in the lobby and a charge to use it from your room. Everybody was very pleasant and courteous at the hotel. I valeted my car each evening and I believe the cost was about $18/night. If you are going on a cruise and you want to stay somewhere for a night or two before or after your cruise, I would definitely recommend this hotel too. It is just off of Pier 3. If driving from the airport, take 26 West to Old San Juan and then veer left where it says Convention District but stay in the right lane. The hotel is a couple of miles down on the right. You'll see the port to your left and possibly some cruise ships. There is a lot of construction going on all over San Juan right now and this is the best, fastest way to get to the hotel. There is also some construction going on at the hotel but I did not notice it -- I believe they are working on the rooftop terrace and pool but I chose to go to beaches instead of the pool so I don't know what they were doing.

I was afraid that it would be too noisy and too smokey, but I was happily wrong. Our suite on the fourth floor was not affected at all by the noise of the casino. The location of the hotel is great for those wishing to wander around Old San Juan. As soon as we walked out the hotel we were in the shopping and restaurant district of OSJ! We felt safe during our whole stay. For those people who wrote earlier that they were disappointed in not having a view from your room, you must remember that this is a city hotel- not every room has a view of the water. And even if you did have a view of the water, its full of cruise ships and barges- it is a working port afterall!! One of the two cruise ports in OSJ is right across the street from the hotel. Unfortunately, our cruise line was docked at the other port, but a short cab ride (which was arranged by the helpful hotel staff) was all it took to get from the hotel to the ship.

My wife and I arrived on a Friday for a 2 night stay with another couple prior to departing for our cruise. Since our flight arrived first, we went on to the hotel ahead of our friends. When we arrived at the Sheraton Old San Juan, our bags were unloaded and brought into the hotel lobby. We checked in, and were told to go on to our room and that the luggage would follow shortly behind us. Once into the room we noticed that we were looking into a parking garage. This was disappointing, but it was what it was. Forty minutes later, our luggage had not yet arrived, so I called the Bell Desk to inquire. I was informed that our luggage was on its way, and would arrive shortly. When I asked about changing rooms in order to get a better view, I was transfered over to the front desk. The Asst. Manager informed me that since I had requested a room with two beds, that he could not make any changes. When I asked him why, he told me that all rooms with two beds face into the parking structure, and therefore he could not change it. I wondered who would design a hotel where all the rooms with two beds faced into a parking structure and only rooms with one bed had a view, but I told him we would keep the room that we were in. Thirty-five minutes later when my luggage had still not arrived, I went down to the lobby to find my bags. My luggage was still in the same spot as they had dropped it an hour and fifteen minutes earlier. Needless to say, I carried my five pieces of luggage to the elevator myself and took it to my room. Later that evening, I was awaken by the barking of a dog. If the dog were outside, I would have been more accepting of the situation, but the dog was actually inside the hotel. When I called to complain, I was told that the Sheraton Hotel was a pet friendly chain and that nothing could be done since the owner was not in their room. The dog continued to bark until 2:10 a.m. I can only guess that the owners decided to return to their room at that time and the dog then stopped barking. The next day, we went into Old San Juan at around 9:00 a.m. to spend the day. We returned at 3:00 p.m. to find that our room had still not been made up. When I called the front desk to ask about my room, I was told that due to the cruises there is such a large turn-over of guests on the weekends, that the rooms occupied by guests that are staying are not cleaned until all other rooms are done. So basically, since I was paying for two nights, I was getting less service than if I had stayed only one night. That evening, we went upstairs to the pool and hot tub. When we arrived, we noticed that the pool had algae in it and that the hot tub was actually cold. I called the front desk and was told that the hot tub was broken and that the pool would be cleaned the next day because there was nobody available that evening to clean it. Finally, the last day at the Sheraton Old San Juan. We got packed and headed for the elevator with our luggage. We waited anxiously by the elevator dreaming of getting on the cruise ship. We waited and waited and waited and waited. Seems that one of the elevators was broken and everytime the working elevator would stop, it was full already. After the first hour of waiting, I called the front desk to ask for help. I was told that my only option was to carry our luggage down from the sixth floor. Since there was four of us, and we had 10 pieces of luggage, that was not an option. So again, we waited and waited and waited. Then, 40 minutes later, a hotel maintenance man came walking down the hallway. I stopped him and asked if there was some sort of employee elevator on the floor. He said that there was, so I gave him $20.00 to allow us to use that elevator to get down. He agreed, and after 2 hours and $20.00 we were finally checked out of the Sheraton Old San Juan. Now, I want you to know that I am a member of the Sheraton Hotel / Starwood Properties frequent guest program and I not only complained to management at the Sheraton Old San Juan, but also to their corporate guest services. I have stayed at other Sheraton Hotels and have had wonderful experiences. This stay took place in February 2006, and as of yet, I have gotten no response from anyone. Also, I think it is pertinent to know that I paid $325.00 per night for this stay. For that kind of money, I have come to expect so much more that what I recieved.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but Terrible Staff\u201d", "Author": "CarribeanWanderer", "ReviewID": "UR5322969", "Content": "I stayed here for twice for business trips.

What made it worst was that the lady at the front desk told me to come back at a certain time, but when I did, the room was not yet ready. Also, you will need to follow up on everything. As an example, I had requested for laundry pick up at 6 AM, and left the hotel to stroll around the vicinity. When I came back at 9:30 AM, the laundry was not picked up, and apparently the front desk forgot to tell housekeeping. Another problem is that there is always an error in my bill e.g. breakfast charge even if I used a voucher. After a while, I was already beginning to think that the hotel is doing it on purpose. In my second stay here, after being given a room, I immediately went back to the front desk and returned the room. The room provided was not only dingy, there was this horrible smell.

We tried to check in around noon and the lobby was a zoo. There was luggage piled all around and people everywhere, coming off the ships and checking out to get on the ships. We were told to come back around 3 and they took our luggage for us. We felt a little uneasy because we had to leave our luggage piled up in the lobby until they put it away. Spent the afternoon walking around Old San Juan and were able to check in when we came back. The elevators are a little scary, they're old and look like they need replaced. The hallways are somewhat dark but our room was beautiful. However, we had a partial harbor view reserved and got a view of the parking garage. There is a pool on the ninth floor with a great view of the harbor and the cruise ships. However, the pool is VERY small and has little seating area.

No need to worry if you are considering it. We stayed Feb 14-17, 2006. The lobby is small but clean and elegant. The rooms themselves are clean, new and standard Sheraton. We arrived around 11pm on the 14th, so they checked my husband and I into a room with two beds, with the promise that we'd be moved the next day. The room we were moved to the next day was exactly the same as the first room except it had the requested King size bed, and this time we had a view of the Ferry docks rather than the parking lot. Both rooms were on the 5th floor, and we had no noise issues. This hotel is fine if you want to be in Old San Juan, but don't stay here expecting amenities and things to do. As others have noted the pool is not that big or enticing- the view from the 9th floor is nice in the evenings and a good spot if you want to read and relax for an hour or two. I used the gym on one occasion- also on the 9th floor. It's nothing fancy but there are some treadmills, ellipticals, weights etc. It does it's jobs. My biggest complaint about this hotel is lack of room service. The kitchen closes at 11pm. Our flight was delayed from NYC and we had planned to be in San Juan by 730, but arrived at 1030 instead and were famished. By the time we called room service, we were told it was closed and when we asked the front desk for any place we could order from, they had no numbers for us. We were both tired, and unwilling to go out at that time for food so we fell asleep hungry. This struck me as weird, that there is nothing available after 11pm. I did order room service on another occasion. A burger for 15$. With tax it was 17$ I think (there is never tax in restaurants in PR) and ontop of that they add a 3$ gratuity. I was suprised when the delivery guy waited for me to tip him, when theyd already added the 3$?? We also had a drink at the bar on the ground floor Fogato- the drinks are decent. And we were on our way to dinner, but they serve complimentary snacks there. We had breakfast included in our room price. Beware of something about this- they have an array of breakfast laid out, and no one really tells you anything. They just seat you down and pour coffee. It's only once the bill arrives that you're told to pay extra. Apparently complimentary breakfast only covers the cereal and fruit. I had cereal and a small portion of eggs one morning, for which they charged me $8 extra. I just wish they'd told me earlier, as I wouldn't have minded not having the cold eggs anyhow. Talking amongst some of the other people eating breakfast everyone expressed suprise when the bills were presented. A perk that we were unaware of before is that there is free wireless internet in all the public spots, so bring your laptop and you can use free internet in the lobby/Fogato. It's hard/expensive finding internet in Old San Juan otherwise. I rated this stay a 4 because it was a comfortable stay. Nothing extra-ordinary, but nothing much to complain about either.

I had made the reservations last summer before it changed to a Sheraton, and I had to make 2 calls to Sheraton and one to the mgr in San Juan to get the reservation transferred. The web site kept saying \"reservation does not exist\". Anyway, I got that straightened out, and we arrived as scheduled around 4 p.m on a Saturday. The check in took almost a half hour. One girl trying to handle everything. Our rooms were small (the balcony was literally 6 inches wide) but we weren't going to spend much time there anyway, so that wasn't a problem. The problems that will keep me away from this hotel in the future were the air conditioning that either blasted frigid air or no air (and in 92 degree San Juan, just turning off the A/C was not an option. Although we did try that for awhile just to get warm and opened the balcony doors, but the room was so humid we couldn't see ourselves through the condensation on the mirrors.) So OK, we fell asleep around 11:00 after a long day of airports and about midnight we were awakened by deafening noise -- music, laughter, screams and assorted motorcycles, tire screeching and police sirens. Although we were on the 8th floor, Senor Frogs at street level was starting to come alive and stayed that way until almost 4 AM.

They are, by and large, doing an excellent job. We had very few complaints during a three night stay last week, and all of them had to do with housekeeping issues. Fortunately, the front desk and management take any and all concerns very seriously, as we observed twice during our stay. First, the room. Our room was a nice, fairly standard Sheraton hotel bedroom on the fourth floor. It was quiet, comfortable and convenient, and a cut above the average hotel room. The hotel location is excellent, allowing access to both the waterfront and Old San Juan with relative ease. The valet staff is excellent, helpful and friendly, as is the staff of La Forgata -- the hotel's restaurant and bar. The food there is excellent. La Forgata is run by the same company as the Parrot Club and Dragonfly, and the quality of the food reflects it. The Churrascuro selections are excellent and the steak was one of the best I've had on a vacation. The negatives have, as said, to do with housekeeping. There were a couple of minor things, but the most blatant problem we had was with towels. We arrived back at the room one of the days to discover that no new towels had been left after cleaning. When we called for replacements the towels were delivered within minutes, and the person doing so was smiling and apologized for the oversight. Unfortunately two of the towels delivered were badly stained and torn, so I decided to let the manager know about the problem. Again, only small issues, but several of them and beyond just this one. The front desk staff was very apologetic, imnmediately summoning the manager. He listened attentively and offered his own apology, assuring me he would take care of things. When we went back to the room a few hours later not only were there twice the number of very clean and acceptable towels, but a small goblet of chocolates and a thank you note. A very graceful response to a minor but persistant problem, and I can state that we had no further complaints after this incident. All in all, this Sheraton is an excellent property and working hard to rectify the few shortcomings still in evidence.

We arrived at the International airport on Friday at 11:30am, and a $20 cab got us to the Sheraton in about 20 minutes. I chose the Sheraton for two reasons: Firstly, we only had 24 hours to spend in San Juan (the majority of our stay was in Vieques, which we flew to the next day from Isla Grande airport), so I thought Old San Juan would be the best place to stay. And secondly, I knew that the hotel had recently been renovated from a Wyndham to a Sheraton, so I thought everything would be pretty new and clean, and the Sheraton/Starwoods name has proven to be dependable for us. The Sheraton did not disappoint. We had lunch at the hotel, and the friendly waiter gave us a map and provided directions to a number of attractions, restaurants and shops to get us acquainted with the area. Our room, clean and non-smoking, featured a very comfortable king size bed (the sheraton sleeper beds are great), good bathroom, and a nice view of the bay. Getting around Old San Juan by foot was easy from the Sheraton...the walk along the water towards Fort Morro was gorgeous. We planned to visit Fort Cristobal that day as well, but got sidetracked on Calle de San Francisco and all the shops, eateries, and museums/arthouses that were there. We had dinner at El Picoteo at the El Convento Hotel. The paella was incredible, as was the fresh vanilla cake. If we ever return to Old San Juan for a night, I think I would stay here. We hit the casino back at the Sheraton for about 10 minutes. Its a novelty, but not the reason why we stayed there. We had breakfast the next day at a local diner on the south side of one of the smaller plazas. No one spoke much english, but the cafe con leche was great, as were the pastries. Fort Cristobal is an easy walk from the Sheraton, so we went there for a little culture and to take in some dramatic ocean and city views. Checking in (early) and checking out at the Sheraton was a cinch. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stay in Old San Juan.
