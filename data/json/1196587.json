The first time it was brand new so I guess it was under utilized. Our room was a beautiful, first floor patio room right on the beach! Year two, we were not able to walk out on the beach level but at least there was a small balcony on which to enjoy the ocean view. By year three, now a Gold level Marriott rewards member, I was shown to a room with a wonderful view of the parking lot! When I questioned the front desk, the not too bright clerk told me this was the room I had requested. As if anyone requests a parking lot view! I asked for the Manager and was told he wasn't there. It never occurred to the young man to offer a Supervisor instead. Not that speaking to the supervisor had any effect either. The hotel was booked solid, there was no accomodation offered (so much for one class upgrade!), just so sad, too bad. It wasn't until much further in the conversation that I was told that the room I booked back in April was part of a block given to the convention and all they offered them was parking lot views! This was a major disappointment since there are beachfront hotels with gorgeous outdoor pools up and down the Boardwalk which include breakfast (Courtyard doesn't), have better parking and decent coffee (the coffee in the room is awful and paper cups? Really?) there just doesn't seem to be a reason to be loyal to Marriott in OC.

Pros: 1. it is on the beach 15th street and is right off of the boardwalk. 2. it is updated and pretty clean. 3. we had a city view room and our room had a small view of the ocean. Cons: 1. parking is horrible, the parking under the hotel is small, a tight fit and most of the times there are no spaces available, you have to park across the street. 2. There is no lotion in the rooms (it seems like a small issue, but you are in the ocean or the pool and lotion is needed when your skinned is dried out). 3. It was extremely difficult to reserve the type of room you want because the hotel was packed to capacity- the only room I could get was a city view 2 queen for just my husband and myself (waste of space for just the 2 of us). 4. the pool is EXTREMELY small and the \"hot tub\" is just an extension of the pool and was not hot at all. 5. they give no incentives for marriott rewards members, you are like everyone else. 6. There is no room service after 10:30 (that can be a problem when you come to the hotel late and there are no options available to get a hot meal at the hotel- we actually had to order take out delivery :-( 7.no breakfast included (unlike the other hotels), the captains table- the food was average 8. the price, be prepared to pay a lot to stay here. I expected more from this hotel, especially if they are asking $399+ tax per night. They also require a deposit worth a full night and there is no cancellations 3 nights before checkin. We were experiencing a lot of bad weather in our city and we had to go through the weather to get to ocean city because we would lose $399+tax if we didn't check in. All in all, this hotel and stay was average at best, nothing special, just average. Honestly, I would only stay here again when the price is lowered.

We like to keep up with local news, and at night after a full day at the beach it would have been nice to relax and watch a good movie or TV show. Apparently Marriott can't afford many channels, and none of them were local. The listing provided on a card in the room showed HBO and the usual suspects: USA, TNT, etc. Sorry, folks, don't really have those. We couldn't even watch a local baseball game. They apparently only had the basic Dish Network package, nothing for kids or adults except talking heads. And the local news? It was from New Jersey! This is a Maryland hotel. Very disappointing. When we went down to the hotel bar to try and catch that Washington Nationals baseball game the bartender said, \"Sorry, we have the same TV service here that you do in your room.

(1) The hotel room was on the hot side, it appears you cannot control the temp and they set it at 74-75 degrees, which for me is too warm.

However, I think this hotel is worth the cost, especially if you have kids. Being able to take the elevator from the 4th floor, and be on the beach, in less than 2 minutes is pretty nice. We found the hotel to be very clean and well kept up (I believe it is relatively new). Rooms were nice sized, and have 2 queen beds, a fridge, and a microwave, which is nice when travelling with kids. Balconies were an added perk, but beware not all of them look out on the ocean (although most do in some fashion). There is a small pool here that is a nice escape for the kids during the blaring afternoon sun - but don't be fooled by the pictures, there is no hot tub, just a \"conversation pit\". I found the staff at the hotel to be a bit on the disinterested side...not unfriendly, but not particularly warm or engaging. For example, we got there about 2:00 on our arrival day...when I went to check in, I was told \"your room is not ready...probably around 4:00\". So my family and I just sat in the lobby and played cards...at 3:00 my wife went back up to the desk after we saw 3 or 4 other families check in...at which point we were told, yes, your room has been ready for 1/2 hour or so...unclear to me why we couldn't have been told this since we were sitting all of 20 feet away! Parking is a bit adventuresome here, as it is everywhere in Ocean City. If you are lucky, you can squeeze into a small spot in the \"parking garage\" under the hotel...but it is more likely you'll wind up in a dedicated lot across the street. The Captain's Table restaurant serves good food, but doesn't have much in the way of \"ambiance\", and their dinner prices are aggressively high.

The location is right on the beach with very easy beach access. It is about center the boardwalk area so there are several restaurants, eateries and shops within steps of the hotel.

We appreciated the fact that this hotel is non-smoking, both in the rooms and on the balconies. The room itself (double beds) was spacious with updated furniture and linens...a definite upgrade from some of the old outdated motels Ocean City has. The bathroom was a nice size and very clean. The room also had a mini-fridge. Beds were pretty comfy. The restaurant at the hotel (Captain's table) has a great breakfast menu.

We stayed here 3 years ago when it first opened and were pleasantly surprised at the hotel considering that the vast majority of the hotels in Ocean City are run down. Not much has changed with the hotel in that 3 years and it appears that the management has been keeping up with the property quite well. We had an ocean front room that overlooked the beach and boardwalk. It had a small but adequate balcony to enjoy the view from. The rooms were clean and the beds are still super comfortable. The staff are friendly and the location is nice since it's on the quiet end of the boardwalk. In terms of pricing, this hotel is going to run you a lot more money as compared to other hotels along the boardwalk. Even with our AAA discount, the hotel still was an average of $30-$50 more a night than some other hotels in the general vicinity. But again, you are getting a much nicer and much cleaner hotel than the cheaper ones. The pool area as mentioned is quite small and the parking garage is laid out quite awkwardly. I can see how large vehicles would have difficulty moving around. I would have no regrets recommending this hotel to any friends or family. In fact, I think even though it is more expensive it is probably one of the better options in Ocean City. The only hotels that may top this are the Holiday Inn Suites (17th St/Boardwalk) or the Hilton Oceanfront Suties (21st St). Holiday Inn would be more for families and the Hilton would be for those with a lot more extra money.

The lobby was fantastic and I felt like we were actually in a \"resort\" property. Check in was a breeze. The rooms were modern and new. The beds were extremely comfortable and the mini-fridge and microwave were a nice touch. Flat screen TVs were nice as well. My only complaints are mostly minor. A mini bar of soap is not sufficient for a family of 4 taking about 2 baths/showers per day. At the beach, even one wash cloth isn't enough per day, so I would bring additional shower wash or soap for your use, and snag extra wash cloths if you can. The indoor pool is nice, although the water around it tends to build up. I saw one man almost fall from slipping. It would help if someone came around to brush the water away from the walkways around the pool. The hotel restaurant was nice, although service seemed slow and food average.

The pool :( This leaves MUCH to be desired. I wish they would have an outdoor pool, or one that was a tad bit bigger. The hotel next door has a HUGE pool and watching those guests enjoy the large outdoor pool was painful because the one in this hotel is pretty bad - unless you are a little kid. 2. The Pillows!

Snooty Reservationists! Big disappointment overall.\u201d", "Author": "EarthyBarbara", "ReviewID": "UR97720437", "Content": "In January 2011, I called the Courtyard Marriott in Ocean City, Maryland, and booked a room for 2 nights on February 19 & 20. I specifically asked the reservationist for an oceanfront room on a higher floor. I wanted to ensure a nice view of the ocean. Low and behold when I received an e-mail confirmation from the hotel I noticed our room was on the ground floor. Not only is there no view of the ocean, the ground floors do not even have a balcony, just a patio on the boardwalk level. I called the Marriott and inquired as to why our reservation was for a ground floor room when I had asked for a higher floor. The reservationist said she had no way of knowing what floor our room was on when making our reservation. This didn't make any sense to me. I asked the reservationist to please move us to an oceanfront room on a higher floor. She replied that she could not do this because the hotel was sold out, but that she would make this notation on our reservation. I called the Marriott a week or so later and asked the reservationist if someone had cancelled and if we were placed in a room on a higher floor. The response I received was that nothing will be done until the day of check-in! I tried calling back a few other times spaced apart and kept getting the same response, \"nothing will be done until the day of check-in.\" In other words, even if someone should cancel a room on a higher floor, the Marriott would not move our reservation to that floor. The reservationists I dealt with were sarcastic, rude and very unhelpful. I was treated like pond scum by the Marriott reservationists. This situation was so totally unsatisfactory that I accessed the Marriott Corporation website and sent an e-mail to customer service regarding this matter. Within about 15 minutes, I received a website inquiry reply indicating that our reservation had been moved to a higher floor! I was very impressed with the can-do attitude of the customer service representative. So, all along my reservation could have been on a higher floor, but the Marriott reservationists would not accommodate my request. Now, about the Courtyard Marriott hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Although we stay in Ocean City at least 20 times a year, this was our first stay at the Marriott. It will be our last. The first thing I noticed was next door to us on the fourth floor there was a motorcycle gang wearing their leather jackets with \"Colors.\" I have nothing against motorcyclists, however, this group was rowdy. Another gang of motorcyclists had a room(s) on the ground floor and were sitting out on the patio level. They were hollering up to each other and throwing things at each other like children. They were drinking and smoking smelly cigars (smoking is not prohibited on the balconies or patio). We booked the Marriott for a nice quiet holiday weekend, but this didn't appear to be the case. Be advised that the balcony\u2019s are not private. They set out from the exterior of the hotel with small glass siding. You can see and hear everything from the other balconies on each side, above and below. There is no privacy whatsoever. Now, on to the pool area. When I first called the Marriott I asked if there was a Jacuzzi adjacent to the swimming pool. The reservationist said yes, there was a Jacuzzi. If you look on the hotel website, you'll see a round tub adjacent to the pool. However, we found out when we went to the pool that this was not a Jacuzzi, but called a \"Conversation Pit.\" Much to my dismay, the water temperature in the Conversation Pit was barely lukewarm. The pool water was actually warmer than the Jacuzzi. I had hoped to get some therapy from the hot water jets for a knee injury sustained from slipping on the ice. Well, that didn't happen. There was no hot water and the few jets were very weak. Oh, don't let the wide-angle lens photo of the swimming pool fool you on their website. The swimming pool is nothing more than an oversized bathtub. We also found out that there is only one swimming pool on the hotel premises. In the warmer months, expect the tiny swimming pool to be filled with people along with the \"Conversation Pit.\" You have been warned! The guests and even hotel staff joked about the \"Conversation Pit\" disguised as a Jacuzzi. Now, about the hotel room. If you like staying in mobile home trailers, this hotel room is for you! Our two-Queen room was long and very narrow. So much so that I felt a little claustrophobic. The bathroom is standard with a small countertop around the sink. The towels were small and thin with little absorbency. We were not offered terrycloth robes in this room. The shower head leaked down the tiles and onto the floor. The bathroom floor was dirty as I noted from wiping water off the floor from the leaky shower head with a white towel. There were quite a few marks (dirt) on the walls which could have been wiped down for aesthetics. The small refrigerator is very tiny. You can barely get a few sodas or bottles of water in this fridge. It's the smallest hotel fridge we have ever seen! Forget trying to get a half-gallon of milk in this fridge. It's nearly impossible. There is no place in the fridge for any food. Just a few beverages. The Marriott has signs all over the hotel advertising \"The Captain's Table Restaurant\u201d in the hotel. Therefore, they discourage guests from bringing food to the hotel by providing the tiny fridge. There is no table and chairs in the room in which to sit and eat food. Again, the hotel wants you to eat in their restaurant. (That's another story). There is a small table for a computer keyboard which we pulled out and then placed the two balcony chairs around in order to sit and have some cheese and crackers during our stay. We had to think out of the box for that one. So far as furniture, you only have one computer chair, one living room chair, a long credenza, night stand and dresser drawers. The hotel rooms are not very well appointed. There were no pictures on the long wall over the head of the beds or on the walls, expect for one overtop the small fridge area. There were three small black & white photos glued to a wooden ledge overtop the credenza. That's it so far as accessories in the hotel room, except for a floor lamp. There are no windows in the room expect for the balcony doors. There are very bright lights on each balcony which stay on all day/night. You have to close the drapes at night to prevent the bright light from shining into the room keeping you awake. Not good. When my husband and I retired for the evening we slept in the two Queen beds. I could not believe how bad my bed smelled! It reeked of perspiration. So much so that I had to sniff each pillow to determine which one had the least odor. It was a tough call because all the pillows smelled badly. So did the bed linens, especially the thin comforter. It was as though a team of Suma wrestlers slept in the beds after a match, with no showers. The hotel does not use pillow covers or double-up the pillow cases. Hence, the pillows are full of perspiration. The smell became embedded in my nose and throat for nearly 24 hours afterwards. I could hardly sleep and keep from gagging. The beds were comfortable, but what good does it do you when they smell so bad? The Marriott should use Febreeze on the bed linens or Baking Soda in the washing machines to help rid the smell. The hotel offers satellite TV. You do not have the usual cable channels in other Ocean City hotels and there is no local weather station or visitor information channels/guides. It was a windy weekend and the satellite signal kept going in and out. There is a clock radio in which you could not set the correct time. The clock was off by 20 minutes. It's the type of clock radio in which the time automatically sets itself, but obviously that wasn't working. About the \"Captain's Table Restaurant\" at the Marriott hotel. We dined there once, but never again! There were only two other tables in use and the rest of the dining area was empty. We asked the host for a booth and he snapped at us saying we could not sit at a booth, as these were for more than two people! We almost waked out, but decided to give it a go. Big mistake! Then the host placed a couple with several children right next to us. The children were screaming to the tops of their lungs. We then asked our server to be moved to another table. My husband and I both ordered the (expensive) Filet Mignon. Both Filet\u2019s were dry (no juice) and tough. I have never seen a Filet Mignon that did not have a little juice or wasn\u2019t moist. These were dry as dust and total waste of money. This, despite the fact that my husband ordered his Filet Mignon \u201cmedium rare.\u201d I ordered the Filet with Crab Imperial on the top. I found that the crabmeat was Asian and tasted very fishy-like. Most restaurants in Ocean City, Maryland, serve \"Blue Crabmeat,\" but the Marriott serves Asian. It was gross and inedible. Be aware that there is no view whatsoever of the ocean or Bay-side at the hotel restaurant. What you see out the windows are the backside of other hotels and a gross swimming pool with stagnant water. That's it! Many O.C. restaurants have a view, especially of the picturesque Bay-side. Oh, well. More points lost for the Courtyard Marriott in Ocean City, Maryland. During summer months, expect to pay $400 to $500+ per night for a hotel room at the Courtyard Marriott in Ocean City, Maryland. There are much better hotels at a more affordable rate, especially with larger swimming pools (both inside and outside). There is little, if any, recreation for children at this hotel. This concludes my review of the Courtyard Marriott in Ocean City, Maryland. I hope you have found this information to be useful when planning your next trip.

Since we only travel to the beach off-season, these things are very important. We love having a room that faces the ocean so we can see and hear the waves, and in the late fall/winter it's a very affordable option. While we don't really care for Ocean City, we just can't stay away because we like this hotel so much (and we keep asking,\"Why couldn't this hotel be in Rehoboth? It would be pure bliss!\").

However, I checked in and checked out 10 minutes later. Unfortunately, I was looking for a place where I could spend thankgsgiving weekend relaxing and occasionally watching the ocean waves from my room, as realistically, there isn't much else to do this time of the year. I was given a non-ocean front room, facing another motel and a sneak peek of the ocean. Check in personnel were very friendly, but clarified they did not have ocean front rooms available. When I got to the room, it just didnt fit my needs above. For the record, room was very clean and fresh. But since I had been told there were no ocean front rooms, I quickly made a reservation at the Hilton, then called the Courtyard's front desk to let them know I was checking out. Surprisingly, they said there was a ocean front room available if I was willing to stay. Unfortunately, the Hilton reservation had to be prepaid, so it was too late. I am both Marriott and Hilton rewards guest, hence switch between the two. So for the record, this is a nice and well maintained property, but not all rooms are ocean front if that is what you are looking for, again depending on the season.

Room 212 had an odd mechanical noise in the room. It was as if you were in a giant washing machine. Our saving grace was the ipod docking station that helped put my 2 year old son to sleep. However, Tiasha from the front desk was gracious enough to give us a new QUIET room in the third floor (311). I highly recommend this room if you were on a budget like us. The view was so much better, it's near the lobby and it was right across the access for the pool, patio and work out room. And since the room was right next door to the Captain's Table, room service was insanely quick! It took less than 10 minutes for our breakfast to be delivered to our door.

Matter of fact, right now, I am sitting in a two room corner suite on labor day weekend. Suite has a seperate living room, full kitchen with granite, big screen tv, and huge balcony. Not to mention the 3 pools and what not. I paid $459 a night for this room on a holiday weekend.

Last year we were fortunate enough to have a 1st floor room on the boardwalk. This year a second floor room with a glipse of the beach. Well worth it to pay the extra for the beachfront rooms...

She'd never been to Ocean City and since I'm a Marriott Rewards Member I figured I'd use my points and I'm really glad I did. To start with, most of the rooms are \"ocean view\" but I wanted an \"ocean front\" room. This cannot always be guaranteed but when I called and spoke with Brandon, not only did he put in the request for me he also was kind enough to have a card and small gift bag put in the room. (NOTE: this is NOT standard practice). He also suggested I call back the following morning to see if my request was granted. When I called the next morning I spoke with Ed and he assured me he was working on it since it was a \"special occasion\" and would do his best. I must admit they exceeded my expectations. Check-in was a breeze with Ed was at the front desk. We arrived @ 2:30, check in isn\u2019t until 4 pm but our room was ready. YIPPIE SKIPPE! We stayed in room 322 (3rd floor) which is on the same floor as the lobby, across from entrances to pool, exercise room and laundry room. You'd think with all the activity going on it'd be really noisy but thankfully it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t hear a peep outside of my room door. The room was big and CLEAN with 2 double beds, lounge chair and a balcony that faced the ocean with 2 chairs. The view was absolutely amazing and made me even more glad I was so persistent with my request. The hotel is centrally located on 15th street which is where all the \"action\" really begins. It was great exercise to walk all the way down to the beginning of the boardwalk and back daily. It gets really crowded but that's what happens when you go during \"senior week\" (total accident). It also got pretty noisy outside when I left my balcony door open but once I shut it; BLISS. They have a restaurant onsite which we didn\u2019t go to. The prices were a little high but the food surely smelled good. Not sure what the complaints are about the underground parking. I didn\u2019t have an issue parking my car and I drive a Camry which is considered full size. Maybe being from NYC I'm used to it or maybe those that complained simply can\u2019t drive or park well. The lobby served lemonade on Saturday next to the coffee stand but not sure what happened Sunday and Monday. Maybe it's only a weekend thing? Also, if you want some of the comp coffee, get there early. Both days when I went to get some the carafe was empty. Can\u2019t really blame the hotel; they we're sold out and it is a complimentary service they provide. The pool was more of a large tub with a bath tub attached. Kind of annoying when you have 10 people trying to swim in it but hey, you've got a huge ocean out there so why only stay at the pool? Besides seeing the young kids learn to swim was too cute! There is a staircase by the pool which leads to a walk way for the beach; super easy access. NOTE: You are not allowed to bring hotel towels down to the beach so please remember to bring your own from home or buy them at one of the many shops on the Boardwalk. The ONLY reason the hotel isn\u2019t getting a rating of 5 is they entered my room and cleaned it even though I had the \"do not disturb\" sign up. Of course some people wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this but I value my privacy and I put the sign up there for a reason. That\u2019s one of my BIGGEST pet peeves and a sure way to knock off 1 point when I do a review. All in all it was a great experience and this is a great hotel.

We only went there for breakfast, but the food was fresh, delicous and very reasonably priced.

I stayed at the OC MD property the first week it was open in August 2009 and paid around $180 a night. The location is nice and the decor and property was brand new. I reserved several rooms for summer 2010 at the \u201clong term stay rate\u201d which was 7 nights. Six months later in December 2009 I was charged a one night deposit for one of the reservations. I had to call silver elite customer service who indicated I should not have had my card charged for that reservation or any of my other reservations. After two phone calls to Marriott I received a response from the OC MD hotel manager indicating they were charging one night deposits for summer 2010 but he was refunding my card. He acted like he was doing me a favor by dropping the requirement even though it was clearly NOT in my rate rules and I had never been charged a one night deposit before in seven years of Marriott lodging. Of course I then get my card charged for my other reservations and had to have these fixed too. A few weeks later in December 2009 (before Christmas) Marriott contacts me saying there was a problem with my reservations for summer 2010 and they were researching the issue. Uhhh ok. I am then contacted by another Marriott employee soon after that and they tell me there was a \u201chuman error\u201d with the rates of my reservations (why is that my problem?) and the Marriott employee changed my rates on my reservations to $300-400 per night. If I didn\u2019t like the new rate which was now tripled I could cancel the reservations) and they would then give me a lousy $100 Marriott cheque (I had to cancel all of them to be eligible). I was told this a very equitable solution (tripling the cost of my reservations after months of planning is equitable?). Never mind that I am a silver elite member who had the reservations for almost six months and the rate was guaranteed. They went into the system sabotaging everyone of my confirmation #\u2019.

We arrived and found a beautiful NEW (just opened in August 2009) beachfront hotel on the quiet end of the boardwalk away from the noise of the shops,restaurants, and amusements. I had opted for an early check-in as normal check-in is 4:00 pm. We got there around 12:30 pm and our room was not ready yet but that was ok since I know that requests for early check-in cannot be guaranteed. The male clerk at the reception desk was very gracious and friendly and gave us a key card so that we could access the changing room/swimming pool area and told us to check back around 2:00 pm as our room should be ready by then. We went out on the beach. It was a bit windy but otherwise it was a beautiful, sunny day. We checked back around 2:30 pm and our room was ready. We were very pleasantly surprised to be put in a beautiful oceanfront room on the 4th floor. This was a real treat as I had reserved a room with a balcony but did not opt for the oceanfront room as it was slightly more expensive and we were watching our money. I would definantely opt for the extra expense to reserve the ocean front room on our next stay as the view was spectacular. The room was so very clean,clean,clean. The furnishings were very tasteful including the beautiful bed coverings/sheets which were not standard hotel fare. The beds were very comfortable and I slept great. the bathroom was very clean and amenities great.The room was also very quiet. It was Delmarva Bike week and I could not even hear the thousands of motorcycles from the main drag. There was a choice of parking under the hotel which was limited but an overflow lot was offered right across the street. It was a great location as there were many restaurants nearby that you could walk to as well as a restaurant in the hotel. I also liked the extra security feature that the elevator located in the parking garage would only take you up to the lobby so you had only the choice to go to the reception desk using the elevator or stairs until you checked in. You had to have your room card key to access a door to access an elevator that would take you to all floors. The only minus that I could see was the very,very small pool but this was not an issue as we came to enjoy the beach. This would only be an issue if we were to visit in the cold months but we would more than likely only be going to OC when we could go on the beach for sun and fun. This was our first stay in a Marriott and it was by far the nicest place that we have ever stayed. An extra added nice touch was the fridge and microwave in the room and the free coffee that was served in the lobby in the AM. Also, hats off to all staff as everyone that we came into contact with was very friendly and helpful. We will definantely be back as I am very,very picky about cleanliness where we stay and this was wonderful. The only small problem that I had is that the room card keys are a little stubborn and had to make several attempts before I could get the door open. Also, your card key will not work for you to re-enter the room after the 11:00 am check out time so make sure that you are checked out by 11:00 am or a very helpful maid(such as we had) will need to let you back in your room.Keep up the great work,clean rooms, and great service!", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hagerstown Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBest night sleep in years!\u201d", "Author": "reeselizabeth", "ReviewID": "UR45443288", "Content": "This hotel was great.

I am also not one to complain about every little thing and in general am quite easy to please. So it is with some regret that I have to say that we were not happy with the Marriott Courtyard in Ocean City, MD. In fact, we were quite disappointed. The weather forecast looked great and we were looking for a last-minute, middle-of-the-week getaway \"down the ocean\". Our only two requirements for a place to stay were that it had to be oceanfront and the place had to have an outdoor pool (with two young children, we knew that although they would enjoy spending time on the beach, ocean swimming would not be practical, especially in the wake of Hurricane Bill). Being a last-minute trip, the options were limited. My first preference was to stay at the Hilton, but they were all booked-up. So being a big fan of Marriott, and wishing to earn some more Rewards points, I thought that a two-night stay at their brand new beachfront property would be just what we were looking for. Besides, they were on the beach and had an outdoor pool, right? So we were very disappointed when we checked in to find out that their \"outdoor\" pool was really a very, very small pool housed in a greenhouse type enclosure without any direct sunlight (I guess with the windows opened it kind of qualifies as an outdoor pool). To call it an outdoor pool is very misleading. To make matters worse, there was a problem with their pool, rendering it unusable. The front desk apologized and said that the pool should be filled-up and ready to use by evening. So even though the kids were disappointed, we went up to our room to change for the beach. The room was very nice: clean, well-appointed, with a perfect view of the boardwalk and ocean. We enjoyed several hours on the beach, but once evening came and the pool was still empty, we knew the chances of it being ready during our stay were quite low. Anyway, we had a fun night on the boardwalk and were ready to crash back in our hotel room. Our lights were out by 11 pm, but the noise of loud voices and the constant slamming of doors made it one of the most unpleasant and sleepless nights I have ever spent in a hotel. I don't think that the people on our floor were being particularly loud, but the doors and walls seemed so thin and the large gap at the bottom of the door let in a lot of light and noise from the hallway. In addition, every door on our hallway slammed shut. I was lucky if I got two hours sleep the entire night. The next morning I went down for coffee and saw that the pool was still not available. Right then and there, after a terrible night, I pulled out my Blackberry and was able to get a room which opened-up last-minute at the Hilton. I went up to the front desk to tell them that we would not be staying an additional night. I really wasn't going to even get into it (besides, as I said, I'm not really one to complain), but when asked how our stay was, I had to express my displeasure with the pool and the terrible amount of noise. The manager overheard and immediately came over to see what was the matter. He did say that they were having some trouble with some of the doors on some rooms not being hung properly, which may have contributed to the noise coming into our room. I also told him that there was no door sweep at the bottom of the door, so there was no blocking of any noise or light coming in from the hallway. It looked to me that this was an old condo building that was renovated by Marriott, so maybe the original construction wasn't high quality. In any event, I didn't want to spend another $350 to not be able to use the pool and to be kept awake all night, so we decided to check out and go to the Hilton. The manager was very polite and said that he was sorry, and even offered a $175 credit on our one night stay. This was appreciated, and we used the $$ to defray the cost of our bar tab at the swim-up bar at the Hilton :) Anyway, I don't think I'd stay at the Courtyard again, especially since the Hilton is about the same price and was way more like a resort (unlike our time at the Courtyard, we had a BLAST at the Hilton!! The kids are still talking about it). I don't know if our experience was an isolated instance, but I can't say that I'd recommend this property until they get some of the kinks worked out with the door-slamming and noise.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, PA", "Title": "\u201cAwsome Edition to the Boardwalk Hotels\u201d", "Author": "YoungBuckTravel", "ReviewID": "UR39262672", "Content": "I have been going to Ocean City ever since I can remember and have a lot of memories there.

We then came across the Courtyard Mariott and saw they had a sign with vacancy. We decided to stop, not knowing it was a brand new hotel and see if they had a room available.
