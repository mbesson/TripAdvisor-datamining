The hotel has a nice layout which made it seem as if there was no one next to you. In the evenings it was nice to watch the sunset from the balcony. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They were very responsive and had lots of great advice for nearby eateries. The hotel was so close to the beach and was easy to walk to. They also have beach chairs and umbrellas that you can rent. They have an outdoor shower with warm water to rinse off after coming back from the beach. The hotel offers room service, but it\u2019s not 24 hours and it\u2019s from a nearby restaurant. They also have breakfast, but we didn\u2019t try it. Location: The hotel seemed to be in a \u201cyoung\u201d part of town, but it wasn\u2019t rowdy. My husband and I were traveling with our two kids and it felt safe. It isn\u2019t close to downtown San Diego, but when you\u2019re standing there looking at the ocean from your room it didn\u2019t really matter.

Ocean walk is very busy with lots of activity and great people watching. Everyone and I REALLY MEAN EVERYONE is friendly and nice at this hotel. Not one person, from maintenance to front desk, hesitate to greet you when you walked by even if they were very busy doing their job. We ate at the Fishery nearby which was great. Did not use pool or hot tub since it was cool although plenty of people were there. DId not do the breakfast although it looked good. I asked the housekeeping woman if we could have extra regular coffee packets and she handed me 3 of them. Several other places I stayed at made it such a hassle to get more than one packet. Pacific Beach is a unique area and even though it appears to be more spring breakish, it is family oriented. Just walk the neighborhoods. The main part on Grand and Garnet can be a little challenging. Certainly saw some interesting characters. This hotel is at the north end of the beach and seems quieter than further south.

I have never felt so compelled to review a hotel, good or bad, as I feel to review this one. First and foremost the staff (everyone, without exception) is wonderful -- the best! They could not have been more friendly, helpful, polite, accommodating... I could go on and on. Our car was retrieved promptly (often several times a day) within minutes of calling down for it. Every time we came through the lobby the desk staff and concierge inquired as to where we were going today and if they could get us tickets, make us reservations or print us directions -- really helpful. The staff in the Carribean Room for breakfast in the morning and for drinks (and the delicious chocolate chip cookies at 4:00 every day) in the afternoon were great, as well. Breakfast was good (two different omelettes, sausage, bacon, breakfast potatos, make your own waffles, muffins, yogurt and delicious fresh fruit) and is 1/2 price if you are a guest at the hotel. Coffee is complimentary in the lobby and/or the Carribean Room in the morning, too. Drinks and light food can be ordered from the pool area in the afternoon, and the service was always prompt, polite and with a smile. The hotel itself is lovely, the rooms are lovely and the view from the ocean front balconies is amazing. A couple of times we saw whales swimming by in front of the hotel from our balcony. It was fun to people watch and watch the surfers every day, as well. The rooms were very clean and one of the days our room was actually cleaned twice. Chocolates left on our pillow every day were good, too. My one and only VERY MINOR complaint is that the pillows on the beds were a bit lumpy. This was our first time visiting San Diego, or the west coast for that matter; we were there to visit my nephew and his family. Though there are many hotels much closer to where he lives, I would never consider visiting the area again without staying at the Pacific Terrace.

Bikes (free rental) were promptly brought out when we asked for them. Warm freshly baked cookies are out every afternoon. Crystal Pier is nearby and we saw dolphins playing. The amusement park in Mission Beach was a fun thing to do for a couple of hours, and is just down the boardwalk. Anyway Pacific Terrace is a small sweet hotel that I highly recommend.

It is right on the beach, well really 30 feet above but easy walk down steps. Nice pool and hot tub. The breakfast (on site) is good (cereal, scrambled eggs, omelet, bacon & link, potato, coffee, juice. The room is small but in the 3 hours open the tables turn over pretty fast and you can eat easily outside. If you have AAA card breakfast is half priced and no rental charge for bikes and other plus card benefits. Kono's (2 blocks down beach walk) serves good breakfast, long line that moves fast and for less than $7 each --good. Kono's also has outside espresso stand for morning walks. They have fitness room at garage level and bonus/play area (kids) above breakfast area. We bought our LegoLand tickets from Hotel Consigner and saved $7 each. Very secure, safe area. Rooms are nice (a little dark inside) with large screen TV. Underground parking is secured by metal roll-up gate at entrance and exit. About 5-6 blocks away is a Starbucks, CVS drugstore, Ralphs supermarket. We also ate at Nicks (next to Ralphs) which was good food with kids menu (large & busy bar upstairs and in part of main floor. We had the larger suite with a regular room adjoining. The difference is the suite had a bar/ counter with some bar chairs, sink, microwave and cabinets with dishes/flatware. I would do regular room next time since we only did popcorn in microwave. The negative:I would not recommend staying in room 110. The elevator is right across from the door and the breakfast area is just down the hall (after room 111 & 112 i think). From 7 am you are awakened to kids yelling as they get off elevator to run down the hall and at night 12-2am you are awakened by laughing and yelling from those waiting for the elevator. I must point out that this was during spring break, so it may only be a problem on friday/saturday nights at other times. We also had room 111 and people do sit right outside your patio area eating breakfast, so many times you wake to kids screaming. The mornings should be no problem if you're up before 7am. The TV in 110 was a dark screen. Really really dark. Engineering has the remote to adj brightness/contrast. It may be time to change this TV because even thought Engineering was prompt to come in and adj. it was still fairly dark after he finished. He said something about the TV may have a feature that automatically darkens the screen based on the amount of light in the room. Also, the beds are on a platform. They do provide a small 2-step stool (located in closet) to help get up and down. But if you have any mobility problem or are short this could be a problem. Oh, speaking of short...or the opposite, the shower head is high, you can be 6-3 or more and enjoy the shower. We will stay there again, mostly because of location, the beach, the safe walking along the sidewalk/boardwalk (?? not really a boardwalk but great for many people walking and bikes going by). One more thing that was nice was that when making the reservation, they assigned the room right then. I requested first floor and was given 110 & 111 at that time.

My husband booked this trip for our family and chose this hotel based on the positive reviews he read. The 3 story hotel is located right on Pacific Beach. It literally takes you less than 3 minutes to get from your hotel room to the ocean. It was very low key and uncrowded; a boutique-type gem. Upon our afternoon arrival, we were told our room preference was not available. We booked through Expedia and were told our room preference was not guaranteed because of that. The staff worked immediately to remedy the situation and placed us in a king jr suite with a full ocean view for the first night and then moved us to the room preference we had originally booked with an upgraded view. Every staff member we encountered, from the front desk to the person who brought us extra pillows, were friendly, competent and eager to help. Great staff! The rooms were upgraded and very clean. All amenities were provided that you would expect from a high end hotel including large beach towels for our use. The beds were very comfortable and the decor lovely. My only complaint would have been the use of bedspreads as opposed to duvets. The entire hotel was very well maintained, including the pool and lounge area. The pool was an ok size, no frills, but very clean with comfortable chaise loungers with cushions. And of course with a spectacular view of the Ocean! For a small fee the hotel provides beach chairs and beach cruisers. Children's beach toys are free to use. The beach in front of the hotel was never over crowed and we always had a front row seat to some great surfing. Parking was also convenient located in an underground garage beneath the hotel. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel because we were off exploring the area each morning. Be sure to try Kono's Cafe just south of the hotel.

We arrived at the Pacific Terrace before our room was ready but they were very accommodating in holding our baggage and letting us use the facilities and the pool. They also gave us a nice room upgrade and a bottle of wine as we were celebrating our anniversary, which was a nice touch. I can't say enough about how welcoming and helpful the staff is at the Pacific Terrace -- they all seemed genuine too, like they really wanted to help and were not just asking because they were getting a paycheck to do so. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable. We loved that the hotel offers bicycles that you can take along the boardwalk, it was so relaxing and fun. We didn't stay by the pool much, as we really wanted to enjoy the beach and boardwalk and check out the san diego bar scene and attractions (the Zoo is a must -- it's just incredible and not like any zoo you've ever been to!) , but the pool area looked nice. As for San Diego, I'm so in love with this city. The people are the friendliest and most happy people i've ever met in the U.S. I can definitely see my husband and I relocating to SD down the road. if you're comfortable using public transportation, don't be afraid to take the local bus to any attractions or anywhere for that matter -- it's MUCH cheaper than a taxi and it's very convenient. The bus stop is a few seconds walk from the Pacific Terrace and the transit system in san diego seemed very easy to use. Taking the bus gave us a chance to talk to the locals and see some parts of san diego that we prob would have missed if we took a taxi (downtown, little italy, etc.).

The rooms have 2 double beds which are amazingly comfortable once you manage to clamber onto them - the heavy wooden frames around them are just at the right height for me to bang my shins every time I attempted to get on the bed. The view of the ocean from the balcony is fabulous - we left the door open to fall asleep to the roar of the waves crashing against the beach. Our room was almost right in the centre of the hotel - which meant that we were over the top of the entrance to the pool - the balconies are great but they aren't very private or quiet - indeed when there are people in the pool, especially kids playing, it can be very noisy. Service was reasonable - but not exceptional. When we booked we had a rate with a free glass of wine which didn't ever materialise - although to be honest we kept forgetting to mention it. There were a couple of other niggles which irritated - they ran out of the only decent beer they had in the bar - Sam Adams (they only did four different beers, one of which was a \"lite\") and 2 days later when we tried again for a beer they still hadn't got any (the bartender was a bit embarrassed and offered to pop down the shop!). The other niggle was that we asked about a late checkout - it was a quiet time so they agreed to an hour later than normal - 12noon, but if we wanted a 3pm checkout we would have to pay just under $100. We settled for 12noon. Overall we really liked this hotel - its small and right beside the beach with a great view and we would probably go back if we ever return to San Diego.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Service Good Location\u201d", "Author": "whereissnot", "ReviewID": "UR123182137", "Content": "We stayed at the Pacific Terrace in May 2011 and we are always comparing their service to other places we stay.

Their full ocean view rooms have balconies that are basically on top of the ocean, and are AMAZING for people watching if you get a room on floor 2 or 3 on the right-hand side of the hotel. Try not to get a room right in the middle of the U shaped hotel, as those are farther back from the beach and you end up just spying on people in the pool when you should be enjoying the sunset. I never pay for parking, as I'm always able to find free parking within a few blocks. I also never eat the food at the hotel, as San Diego is chock-full of marvelous restaurants. My partner and I are honestly slightly embarrassed for liking this hotel so much. We're in our early 30s, which we think is far too early to be staying in a Tommy Bahama themed hotel. The upside of that is that there isn't a party scene at night. It's always quiet, we sleep with the balcony doors wide open, and when we venture down to the jacuzzi we always have it to ourselves. The one downside is the customer service. The hotel staff tends to be reluctant to allow early check-ins or late check-outs. They also won't let you book a specific room unless you pay a $50 fee -- so even if we book months in advance, we aren't guaranteed one of the right-hand side oceanfront rooms. Even though we are repeat customers! I also never get free upgrades, even when better rooms are available :-( My final gripe: my partner called today to find out about availability this coming Monday. He called at about 6pm and was given a special unadvertised rate by the person working the desk. He said he would call back in a bit to confirm. When he called back a different person answered the phone and refused to honor the rate he had been quoted just a few hours earlier, even though the room (a King Suite) was still available. We felt like we were being jerked around a bit, so we booked a \"Surf Pad\" room at a different beach-front hotel just a smidge down the boardwalk. We're bummed out, because that hotel is swankier, but also louder and douchier. That said, they are much more accommodating about early check-ins and they don't bait and switch on price.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hot Springs Village, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class All the Way!\u201d", "Author": "GoDog514", "ReviewID": "UR122827727", "Content": "Every staff person we interacted with was very friendly and helpful.

The views from the hotel were awesome! My favorite time of the day was at sunset. We would sit on the chairs by the pool and have a perfect view of the sunset. The service at the hotel was excellent. Everyone was friendly from the janitorial staff up to management. I thought that was very impressive. Even before we traveled to San Diego, I was contacted by the hotel concierge to find out if we had any needs for reservations at local restaurants or any local attractions. In advance, the hotel made us dinner reservations for some near-by places, and got us our San Diego Zoo tickets. This made things so convenient and easy for us. Our room was very nice and a good size. We stayed in on of the family suites. The pull-out couch was very comfortable. The view from our room was of the pool and the ocean. I think this was a perfect room for our family of 5. As far as food, the hotel only serves breakfast. We ate breakfast there 3 out of the 5 days. The food was pretty good, but the menu did not change daily while we were there. It was a buffet with things like eggs, omelettes, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast, pancakes, french toast, yogurt, bananas, a few rolls, and a couple of choices of cereal. We enjoyed it on the days we ate there. The coffee was Starbucks and was very good. The hotel concierge gave us 4 excellent recommendations for places to eat dinner. We enjoyed all the places they sent us to. Most of the places were within walking distance and we would walk there along the boardwalk each night to get there. The pool was nice and enjoyable for the kids, and they had a nice hot tub. The chairs were comfortable lounge chairs and they even set up tiki torch lights once the sun went down. The hotel really was a great choice for us and I would highly recommend it. The only drawback at all had nothing to do with the hotel itself, it was more the area where it is located. We found it was very interesting, but we had no problems with it. The boardwalk had some homeless people further down the road from the hotel and there were certaintly some very interesting characters we saw as we walked on the boardwalk. The hotel itself is very secure and we never felt unsafe. The area around the hotel is pretty casual with a lot of surfers around. It was fun to watch them surfing at high tide! We did not spend much time at the actual beach. The beach area is okay, but certaintly not like the white pristine beaches in the Carribean :). It is just a public beach in California. I knew that this was the case, but playing on the beach was not one of our priorities this vacation. I did see other families with their kids down on the beach playing. My kids seemed to prefer the beautiful pool at the hotel. Anyway, overall I would say the hotel exceeded our expectations. We were very happy with them and would recommend this hotel.

It's by far the best hotel in the area - Pacific Beach. The view onto the beach and the Pacific and the surfers is fantastic; as are the sunsets. Just as good is the level of service here - the quality,warmth, friendliness of every single team member is as good as i have ever know it in any hotel. The best room: The best rooms are on the second and third floors - avoid the first (ground) floor as it's onto the pool and not much of a view of the sea. The best rooms are on the edges of the hotel but they are the suites and I'm not sure they are worth the extra. You get a great sunset from all the ocean front rooms - it does not matter which one you are in. We were slightly to the side of the pool (on the second floor) which was good. Breakfast is really average and I would not bother with it - as one guest said: 'in other hotels this kind of breakfast is normally complimentary.' Go out. There is no restaurant in the hotel but that's fine as there are so many choices in walking distance - ask for the restaurant recommendation sheet they have in reception to find the better places. The hotel is not a trendy hotel - it's very functional but it won't win design awards! It's ideal for families. The secure garage parking, under the hotel, is $20 per day for residents, which is steep. There is free wifi which is of a good quality. I Which brings me to my main problem - the area - Pacific Beach itself. It's a surfer beach, popular with students, and the younger folks. It's NOT a top end resort at all. I guess, for California, it's a little bit of a dive. Trendy dive. So, for example, eating out is cheap and cheerful. There are loads of rowdy sports bars close by. Next time, i think I won't come back to this area (I'll go to La Jolla, see below) which is a shame because i liked the hotel. My advice is to research the area you stay in San Diego very carefully. Here's my very simple guide..... Most important to you is restaurants, busy and good bars and lots of choices. You don't mind not being by the sea.....GAS LAMP QUARTER DOWNTOWN You like being by the sea and like really loud and lively budget places with the trendy vibe....PACIFIC BEACH You want to be by the sea, will pay really premium prices and like it older and more conservative....LA JOLLA (you get the bonus of seeing seals every day on the rocks around La Jolla) In all 3, you'll need a car to get around and inland, into the forests, mountains and desert - all of which are 1.5 hrs drive from San Diego. Bye the way, San Diego is totally cool place - so definitely go. ps top tip - we went in late October and the 'coastal eddy' had started = fog, mist, cold (mid 60s). Simple... 3 days it was miserable on the coast, we drove 1.5 hrs into the mountains and then onto the desert and it was beautiful - totally cloudless blue skies and hot, hot, hot. Within 1.5 hours we went from 65 on the coast to 96 in the desert. I love the fact that that is always and option if you have fog/bad weather in San Diego.

We had a third floor ocean room and the view is spectacular. I felt the neighborhood was safe and offers a wide variety of good dining options in the neighborhood, provided you are willing to drive to some. The public areas are well kept and the staff is extremely friendly, always going out of their way to cordially greet you every time you pass by them. Although the pool is not huge, we enjoyed it. The hot tub was also nice. We were disappointed in our room. At $500 a night and all the glowing reviews (#2 in San Diego!), our expectations were high. The rooms are dark, cramped and cluttered with a lot of large clunky furniture that is not functional. There were no regular size drawers to put our clothes in, so we kept them in our suitcase \u2013 but there was barely a place to set our open suitcase (that was out of the way). The bathroom vanity was so cluttered with stuff that there was no room for our stuff. The caulk and tile in the bath and shower area was dirty and installed poorly. I recall seeing a previous review that said something like: \u201cthink Best Western with wood trim.\u201d I think that pretty much sums up the quality and style of the rooms. Which would be fine, if we weren\u2019t paying $500 a night\u2026\u2026 It was nice to have breakfast available in the hotel, and they have an adequate selection. However, the precooked breakfast is of mediocre quality (e.g., dry toast, hard waffles). They have the staff on hand and the facility to cook eggs made to order, which would be a great addition. If the breakfast were fully included, it would be harder to complain. But it goes back to the value issue: since we were paying extra for it, we were expecting a bit more. Oh, and the chocolate chip cookies that everyone\u2019s talking about? We heard about them, we even smelled them, but we never saw one. Apparently, there\u2019s about a 30 minute window in which you might be fortunate enough to get one\u2026.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altadena, California", "Title": "\u201cUps and downs\u201d", "Author": "Umberto B", "ReviewID": "UR117562605", "Content": "My wife and I booked a family suite with our 7-year and twin, 2-year old girls. Prior to our arrival we requested two cribs for the twins and were promptly assured that two pack-n-play would be waiting for us in our room upon check-in. The cribs weren't there when we arrived, but a visit to the front desk fixed that. The 2-room suite is not terribly large, calling it a \"family\" suite is a bit of a stretch. The living / dining room has a pullout sofa bed with a comfortable but somewhat complicated air inflatable mattress (electric pump is in the closet), and no direct access to either patio or bathroom, remember that if you like to watch TV late at night while other family members are sleeping next door. The \\bedroom has two very comfortable queen beds and a small work desk, but not enough room for the cribs, so we ended up leaving those in the living room and our older daughter slept with us on the second queen bed since the cribs took all the room in front of the sofa bed, no big deal but we were hoping for some extra room in a family suite, honestly. Some nice touches in the room: a power strip with plenty of available outlets for phones and laptops by the desk, an iHome radio on the nightstand, an available refrigerator in addition to the minibar fridge for the babies' milk and stuff, two big, high quality flat screen TVs and DVD players, Tommy Bahamas toiletries, four big pool towels - but make sure you bring them back with you to the room or they will charge you for the missing ones. Not so nice: somewhat dated furniture and carpets, a bathtub with an anemic shower head (in a suite at this price we expected separate shower stall and tub), poor wi-fi coverage. We were on the first floor (suite 105) and could barely get a signal, or none at all, depending of where we sat. I hate that. Service was spotty: Very friendly staff, but we left the room at 10 am the second day and when we came back at 2 pm for our girlls' afternoon nap, the room had not been done yet. We called and scheduled it for 6 pm, housekeeping did come while we were out for dinner but must have been in a rush as they forgot a bunch of cleaning supplies and dirty rags in our bathroom. My wife and daughters had no complaints about the pool, service staff was attentive and friendly everywhere else. We ate breakfast in the room, much easier with little kids... The $20 daily \"valet park\" fee should be eliminated, though. First of all, the valet attendant is almost never there and it is really way faster to self park, it's a small hotel. Also, 500 bucks for a room and you want and extra $20 to park my car, seriously? Finally, a couple of hours after checking out someone called my cell and left a message saying that housekeeping could \"smell some strong smoke odor\" in my room and I would be assessed a $250 fee, bye bye. WHAT? We don't smoke and, if we did with 3 small kids in our room, we should probably be in jail, lol! I called them and, after putting me on hold for a while, a manager came back on the phone to tell me the fee would be waived... She never explained why I was assessed the fee to begin with, a mistake perhaps? I don't care either way, but I can't help but thinking that, had I not called right away to complain, that fee would have stuck. Everyone makes mistakes, but before you accuse someone of smoking in a $500/night non-smoking room you better make 100% sure you know what you are talking about. Finally, the location: It's great as long as you concentrate on the ocean in front of you: Unbeatable views, breezes and walks on the beach just steps away, really gorgeous. The area around the hotel, on the other hand, is definitely forgettable. It's fine to hang out during the day but I would not feel safe walking around at night with small kids. We didn't, we took the car to go eat since the hotel has no restaurant. Lots of beach dives, taco stands and fairly seedy pubs, rowdy kids in a party mood (it's the end of summer, maybe that had something to do with it) and the occasional homeless sleeping on a bench, Pacific Beach is not very family friendly in my opinion.

The beach is wide and nice (the water is cold). It's easy to find restaurants, clubs, and shopping within walking distance. Walking is the best way to get around because there is no other place to park your car other than the hotel. It costs $20 per day to park and the parking garage was well lit and convenient - definitely worth it, considering the lack of parking in the area. There were a lot of people partying at clubs/condos/restaurants along the boardwalk; so if that offends you, you might want to pick another beach. We saw plenty of families along the boardwalk too. The Pacific Terrace Hotel is on the north end of the boardwalk, so it doesn't get the same foot traffic and noise as its neighbors to the south. The hotel loaned us boogie boards, beach chairs, and beach towels at no charge which was a nice benefit. This location was convenient to our trip to Torrey Pines State Park and La Jolla. Though we didn't go there, Sea World was nearby. For our week-long trip to San Diego we stayed in three different places - a B&B in Coronado, the Pacific Terrace, and a B&B in Hillcrest.

This is perhaps the only negative, all the restaurants we sampled in the near vicinity are mediocre at best. You have to go at least three blocks back into SD to find somewhere to have a good meal. Granted there are quite a few restaurants along the Pacific Beach boardwalk but they are not great as it seems that they are quite happy with the passing trade they have and seem to cater for the drinking customer more. The best we found was the Green Flash and they got our order wrong but what we had was OK. The pool is nice, clean and gets sun pretty well all day. We had a great few days here and would recommend this establishment but its quite expensive.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful ocean front hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kayenne", "ReviewID": "UR116343526", "Content": "We stayed for three nights, and our family had an excellent and comfortable stay in a full ocean view room (318, I think).

We were so thankful that we even got the same exact room we had 2 years ago,,,a King Jr Suite. We are a family of 4 that includes twin 9 year olds. I felt that the room was clean and well maintained. We loved that we had access to beach toys, chairs and an umbrella. The umbrella was a huge benefit to me as we are all extremely fair skinned and burn easily as a result. The room had a breakfast bar area with refrigerator and microwave (plus a mini bar which we never used). There was a sofa sleeper that was a little larger than twin bed size which was great for the kids. The room was a great size and arrangement for us where we could have access to our own snacks and make a lunch or dinner for the times we wanted to save a little money,,,or too tired to go out. The \"kitchen\" area was stocked with plates, glasses and utensils. It was on the first floor with a patio that opened out to the pool area. It is the only room I've stayed in that had enough trash cans! I thought the hotel was fairly quiet. We are not picky about things like that. My kids are usually the ones making the noise. There was a workout room that I meant to visit but never did and also a computer available. There are even books available to read which was great for me because I forgot to bring one. The hotel is right off the beach. It is exactly what my daughters loved,,,,alternating between the pool and the beach. It was so easy for us with it being on the first floor. Access to the hotel and pool is secure. We always felt safe and it was not over-run with people at the pool or the breakfast buffet. Surf lessons are offered up and down the beach. The boardwalk was great for exercise. We meant to rent bikes but never got around to it. It was a great and lazy vacation,,,,just what we were looking for. We didn't need the big resorts with the fancy pools. My daughters (age 9) were perfectly happy with the pool and beach. We met another family that had been coming there for 25 years and staying in the same room. Everyone we met was really nice. I feel like they kept up the clientele so we were never concerned with the other guests. Everyone was quiet and respectful of privacy. The breakfast buffet was simple but just what we wanted. There was a great breakfast place down the beach a short walk,,,,Konos,,,the portions were huge. Yes, hotel parking is $20 per day,,,as it is for most nice hotels on the beach. There was a lot of kelp on the beach and I did read up on that situation about the kelp washing ashore and that it is best for the environment for it to be left there. It was interesting and I recommend reading up on the subject. It certainly didn't slow us down or impact us one way or the other. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Housekeeping did a great job. A few times, we left in the morning and stopped back at the room fairly early, like 12:30, and the room would already have been cleaned. I stayed in a partial ocean view room for 6 nights at $420 a night. I didn't know it came with a kitchenette, so that was a nice surprise. It had a small frig, microwave, coffeemaker, sink, and plates, bowls, and utensils. It came in handy. The balcony overlooked the ocean on the left and directly underneath and to the right was grass and a view of another building. The Pacific Beach area can be noisy at night. I left the patio door open to hear the ocean overnight. Drunken carousers screaming below at like 3 am woke me up the first night. I came to San Diego for comic con, and the hotel was close to everything I wanted to see. I don't think it took longer than 10 minutes to drive to the convention center, the zoo, Sea World, La Jolla, etc. There are also a lot of restaurants you can walk to from the hotel within a few blocks. There's a Trader Joe's a couple blocks away as well, so you can buy drinks, etc. to bring to the zoo or the other attractions that want to charge you an insane amount for a snack or bottle of water. Parking isn't too bad if you don't mind sometimes having to walk a block or two. There is a garage at the hotel that is $20 a night, but we just parked on the street, and it was fine. It's well marked where you can park and can't, mostly only signs for street cleaning (no parking first Wed. of the month sort of thing). The staff was really nice about answering questions about getting around and parking and didn't push us to pay for the garage, which is what I expected. They provide a lot of nice little touches which I appreciated: free iced tea and cookies, 4 beach towels in your room, HBO, everyone on staff makes a point of saying hello. The only thing I can come up with negative is that they were doing construction on the pool area, so I didn't get a chance to use it. But it wasn't a big deal, since the beach is right there. Also it would have been nice if there was another entrace other than the lobby. It was quite a hike to get to my room each time on the other side of the building.

The good news is that it lived up to its promise. The staff was more than friendly, the room was very comfortable and the location was ideal. A small reason behind our choosing this hotel was because they rented bikes on the property. We were briefly disappointed when we learned they were out of bikes when we checked at the front desk around noon. However, we were pleased when Rachel at the front desk directed us to a rental company just a couple blocks down the beach where we were able to rent for an even lower price than the hotel offered, thanks to a coupon she gave us. We didn't mind the walk to the rental location since we were already planning a long ride and a little warm-up walk wouldn't hurt. At the bike rental place, we were on our way in under 5 minutes. We also got a recommendation from Paul for a Mexican restaurant in Old Town, plus a coupon for a free appetizer. The food was great! On the downside, just minor points. There were lipstick marks on one of the glasses in our room, but otherwise the room was impeccable. Don't expect much from the excercise room. We checked it out, but decided against it. Choose a long bike ride if you want to get in some exercise. The pool was nice and but most lounge chairs were taken when we chose to visit around happy hour. However, we had a room on the first floor that was just steps from the pool and were happy when they brought our drink order to our patio where we were taking in the view.

The hot tub seemed very popular in the evenings as well. It was relatively convenient to get to the I-5 to be able to drive to area attractions. We had a \"partial ocean view\" room which ended up being on the first floor looking out towards the pool-we could sorta see the ocean--but from my perspective I wouldn't consider it to have been a true \"partial ocean view.\" That being said..I would say to spend a few extra dollars to get a ocean view room on the 2nd or 3rd floors--that way you won't be disappointed. The room was nicely furnished, spacious, and clean. Our wireless internet was inconsistent--sometimes we could connect and stay connected without issue and other times we would lose the connection sporadically. We were not aware of the fees to park our car at the hotel prior to arriving-so that was a big surprise to us. $20 per day to park in the parking area under the hotel seemed a bit high to me--so be sure to plan on budgeting that into your travel costs. Also, when we booked our room the hotel was doing continental breakfast with the room--they stopped doing that just before we arrived. They are now charging a separate charge for a breakfast buffet ($11.50 for adults and $6 for children).

The location is terrific, providing gorgeous ocean views and close access to the beach (note, the hotel sits above the beach, so you must use the nearby wooden staircase to get there). The room decor is plush with a tropical flair--comfortable beds, wooden louvered rolling shutters, and premium dark wood furniture. We enjoyed the huge flat screen TV and DVD player. The bath area included a large marble-topped counter and sink with large mirror, separate from the toilet and tub. The countertop housed a small fridge and also a mini-bar. Everything was sparkling clean. The balcony was oversized and included 4 wrought iron chairs and table. Our particular room faced a more southern direction, but the balcony was semi-circular in shape which allowed for a broad view. We did partially overlook the side street and a few buildings, but still had full ocean views, including some spectacular sunsets. (There are also ocean front rooms that overlook the pool area.) The pool was small, but more than adequate; the lounge chairs were comfortable and I really enjoyed being able to see the ocean waves while lounging by the pool. The hotel does not have a restaurant on-site, but there are many places to eat within walking distance. They also have a unique system with a couple of the local restaurants where you can actually charge your meal to your hotel room. There is also the option to have room service provided by nearby restaurants. There do serve breakfast, at an additional cost ($9). We enjoyed it--choice of ham and cheese omelets with breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast or waffle and bacon or sausage. Plus coffee, juice, milk, and hot chocolate. I can't say enough about the staff. Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating. Check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient. I was welcomed back every time I returned through the lobby. Every single staff member I encountered greeted me. I also noted that members of the staff were constantly cleaning and polishing the public areas. All in all, really top-notch. The room rates are in line with first class status, but I really felt like they went out of their way to earn it.

We had the option of staying downtown San Diego, but we wanted to find someplace away from the hustle and bustle. Pacific Beach is an area full of character, and very laid back. We found the Pacific Terrace Hotel through TripAdvisor. This is our 2nd stay at the hotel. When we arrived, we weren't placed in the room we thought we had reserved. It was simply a difference in what we remembered when talking to the reservation agent vs. what the reservation agent had noted. Our understanding was contrary to what their room classes were. They could have easily argued their point (which technically was correct). After talking with the staff, and out of sheer goodwill and interest in pleasing us, the shifted some rooms around and were able to put us in the room we had expected. The next day we received a personally written (not a form letter) note apologizing for the mix-up and wanting to ensure we were satisfied. We needed to stay in our existing room for a couple of nights until the current guess departed our room. The thought of moving rooms wasn't appealing to us because we'd have to pack our stuff and move it. They sent us another note on the day we were to transfer rooms indicating it would be done between 11am and 1pm, and we didn't need to be present - they'd send a guest services agent to move all of our luggage. They told us to hang our clothes (which we would have done anyway) and they'd move them directly from the old closet to the new one. We basically threw our toiletries in our suitcases. All the moving was done by the guest services agent. Let me reiterate - they way their room classes were set up, they didn't need to let us transfer rooms, but they did it anyway. They also discounted the rate for a few nights, gave us a free bottle of wine and free garage parking. The staff is unbelievably friendly. We've traveled extensively for business and pleasure and have never had such wonderful service. The amenities in the room were fabulous. The bed was so comfortable, the provided a DVD player, beach towels ... everything I could think of. My wife had a sinus headache one evening and someone at the front desk offered to go to the drugstore and purchase medicine.

The staff were friendly and responsive, but we had a bunch of minor problems that sort of added up. Our thermostat didn't work, the pbs station on the tv didn't work (and that's all our kids watch!), the dvd player didn't work, and our room was missing a trash can. Very responsive fixes to most of these problems but the pbs never got fixed---we were told it was a LodgeNet issue).

I never felt my safety was threatened, but it was not exactly a neighborhood feel. Skip the breakfast...many local places were very good but the whole \"Carribean Room/pool\" scene was pretty unpleasant. The pool is very small, not particularly clean, and not somewhere we felt comfortable lingering. The worst part of our experience was the cigarette smoke. We did have a non-smoking room, but even with the patio door shut, smoke from the neighbors must have been seeping through the walls.

This was our first time in San Diego and we happened to arrive at the same time the area was in the middle of an atypical cold snap. We originally reserved and were placed in a partial ocean view junior suite on the top (3rd) floor. This view was great for both looking out with a direct view of the boardwalk to the south and the ocean at just a slight right angle. We also faced the pier which extends hundreds of feet over the ocean and was lighted at night. The room was spacious and well appointed and includes a small kitchenette area, sitting area with couch and a small desk area for laptop use. Free Wi-Fi and parking was included in our package. The stocked kitchenette is convenient for those that may want to purchase food and prepare some meals to reduce restaurant dining expenses should you desire to do so. It\u2019s a nice option but we did not take advantage of that aspect.. Visit Kono's a few blocks walk south on the boardwalk for a big breakfast at reasonable prices. Do take advantage of the very knowledgeable and helpful staff of the hotel. Both Angela the concierge, and Kyla at the front desk are fantastic to work with and exceptional at their jobs. Upon arrival we spent a fair amount of time with Angela getting assistance and recommendations for the \u201cmust-do things\u201d in the area that she would recommend as a person with provincial knowledge. Angela took time with us to provide us helpful information, directions, restaurant recommendations and even ways to save money by acquiring discounted event/tour coupons available at that time of our stay. During the remainder of our stay whenever we saw each other we would casually chat about what we have done and are planning to do next, as easily as if talking with a friend. The next point I cover is not a complaint. It's an example of how the hotel staff works to please their customers. Although the assigned room was almost perfect in every way, there was a slight issue with our shower. No matter how we positioned the shower head, water still leaked out onto the floor. The swinging glass doors have a slight open space where they meet the side walls, and the joint where the glass doors are suppose to seal must not be tight enough. This was not so much of an issue other than it required us to use the towels to sop up the spillage which took more than just one towel to absorb. I was more concerned about long term damage to bathroom floor and to the ceiling of the room directly below us than any minor inconvenience to us. After our second morning when we were leaving to sightsee for the day, I reported my concerns about the shower to Kyla at the front desk. She said she would send someone right up to look at it. Out of curiosity, I inquired if there were any full ocean view rooms available for upgrade. Kyla checked for availability and found a corner room with a full ocean view that was displaying as available for the next 2 out of our remaining 3 nights and she offered it to us at a VERY reasonable upgrade fee. She could then move us our final night to another full ocean view junior suite room free of any additional charge. All we had to do was throw our clothes back into our suitcases and the staff would move them while we were out for the day. Anything hung in the closets could stay there and the staff would take care of moving them. During the 15 minutes it took for us to go back to pack our bags and return to the front desk with the old room keys, Kyla informed us of some good news. She was able to move some things around in the system so we could stay in the corner room for the duration of our stay. Not only were we excited to hear this news but Kyla looked genuinely excited for us that she was able to work this out while we had packed. She really went above and beyond anything we had expected and I can\u2019t stress enough how she sincerely took pleasure in making us happy. The room was a great bargain in my eyes. This corner room turned out to be one of the large honeymoon suites with two separate balconies overlooking both pool and ocean, two separate rooms dividing the living room, kitchen, dining room area from the bedroom, bathroom area (with larger sink area and separate large Jacuzzi). We awoke each day looking directly from our bed straight out to the ocean, with the waves lapping onto the shore and no more water lapping onto the bathroom floor after showering. The hotel has a nice pool area but as mentioned the weather was a little cool and windy. You need your room key to gain entrance though the gated areas. This is probably due to keep small children and non-guests from access. The pool was heated and the children had no problems jumping right in. There is also a large separate hot tub to one side of the pool with temperatures high enough to ward off any cold weather. We found this hotel\u2019s location ideal for our plans which included spending our time at different places in the surrounding area. During our stay we visited the typical spots such as Old Town, Coronado Island, Balboa Park, Gaslamp quarters, Seaport Village, etc., via the Old Town trolley tours (highly recommended for first time visitors). We drove the rental car back to some of the same to spend time in the evening hours. We also briefly visited La Jolla, Laguna Beach, Balboa Island and Newport Beach. The hotel\u2019s location was perfect for both these North and South directional excursions. All the staff at the Pacific Terrace hotel should be commended for their customer service and friendliness from the bellboys, valet parking, maid service, front desk and concierge. Each person always had a ready smile and courteous greeting during the length of our stay. We would highly recommend this hotel to be one of the top on your list for consideration if you are staying in the area.

We book the full ocean view room as we enjoy sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine watching and listening to the ocean waves. If you like to leave the balcony access door open (to hear the waves at night) be advised that at 7:00 AM the pool area is open and it becomes a bit noisy. This is a family friendly hotel and there are kids along with the noise they create.

Our view looked out,. partially, on a public washroom that was refuge (in bad weather) for at least four unfortunate, homeless individuals. In good weather, they spent nights on the wooden walkway to the beach. While I sympathize with their plight - it set up a strange combination of resort versus homeless neighbors. Just what were we trying to accomplish - relaxation? or dealing with reality? In looking back on Trip Advisor comments (on return home), I noted that this situation was pointed out a couple of times back in 2009 - so its been going on for a while. So, it seems, it is a long-term issue there. I suppose the kicker for me was the nightly, late-night \"singing\" by our \"neighbors on the beach deck\". My young son joined us in bed having \"nightmares\". He said they were singing \"help me\". What do you say to that ? Other sounds along the walkway late at night were heard most nights.. So..... what should I say.? I'm not overly negative, just realistic.

We are not in the $380/night hotel crowd but this was worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime experience of hearing and seeing the surf outside our open balcony. The Capri condos next door is a much taller building and has huge search lights on its roof. It lights the white waves of the surf during the night so after dark, you can still see the waves rolling in. It was pretty incredible to fall asleep to the sounds and sights of the ocean. The room was sumptuous and we enjoyed it very much. This hotel is one of those places where you don't ever really see work being done but you know there must be many workers to keep it all so perfect all the time. This was our first exposure to extra fees for everything. Our \"extras\" bill was over $200, above our pre-paid room/taxes. That was just parking, internet and breakfasts, not even the mini bar or room service. Breakfast was posted as $9 but it had 2 kinds of fees/taxes added to that which made it $13. I'm sure those things don't matter to the money-is-no-object crowd. This location is second to none. The boardwalk is about 5 yards past the edge of our pool/breakfast area, and then the sand and water are just below that. We soaked up the ambiance of rollerbladers, yoga'ists, surfers and California culture. Things I found odd about our room: the shower had beautiful luxury glass doors, but were placed on a standard hotel tub, which meant you had to shower with your arms up to not bump into the (marble) walls or glass doors. It was very very clean, but I still think it's gross to rub against a shower wall.The water pressure was also nothing great. The bed frames were outrageously beautiful handcarved wood. The wierd part was that the rim part of the frame running around the mattresses was about 8 inches wide. Just swinging my legs down off the tall bed without thinking about it resulted in a number of good bruises. This was a bed where you had to calculate your strategy for reaching the floor. And they don't have any King beds, just queens. I'm sure this is every hotel's battle near salt water, but there were several bits where the drywall was crumbling or rusting metal showed through. Our balcony railings seemed painted not too long ago, but you could tell it was bubbly and rough from rust underneath.

We had a perfect view of the pool area and the ocean from our top floor, centre room suite. It was incredible falling asleep and waking up to the gentle sound of the Pacific Ocean right outside our large balcony window. In fact, the way the room and bed are positioned, we could actually watch the ocean as we lie in bed. It was far enough into the room, however, that there was no worry of anyone outside looking in. The spa tub in suite was huge and extremely comfortable, easily fitting my 6'2\" husband and my 5'2\" self with room to spare. The toiletries were nice and they provided toothbrushes and toothpaste in addition to the usual upscale soaps, hair products and lotions. Our toilet did stop working after one use, but after a quick call to the front desk, an \"Engineer\" came and fixed it within minutes. We were very impressed.

We had planned to stay in a partial ocean view room, but received a call from the hotel before the trip with an offer to upgrade to the Executive Suite. It was a little extra per night, but SOOO worth it. The room was incredibly spacious with 2 very comfortable queen beds, huge flat screen tv, dvd player, sound system, sofa, dining table and small kitchen area with a mini bar and fridge. We even commented that the suite was probably bigger than our small townhouse at home. There was also a spacious private balcony with a partial view of the ocean which was close enough to hear the waves crashing and watch the surfers. I highly recommend the 3rd floor rooms for best view and least street noise. The bathroom was beyond belief with a HUGE jacuzzi tub, walk-in shower, spacious closet, dressing and makeup area AND a TV!!! Watch a movie from the tub or while you're getting ready. An array of toiletries were provided including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath salts, shower gel, mouth wash, toothpaste and tooth brushes. The maid service was amazing; they respected our privacy and as soon as we left just for a short time, we came back to a made up room without ever seeing the staff responsible. The front desk and all other staff were all very helpful and accommodating. The heated pool and jacuzzi were very nice and the hotel location cannot be beat. It's just off the ocean and a very short walk to many restaurants, bars, nightlife, and shopping. As for the rates, they were pricey and parking is extra, but sometimes you get what you pay for and we left feeling like this stay was worth every penny.

There must just be something \"magical\" about Pacific Terrace. In our times, with everyones busy lives, for all of these happy guests to sit down and take the time to write multiple paragraphs praising this hotel must say something great about this jewel of a hotel. We are rate shoppers! Never once in negotiating our room rates, comparing with other hotels, etc., did the staff ever make us feel \"cheap\" or badly for trying to get the most room for the money- quite the opposite in fact. Paul, Danielle and Carli were all wonderful to deal with as we changed rooms (different views and sizes) three times before deciding on one! When we arrrived at 7:00 am (after a 6 hour drive from Phoenix) they took our number and promised to get the room ready early for us...they also recommended a restaurant up the street called Hennesseys. The concierge Katherine overheard us looking for a place to eat breakfast, called the restaurant and arranged for us to get a two for one breakfast:) Hennesseys also is a wonderful, casual place to eat- equally friendly and accomodating staff... low key though, so if you are looking for \"fancy\" this is not your place! Great food, great drinks- and a very lively football watching group was their clientele! So, true to their word, we got our room early... having booked a full ocean view and coming out to see palm trees blocking our view- we asked to switch rooms.... again- NO PROBLEM:) They rushed a bellman up to us- he helped us pack up the room we had just unpacked and they moved us down the hall- the whole time assuring us that the room we had was the only one with the palm tree \"blockage\" and not to feel badly about wanting to switch. We did this and got the most AMAZING view!!! After a long day of sun, drinking and eating, we decided to rent a movie on the PPV they offer at the hotel- being technologically challenged, we had to call down a few times to figure out how to get it to work- again- no problem... every request, small or large was met with a smile, and NO PROBLEM- that should be the theme for this hotel- WE HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AMAZING SERVICE AS IN THIS HOTEL! We have stayed in resorts in many cities- many of them more expensive and \"high end\" with less amenities, and certainly worse service. Its as though the entire staff goes to customer service seminars on a nightly basis to keep it so consistent:) One last thing we would like to point out, and yes we are going to mildy bash a couple of the other beachfront hotels here- Ocean Park Inn, Tower 23, Beach Cottages, Best Western Blue Sea Lodge..... We have stayed at these places. We have occasionally made reserverations and then called the cancel them... well, before staying this time at Pacific Terrace, we had also booked a room for $30 less at Ocean Park Inn. When we booked the room at Ocean Park I called Pacific Terrace to cancel- they didnt just say \"ok, heres your cancellation number\"- they asked why? And they asked if there was anything they could do so we didnt have to break the reservation....it worked! Even though Pac Terrace was higher by $30 a night, we stayed with them- number 1- because they made us feel that our visit mattered- number 2- they offered us a nice bottle of wine! So, I then called Ocean Park Inn to cancel and got \"heres your cancellation number\"- not even a why.... that kind of service with our kind of take on it could mean thousands of extra dollars a month for one hotel over the other! Our special thank yous to Katherine, Paul, Kyla, Carli, Danielle, Angela, Ted and the bellman- sorry guys we do not remember your names!

The only thing I'd nitpick -- and this is a function of staffing, not the individuals ... we found the pool beverage service to be a bit uneven, having to track down the person to order a drink once in a while. There is plenty of seating outside now for breakfast, and the food is excellent. I did the \"cook to order\" each morning and it was well prepared and fast. No restaurant on site is not an issue, as there are lots of places to eat very close, and room service is available. One comment on parking ... some have said to pass on the underground parking ($20 per day) and find a spot on the street. At least during the busy season forget it --- there is really no street parking close by. Try the first night in the garage, and then look yourself ... but the $20 is worth it.

The balconies were roomy enough for the four of us to have our pizza while taking in the view. The pool is not huge, but it's fine because the hotel is small. Everything is lit up at night, giving it a very warm, romantic feel even with the kids there. Amenities: Large towels are provided in your room when you arrive to use at the pool and/or beach.

Parking is $20, but it includes valet service. There are also computers with free internet access and printers for guest use. Service: The staff is what really pushes this hotel over the top. Everyone had a smile and a hello, and seemed eager to please. Check-in was a breeze, and the front desk was happy to provide info on food, shops, etc. Our room was made up each day while we were out, and the kids loved the chocolates with the turn-down service. The staff members were happy to take photos for us, and Danny the bellman was even able to give us some pointers on using our camera. Overall: Unbeatable, even though it is expensive. You often feel that four and five-star hotels try to nickel-and-dime you with extra charges, but the Pacific Terrace is just the opposite. All the included amenities and the great staff make worth every penny.

The location - gorgeous, funky, convenient, safe, walking distance to lots of things, and best of all...not downtown. The roar of the surf is part of the appeal, as well as the view and people watching. The hotel feels small and intimate - you recognize when there are new people at breakfast in the morning. We would get up before our kids, sneak out of the room and go have coffee and read the paper poolside while they slept - glorious. The hotel has quite an international feel of the clientele, and there are plenty of kids around. Another amazing thing - and even our kids kept commenting on it - was how nice everyone is. From the housekeeping staff that would run things to our room to the engineer that was fixing the pool heater at 10:00 at night and proudly said it would be ready for us in the morning, the staff was simply outstanding. And finally, I have one tip and a final compliment for the staff. We knew that we were going to go to the Wild Animal Park, Zoo and Sea World while we were there, but decided not to buy the 3-1 pass online because the hotel web site said they sold discounted tickets. As it turns out, they are unable to offer the same discount that you can get online due to restrictions from Sea World, so it ended up costing us more to buy at the hotel. It was MY mistake, as I didn't ask ahead of time where to purchase them. However, the hotel CREDITED ME the difference between what I would have paid online and what they can charge! I'm not kidding - these people are the best. So, buy your tickets online, but stay at the Pacific Terrace when you visit.

They were almost too generous with the towels and bath products! The resort is on the north end of a 3 1/2 mile boardwalk: if you get up before the crowds it's an awesome run. Definitely rent bicycles and pedal down to Mission Bay and through the lovely park. The boardwalk is mighty busy, but the hotel is a little off of where the action is so you wouldn't even realize how crazy busy Pacific Beach actually is while staying at the hotel: but just walk out the door and south one block and you're in the middle of it all! We enjoyed watching the surfers at all hours of the day from our balcony, and pool area was tropical and lovely. The concierge took care of every possible question and request we had. My husband and I felt perfectly comfortable on our own at the hotel, but it was filled with families who seemed to be having a great time as well. I didn't feel overrun by all the kids there, and our visit was still quite romantic. My only suggestion is try not to rent a room on the south side of the hotel - the balconies overlook the parking garage and a street that seemed very busy with early morning surfers: you might find that action disturbing. Spring for a room overlooking the pool. Although there was no restaurant on the premises, there are great places to eat steps from the door.

At first I thought it would be a drawback to have no restaurant on site, but there are many nearby, some that allowed us to charge back to our room, and room service from two restaurants only took 30 - 45 minutes to arrive. The staff was SUPERB. Ted wouldn't let us lift a finger with our luggage; when a light bulb burned out, I went out for a bit, and returned to find it fixed. If you don't want to bring your own laptop, there is a PC station on each floor. The only drawback was that the beds are high, but I did find a bed stepstool in the closet.

We settled on a corner room (but not a junior suite) with a view of the ocean and coastline as far as the eye could see. We spent much time on our terrace with books and afternoon cocktails. We had a decent continental breakfast included in our room rate -- additional items or a hot cooked breakfast could be added. Breakfast on the terrace was lovely but a bit chilly - a heater or two would have been nice. Pool was small but well kept and our kids really enjoyed it. Concierge service was superb - weather it was making dinner reservations (try JRDN for dinner), ordering take out for us or getting tickets to the zoo. My only minor complaint was the cost of parking - $20 per night.

Their intentions are the best but in my observation the hotel management seems to be absentee. When the rooms were redecorated 4-5 years ago they brought in horrible beds that have huge wooden frames. They were supposed to be luxurious -- but fail miserably. The beds are high and the wooden frames are very large and uncomfortable when one gets into and out of the bed. They probably cost the hotel a fortune (or maybe not-- perhaps the manufacturer realized their design flaws) but they seem as if they will be around for a while although they look dated now. (Management has even added a small set of steps to use to get into the bed--like the ones you see on TV for your dog) Large flat screen TV is supposed to compensate for the bed issues I imagine...

If you don't like the first room you are assigned, ask for another. Unless you want to keep tabs on children and the pool, I strongly advice a second or third floor for the view and the improved security (although the property is secure-- the open door to a private balcony is better than a room where people parade by and can look in..)

It's a smaller three story hotel overlooking Pacific Beach, separated from the beach by the popular 3 1/2 mile boardwalk. Our room was nice, decorated in a Caribbean/tropical theme. Nice limestone bathroom, separate sink area with a mini fridge. Everyone working there is super friendly and helpful. Complimentary continental breakfast included lots of choices: cereals, fruit, yogurt, bagels, pastries, coffee, juice. At breakfast you can also pay for a cooked meal, but lunch and dinner are not offered, nor is there a bar in the hotel. (Complimentary glass of wine delivered to your room on your first night, and of course, lots of watering holes nearby.) I think all the rooms have at least a partial ocean view, which is how our room (208) was listed, but I really couldn't have asked for more \"view.\" Our balcony was good sized, overlooking the ocean and the courtyard where the pool and hot tub are. Didn't make it for a workout in the fitness center which is a small room in the parking garage, but got plenty of exercise on the boardwalk and in the pool. The location is great, couldn't be closer to the water, and right on the city bus line. Lots of restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance. Loved Pizza Amore for salad and thin crust New York style pizza. Would not return to the Green Flash restaurant, and the restaurant JRDN (yes, that's spelled correctly) was too hip for us---think \"ultra lounge\" but the food was good (and pricey). I would definitely return, but probably only in winter. If you're a people-watcher you'll love the 24/7 walker-jogger-bike-rollerblade-segway-skateboard-dog-stroller traffic (got the picture?) on the boardwalk, but if you like your privacy you might find the constant parade a little intrusive. Even though the courtyard and pool area are walled and gated, a large part of the wall is glass so that you can see the ocean, but the boardwalk users can look into the courtyard and even into your room if you haven't closed your shutters. In January even during bad weather, the boardwalk was used pretty heavily and I'm sure it's crazy crowded in summer. But that's the urban beach scene and I don't fault the hotel itself for that.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't ask for more...can't wait to go back!!!\u201d", "Author": "SummitCo", "ReviewID": "UR54625413", "Content": "The Pacific Terrace is an out of this world hotel with an ideal location in one of the best cities for vacationing ever!.

They wrongly charged us for the mini-bar, but upon protest, they promptly corrected the error. Their hotel description didn't say anything about having to pay for wireless internet. Other amenities requiring surcharge was clearly listed. Wi-Fi was not listed among those for-fee amenities. However, I learned that they charge $10-$12 per day for Wi-Fi. They gave me the first day free. I didn't use Wi-Fi after the free day, since they had a desktop with printer for guests in the hallway near the front desk. They should clearly state about charging for Wi-Fi. BTW, I think all hotels should provide free Wi-Fi. Charging for it is like charging for cable TV channels. I rather have free Wi-Fi and for-fee cable channels. Cheap roadside motels like Best Western provides free Wi-Fi. What's up with upscale hotels charging for it? I parked on the street everyday. Never had problem finding a spot or safety. As people leave the beach in the evening, spots always opened up. Front desk people will tell you where you can park for free.

Sadly, because of failing health resulting from degenerative spine problems, we had to cancel several attempts to go this past year. She passed away in mid August. In memory of our mom, my sister, her husband and I, thought it would be nice to embrace her love of the ocean and spend Thanksgiving at Pacific Beach. The Pacific Terrace Hotel and the location is super! It is a charming elegant hotel. Instead of booking a room for my sister and her husband and a room for myself , we took the spacious \"master suite\" . If you view the video tour and click the master suite you can see how nice it is. I slept on the pull-out sofa bed- it has an inflatable mattress and they include an electric pump that's easy and fast to use. Let me tell you- it was soooo comfortable! As you can see in the video tour, there are two spacious balconies overlooking the ocean. You can really enjoy the relaxing sounds of the waves as you drift off to sleep. That's what's wrong with some of the mega resorts- your too far away from the beach that you can barely see or hear anything. The Pacific Terrace Hotel, their grounds as well as our suite were extremely clean, the staff is friendly and helpful and makes you feel welcomed. We had a nice light breakfast at the hotel and later a wonderful Thanksgiving buffet at World Famous, a restaurant on the beach only a short walk away. There are many other nice restaurants, all kinds of shopping, bars and taverns, and clubs within a short walking distance. Weather was in the mid to upper 70's. with just a slight breeze, lots of surfers and kite surfers, to keep you entertained. My sister and her husband who have traveled a lot were \"impressed\", as my sister likes to refer to places she likes a lot.

The hotel was so quiet, that our upstairs neighbours actually called to complain about our noise, lol (we are usually the ones calling to complain). We were on the balcony around 9pm the night we checked in and probably were a bit loud. Breakfast at the hotel is extremely reasonable and is served every morning. Housekeeping is timely and does a great job. All other staff are great and they met our every request and asked us lots before we had to if we needed anything. Only downside is the beach neighbourhood. The area is full of the stereotypical \"California beach bum\" type. Not necessarily a negative if that's what you are expecting. The boardwalk is very close to the rear of the hotel, but far enough that you don't get any noise from passers by. We slept with the balcony door open at night and felt completely safe.

Went to use a robe and untied it only to find a long black hair inside the robe. This robe was not tied as neatly as the other one so I suspect housekeeping replaced a \"used\" robe on the hook.

We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and its proximity to the ocean. The hotel is wonderful. All of the staff, from check-in, to the maid service, the bellhops, even the maintenance guys in the elevator were awesome and made us feel like special guests. Pros -Hotel is super clean, very nice overall -Rooms are awesome and decorated with real furniture not the normal cheap hotel stuff! -Nice pool with great bar service from very helpful staff -The view of the ocean is awesome. We had an Oceanfront King on the 2nd floor. I would try to get one of the end rooms that face the ocean when I return. All have awesome views but the hotel is sort of C shaped facing the ocean. The end rooms have the awesome view but don't have to overlook the pool. Either way, the view is awesome and will not disappoint. -Location is within walking distance to all sorts of original restaurants. Ask the front desk, they will guide you. Make sure you eat at Taco Surf, just 1 block away on the main road. Its a wonderful little dive Mexican restaurant. Very clean and delicious. The kids (ages 3 & 5) liked the pizza next door and I was able to bring it in to Taco Surf. Cons - these are nit picky but you cannot review all positives! -A little pricey. I booked on their website and chose the Internet prepay deal. The price ended up going down a bit, so I called and was upgraded. But, I would say the price is justified given the service, location, and cleanliness of this hotel. -Self parking is $20 per day. With the price of the rooms, this should be included. Good luck parking the car if you refuse to use their parking. -I called to ask if they were on the beach. I was told they are 15 steps from the beach. Not true, they are 15 feet from the beach, but if you took 15 steps towards the beach, you would fall down a 30 foot cliff. Now, however, they are on an awesome boardwalk and located between 2 sets of stairs to get to the beach. The stairs are probably 45 feet in either direction. We explored the area quite a bit, and we believe this is the nicest beachfront hotel in the area. There are so many nice touches, from the furniture, to the turn down service, to the printed information delivered to your room telling you what staff is available overnight even with their pictures, and just the overall great, secure feeling you have while staying here.

We had a so-so rate for the weekend and an ocean view suite. We anticipated the whole pool experience in the car going down from LA. When we got down there we were met by a half dozen youngish thugs with stretched ear lobe rings, full body tats and a few had that glazed look of \"where am I?\" on their faces. There were all guys except one girl who was in a bathing suit that was 3 sizes too small for her body. Not pretty for the family scene. They began to smoke and carry on. It's all good, believe me. I was a punk once too. But not for $400 thanks. The concierge and my wife had a mis communication about dinner reservations but it was finally worked out. We went to the trendy JRDN at the Tower 23 hotel a few blocks away. The babysitter that the hotel arranged was great btw. JRDN started off with a thud. There's lots to write here but I will leave it to Urbanspoon. Look for my review there. Just prepare yourself for lots of trendy but no substance. We inquired about the change in guest profile and were told they would \"ask them to calm down\" if need be. Ya.... no thanks. I don't need to be shot in the garage. These guys were about 5 or 6 to a room btw. I know that was not on the rules list. The free hot breakfast has been changed to a $7.50 hot breakfast with lots of $2.00 add ons. We opted for the free continental. It was fine. The supposed Starbucks coffee was weak. Go down the beach a bit and have a better coffee (and probably breakfast) at Konos. The beach here is not fluffy white but that is ok. If you are looking for Hawaii, San Diego ain't it. But all in all the hotel's location is prime. In fact, if they didn't have the location, they'd probably be out of business at this point. Upon check out the concierge (Katherine?) was very helpful and offered to do anything to make all the woes go away. She gave me free parking ($20) which I didn't ask for. It's funny. They always think it's about the money. It's not. Get rid of the party at the pool and I would have paid $500. The sad part was that she was so earnest in her effort to help, the other \"customer service\" agents at the desk (Matt and another gal) were making fun of her while I was being helped.

I have never been in a hotel (priced at this level) where there is no restaurant and no shop to buy basic requirements ie,bottled water, sun cream etc.The hotel itself is in need of a fresh coat of paint and quite shabby. The room service is provided by a couple of local restaurants and is expensive and there is a basic cable television service, any other channels eg Disney costs extra .There brochure mentions all day pool service but that is very rare (provided by a little bar which is rarely open)and again no food available. The fridge in the room is stocked with drinks (watch the dates on the beer) and snacks which are at their sell by date or just short of it! Also beware the bottle of Evian on the table beside the glasses, this costs a hefty $5.We were fortunate as the air conditioning was not required as I doubt you could have slept through the noise.There is little parking outside the hotel which forces you to stump up $20 per nite to park in the hotel's underground car park. No fault of the hotel however,the beach could have been better cared for as it didnt appear to have been cleaned in a long time and was covered in seaweed.A pleasant stroll along the boardwalk was marred by dodging numerous cyclists and joggers and lastly the whole area attracted homeless vagrants-a lot of whom appeared to sleep beside the restrooms located directly outside the hotel and on the benches on the boardwalk.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, amazing staff!\u201d", "Author": "marcosie", "ReviewID": "UR28399335", "Content": "My husband and I would come back to this spot any time!

Some of us got Jr Suites with nice views, I got a regular first floor room with a view of the ocean through the pool area. Which was blocked by the plants they have. They waived the parking fee for us in the garage because we stayed for 11 days. Granted I would have been reimbursed if they charged us anyways. The staff was very accomodating. I wanted a microwave in my room, and they brought one up to me. However the way they plugged it in, I kept killing the power strip it was plugged into. Which didn't help at 4 am when I was getting up. (Jet lag from East Coast) The staff would always recommend a good place to eat for me. both nearby and further away. They gave me directions to both Target and Walmart (I forgot to pack a swim suit). The TV was nice and big. Being able to listen to the ocean at night was a plus, expect on the weekends with kids who were there to party checked in, then I couldn't sleep well. The pool was very warm, which helped with the very cool breeze coming off the ocean. Ok now the negatives. I contacted the hotel before my trip to inquire about HSIA. They said it was wireless in the hotel, and there are no wired connections in the rooms. Ok fine, I took a wireless laptop with me. I decided not to bring DVD's with me (since I was traveling for such a long period of time), relying on my Netflix streaming account to watch movies online. BIG mistake!!! The conneciton signal in the room was a 3 bar, 4 if I was lucky. There are no Desk level electrical outlets, so you have to search for one for your computer. In this age of Internet access, I would expect a wireless signal of at least 4 to 5 anywhere in the hotel. Oh well. I meant to ask for turn down service at a different time, because when I got back from work, I would turn my own bed down. But the little chocolates they provided are nice. Thier breakfast was a JOKE. It was easier to make my own in my room (after I got the microwave). Of course we headed into work at 6am. so breakfast wasn't even being served yet.

All of the extra charges (parking, etc) made me feel like I was being nickel and dimed, and if I'd had to pay full price it wouldn't have been worth it. They did have a \"continental breakfast\" one morning - which was a danish and an orange juice - and $9 for an omelet and some sausage.

The hotel itself is perfectly situated on Mission Beach with most rooms offering terrific views of the ocean as well as the hotel's beautiful, warm and lighted pool surrounded by comfy lounge chairs (some under a shaded canopy that I certainly needed for my red head!) The grounds are beautiful and well kept up with maintenance people all over collecting towels and any litter that (rarely) seemed to find its way to the pool area. What I loved about the pool is that there was no smoking, no food and beverages (since the eating area patio was just steps away) and no music....Just peace and quiet. Even the very few children in the pool were quiet and well behaved. The tone was just automatically set to be this tranquil. We swam everyday despite SD having a record cold spell during our trip. When I asked the hotel desk to turn up the heat in the pool even more than the 80 degrees it was set at, they immediately complied and the next day, and for the rest of our trip, the pool was a haven away from the cold winds off the Pacific. Each room has a fantastic balcony where we had our breakfast delivered daily. To look at the beautiful ocean and that pristine beach over coffee every morning was the best way to start our day. There is also a walkway along the ocean path for bikes, rollerblades and the like, but we loved walking on this amazing beach best with its hard packed damp sand making it super easy to traverse. The rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable beds, lovely furnishings and lighting, new, clean carpeting, and plenty of space to stretch out. The staff, though, is what made this a special trip for us. We were treated with such cheerful smiles and genuine offers of help in every way by every staff member there. Lynette, Ted, and Cassie were especially helpful. Lynette brought us complimentary wine one evening for us to enjoy on our balcony and even remembered a treat for our 3 year-old son, Leo. The housekeeping staff, too, was exceptional, going out of their was to accommodate our changing needs daily. We loved them all! My partner didn't want me to even write this review for fear that the hotel will become too popular, but they really deserve kudos for their fine service and wonderful facilities. Even with the \"incident\" of a broken water main on our first night, leaving all of us with no showers for 36 hours, the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable and were profusely apologetic about the accident (which wasn't in any way their fault to begin with.) It was impossible to be angry about it with the entire staff scrambling to help us all out. I wouldn't necessarily go to San Diego again just for Sea World and the Zoo (the main reason we took our son) but knowing that we could stay at the Pacific Terrace again ensures that we will, in fact, be back.

We have two children ages 2.5 and 5 years so we stayed in a Family Suite (two rooms) the first two nights.

This room actually worked much better for us and we downgraded the rest of the trip to the Junior Suite from the Family Suite. We found we didn't need the bedroom closed off...the kids fell asleep easily after days at Legoland, Seaworld, Zoo etc. and then coming home and playing in the pool. The suite was well equipted and had a refrig, kitchen table, plates and utensils so we were able to eat fruit and cereal most days before heading out.

The BEST things, of course, are the location and the incredible view and sound of the Pacific Ocean. The facility is fabulous, and the staff bends over backwards to please their guests. They sincerely seemed to want to do whatever they could to make us happy. When we checked in on Sunday, 1/18, the consierge, Katherine, made us feel like we were the most important people in the hotel with her attention to detail, patience, and efficiency in meeting our requests. On the last day of our stay, the front desk gave me enough post cards so that I could give one to each of my students back home. Everything inbetween was exceptional, too. We were fortunate to stay off-season, when the room prices were discounted by 50%. So the price wasn't extremely expensive, just very expensive. Still, we felt that we got our money's worth and then some! We stayed in a 600-square-foot junior suite on the thrid floor with a full ocean view, a King bed, and a breakfast bar. Here are some tips that I don't recall reading in the other reviews: **We discovered that the view was even better when we took the tall breakfast stools out onto the balcony. Then we didn't have to look through the bars to see the ocean. **There is a silent but very effective ceiling fan in the bedroom area that helped to keep the air circulating. The temperature was perfect so we left the patio door open all day long. **The sliding shutter doors can be closed to give you absolute darkness & privacy, or can be moved completely out of the way to provide a totally unobstructed view out the patio door and windows. The shutters can be moved to allow just the amount of light or darkness desired. **Separate from the toilet & shower area, there is a large vanity area by the sink, with a giant mirror and a large plug-in makeup mirror. Lots of room to spread out. **The bed is extremely elevated, probably so you can still see the ocean while you're lying down. There are stairs provided in the closet that can be placed by the bed if you need help getting in and out of the bed! It is unbelievable comfortable, and we slept extremely well. **We slept best with the patio door shut tightly at night. It was very quiet, but you could still faintly hear the beating of the waves. **The $9 breakfast was actually about $27 for two people, when you add in the required gratuity, tax, and a tip for the server delivering it to our room. But it was large, hearty, and very tasty. Great to eat breakfast on the patio as we watched the ocean & the people passing by on the boardwalk! **We observed daily testing and/or cleaning of the pool and hot tub by pool professionals. My husband felt that the chemical balance and temperatures were perfect. **Even during the off season, the $20 per night for parking was well worth it. Easy in, easy out, safe, secure, and convenient. **The best part of the trip was our time at the hotel or on the beach. Why go anywhere else when you're in the perfect location with comfort and luxury all around you? During the day, the ocean, beach, boardwalk, and nearby shops and restaurants were all we needed. Watching the sun go down as we sat on our balcony was breathtaking every evening. After dark, the in-room movies were nice entertainment, for a fee of course. **We purchased pop & snacks at a nearby store to stock our refrigerator so we weren't tempted by the goodies in the mini-bar. In the Carribean Room, coffee & tea were always available, there was iced tea and lemonade in the afternoon, and freshly-baked cookies are at the front desk at 4:00 p.m. Yum! **Twice we ate at the Crab Catcher in La Jolla, about 20 minutes away by car, but you'll need good directions to get there. The hotel concierge can make the reservation and will get you great seating. Delicious food, beautifully presented. See if you can get Michelle to be your waitress -- she was delightful!

Dennys and iHop was close by so I didn't bother with the in house stuff, and just went to one of the many local restaurants nearby for breakfast. The $20 parking was a bit steep too, but with the limited on street parking, you'll probably want to pony up the $20 for it if you're going to be there during peak season. I was there during the winter, and parking was still a little scarce at times. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. They greeted me by name when they saw me which was actually quite surprising and a nice personal touch. They also offered to help with my bags which was also nice.

Good thing we weren't in a hurry to catch our plane... this alone would make it impossible for me to ever consider staying here on a business trip - Standard collection of all the usual hotel annoyances... cracked wine glasses, sinks that don't drain properly (and the SMELL when they don't...), only tolerably clean carpet, one of the phones didn't work, yada yada yada. - The pool is definitely on the small side, and some days it was a challenge getting a lounger. In the end, while we enjoyed our stay there, we wouldn't go back. Or at least if we did, we wouldn't stay in the family suite, which cost us over $600 per night. At $100 - $200 per night sure, I'll put up with the little stuff, its kind of expected. But for $600 a night the whole experience should be top notch from start to finish, not just parts of it. Frankly, take away the super nice furniture and TVs and basically the average Marriott Suites is going to give you virtually the exact same experience... at a third the price.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff,Wales", "Title": "\u201cA lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "welshbelle", "ReviewID": "UR19051746", "Content": "We stayed at the Pacific Terrace Hotel for one night last month before moving on to a rented house in La Jolla.

Not disappointed, but overall it is pricey for what you get. Pacific Beach area of San Diego is a laid-back and scenic extent of beach that doesn't suffer the pretentiousness of La Jolla, or the city feel of the San Diego centre. This is a small hotel with some great features, including: good breakfast included, great complimentary wines at 4pm daily, twice daily room service with turn-down service, sumptuous bath-robes provided in room, in-room fridge, huge TV, heated pool and plastic wind-barriers round the pool so even when a chill sea-breeze blows, it is hot sitting round the pool. Above all, it is located above a really attractive beach, and there is a great view of the sunset from the beach. However, parking is extra, a rollaway air-bed is extra, and the total cost is similar to a 5 star hotel, which is I think hard to justify. It is a compact hotel, and when busy, it can feel squashed with insufficient space around the pool..Hotel is in a \"V\" shape, with a south and a north wing. The South wing rooms get best views of ocean and sunset, and they get sun on the balcony, the north wing rooms don't, apart from the top floor. So ask to be in South wing if you like sun and sunsets, and north wing if you don't! Oh - really good Thai just around the corner, 5 mins away, cheap but really authentic taste.

It is also very easy to access any place you might be going in San Diego - downtown is only a 10-15 minute drive. The hotel is everything that the reviews claim. You will smile a lot,. and you will be surprised. For us the surprises included an enormous room with full kitchen, even though we apparently had the lowest priced room on the property - #126. The comfort level of our room brought to mind the luxury of the Hotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. The huge LG flat screen TV is worth the cost of admission! The free breakfast is so ample that we had little interest in lunch. The wine party at 4 PM is a riot - they serve decent wines, and the servers come by and refill your glass if they catch you not returning to the bar! It's a great way to start a fun evening, though it would probably work better at 5 rather than 4. The gated underground parking is well worth $20 a day since it takes one more worry off your mind. There were always open spaces. The staff at the hotel has a huge bias for yes...it seems as though they have figured out that if they just give guests whatever they ask for, life will be smooth.

When researching hotels in the area, I came across a couple of travel sites with old outdated pictures, when I went directly to the hotels site, I was surprised at how lovely the rooms were. I called the hotel to confirm, that the pictures on their site were current, and I was told that all the rooms have been completely remodeled. I booked a partial view double bed room for 159.00 plus tax (what a bargain) since the price for that class room is normally 440.00 The only downfall was no king bed. I requested for for a room on the 3rd floor, I was told that they couldn't guarantee it, but that he would note that I am requested a room on the 3rd floor. After reading several reviews, I had mixed feelings, but it was really the only beachfront hotel I could find in the 200.00 price range, that looked maintained. The staff was super friendly, attentive and professional. I have never been to a hotel that every class (bellboy, front desk, house keeping, cafe, security) of employee was kind, courteous and willing to bend over backward to accommodate your needs. This hotel is VERY customer service orientated. Upon check in, I asked if they could accommodate us with a king bed, mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary (really tried). Unfortunately they were unable to do so, since they were completely booked. They were able to accommodate my request for the 3rd floor, as the view is so much nicer. Some reviewers complaining about the 20.00 underground parking, but the peace of mind is worth it, very safe, key access only, and direct access from hotel elevator. The room decor was very inviting and up to date. Nice dark solid wood beds, granite counter tops, marble bathroom, huge plasma TV, ipod player clock radio, snack bar, coffee maker, iron, blow dryer, safe. The room was immaculate, and well stocked with towels, comfy bathrobes, bath goods even q-tips & cotton balls. The beds were very comfortable, pillows were fluffy, the sheets were high thread count and super soft. The balcony was spacious, with 4 chairs and a table. Our room was facing South toward the pier, and it was an amazing view. I could have sat on that balcony our whole visit just listening to the waves crash and people watched. There was a little parking lot below our balcony, that was normally occupied by surfers. I had a blast watching the surfers change in and out of wetsuits in the parking lot, lol. It was a little noisy at times (car alarms, beeping delivery trucks, ice cream truck) but I didn't mind, I liked all the action. I do have to say that there were quiet allot of homeless people in this area (most beach areas are this way), but I never felt unsafe or threatened in anyway as they just mind thier own business. Lots of restaurants, clubs and shopping on Garnet which is about a 3 block walk. This area is populated by allot of young college students, majority is 25 and under. There were a few nicer restaurants like Jordan at Tower 23 hotel which is 2-3 hotels down from PTH that had a more mature crowd 30 and over. It's definatley a lively happening area, which my husband and I enjoy. We live in Los Angeles so we are used to this type of atmosphere, it might be a little shocking to people who are not accustomed to this. Beach access is super close and easily accessed through the pool area which is accessed with your room key. We didn't use the pool/spa, but it looked really nice, heated, ton of towels and lounge chairs. I did notice allot of families on the lower level and pool are which is were the family suites are located. Which might be a little odd if you are there for a romantic getaway or honeymoon. Some little perks that make ALL the difference in feeling pampered........... Free iced tea, lemonade, Starbucks coffee (self serve) Basket of apples and fresh baked cookies in the lobby Free wine from 4-5PM in the cafe (self serve) Turn-down service, with Belgium chocolates on your pillow Basket of towels in front of every room in the morning Continental breakfast included I was expecting danishes, cereal and fruit, but the variety was impressive. 5-6 different types of pastries and muffins Bagels, croissants, english muffins (variety of cream cheeses, jams, peanut butter) Fresh fruit, variety of melons, oranges, apples, bananas Variety of hot and cold cereals Boiled eggs Yogurt Starbucks coffee, Tazo teas, Juices, milk The dining area seats about 15, but there are several tables right outside the cafe around the pool or you can get a tray and take your food to your room. If you really want to be pampered, for 12.00 you can put in a request the night before to have breakfast delivered to your room. I myself, got a tray and took it up to my room and enjoyed breakfast on the balcony watching the sun come up. This hotel went above and beyond my expectations, I will definatley be visiting PTH on a regular basis when I need to getaway with my hubby. Hopefully I can get a budget friendly rate again in the future, because $440 is a little steep. The only thing I disliked was the early check out time of 11:00am.

Hardwood furniture, big flatscreen tv's in both rooms of the suite, a view of the Pacific, heck we were right on the boardwalk. We were thrilled with the overall hotel and the room. Breakfast was a selection of bakery shop type rolls and danishes and granola with fresh fruit etc. No eggs or waffles, but It was high quality and was probably healthier too. We walked the beach each morning, but the water was too cold for a real swim, but my boy and I did jump in for the thrill. There were great eateries and shops within walking distance which we did use on two nights.

They give real voice calls for morning wake ups, and one morning the guy told me that he recalled that we were heading back to LA for our flight and he informed me that the interstate was closed.

The wash basin is in the room itself which isn't great. The toilet and shower over the bath (which again is like a motel bathroom) are off the room separately.

Breakfast is cereals, some bagels, bananas, apples and juice so don't get too excited. The pool is nice enough though smoking is allowed and with kids around, not brilliant. There is no pool service for drinks or food. There is some free wine for an hour in the afternoon but no great shakes. There is no restaurant - but there are restaurants locally who will deliver. There is free parking within walking distance of the hotel but it is limited - it's there though.

It hasn't had much competition in the past, but with hotels like Tower 23 springing up (2 minutes walk from the Pacific Terrace and better in almost every way) I hope they will have to reconsider their proposition. If you think you're going to get a great hotel because of the rate, you won't. But if you're happy with a good motel that has a pool and view and you think it's worth $350+ then book away !", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "tikisuz", "ReviewID": "UR15288230", "Content": "This was the most romantic place I've been in a long time.

Two years ago I thought that I had found a gem and was nervous to even tell friends as I wanted to keep the secret to myself. My last stay was a week ago and I booked a partial ocean view for two nights. I knew that the rooms are rarely ready before 4pm so did not bother checking in until my conference was over for the day. Upon check in I was shown where my room assignment was and asked if there were any other rooms (I knew this one was not optimal). The gentleman at the desk told me that they were entirely sold out - he assured me that I would like the room. Needless to say, the room was not acceptable. It was directly over the lobby of the hotel and essentially faced the street with a street light shining in to the room and cars parked behind it. When I called and said that this was not what I had expected - he asked in a snippy voice \"can you see the ocean?\" to which I replied \" not really, there is a light glaring into the room\". I told him that I would prefer to check out than stay in this room and then magically there was another room. Both days that I went to the pool there were no towels for the beach or for the pool (only a pile of used towels). In fact, I stood next to a soaking wet man in the lobby the second morning as there were no towels at the pool so he was going back to his room to dry off. The \"breakfast buffett\" is in a small room that feels rather dirty - you can get a tray and bring items to your room which I recommend. The rooms are still nice although do not feel quite as pristine and new as they did 1-1/2 years ago. I agree with the reviewer who stated that if you have a car, you are roped in to the $20 parking fee as there is sparse overnight parking around the hotel. I am not sure that I will stay here again - would probable consider renting a beachhouse if I needed to be by the ocean.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Pacific Terrace\u201d", "Author": "HJSDenver", "ReviewID": "UR15124775", "Content": "We loved the Pacific Terrace. It's a nice beach hotel with a great location. We could see the ocean from our room and patio. The hotel has easy access to the sand -- you go out through their keyed entry gate onto the boardwalk, and down a flight of stairs to Pacific Beach. The pool is small but fine. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. They sell tickets to area attractions at a small discount, and it was very helpful to have our SeaWorld tickets in advance so we didn't have to wait in lines. The complimentary breakfast was very good, with lots of healthy choices. There is a complimentary wine bar by the pool in the afternoons. We had a big group for a family reunion, including 3 kids under age 12, and everyone was happy. The hotel is expensive, but given the location, we did not feel it was overpriced. However, we would not recommend the \"Family Suite\". It has 2 queen beds and a sofa bed but only one bathroom, and the room layout felt cramped.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary after several years of marriage and were looking for something different and romantic as my wife would say. I am an appraiser by profession, so I may be a little more critical in my observations. If you like a noisy beach location then this is your place. The hotel is on the beach boardwalk and lies between two feeder streets that lead to the beach. It has underground parking which is another $20 for each night. Considering the amount of beach traffic you really have no other alternative, but to pay the extra $20 for parking so factor that into your costs. We asked for a partial ocean view to take advantage of the beach location and yet to be a little more economical then the very expensive beach front location, but one had to be on the balcony to see the partial view. What was really annoying is that you were directly facing one of the streets I refer to. If you don't mind being bothered at 6 AM by people arriving at the beach then your OK, but like us, we like the slider or window ajar to get fresh air during the night when sleeping. There is late and early traffic on the streets and since the hotel is only 3 stories high you are going to be relatively close to the noisy streets regardless of which floor you are on. We were on the 2nd floor. One noise that could have been avoided is the hotel Help early in the morning. I didn't understand a word they said, but all I know is that there was one hotel worker that appeared to be in charge of the others and she was doing a lot of yelling to her subordinates in the hallway. The doors were not well insulated and we did complain to the hotel about their Help being too loud in the early mornings. The rooms were appointed rather comfortably, however, the large frame beds did make it more difficult to enter the beds, especially if you have small children or older adults who will find it difficult to climb into and out of the beds. Even exiting the beds we were hitting our shins, because the frames came up so high from the floor. Like many hotels, these beds had colorful tropical bed spreads that I would never sit on or lay on and it is obvious these bed spreads are not washed on a daily basis like the sheets are changed. The floors seemed clean and they did provide new slippers, but the slippers were one size fits all and if you wear an 11 shoe like I do then forget it. The bathroom was OK. Only one sink and the water pressure was normal. The bath tub is enclosed with a double glass doors with seals at the bottom of the doors that did not seal and if you took a shower there was more than just a pool of standing water when you exited. We had to use several towels to soak up the water and we also reported this to the hotel, because we thought it would create mold and moisture problems in the walls. The room had other features, like a small refrigerator, microwave, a small wet bar and a big screen TV. There was a hair dryer, a lighted magnifying mirror and ironing equipment. They did provide terrycloth robes that were available for purchase. One feature they did have that was upscale and that my wife enjoyed was the Gilchrist and Soames body bath soaps and cremes. On the other hand, however, what may be a little embarrassing if you are sharing a room with non-intimate guest is using the bathroom. The bath fan was too small and inadequate to ventilate the bathroom odors that penetrated to the entire room immediately. This is a design flaw in the original construction. There is no restaurant in the building, but they do provide a continental breakfast from 6:30 to 10:00 AM. in the exit room to the pool area. There is also Starbucks coffee provided all day that were in dispensors near the pool area. One evening they did have some complimentary inexpensive wines available for tasting in the late afternoon near the pool/patio area. There is a considerable amount of local shopping stores and small fast food local-owned and chain restaurants , but if you want any real fine dining you will need a vehicle to travel up to La Jolla, which is the adjacent city, which is approximately 5 miles north. Our partial ocean view room was $330 and tax was $41.25, parking $20 for a total of $391.25 per night.

It is one of the nicest rooms I've had in a hotel. I don't know what he paid for the room, but he's a great guy. He reserved us one of the King-suite ocean front rooms. It was pretty much in the center of the hotel (kind of shaped like a horseshoe a bit) and I think we had room 316. The balcony was nice sized and felt fairly private even though it overlooked the pool and deck, which is just off the main beach path running throughout PB. We slept with the door wide open at night to the sound of the crashing waves of the ocean. But, it also came with a price. Staff moving deck chairs around in the morning (6 am?) by the pool dragging the metal legs along the concrete as well as a bunch of Marines on their early morning and loud cadence jog. But, did i mention the waves? ;-) The room had gorgeous furniture (a REAL entertainment unit) a huge wide screen LG HD TV, a comfortable bed, enough tables and sitting areas to be comfortable, and lovely decor. The room is decorated throughout with dark wood working such as the crown molding and plantation shutters covering the slider door (no cheesy curtains!). It's very warm, relaxing, and tropical feeling and was reminiscent of a model home in a new housing community. The bathroom consisted of a large wide area near the door with the closet and a nice sink and countertop. One of my few complaints was the screw for the hot water knob was stripped and kept falling off it's base knob. The toliet and tub/shower are in a closed room. The main room had a huge granite counter/bar near the small kitchen area (honor bar, small fridge, microwave). We didn't need any of that (except for the $6 Amstels). Everything was clean, new, and seemed recently painted. My only major complaints are with the towels, they were not that plush or high-end comparing it to the rest of the room's offerings. Robes were provided, though. Also, the pillows on the bed were not that nice (we grabbed two more from the closet). They could use some plusher, down or feather nicer pillows. -The staff are super friendly. -You have to pay for parking in their private garage underneath the building. -We ordered room service which comes from one of two off-site local restaurants (Hennesey's was one). The food was just ok and not that worthy at all of being 5 star (like typical bar food). Too bad they don't have a better restaurant/room service on site. -Location is great, near lots of restaurants, the beach, convenience stores, etc. Though I've never stayed in PB during the high season, it was nice there mid-week in March. Read my other reviews; i'm stingy with the \"5 stars\". I think this place is really 4.5 on my typical scale, but I'll bump it up to 5.

I traveled with my husband and 6 year old, we've stayed in plenty of nice and not-so-nice hotels and we were so thankful that we chose the Pacific Terrace. With the numerous online searches available I had originally scoped out a different hotel in SanDiego that we thought would meet our needs, but after reading trip advisor decided that there were too many reviews regarding uncleanliness of rooms and uncomfortable beds, which I will add are my #1 and #2 requirements when choosing a hotel for family travel, (when traveling for relaxation with family it's just not worth it to be uncomfortable). This hotel was very clean, very comfortable (including the beds), and quite peaceful. The friendly staff always greeted us with a smile and a friendly comment when we exited and entered, I think they really like their jobs. One surprise was the exercise room. When hotel staff mentioned that I had to go through the underground parking lot to get to the exercise facility I was haunted by thoughts of a dingy old room with rusty equipment...to my sincere pleasure it was the exact opposite and absolutely perfect. It has new, clean, well maintained equipment, 3 TV's, free weights and machines - it is a small room but has everything you need for a vacation work out, even a scale & restroom with shower. The breakfast (with plenty of healthy choices) and wine reception are a great way to start and end a relaxing day. Don't worry about no shuttle and don't bother with the \"hotel' driver. [I was concerned about whether to rent a car or choose a hotel with the optional shuttles available (hotel shuttle was originally was my # 3 hotel requirement for this family vacation) - but I am happy we chose to rent a car and I recommend it merely because SanDiego is pretty easy to get around and most importantly for the freedom to explore what you want when you want... also renting the booster for our child with the car rental avoided putting him in taxis or vans with inappropriate or no seatbelt. We did the usual SanDiego stuff - the Zoos, SeaWorld, the beach,... but we passionately enjoyed our family vacation when we ventured off the beaten path, for example we visited the beautiful Torrey Pines area and toured a few of the nearby vineyards, which included a fun educational opportunity and often wine tasting's for the adults.] The hotel is surrounded by many types of food and restaurant choices, the room service is a nice option, but we had a great time going for walks (or driving around in our rental car) to explore the area while choosing our next meal. - Konos, Gringos, many Thai, and Japanese options to name a few of our favorites. It was assuring to find that the photos shown on the hotel website are true representations of the rooms and the hotel. Because we vacationed during the off-season we were able to experience this hotel at a reasonable rate, which was much appreciated!

The reviews were factual and I loved my stay at this hotel. It was perfect for all of my/our needs. The location is great as it is situated on the Pacific Beach boardwalk. The hotel pool overlooks the Pacific Ocean and you can listen to the sounds of the ocean as you drift to sleep at night and at sunrise you can enjoy the view as well as the surfers. Picture perfect! The hotel is a small boutique hotel with a friendly and helpful staff. It does not have a restaurant on site but there are many casual and more upscale dining within walking distance of the hotel. A short walk (1-2 blocks) on the boardwalk will take you to the surfer community of Pacific Beach with all the restaurants and shops. The hotel offers a free morning breakfast in the breakfast room. It was nice and everyone seemed to enjoy it. If you want a hot breakfast then you can order room service or walk to nearby breakfast restaurants as there are several options. The rooms are clean, well taken care of and the furniture, wall hangings, plantation shutters and other extras make your stay at The Pacific Terrace one to remember. Throughout the day the hotel staff sets out for the guests (without charge) iced tea, lemonade, cold water, hot water, teas, coffees, fruit and cookies. Also, a wine reception at 4:00 and on Friday cheese and crackers. There is a small gift shop, small gym, concierge service and each floor has a computer so that the guests may check e-mails or print boarding passes. For a fee you may park underground of the hotel, park free on the street or you can catch a bus (1 block) or take a bus to a Trolley station. The location is near downtown, Gaslight Distrist, Old Town and La Jolla. The twice daily maid service, nightly turn down service with chocolates, fresh towels waiting outside your door in a basket, terry white robes, pool towels, and other extras makes me want to return to this hotel when I am in the San Diego area again.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel!

I am a perpetual complainer and even I have to zip my lip on this one! The staff are great, the rooms are great. The continental breakfast is great, the pool is great. The location is outstanding. Other things to mention. They have a small work out room in the garage. It has a treadmill, elyptical and weights. All new with 3 flat screen TV's. Small but adequate. The hotel is situated on a bike path. Bring your bike, roller blades or jog. It is wonderful. Lots of bike rental places around. $10 for the day. Good restaurants to walk to (3-6 blocks). We loved Karinya Thai [-]. We sat on pillows on the floor. Great food and fun for the kid. Lots of options to eat on Garnet Ave. Sushi, Fatburger, Denny's, Japanese. Lots of Mexican food places on every corner. Parking off season is easy. There is plenty of free street parking. I assume during the Summer you will need to shell out $20 per day to park in the underground hotel lot. The 4-5pm wine and cookies are great. The heated pool is great even in the middle of the Winter. The beach location is the best in San Diego. The Jr Suite room has a fridge, coffee maker and microwave. Dishes, glasses and silverware too. Trader Joes is a few blocks away. Ralph's Supermarket is also a few blocks away. You can pick up tons of yummy frozen goodies and nuke them as needed. I booked directly through the hotel and obtained a $149 garden view per night rate. I showed them proof of a free oceanview upgrade from another website and they honored it.

On the positive side: 1. The customer service could not have been much nicer. Everyone was warm and friendly from the maids to the check in desk. VERY warm. Even the maintenance folks were very nice and went out of their way for us. 2. The pool is delightful. Small, but very warm. So easy to get into it. A good hot water shower is located poolside so if you are coming in from the beach you can rinse of thoroughly before going in the pool or into the hotel. There are nice fluffy chair covers and plenty of towels. The pool is basically oceanside although a wall is there to assure privacy. 3. The hotel is very clean. Maids come right away when you leave your room and do a very fine job of cleaning everything. Turndown service is nice with chocolates! 4. The location is great in that you are steps from the beach, close to many bars and restaurants - - all in walking distance. And you are ON the beach. The oceanfront room we stayed in had excellent views and a nice sized balcony with two chairs and a table. 5. Fantastic plasma television! Have never seen better in a hotel. On the negative side: 1. This particular area of San Diego could be described as having \"local color\". There's a good number of beach bums, BMX bikers, lots of body art and piercings, etc. We were asked by a few people to give them our doggie bags from the restaurants, but no one actually out and out begged for money. I never felt unsafe at any time. But I can see how this might bother some folks . . . 2. There were some maintenance issues during our stay. Our bathtub was leaking water into the room below. Unfortunately, they decided to fix this issue at the exact time we were returning from the beach and wanted to take showers. I was annoyed to be honest, but the chief engineer was very, very apologetic. He actually came down to get us at the pool when he was done with his work. They really could not have handled it any better than they did. We also had A/C issues. Everyday, the AC turned off on its own, and an engineer needed to come turn it on. A bit annoying, but it always ended up working. 3. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant or poolside bar service. Frankly, I think this was its biggest flaw. They provide room service through two local restaurants - - Chilis and a sort of sports bar. The sports bar does have good food, but I like to just be able to grab something spur of the moment and there's no way to do that. The hotel provides breakfast which I'd describe as very fair. If you just like cereal, milk, and a banana - - you are all set. They provide tons of pasteries that are totally nothing special. Their bagels are pretty much awful - - I'd give them a 3 on a 1 to 10 scale. The English Muffins are Thomas' and are fine. But the worst part is that the layout makes NO SENSE. The toasters are blocking access to the fruit bowls, and everyone is standing waiting for these very slow toasters to deliver the goods and meanwhile blocking others from getting their food. When you eat breakfast, I highly suggest bringing your food outside - - it's much more comfortable and pleasant there. There is also free wine from 4-5 which is a lovely touch, but it would be great to be able to buy a drink to have by the pool at other times of the day. 4. If you are going for the beach, the beach is good, but not fabulous. There's tons of seaweed actually on it (not in the water though). It's long and good for running. It has good waves for boogie boarding and surfing. The water (being the Pacific) was cold, but totally bearable. All in all, we liked it a did our kids. 5. The parking garage is a tight both in terms of space and the number of cars it can handle. We rented a GMC Acadia - - any bigger than that and you'd be seriously struggling to park. 6. The beds have great linens, but somehow weren't super comfortable. A bit too firm for my taste. If you like firm, you'd be very happy. The overall feeling is nice as the linens are high quality.

I had booked the hotel as the reviews were positive and it described itself as luxury. We were disappointed as it is certainly not luxury. On the positive side the staff were friendly and helpful and the location in terms of access to a wonderful beach great. However, there were a number of factors that seriously detract from the experience. Probably the major one is the very poor \u2018Continental\u2019 breakfast. It is described in their in-room video as Gourmet; it certainly was not. A luxury hotel does not serve up a selection of pastries and packets of cereals in a school tuck-shop setting using cheap plastic cups and plates, surrounded by flies and expect to call that a luxurious experience. The lack of dining facilities, or indeed what appeared to be any form of cooking facilities, meant that we dined out each evening. The local area is really geared toward the younger generation, i.e. teens/early twenties and not forty-two with a wife and two children. Hence, the dining alternatives tended to be Grilles attached to Bars and were not really suitable for a family. Note that the area was not threatening, it\u2019s just that the options were not really places you would take your family. The next aspect was the bathroom. In fact the shower (above a small bath) and toilet were in an en-suite that is best described as being close to a downstairs utility room. It was not a luxurious bathing experience. I have noticed in the photos posted by other reviewers that other bathrooms looked larger. We stayed in a Partial Ocean View room; maybe other types of rooms are better. We also had problems with our air conditioning, it worked very rarely and the room window could not be locked. Also, the in-room safe was small, so that you couldn\u2019t fit in anything bigger than a mid-sized camera. Although the furniture was OK, the general appearance of the hotel was of being in need of a renovation, for example, the carpets were dated and the balcony floor covering was pealing. We didn\u2019t use the pool, as we preferred the beach. However, it did not look particularly inviting and there was no pool-side bar, as far as I could gather. Would I stay there again. Probably not.

I'm under 40 so I'm in no way a prude, but the area consisted mostly of young surfers, people with multiple tattoos, etc. One set of washer/dryers were not in working order and the front desk didn't have quarters readily available for those wanting to do laundry (they did quickly run out and pick some up); room service (which is ordered from two local restaurants) left off one of our children's meals. The staff did offer to go back and get it, but 30-40 minutes with hungry child was not worth it so we just shared our meal with him. We also asked to checkout one day early but were told we'd be charged the full rate ($400+) anyway so we stayed.

On the positive side, each room did have a small refrigerator, microwave and hairdryer, and proximity to beach was nice.

The large, well-appointed rooms offer comfort and either indirect or direct ocean views. The location is close to Sea World and sits along the Mission Blvd. strip of restaurants, shops, and bars. The strong point of this property is the rooms. They are spacious, comfortable, and well-maintained. Our room, number 317, was a \u201cpremium ocean view junior suite\u201d that featured a wonderful ocean view. It is a one-room suite with dimensions of about 17x35 feet, excluding the dressing and bath area. We enjoyed leaving the balcony\u2019s glass sliding door open at night, since the hotel is close enough to the beach to allow the sound of surf to lull us to sleep. We were able to close the screen door to exclude insects and adjust the wooden louver doors for privacy without losing the ocean\u2019s soothing sound. The room was furnished in heavier, higher-quality furniture. The room was available with either two queens or a king with sofa bed. Accompanied by two children, we chose the two queens, which were massive; the mattresses were boxed in by a wide wooden frame, so that one would occasionally bump it when moving in or out of the bed. The beds faced a modular shelving unit that contained a 42\u201d flat-screen HDTV, drawer space, and lighted shelves with inexpensive sculptures, etc. There was a two-chair seating group near the balcony door, a desk, and a table with four chairs. All were appointed with nice coverings in bold colors, and nothing seemed worn or dirty. At the table end of the room, there was a kitchenette with sink, microwave, undercounter refrigerator, and dinnerware. There was also a locked, second refrigerator stocked as a mini-bar. We never used the facilities to prepare meals, because of the abundance of restaurants within easy walking distance. Several restaurants allow your meal to be charged back to the hotel, and two restaurants will deliver to your room with a small service charge, again billed to your account. We tried that the first night we arrived, and the food was delivered by hotel staff, warm, within about 45 minutes. The bathroom area was more modest, although the hotel offers more bathroom features in an \u201cexecutive suite\u201d category that was sold out when we reserved. The sink in our room was in a separate dressing area with a closet and vanity with generous marble counter space. The toilet and shower were very average, located in a small room off the dressing area. The toiletries were \u201cGilcrest and Soams\u201d, which I believe to be a European hotel supplier\u2019s brand. The room rate includes a cold continental breakfast and late-afternoon happy hour. We did partake in breakfast every morning, with a selection of bagels, rolls, cereals, yoghurt, and fruit. There would also be two juices available. After a few days, the limited selection became somewhat tedious. The hotel has no restaurant other than the breakfast room. Breakfast could be eaten inside or out. The San Diego climate made breakfast by the pool very enjoyable. In late June, the mornings would be quite crisp, limiting ocean bathing, but enhancing lounging around the pool. The modest pool was heated and had an adjacent whirlpool tub. During our stay, it was never crowded. We never made it to the happy hour. It was held only from 4-5 p.m., and we would always be away from the hotel. Parking was available under the hotel for $18 per day. The garage is accessed through a gate controlled by the room key card, and there are elevators at each end that rise upward to the lobby and the rooms. There are a limited number of free spaces adjacent to the hotel, but they often were unavailable. Especially if you plan to be coming and going in your vehicle, the underground parking is a good investment, and can be decided upon at arrival. There is a tiny gift shop off the lobby, and the front desk can provide tickets to local attractions at a small (typically $2 per person) discount. The hotel straddles the beachfront promenade, which is itself atop a 20-foot cliff above the beach and the Pacific Ocean, both reached by nearby stairs. Although there is a comfortable expanse of sand, the beach experience was marred by tons of seaweed and dead marine life, at least during our visit. There were very few seashells along the beach, disappointing our 7 and 9 year old girls, but they enjoyed watching the surfers in the water next to the pier, just south of the hotel. By the time we left, the younger announced that she wanted surfing lessons. From the hotel, it is a ten-minute drive south to Sea World, and fifteen minutes to the Old Town area. The strip of restaurants and bars surrounding the hotel stays active until late, and drew some who seemed potentially problematic. Although not a major issue, there is a slight risk of encountering boisterous or confrontational conduct later in the evening. We stayed at a peak time, so the rates were high (over $500/night for our room, taxes and parking, even with an AAA discount) and the value was acceptable, but not great. We were not upgraded as others have reported, possibly because the property was busy. However, we recommend this hotel, primarily based its oceanfront location and the room features. It does not have elaborate public areas or a huge pool area, and the limited staff provided adequate, but not instant, service. Because the hotel is not large, there is no hustle-bustle, which we appreciated.

We have stayed in San Diego twice before, once at the Welk Estates in Escondito (love it, but only if you're staying for a week or so) and at the Bahia Resort Hotel at Mission Beach - before the reno's. I really wanted to stay here but the price US$450 scared the bejeezers out of me. This trip I was on business and could write off our hotel stay so I jumped at the opportunity. I read lots of reviews that complimented the hotel and since it's #1 in San Diego how could we go wrong. Just after I booked I read the latest review about the area being a dump and I got scared... however there was no going back... We arrived on July 6th at about 4pm... check in was quick and fast thanks to Humberto (Tito), they have parking underneath the hotel for $18 a night which was great because then it's a quick elevator ride to your hotel room. We stayed in a oceanview room on the second floor middle of the hotel. The room was huge, beautifully appointed and comfortable. The balcony was great with an amazing view. The beds are about four and a half feet high with a little step stool to climb up... There is a bar fridge and a mini bar. Never tried the internet but apparently there is wireless... We got changed quickly and ran for the pool (we had just driven up from Ensenada). There was free wine hour from 4 to 5 and lemonade for the kids. The wine was excellent, white, red and blush and the service was great. We had a quick glass on the patio and then changed over to plastic glasses and went for a dip. The pool isn't huge but is adequate for the most part, only occasionally crowded. The hot tub was great and the view of the surfers was fun to watch. The area around the hotel is funky and fun. We walked all over... ate at World Famous the first night and Gringo's the second night. I lost my nose ring and bought one around the corner at the tatoo parlour. We felt completely safe and happy in the area and after eating dinner at World Famous walked back along the beach skipping the surf with the kids at 11pm a night. There were a few homeless people sipping beers, etc. but no one was violent or scary. The beach is beautiful and clean and we met lots of the vendors along the way in their little shops who were so nice and helpful. We ate breakfast at The Broken Yolk on Garnet both mornings... mmm best omelets ever!! Dinner at World Famous was ok, the appy's were great but the main courses were hit and miss, the prime rib was good, the steak not all that interesting. Dinner at Gringo's was ok too.. the appy's were fabulous, however the traditional Mexican food we ordered was not our favorite and we wish we had ordered fajita's instead. At about 11pm on Saturday night there was a little yahoo going on in the pool, it lasted about 15 minutes before hotel staff cleared them out without incident, however it was very loud for a few minutes. We had a problem with dripping water over our vanity. I called the front desk and they sent the repair man, who looked at it and told me he would resolve it while we were out. When we came back it seemed to have be fixed, however overnight the drip came back and our whole vanity was flooded including all our bathroom stuff, it was a big mess. I complained when we checked out and they comp'd our parking so $36 credit, which was nice. So here's our list of pros: - amazing location, fun, hip and interesting - beautiful hotel - fabulous service - great pool area, fun to hang out at - wonderful sandy beach - entertaining watching the surfers - fun boardwalk to walk along - comfy beds/linens - tv was huge and lots of options - small bar fridge (good for leftovers and cold drinks, etc.) - lots of good restaurants/shopping near by (walking distance) List of cons: - very expensive - have to pay for parking - noisy - we didn't mind at all (in fact we like it) but if you're looking for peace and quiet you probably won't find it here between the surf crashing and the people around the pool We never even went into San Diego proper this trip, we loved the Pacific Beach area so much... we visited Sea World on Saturday and that was excellent, however it's a two day excursion with little people and we didn't get to see everything in one day...

The hotel said they had restaurants that you could sign a tab and they would bill the hotel, so that you did not have to carry your wallet around at night, this seems to me its because the area is so dreadful.

Also, it was a great place to sit and drink free wine/lemonade while the sunset. Nice for eating breakfast and even dinner. One night we brought home a pizza from a joint just down the street and ate it on the patio. The staff was amazing. The free breakfast was really good.

We stayed 2 nights at Loew's Coronado Bay Resort (loved it!) then drove here for 2 nights because I wanted to have a room right on the beach to actually hear ocean waves crashing against the shoreline (you won't get this on any of the bays, artificial beaches or marinas in the area). What a culture shock leaving lovely, serene and secluded Coronado to drive through this overcrowded, busy, dumpy neighborhood lined filled with low rent apartments and 1 star motels. The only other decent hotels I noticed in the immediate area were Tower 23 and the Crystal Pier cottages which despite my dislike for the location I may try out someday just because they are so unique. THE ROOM: we got a premium ocean view suite on the 2nd floor. It was an outstanding, clean beautifully furnished room complete with sink, refrigerator, microwave oven, huge flat screen, dock for your MP3 player on the clock radio. The beds were cozy. But I don't like comforters and throw pillows (they are pretty but how sanitary are they?). My first morning of enjoying the ocean waves was interrupted too early in the morning by loud children playing near the pool area or one of the nearby balconies. THE HOTEL: staff was friendly but not extraordinary. I'd question their recommendations for dining. Two of the staff members highly recommended a place called The World Famous. What a dud recommendation. We drove to the place, could not find parking space anywhere within a few blocks so we drove up to the valet booth where we got ignored. I went inside to the hostess who told me there was a 45 minute wait. I scanned the place and it too looked like a dump. I guess the view is what attracts people to that dumpy restaurant. We drove off to Nick's around the corner and got immediate seating which was alright but not as good as the one in Maui. Our 2nd night I was much more clear with the concierge when I told her I wanted an elegant restaurant with a view in La Jolla. She recommended \"Azul\" which we LOVED and I highly recommend for amazing views, romantic and calm atmosphere and fantastic gourmet dinners and desserts. The continental breakfast was a plus even though our first day we walked to Hennessey's Pub for a good breakfast. The hotel staff had laid out a nice spread of pastries, bagels and cream cheese, yogurt, juices, etc. THE BEACH: fabulous! The walking path just beyond the pool area has nice views of the beach, there's a separate bike path too. THE LOCATION: on the plus side there are a lot of restaurants, cafe's and pubs/bars within walking distance which is great if you don't want to drive anywhere. But what a huge step down from Coronado and La Jolla this area of Pacific Beach is. I think it's because it's a very old neighborhood. If you're in your 20's or if you love to surf you'd probably love this area. The surfers are plentiful on this beach very early in the morning. Although it's a nice well maintained hotel with good staffpeople I probably would not stay anywhere in Pacific Beach again (except for maybe Crystal Pier cottages).

The hotel told us the checkin was at 4pm. We got there at 1130am from Anaheim (oops! wanted to get out of there alive- ha ha) and decided to at least advise the hotel were we there. The were WONDERFUL! They prechecked us in, gave us a garage key and told us we were welcome to use the pool and facilities all day. Then they advised us that they upgraded us to a premium ocean view from a partial ocean view! They then asked for my cell number and told me he would call me as soon as my room was ready and they did. When we got to our room, it was amazing! Plasma tv, fridge, nice bathroom, remote control fan, oversized comfy beds, IPOD docking station clock and a huge patio with table/chairs and a big seashell. The kids were so excited and my husband was surprised at how nice the hotel was for the price we paid ($199/night). The wine reception (4-5pm)was great and the staff was so helpful and got towels for the kids and offered to go get them fresh cookies in the lobby. They have apples and cookies at 4pm in the lobby and all day they have tea/lemonade and coffee in a room by the pool. While sitting by the warm pool we met several guests who have stayed there for years and called it a \"secret gem\". The ocean was so close and great for the kids. They had a warm shower to use before going back to the pool. The towels were fluffy and warm and they even offered poolside massages (not sure price). There were some women there for a girls weekend and they were lined up and ready to get a massage in the tent. A lot of people walk around in the white robes they provide in the room. The breakfast was great too and they even have highchairs. The staff was so helpful and nice. We ate outside and could see the ocean while eating. The only negative is the noise on the boardwalk if you sleep with your patio door open so we left it open half the night and then closed it when the surfers came at 5am. The AC worked great and drowned out the noise. They also have a computer for anyone to use in the hallway so we got to check our email daily which was nice. They offer a few restaurants for room service but it is pricey so we went down the boardwalk to the Green Flash and ate outside with an ocean view (it was delicious!). Also, the Ralphs grocery store is in walking distance so you can get some snacks/ beverages for your room. We DID NOT use our car the entire time we were there. Everything is close and easy to walk to! Our 4 yr old begged to go back to the hotel room because he liked it so much. We all loved it and ALL slept so well. The beds are great. The TV was great. My kids accidentally watched a pay per view movie for 3 minutes but the hotel removed that charge at checkout. The movies are only 9.99 though which is reasonable for a hotel. Our stay was so relaxing and positive. We will be back every year for now on!! We LOVE the Pacific Terrace and finally found a tradition for our little family.

I felt very safe on the Hotel grounds and on the beach during the day. I do not think I would want to go out there at night, though.

Plus, the ocean view is better from the ground floor as you can actually see it from your room versus going out onto the balcony since you aren't above it only seeing sky. The bed was SO comfy. Really fantastic. The other guests that stay here are always so nice. We buddied up with another family and my kids went swimming every night with their new friends.

On our last night, we tried to use the hotel computer to print boarding passes, but the printer wasn't working. The front desk person tried to fix the printer, with no luck. She immediately offered to check me in for my flight and print my boarding passess. I don't know about you, but there are times when I've run out of towels and called housekeeping to bring a few more the next morning. Every morning there was a basket of towels placed outside of our door just in case we needed some. We did have a problem with our AC functioning intermittenly. It wasn't a big deal because the outside temperature was mild. We came back to the room in the evening to find a cute hammer made of chocolate with a note from the maintenance person thank us for our patience while they fixed the AC. There will always be issues with rooms - but what matters most is how the hotel staff approaches it. In this case, they did a wonderful job. I personally loved the area that the hotel is located in. It's very low key and relaxing. Lots of local restaurants. The room was incredibly comfortable. A couple of nights we sank into the comfy bed with our down pillows and watched movies on the plasma TV, with the sliding door open so we could hear the ocean.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salado, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThank you trip advisors for the recommendation\u201d", "Author": "SuccessJoy", "ReviewID": "UR6811955", "Content": "I just checked out this morning from a 3 day holiday weekend stay.

Pulaski furniture you'd want in your home, quiet rooms and friendly staff set this hotel apart. There are only 73 rooms but at least that many staff members to provide what ever you need. Yet, the atmosphere is tranquil. And when you step out onto your balcony and see the beauty of the ocean's crashing waves and the setting sun--breathtaking! VALUE: We booked through Expedia and got a great deal on a flight, hotel package. We didn't book a room with a view, but when we arrived they \"upgraded\" us to a Junior Suite with a view. We took a chance here because there are a few rooms that don't have views of the ocean. Our view was partial. But even what we could see of the ocean was gorgeous. Subtracting the price of our flights, we paid about $175 a night and it was worth it. The Junior Suite was a king sized bed, a sitting area and a kitchenette with a bar that seated four. LUXURY: Travertine tile, wood molding and granite was not just in the lobby but also in the kitchenette and bathroom of the Jr. Suite. The widescreen LCD TV was sharp. It was housed in an entertainment center with display cabinets. The waffle weave bathrobes were heavy. Each night, the turn down service left chocolates in a velvet bag or a small box like Godiva's. They cleaned the room morning and evening. Even the balcony was spotless. Each morning there was a basket outside your room with extra towels, if you needed them, and the local paper. The continental breakfast each morning (pastries, juices, coffee, milk, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.) and the wine reception each evening were complementary. The bath soap was shaped like a sea shell. The shower head was a massager. The sink soap was large. The soaps and lotions were on a copper tray and were of high quality. The balcony had a cafe table and four chairs. LOCATION: Pacific Beach is a surfer community. But even the little bungalows blocks from the beach were over a million dollars or more. The hotel is on the boardwalk above the beach. To the north is a large condo building, then mansions. To the south, condos shops and restaurants. A grocery store and drug store were within walking distance at Grand and Mission Bay. We ate at Gringo's Mexican food and The Green Flash for breakfast served till 3 and fresh sea food. We also ate at Nick's but wouldn't recommend that restaurant. (See my reviews of those restaurants.) Fat Burgers was good too. You could enjoy the room, beach, boardwalk and neighborhood (some interesting shops up Garnet) for a day or two and not have to venture elsewhere, if you didn't want to. PARKING: We took at taxi from the airport (about $23, plus tip) instead of renting a car at first, because they charged for parking at the hotel. But our last day there I rented a car from Enterprise, who came to pick me up and allowed me to return it to a location near the airport when we left. Enterprise gave us a free shuttle ride to the airport. I got the car for less than $30 for a day and was again \"upgraded\" to a midsize car. I was able to park the rental car on the street within a block, sometimes two, of the hotel. The atmosphere of San Diego was very laid back (even the homeless people were more laid back!) In January it was comfortable to be outside near the beach with long sleeves during the day (60s) and a light jacket at night (50s). It was truly a relaxing experience.

I was fortunate to have landed here. I was upgraded to an ocean-front suite and had a beautiful balcony overlooking the ocean. The room, amenities and overall experience were much better than expected for the price (Expedia had a better pre-pay rate than calling the hotel directly). My favorite perk was easy access to running on a well-lit sidewalk that runs parallel to the ocean (so much better than running on the sand). I was able to have a quick run every morning, enjoy the sunrise and see the surfers starting their day. The run gave me a chance for people-watching (there were some characters singing, playing instruments, hanging out) as well as the diverse group of homes on the water (everything from $6M custom homes to quaint little beach homes). The breakfast was very nice and convenient on my way out every morning. The only challenge (which appears to be everywhere in this area) wa the lack of quick cab service. There are not cabs lined up in front of the hotel and it can take up to 20 minutes to have a cab show up.

Yes, our shower leaked a bit, but only if we weren't observant. The doors swing from the walls, meeting in the middle of the tub opening. It is great for getting in and out of the tub, but can leak if you don't get the doors closed in the correct sequence over the side of the tub. This did not ruin our stay. The staff is indeed friendly. We arrived early and were given access to the pool area and general facilities while we waited. Being a holiday week, we did not get an upgrade, but were pleasantly surprised by the view from our 'partial ocean view' room. (see photos) It may be that since we arrived early, we may have gotten the two prime POV rooms that were available. Our room was larger than the room that our kids had because theirs lost some of the footprint to the stairwell. This is something you may want to watch for even in the second floor Ocean View rooms. The breakfast was sufficient and ample, but lacked any form of protein other than yogurt. The selection of scones, muffins, pastries, cereal and fresh fruit should keep most appetites at bay for the morning. It was very nice to not have to get up, get dressed and go find breakfast. There is an interesting, reasonalby priced breakfast stand just down the walkway from the hotel that had people lined up out the door each day. The grounds are very well kept and groomed. The pool and spa are very well maintained and their are plenty of towels by the pool and in baskets by the rooms that can be used from until the rooms are serviced. Our only complaints regard a few details in the room ... a noisy AC system fan that was irritating, plantation shutters that were not properly installed and didn't slide well and a few needed paint touch ups. It appeared that the room had recently had some rennovations that just weren't well finished. It was obvious that new carpet had just been installed in the stairway, so upgrades are in process. Also, the bell on the elevator door is really annoying! The 42\" plasma TV was so good that even my wife enjoyed watching it.

Not a lot of familes walking around at night. (Boardwalk area OK during the day. Lots of joggers. ) Housekeeping was pleasant but not thorough; did not remove our trash every day even when full. Parking is $15/day billed automatically. Your responsibility to ask them to remove the charges if you don't use garage. We used the free parking in the alley. My strongest dislike was having to go to the garage to use guest laundry. Very isolated area. Neutral: Breakfast is OK, all carbs (cereals, pastries, fruit).

Also I have to mention that we ate at Gringo's mexican restaurant 3 out of the 4 nights we were at the Pacific Terrace. It's a short stroll down the path from the hotel, located on the corner of Garnet and Mission Blvd. The food was very fresh and tasty.

My new wife and I spent the final 3 days of our honeymoon from 18th - 21st September at Pacific Terrace and it exceeded all our expectations.

You know what I mean.......when you expect something to be so good, it's always a let down. After a horrible overnight flight from a fantastic week in Hawaii and an extremely irritating 4 hour drive from LAX, we pulled up at Pacific Terrace. We had not slept for over 24 hours and must have looked like the living dead..........we certainly felt like it! However from the moment we stepped inside, we were made to feel so comfortable and welcome, we knew this place was different from most hotels. Our room was to die for - it was huge. We had paid for a Deluxe Ocean View Room, but randomly got upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View Suite. It was fantastic. The bed was so comfortable, the massive HD ready Plasma TV unbelievable, the bar and kitchen area (which we were not expecting at all) were great and the balcony and view were spectacular. The pool area, although small, was more than adequate for the size of the hotel and was so well looked after. If you're around the pool area at 4.00pm each afternoon, a trolley gets wheeled out with a complimentary selection of wine for guests. I thought what a nice touch to be given something for nothing; a glass of wine would be lovely. Four glasses later, I thought it was an even nicer touch!! However, all these things said, the thing that really puts this hotel in a league of its own is the staff. I've stayed in a lot of different accommodations in my time and I can without hesitation say these guys were the best. Not only were they so very helpful and efficient, but their general manor and friendliness was really heart warming. I cannot put it into words, but I'm sure everyone else who's stayed here will back me up, they are just really genuinely lovely people. From the maids, to the room service, to the reception staff - absolutely everyone was fantastic. I 've always fancied going to San Diego and had lots of things planned to end off our 3 week honeymoon. However, we were so comfortable in the Pacific Terrace, we did nothing..........and didn't feel bad about doing nothing!

First of all, my wife and I were vacationing with our two children ages 4.5 and 6. A 'Welcome' email from the hotel was received a day prior to our arrival, suggesting we prepare for relaxation\u2026a nice way to begin. Our 5 pm check-in was smooth, especially for the busy holiday weekend. The staff at the front desk was courteous, professional and efficient. The bellman, Rich, was particularly helpful in pointing out all of the features of the property (pool, breakfast/wine hour, parking, etc.) and our stunning room. We booked an executive suite as it was the only way to GUARANTEE that we receive a room with two queen beds. Premium ocean view and Jr. suites are offered with both King/sofa bed or 2 queen configurations and while the hotel tries to accommodate all requests there are no guarantees. The room exceeded our expectations. Out third floor suite was very spacious and nicely appointed. Notable amenities: 42\u201d plasma TV, large double sliding doors w/ plantation shutters, ocean view patio w/ seating for four, wet bar w/ microwave. The bathroom was exceptionally large and had a jetted tub. The room was clean and well cared for. Our room was located on the north side of the hotel facing the Capri and the ocean. Rooms on the south side look out toward Crystal Pier. There was enough noise at street level that we chose to close the sliders at night. I\u2019m not sure if the rooms that directly face the ocean would be quieter as they are adjacent to the pool, beach and beach walk. The pool facility was appropriately sized for the hotel. Pool and hot tub were heated to 85 and 104 deg. respectively. There were no age restrictions for the hot tub. I believe the hours were 7-10 a.m. Seating was adequate and towels plentiful. Additional shade seating would be nice. This is NOT the \u2018send your nanny down in the morning to reserve a lounge chair\u2019 pool scene. Very relaxed and laid back. Deluxe continental breakfast is served from 7-10am and is well stocked and plentiful. Pastries, bagels, cereals, fresh fruits, yogurts, juice, coffee, tea and milk are offered. Seating is cozy inside or one can dine outside near the pool. It seemed that most guests took advantage of the complimentary breakfast. Iced tea and lemonade are available throughout the day as are an assortment of board games. Complementary wine hour is from 4-5 p.m. by the pool. The hotel DOES NOT have a restaurant or pool side bar service, however, there is fare from two local restaurants to choose from for room service or pool side delivery. Guests are also able to charge back to their room at several other nearby restaurants. Location is ideal. The hotel is located in Pacific Beach just north of Crystal Pier and shares an oceanfront location next to the Capri By The Sea condominiums. Beach access is just out the secured gates. Activities are plentiful. There are several restaurants nearby and worthy of mentioning: The Fishery, PB at Cass and Opal (.8 mile from hotel), an inland neighborhood eatery (no ocean view) delicious, FRESH seafood. Station Sushi, Solana Beach, if you\u2019re up north (and returning to the hotel from Legoland) it\u2019s well worth the stop. Great hotel staff recommendation! Taco Surf, PB, Mission Boulevard between Felspar and Emerald, GREAT taco eatery just a block away. Take-out for pool-side dining. I would not recommend Taylor\u2019s. Service was slow, food mediocre and ambiance just so-so. The fitness room was under construction and was going to be \u2018very small\u2019 according to staff. We did not utilize any offsite fitness facility. Parking located beneath the hotel was adequate and secure; I believe it was $17 a night. The hotel also provided 10 first-come first-serve spaces in the alley behind the hotel at no charge. Surface/street parking is difficult due to the desirable beach location. Hotel checkout is 11 a.m. I had inquired about a late checkout when I booked our room two months prior to our stay and was told it would not be a problem, so I booked a late returning flight to Reno to maximize our stay. However, this request was denied the night before our departure due to the \u2018unusually high amount of room turnover\u2019. In the end, we were extended until noon and were able to use all the hotel facilities (less the room) until 3 p.m. So what cold be done better? Tough question. There were a few noticeable exterior \u2018wear and tear\u2019 marine environment issues (peeling paint, rusty metal) that could be repaired. A small pool side bar might be nice to aid in relaxation. One or two of the staff seemed overwhelmed by the demands and volume of guests and were neither helpful nor responsive to guest requests\u2026find replacements ASAP that are truly dedicated to guest service.

So now I have to spend nearly 25 minutes walking back and forth to a local club that costs me $11 to use each time. I travel several dozen times a year -- mostly for business and a few times for pleasure -- and to me nearby fitness facilities mean an elevator ride away or at most across the street. So today I barely had time to try to fit this in and trek off to the local club only to be told that I cannot use their facilities because I don't have ID with me -- of which the hotel made no mention that it would be required.

It is not a trendy hotel. So, if you are looking at a place to be seen this is not it. Yes, there are sufers, college kids, and bums that hang out on the beach. I've never had a problem with any of them but if they bother you then go out to Coronado or La Jolla. This hotel has been great for our kids as the small pool is warm and not very crowded. It is does not have an onsite restaurant or bar. So, if you want 4 star service while sitting by the pool then this is not the place. If you don't mind walking down the beach to dinner or bars then this is not a problem as there are many. Also, we have 3 small kids and there are many walk up fast food places very close if you don't feel like a formal dinner. I would also say the entire Pacific/Mission Beach area is pretty laid back. There aren't any 5 star restaurants within walking distance. There are many decent places to eat but you have to go to Gaslamp or downtown for the trendy places. The area is definitely on the upswing with real estate booming. It is also much more exciting than La Jolla or Coronado, which are good for shopping, but pretty boring IMHO other than that. The beach at the hotel is great. There is some seaweed around whereas Coronado keeps the beach pretty clean. There is also a 2-4 foot break for body surfing.

When we arrived, I was immediately told that we had been upgraded to a junior suite, which was a spacious and clean room, with an excellent view of the ocean. You are so close, that all you hear all day and all night are the crashing waves, so if you truly enjoy hearing the ocean, this is a perfect place to stay. Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the continental breakfast was sufficient for my family. Nothing elaborate, but plenty to eat. The other nice feature, was that the hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants and bars.

The room was very big with a kitchenette (microwave, stove, refrigerator) - perfect for preparing bottles of milk for our 8 month old, there was a dining area and a sofa bed. It was very clean, plenty of piping hot water and the beds were sooo comfy. We thought the breakfast provided was way above average - plenty of cereals to choose from, fresh fruit and fresh croissants/bagels danish etc. There were also plenty of highchairs - clean ones with working harnesses!! If you choose to get breakfast out there is an abumdance of eateries along the boardwalk (and it's only a 5 min walk to Starbucks!). There's also a great supermarket there where you can pick up supplies to store in your refrigerator. At 4pm-5pm there was complimentary wine tasting which was a lovely touch, there was hot water and coffee provided all day (just help yourself) and cookies at the front desk. Unlike others, we found the $15 a day parking convenient. We could load the kids up easily in the underground parking and did not have to fight for street parking. The key card worked every time so no problems there. The pool area was spotless - even though the weather was unusually cool when we were there, we could still swim and even take the baby in. The beach was a bit grubby and there was a lot of seaweed but we didn't really want to go down there anyway; the view however is beautiful - a lovely sunset most evenings and we even saw dolphins playing off the end of the pier. Yes, there are a few down and outs who \"live\" along the boardwalk, but all were friendly and non-threatening and it did not put us off wandering along the boardwalk each evening for a stroll with the kids. If you enjoy running, this is a great place to exercise and join the many other runners who seemed to be out all day. This is a wonderful accommodation - we think it's one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in (and we've stayed in some pretty swanky hotels). It's small, quiet, the staff are incredibly helpful and efficient and it's very well positioned. We went out every day and the longest we were in the car was on the journey up to Legoland (40 mins). By the way, the hotel has a brilliant sheet with detailed directions to all the major sights. We didn't need a map or even a guidebook - it was all provided for us. Most of the sights are easily within a 20 minute radius, probably less. We bought our tickets at the front desk which saved a few bucks and beat the lines at the entrances.

The Premium Ocean View rooms very spacious and nicely decorated. Althought the hotel seemed quite booked, it felt very quiet and except for the waves on the beach couldn't really hear anything.

The breakfast room however is VERY small and can't accommodate all guests staying in the hotel. We took our breakfast to our room and sat on the balcony, which was very nice. The free wine tasting in the afternoon (also free lemonade) was a nice add on to our stay. There are a few complimentary parking spaces next to the hotel.

There are lots of bars and restaurants, but most of them not really to our taste. But we went to downtown San Diego (Gaslamp district), which is only about 20 minutes away and found fantastic restaurants and bars. We also went one evening for a meal in La Jolla, but it was very quiet there. Maybe because it was off season (after the school holidays). A nice bar/restaurant near the hotel is \"Jrdans\" (5 minutes). We liked the hotel so much, that we actually wanted to extend our stay over the weekend, but they were fully booked.

There was a microwave, refrigerator, sink, and stove on our room. There was ample parking in the underground secured garage ($15 daily) as well as several spots along the back alley. It was a short walk to many local area restaurants (they have automatic billing to your room at several different restaurants). Nearby Crystal Pier was a short walk and you could watch surfers all day and evening.

I talked to her A LOT and she not once seemed impatient or frustrated with me -- she truly wanted to help me. Upon checking in, I found that the great service did not end there. While clearly waiting for the concierge, a front desk staff member came up to me and asked if there were something she could help me with -- clearly going out of her way so that I didn't have to wait any longer (...and she could help me). I asked an employee where we could great breakfast upon check-out (4:30a.m. -- long before the continental breakfast opened) and she took our \"order\" made us each a separate \"breakfast bag\" with fruit, muffins, cereal, and juice and had it ready for us upon check-out.

We stayed and made the most of a beautiful holiday. The best thing for us, was that we could open the French doors into the patio and let the kids play (quietly!). The swimming pool is fenced so we didn't have to worry about them getting close to it. We really enjoyed the staff, the breakfast, the wine reception, the location, and the room - which came with a small kitchen. We also realized that there aren't many rooms at all which don't have an ocean view as all the rooms are facing south, north or west - None of them face east.

The free breakfast is good--lots to choose from and you can take it outside on the patio with tables/umbrellas. As two women traveling alone we never felt scared or nervous walking the boardwalk at night. The boardwalk takes you right to some good restaurants. I will have to say parking is a problem. There are only a few 'reserved' spots for guests (without paying). A few times we had to park down the block when returning at night.

Be forewarned...if booking an \"Ocean View\" room from Travelocity, Expedia, TraipAdvisor, etc., don't expect to get what most people consider an \"Ocean View\" room once you get to this hotel. You are better off booking only the \"Garden View\" room if you want an Internet discount because I could just barely catch a glimpse of the ocean from my \"Ocean View\" room. It was a real disappointment and downer. The only way to get an Ocean View Room is by booking directly with the hotel....as I leaned after I checked-in....and paying the 'premium' rate that isn't found on the discount internet services. I was really looking forward to our stay at this hotel after researching it on this internet sight. I could picture looking out at the ocean and watching the sunset from our room. I had the choice of booking the Garden View or Ocean View and opted for the latter. Boy...was I in for a surprise! Problem #1 - When I got to my room, it had only a king-sized bed for myself and 3 other people! The receptionist claims that Expedia didn't inform them that we had 2 kids staying with us. I showed her a hardcopy of my booking and confirmation # - which showed 2 adult and 2 kids as per the booking procedure - and she said they don't get that information from Expedia...they get different information. Say what??? So this is now my problem?? Oh well, can you please help me out and get me a room with 2 queens. Sorry sir, we're full tonight...perhaps tomorrow...you have a fold-out bed in your room that you can use. Problem #2 - They placed us on the ground-level. Looking out our patio, you needed to be 6' or taller - and standing up - to catch a glimpse of the ocean. Everything else in front of you is overgrown shrubs, flowerbeds, palms, brick privacy dividers and a 7' barred fence on the property-line. When I told the Manager that I am extremely dissappointed they consider my room as \"Ocean-View\", she said that all their ground-floor rooms are considered Ocean View as per AAA ratings or some other fancy-named agency. Can we get and \"Ocean View\" room on the 2nd or 3rd floor - even if it's for only tomorrow night?? Although you booked \"Ocean View\" over the Internet, we cannot give you an ocean-view room on the 2nd or 3rd floor because they are classified as....\"Deluxe\" Ocean View rooms and therefore cost much more money. What?? Oh yes....and they are not available over the Internet. And Sir, your current room also has a kitchenette (that I didn't need!) so we actually consider your room as an upgrade from your confirmed rate! Boy...do I feel better!! Problem #3 - You can complain all you want, but the Manager is used to these Ocean-View complaints, and does not budge on the interpretation. She offered to move me the next day to another \"ocean-view\" room, facing north, on the north side of their building. The room looked directly into the Capri hotel and had a better glimpse of the ocean, but I passed on the offer, and decided to air my complaints on TripAdvisor...hoping that someone else doesn't run into the disappointment that I did....two nights of sleeping on an old cot-type pullout bed...and enjoying the ocean view from my room for as long as I could stand on my tip-toes!
