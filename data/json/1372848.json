The area around the hotel is very nice and comfortable. Not to mention the price is quite nice! The bed was so big and cozy (I was sick while I was in Amsterdam, so I *definitely* appreciated that!).

We loved the funky modern design of the hotel, and the staff were amazing. The rooms are small, but the space is very well utilised, and you don't feel cramped in the rooms. The rooms come equipped with a \"mood pad\" which allows you to choose lighting, temperature, window blinds, tv programmes, music etc from one control. The bathroom is not formally separate from the bedroom, but the loo and shower are encapsulated in cylindrical glass opaque doors which offer privacy. There is also a curtain which you can close the bathroom off from the bedroom with. The bed is nice and big, and very comfortable. We found ourselves oversleeping every morning (which is not a bad thing while on holiday!) The room is also very very quiet (the windows are thick), so you don't hear any outside noise. Bliss! The hotel staff are all extremely helpful, friendly and fun. They also come from all over the world, so you're very likely to find someone who can communicate with you in most languages. The hotel has free use of an internet / computer station with 4 apple computers. This was extremely useful for travellers wishing to look up a map, restaurant, activity etc. And they let you print! The food available at the hotel is also of a very high standard, and they make excellent coffees. The food style is kind of a pret-a-manger style, so you choose what you want (ready made) from a shelf/fridge and then eat it around a colourful bar area. Everything is run on computers, so you check yourself in and out, and it's very easy to do. Proximity to the public transport systems is also very convenient. It's 5 minutes from the Amsterdam Zuid train station, and 1 minute from the nearest Tram stop. We found it very easy getting around from there.

Enjoyed one hot meal, they cook a fresh dish at tea time, and veggie curry box was fine. Breakfast plentiful but bit limited. Rooms very quiet, which kind of surprised us! Only suggestion to hotel is it would be great to have some sort of window to let in fresh air - the air conditioning is great, but I'm not a great fan and like a bit of fresh air! Make sure you get off at right stop on tram 5 from central station (the hotel is just across the road and bike lane, and to the left) as we got off the next one and got a bit lost....

Because the price was so reasonable (compared to other hotels in the area), we each got our own room. The hotel is very convenient to the airport, we rolled our luggage over with no hassle. We had just come in via train from Brussels (which arrived at the airport. Also convenient!). After checking in and getting settled, we went back to the airport and took a quick tram ride to Amsterdam. We walked around, enjoyed a nice dinner, then hopped back on the tram to the airport, and walked back to the hotel. Very easy (in part because we were in Amsterdam prior to Brussels, so we knew our way around... but still, easy enough!). I would describe this hotel as 'high tech modern', but without feeling sterile or cold. The room itself was perfectly engineered and designed. Every inch of the space was put to good use, so that the feel of the room was bigger than the actual size. Every aspect was well thought out. The bed! So comfortable, with excellent quality linens and generous in size. My room overlooked the runway, so I enjoyed looking out my window throughout the night. When it was time for lights out, the blinds blocked the light so not a blink or flash was seen. The quality of the soundproofing was better than most hotels. I could not hear my son in the next room, who had the TV volume up. I loved the gadgets for mood lights, shades, etc. The shower itself was a fun novelty. If I had to say one negative thing, I would say that check-in was a bit bumpy, but we were able to check-in within minutes so that isn't really a fair complaint. I would definitely stay here again, and I would recommend to anyone staying by themselves, or for 2 people who don't mind a little 'coziness'.

We got an early flight from Manchester and were worried that we couldn't check in until 2pm when we would actually be at the hotel by 11am. We needn't have been. We found the hotel easily, it has good transport links from the airport (1 stop) and there is a tram stop literally outside of the hotel (Prinses Irenestraase I think) or a short walk away near the train station is another (Station Zuid). Once we reached the hotel we were greeted immediately by a member of staff who in perfect English told us we could either pay for an early check in or we could leave our suitcases securely in the hotel whilst we went and explored - we chose the latter. He was very helpful as we outlined potential plans for the week, he advised us to buy a travel card - a very good idea if you plan on getting public transport anywhere as it is 7.50 euros for 24 hours and 16.50 euros for 3 so no comparison really. He also printed out maps for us and let us know about the free iMacs and printers should we need any more info. After exploring for the afternoon we returned to the hotel and were greeted by another member of staff, I think her name was Sara. She helped us check in and we made our way to the room. The rooms are amazing. They are compact, however I think a lot of this is due to the fact that the bed is huge. So big in fact myself and my travel partner actually comfortably slept in a \"L\" shape one evening!! There are free movies on demand which are recent releases and should you so wish BBC 1, 2 and 3 are all available. Yes, the shower is..quirky and the toilet is in the middle of the room, however as long as you arent travelling with someone who you dont know that well it isnt too much of a problem - there is a curtain for some privacy and realistically it didnt bother us as we werent planning on spending too much time in the room anyway. The hotel is in a quiet residential area with the World Trade Centre around the corner. The tram line that services it goes through the Museumplein and Leidseplein which was useful as we felt if we were staying closer to the centre we wouldn't have explored these parts of the city. The best part of our experience staying at the hotel was coming back one evening and deciding to have a quiet drink at the bar.

Can't remember when was last time I enjoyed my sleep that much. The staff...can't praise them enough: very friendly and helpful. I forgot my laptop charger at home and I asked for one. The hotel manager was there as well and offered to look for one, unfortunately they did not have one that I could use. anyways, two days later the manager brought me one from the other CitizenM hotel. I thought that was brilliant. The check-in check-out system amazed me as well, you do it yourself using their computers, though there's always someone there in case you need assistance. It's very quick and efficient. You can't pay cash for your room or any additional charges to your room. I leave in London so to avoid any extra charges to my account (transaction fees and currency excange), at the airport, I put the money on a VISA travel card (you can withdraw money from ATM machines, use it in shops etc, without any extra charge) The location of the hotel is very good, 10 min to the airport (the train station si 5 min away) 15 min to the city centre with tram no 5 (2 min away). I recommend to get a travel card that you can use on busses, trams and metro: I had one for 5 days (120 hours...they don't do days, they do hours) and cost me 25 euro. You can get the Metro as well to go to the city, but I would recommend the tram. you can do what they call hop on hop off and see major attractions as the tram 5 passes by Museumplein where you cand visit Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum, Diamonds Museum etc. you jump on the same tram and go further to Spui where is the Amsterdam Historich Museum, few stops further is Leidsestraat where you can shop and from where you can go and walk the city. At the same stop you can find the theatre where Boom Chicago performs (Leidseplein 12) stand up comedy and improvisation - go and see one of their shows..very good laughs. jump on the tram again and you will finally hit the centre of the city!

Hotel good points: Genuinely friendly staff, impressive contemporary hotel design, close to train & tram stops, flatscreen tv in room & free movies on demand, clean, very comfortable bed Not so good: 15-20mins to city on tram but hotel close to tram. Impressively efficient use of space in bedrooms but it is a bit cramped with not a lot of room for bags or clothes - fine for short break The hotel is located less than 5mins walk from Zuid train station which is great for access to schipol airport and to other towns in holland.(e.g. We travelled 20mins on train to Utrecht which is a lovely town and worth a visit for a few hours) Prinses irenestraat tram stop is even closer. The tram infrastructure in Amsterdam makes the whole city very accessible. Amsterdam highlights for my wife and I would be 1) Anne frank house (30mins queue on a quiet day if tickets not bought online), 2) Utrecht, 3) heineken experience (very enjoyable) 4) huge selection of restaurants with flavors from all over the world! Naturally we had a look at the red light district also! Amsterdam lowlight would be our decision to visit a coffee house on our second day. We gave into our curiosity and decided to try a brownie (space-cake). We fooloishly thought that brownies were a safer way to try this experience. 1.5hrs later, we still had felt no effects. Then it hit us. Words cannot describe what a horrendous experience it was. Panic, nausea, paranoia, fear and a heavily drunk feeling give a idea of how we felt. We returned to our hotel. We feared we were having heart attacks and confided to hotel staff. They were absolutely fantastic and looked after us for a few hours until we felt somewhat ok again.When it was over we were embarrassed but they never made us feel bad about it. We subsequently learned that brownies are a lot more dangerous because the effects are so delayed, that you cannot tell if you've had too much. So if, like us, you are inexperienced and do give into temptation when in Amsterdam, our advice is a) do not use brownies, b) do not do it until familiar with Amsterdam as you may not find your way back and c) it may be safer during the day for the same reasons as point b.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay..Would recommend\u201d", "Author": "boydy", "ReviewID": "UR124860286", "Content": "Had a great stay here from fri 10th until sun 12th feb!

The common space is lovely and informal, where you can get a drink from the central bar, watch tv, and just generally lounge. It also creates an atmosphere where you can speak to other guests without feeling like the sad loner, and somehow the hotel and its staff seem to put everyone in a good mood. I also struggle to sleep in hotel beds, but these beds are amazing, resulting in a solid 8 hour sleep - something unheard of for me. The rooms are fairly compact, but again, as someone who stays in suites or large rooms, I much prefer these rooms and wonder if they are sound proof as even when the hotel is near to full I never hear a peep out of my 'neighbours'. As for the staff, they are a credit to the hotel. The portugese barman created a cocktail just for me, the foyer staff (I think he was south african) wanted to ensure the room would be to my liking, and last time I stayed, I ate a take out pizza in the foyer lounge with a friend, drank wine and watched the football. If you want room service, spas, and a footman to take care of your luggage then this place might not be for you.

The trip into town took about 15 mins - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located slightly out of the centre but trams are frequent so no problems what so ever! The rooms are very quiet, as the hotel is located in a quiet suburb as opposed to the noisy town. The rooms are quite small but very quirky, with a large bed and glass walled toilets and showers! The lobby has lots of sofa seating with Apple macs (free wireless) and plenty of books. The caf\u00c3\u00a9/bar is quite expensive, but Amsterdam is generally expensive so it was nothing new. The self check in facilities were also quick and convenient. We wanted to do a few trips whilst in Amsterdam \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Kuekenhof flower garden being one of them, so we got the train and then a bus which cost us about \u00c2\u00a320 each. When we arrived we paid the full entrance fee of \u00c2\u00a310 to find absolutely no flowers in there! The tulip fields were one of the things we went to Amsterdam for. Although it was the end of April, there were a few tubs of tulips but no carpeted floor of or tulips to be seen anywhere (which were pictured so heavily over all the leaflets) This was very disappointing as they must know when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the cutting season, yet still charge full price and neglect to tell people! Bear this in mind if going in April! Overall we had a great stay at the Citizen M and thought this was a great hotel for exploring Amsterdam.

The staff members were friendly and greeted me with enthusiasm - and were very helpful when helping me to use the self check-in terminals. You can choose from a room with a city-view, or a garden-view - unless you're on one of the higher floors (I was on the first floor), it doesn't really matter. The lobby is stylish and it's been designed to feel like you're sat in your fashionable friend's lounge. Books concerning art and design adorn the shelves and the TVs show various European channels. There's a real hostel feel to it and nearly all of the employees are in their twenties - yet there are many older guests staying too. The rooms are designed either for singles or couples. They're small and compact, but the space is used brilliantly - two cylinders form the toilet and shower - the toilet is covered in matte glass, but the shower is transparent (it's not really the place I'd choose if holidaying with friends), but it was a fun touch. The entire room's functions are controlled with a remote control - you can turn off or dim the lights with it, change channel on the TV, change the temperature etc. And the bed was wonderful - it's a huge king-sized, very comfy bed. And everything is very clean! The hotel is in the heart of the business quarter - it's around 20 minutes by tram (tram number 5, which leaves from outside the hotel) to the centre, but the tram was packed every time I rode it (I was being grumpy with my cold, but I'd have appreciated a seat). Alternatively you can take the metro to the central station - the metro is around a 5 minute walk from the hotel next to the World Trade Center. I was only in Amsterdam for a few days, so the 20-30 minute journeys weren't ideal and being in the heart of the city would have been easier - but it was a minor issue. I really wanted to visit Restaurant Greetje while in Amsterdam, I have heard many wonderful things - but due to my cold (shall I mention that one more time?!) I ended up eating noodle soup in nearby Wagamama's. Breakfast at CitizenM was perfectly ok, but for 10 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac (if you book the night before, otherwise it's something like 13 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac if you pay on the day) was a little steep for what there was - croissants, bread rolls, pain au chocolats, cheeses, fruit and muesli with yogurt, plus a juice and a hot drink.

The rooms are super modern and the bed, I have to say, is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, even better than my own, it was a king size and the sheets also super-soft. It does offer very good value for the money, especially knowing the average cost of similar hotels in Amsterdam. The only thing is, it's not really in the middle of it all and you have to walk 10 minutes or so to get to the nearest cafe' or restaurant. However they do compensate by offering a whole range of foods and beverages, that are actually pretty good and inexpensive, as well as several common areas to enjoy your dinner, watch TV or just hang out. They even have Mac computers available for free and working all the time. If you pre-pay for breakfast do keep in mind that they do not have scrambled or fried eggs, just boiled eggs, but other than that you can get pretty much all you want and coffee is really good.

It's very close and easy to get to with the interlink train. Once at the station take your left and walk straight across the square, wtc building is on the right and side. As soon as I got there, one of the stewards welcomes me and helped with the checkin. Within seconds, I was asked to insert my card and pay the full amount. It is an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.95 for early check in which I did as I got there early morning and check in is not until 2pm. There is also an additional cost id paying by card that is not maestro. Once all had been done I went up to my room. This was a lot smaller than I expected. The bed is huge but I would say that is the only main advantage. The tv is also of decent size but the screen is so close that you can't really get the full benefit of it. I was able to work the moodpad within minutes and started flicking through the channels (no MTV). The stewards in general are very helpful day and night. They always greet you with a smile and are nice (maybe a bit too nice at times). The 24hr kitchen/ bar area is very convenient if not overpriced. The food on offer is decent but I'd advise getting food before returning to the hotel as in 2 days there I did not see a restaurant close by. The n5 tram goes very frequently from centraal station (which you have to wait for at point 4 near the food area across the road from the station) and it is a good 20-25 minutes ride to the hotel. There is a very short walk from the tram stop to the hotel. I did not take the night bus but it stops at the same place. I enjoyed the location of the hotel a little bit outside of the city centre as it gave us a break from the noisy touristy city. There seemed to always be people travelling back to the hotel on the tram (especially at night) so we felt relatively safe. The free wifi and mac computers downstairs are a great feature for travellers as it allowed us to plan our itineraries. I would only recommend staying here if you are very good friends with the person you are sharing with or are in an established relationship. Do not stay here if it is your first romantic trip away as the separation between bed toilet and shower is non existent! I would ho back to the hotel but this time would get a room by myself.

The hotel is in a really nice area of Amsterdam, just a few minutes walk from Amsterdam Zuid station and right beside the number 5 Tram halt. There are a good selection of shops/cafes/restaurants on Beethovenstraat which runs along the side of the hotel (we recommend the Gaucho steak house). It takes less than 10 minutes to get to Dam Square by tram. The hotel itself is ultra modern, really impressive, spacious lobby area with a well stocked bar/cafe/shop. Also iMac computers for free use by guests. There is no \"check-in desk\" as such - just a few self check-in terminals. Unfortunately we were presented with a reserved and not very enthusiastic member of staff who was standing beside these terminals. We had booked 2 rooms which meant that we had to complete two separate check-ins (AND PAY 2 x 2.50 EURO CHARGES FOR PAYING BY CREDIT CARD). So I was annoyed at having to pay this extra 5 Euro which had not been made clear at the time of booking. The female member of staff was muttering something about City Tax (I am aware about City Tax and have no problem with it). My problem was the 2 separate credit card charges for one single booking. When my sister asked the female staff member whether we should choose the City View or Garden View rooms, she was greeted with a smirk and raised eyes. Later when we had visited our rooms and returned to the bar for a drink, the same female member of staff was eating her dinner and gawking at us from across the room. I don't think this is very professional behaviour. This was the exception as every other member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. I just shows how one person can really change your perception of a place. So on to the rooms - VERY clean, compact, has everything you need. The Phillips Mood Pad is a great idea, but mine was faulty. I could not choose the free movies, games and music and my window blinds kept closing by themselves, also on 2 occasions all power in my room totally shut down.

Each of these new age hotels offers compact living space suitable for one traveler who does not require the add-on and costly features of stereotype hotels. Put a different way, this means: if you are accustomed to Hilton, Sheraton or Marriott, want room service, large rooms suitable to hold private meetings in and dozens of other things we often take for granted, then this style property is probably not for you. Citizen M has taken the concept of cramming many good things into a small space very much to heart. Approximately 25-30% of the total floor space in the room is taken up with the monster bed, which goes from wall to wall to window. The beds are remarkable with firm support and good linens that fit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a point that a few supposedly up-scale hotels might consider. Everything I saw was spotless and cleaning was an on-going process. My towels and sheets were changed every day and my room was the cleanest I have seen in any hotel, ever. There is no bathroom per se. Circular glass cylinder enclosures, reaching from floor to ceiling and which open like a clam shell, house a full size toilet and a separate shower. This is a fully enclosed shower, not the kind where the drain is in the floor and when you use it everything gets wet. The wash stand is separate, so in theory, three people could share a room with one being in the totally enclosed shower with telephone hand set type shower, plus a wonderfully full rain shower, one could be in the frosted glass toilet cylinder and one could be at the basin or in bed. But I would not recommend these accommodations for more than two people and this should be two who are VERY comfortable with each other and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect ANY privacy in the room, because there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any. True, a filmy gauze curtain can be pulled between the bed and the rest of the room, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much wiggle room, so any personal matters will be shared unless someone leaves. If you have a ton of clothing that needs to be hung up, forget it. My room had three hangers and space for no more. A shirt that I hung up to get out the wrinkles constantly got caught when I opened and closed the door. The room offers remote control for everything: door locks, TV, blinds, night shutters, music, lighting and temperature. The remote was sometimes pokey and sometimes had to reset itself, leaving me with TV blaring and no way to shut it off. This can be annoying and I suspect the software is constantly being upgraded. Everything that the remote operates has limits. I found no way to get really adequate light to read in bed and the room temperature control only had six settings. If you wanted warmer or colder, it is not going to happen. Some of these pre-set parameters need to be revised. I stayed in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CitizenM for four nights and then transferred to the Schiphol Airport version for the last night so that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be close to the terminal for an early morning flight. More on that in a separate review. The city hotel is a 20 minute train, tram or Metro ride into the Central Station. This is fine in good weather, but the trials of walking to the tram or Metro stops in rain, wind and cold were making me wish for a nice in-city room where everything was nearby. If you arrive from the airport, the train stops at the nearby south station, but the directions I got were confusing and instead of a ten minute walk in the rain, it took me nearly three hours to get to the hotel after getting on the wrong train, taking many wrong turns and getting wrong directions. By the way, everyone I met spoke perfect English. The hotel has a well stocked buffet canteen with full bar, plenty of snacks and breakfast in the morning at an additional 9.95Euro. For traveling Americans, this $15, self-service, continental breakfast is probably a good deal, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer a lot of choice other than coffee/tea, juice, yogurt, excellent rolls and croissants and fruit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a fair price because there is nothing else nearby. The staff was very helpful and the internet area had good free access with large flat screens and comfortable seating. Internet access throughout the hotel is also free. This is the way it should be. I felt safe coming and going day and night, but the area, even though residential, seems to share the unfortunate Dutch reputation for giving one an eerie feeling. Two expensive cars were broken into on one night while I was there and I saw evidence of homeless camping just across the street. For most people, this would not be an issue, but it is also worth noting that there was no evidence of police or security personnel anywhere except in the downtown Central Station. The hotel was very quiet. There was a small safe that just fit my mini laptop, phone and wallet. The twin lifts worked well and quietly. The large lobby was friendly and accommodating. So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the split: are you willing to stay outside the city, in a clean, comfortable, safe environment for about half (or less) of what in-city hotels will charge and for which you may get less value? If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to ride public transport, your decision is made for you. If you want to try what is perhaps the coming wave of hospitality, try this one. If you bring a friend, be prepared to do a lot together: shower, sleep, etc, etc. One other note: I arrived early in the morning and although they had a room for me, there was an additional charge of about $25 for early access. When you add this fee into the base rate, plus the optional breakfast charge, you are getting up in the same range as in-city properties, so what may look like a deal may not end up being so. I liked this concept despite its drawbacks and may well book a CitizenM again if I have the time and inclination to stay outside the five canal rings of Amsterdam.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cexcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "bear000", "ReviewID": "UR121742825", "Content": "I have spent many years travelling internationally for work so I know something about hotels and what to expect.

This is probably not the Ideal way to first encounter a CitizenM hotel room as the all controlling remote takes a little getting used to (I still have yet to work out why one of the lighting presets changed the channel on the tv...?) The coloured lighting is cool but to get the full effect you need to dim the main lights something I only worked out how to do the next morning (hold down the wall switch). On entering the room, and once having weaved between the glass cylindrical tube containing toilet and the other tube containing the shower, you're presented with the bed. The bed itself is massive and runs wall to wall in front of an equally wide window. The actual room is pretty small though. We got a room with a view over the offices in the distance which fitted with the look of the room. As others have said given the toilet is in the middle of the room it is perhaps not suited to couples in the early stages of a relationship. Room soundproofing seemed fairly average and I was aware of general noise from the corridor during the night and morning. Free Wi-Fi was useful and getting in to town is very straight forward as the tram stop is almost opposite the hotel and takes you right in to the centre of Amsterdam.

All movies are free and also the wifi access is very good as well as being free also. My son and i will def return next year probably as a family with my husband and younger son and would have no hesitations in recommending this hotel. p.s The tram 5 stops right outside of the hotel and takes you in the centre in a matter of 10-15 minutes and run very frequently if you dont want to stay in the heart of the city but still have accessible access.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFunky, friendly & great value.

We booked in at the CitizenM as it seemed to really catch our eye based on the Trip Advisor reviews to experience something a little different. That said, here's a summary of our CitizenM experience: Rooms - Felt like I was entering a space capsule! Pictures describe the rooms far better than words, so I've attached a few. \"Trendy\" and \"different\" are truly understatements, you have to see it to believe it! Its no secret the rooms are on the smaller side (as is the standard of many European hotels), but what the rooms lack in size they make up for 10-fold i character and visual appeal! From the capsule-like shower and bathroom stalls, to the remote control blinds, music and funky lighting, the CitizenM thought of everything when coming of with the design of this place. My only wish is that our stay could have been longer! That said, If you're travelling top heavy with luggage, this room may not be conducive nor practical for you, but ideal for backpackers or those traveling with one suitcase. Front desk/staff: Friendly and helpful and with no hassles checking in or out. Your check in/out process is completely automated and done electronically rather than through a \"front desk\", but always someone around to assist you if there's any confusion (there won't be, its super easy!) Location - As asset or a drawback, depending which way you view it. Via tram, its a good 20-25 minute journey to and from downtown Amsterdam proper, but very easy to catch as it runs continuously throughout the day. As an asset, its off the beaten path and away from the madness and crush of the crowds, so could be viewed as somewhat of a personal escape with transit at your fingertips depending on your point of view. Value - One of the best deals going in Amsterdam, period! Sure its a little off the track, the the price coupled with everything else makes this place feel like a steal! The bottom line - The CitizenM most definitely deserves its title as Trip Advisor's trendiest hotel . From the truly one of a kind rooms, unique decor and futuristic theme, I can only hope I'm afforded the opportunity to stay here again.

From the ease of check in and the attentiveness of the staff this would be one of the finest hotels we have ever stayed in. The hotel is a 5 minte walk from Amsterdam Zuid Station and a tram stop across the road from the hotel makes it a perfect location to explore the beautiful city of Amsterdam. The number 5 tram takes you from the hotel to Leidseplein in about 7 minutes or Dam Square in 15 minutes. If you're there for a few days I would recommend a 72 hour public transport pass that can be bought from the big silver machines at Zuid station for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.50. Check in and check out was a breeze and is all self service with staff members there to help. The bedroom was beautiful and had a huge wall to wall bed. We really enjoyed the uniqueness of the rooms with the shower and toliet contained in seperate pod's within the room. The free on demand movies were a great feature as well. Superb wi-fi as well. The staff at the hotel couldn't have been more polite or helpful. Service always with a smile which is sadly lacking from many other hotels. We never had breakfast in the hotel. Instead we went to Bagels & Beans which was a five minute walk from the hotel. When you leave the main exit of the hotel turn right and walk to the end of the road and you will find it across the road.

Our stay went as planned, and the staff was very friendly, although the coolness of their every single remark sometimes went overboard, but you can forgive that considering that's the name of the game at CitizenM. The hotel is conveniently located if you need to access the Schiphol airport, as the Amsterdam Zuid train station is just a stop from there, and a short walk from the hotel. The restaurant Fidelio a few blocks away serves delicious food, although many of the \"citizens\" seem to have found the place based on two dinners there. The bed is just huge and pillows and blankets are top class. Transport to the City, Pijp or other parts of town is easy and quick. Going into our personal experience (and hopefully allowing for a little bit of heresy among all the loyal praise previously written here), the hotel left us fairly cold. This despite the fact that the lobby is furnished with design classics (and geniune, expensive ones they are) and although they have some advanced tech tricks installed everywhere. What caused most irritation right from the start was that they position themselves above normal hotels that cater for \"ordinary tourists\", being a home for a global tribe of travellers who are somehow smarter in their travels and especially hotel selections than your average Joe. For us, this soon started to feel as calculated as it probably is. It did not take away the fact that their rooms are plain tiny and have very little warmth or coziness of any sort. Controlling everything with an RC does not add any comfort, either, after a few minutes of fooling around with the device. Quite the contrary, finding optimal lighting for various situations turned out to be difficult (going in the toilet during night while sleeping with a partner was a mess as you had to light up the entire room). Another thing was that their breakfast deal could be more flexible: you cannot get the cheaper pre-book option for just one morning, but either take it or leave it for the entire stay, since the \"system\" has been programmed so according to a staff \"ambassador\". But to be fair, if you ditch the hype it is an ok hotel as long as you don't expect the comfort of a four-star hotel - or pay for one.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hannover, Germany", "Title": "\u201cTop Ten Hotel in Amsterdam?

We had to pay 90 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac for the room without breakfast, The hotel is definitely not in the City of Amsterdam. Even though you have a tram station next to the hotel it takes you about 20 minutes to get to the city centre. And... in the night the tram stops its service. The hotel might be good for buisiness travellers as the World Trade Centre is near by, for sightseeing I would definitely not recommend staying there. Now for the room: Before booking the hotel I read in the reviews and in some travel magazines that the rooms are well designed and that you get so much comfort for your money. Well... I could definitely not agree. The rooms are tiny (which is okay in Amsterdam) but they aren't well designed at all. The bed is okay even though it's a little uncommon to have only one side to enter it. The shower is really good, the bath products are not. The real problem in the room is that you have first nearly no space to store your luggage and your wardrobe and second that the toilet is really impossible. I stayed with my husband but really don't need him to be virtually in the toilet with me. The toilet (and also the shower) is in kind of a glass cylinder, its frosted glass but you can easily see through. And you can hear through it...Very inconvenient...

It caters to tech savvy short term guests with mid-level budgets The core concept is to use technology to cut personnel costs to the rock bottom without unduly compromising service, to use architectural and interior design to cut room size to the bare minimum without unduly compromising comfort, to locate the properties near transport hubs in outlying areas to cut costs without unduly compromising convenience, and to wrap this all in a sleek stylishly designed package with free internet. Technology/personnel costs: Self-checkin and checkout at touchscreens in the lobby eliminatedall but one front desk person; fully automated room controls covering temperature, shades, television and wakeup calls reduced the need for front desk and floor staff. Comment: This worked well. The staff member on duty in the lobby could explain things to the non tech saavy guests. Most guests did not require assistance. Architecture and interior design: The rooms were a bit smaller than the European norm, but far larger than the Japanese norm. A huge bed filled one end of the room, wall to wall with storage bins underneath. There was no sofa/divan, no bureau for clothing. The shower and the toilet stood in the middle of the room, with movable plastic enclosures, with a sink and rotating mirror. There was no conventional bathroom. The windows were wall to wall with very effective blinds encased by interior and exterior glass. There were no conventional curtains. There was a small desk and hard chair, not quite large enough for work. Comment: A colleague noted that the design limited privacy for toilet and shower, and might be an issue for some couples. Location: the hotel was adjacent to the Amsterdam Zuid station with great access to Schiphol and on the number 5 tram line eight minutes from the Museum area and fifteen minutes from old parts of Amsterdam. The hotel distributes a very clear map with tram routings to help guests find their way around. Comment: This works \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just get a day card for transit and enjoy. The rates at the hotel were far lower than at properties located in the museum area and old parts of Amsterdam. Bottom Line: As the many favorable reviews here suggest, the concept works well and is likely to spread to San Francisco, Boston, Stockholm, Copenhagen and other fairly high cost destinations that appeal to younger travelers with some money. Of course, the tech saavy who are most likely to post on-line reviews are also the most likely to like the Citizen M concept.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Neuchatel, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cBrings a smile to the face of the most seasoned traveller\u201d", "Author": "Simon2036", "ReviewID": "UR119127781", "Content": "Very unusual but superbly equipped and incredibly friendly hotel.

It is an experience by its own. You will find yourself telling about it as if it was one of the tour sites in Amsterdam. Every inch of this hotel is decorated and branded in some way.

How they managed to squeeze everything into it and still give you enough space and a unique feeling that you have exactly what you need. The bed is huge and most comfortable, so don't be worried about your night sleep. The room is clean, and obviously the most interesting things are the shower and toilets. You will either love it or hate it but will not be indifferent. We liked the concept. I can understand why someone can feel uncomfortable having the shower fully transparent. Anyway it was very comfortable with full control of water temperature and great water pressure. The lobby and public area of the hotel are beutifully decorated. There is an area with Macs and printers where you can conenct to your email or surf and print whatever you need without the need to ask the staff to do it for you (very handful when you need to print your borading pass/ car rental confirmation/ a map to the restaurant). You do not even need the receptionist in order to check-in or out. You are doing it online using a special workstations located at the entrance of the hotel. (Of course, the staff will help you if you are technologically challened). The cafeteria is very convenient. They serve good cofee, good fresh pastries and generally a good selection of packed salads and light meals that you can get at any hour. The staff is generally young and helpful. I must say that I tried several times to get their help in getting a recommendation for a restaurant or some information regarding the transportation and got inaccurate information. The hotel is located near the \"south\" train station of Amsterdam, what makes it very close to the airport by train (6-10 minutes) , but quite far from the city center (20 minutes by tram). But the tram stop (number 5) is just on the opposing side of the street what makes it very convenient.

The rooms are like prison cells more than rooms, all very square with the loo and shower in the middle of the room and the auto check in/check out is very unwelcoming.

The location from the airport is good. A quick train ride from Schnipol to Zuid station is cheap and takes a few minutes but the city it too far away. In the space of 3 days I spent over 100 euro on transport. On a Saturday night after 12pm we paid 29 euro! The number 5 tram beside the hotel is pretty reliable and only 7 euro for a 24 hour pass but its a pity is stops at 12.

We were greeted by a lovely member of staff on arrival who showed us how to check in which I was grateful for. On check in I asked for a 'city view' room and ended up with a nice of the car park :/ The room was 'cool' but at the same time it was cramped. The room is controlled by a remote control which has options such as turn lights on / off, or turn on the tv etc. The mood lights on the tube like shower / toilet was pretty cool on the other hand when my girlfriend was getting ready using the mirror and I needed to use the toilet there was no room. The shower was awkward to use at the start but I soon got onto the hang of it. The room had no iron which caused a little nuisance (not for me since easyjet lost my baggage) but we had the choice to use an iron downstairs. I didn't like the fact there was no restaurant in the hotel. Ready made sushi and the choice of rice etc isn't a satisfying meal, after a long day of walking around the city I would like a more exciting choice of food. A 500 metre walk down the street and I found a pretty good restaurant. I paid 400 Euro to stay in the CitizenM for 3 days and spent over 100 Euro on transport to and from the city.

The hotels closest station is Zuid which you can get from Schnipol Airport with a transfer time of approx 25 minutes with a 3 euro fare. From Zuid station it is about a 5 minute walk to the hotel, there is a little park beside the hotel. The area is great for business and with excellent transport links with the tram stop a 2 minute walk from the hotel which takes you to the museum district or dam square so very easy to get around however bear in mind that the tram service ends at 12 midnight. Tram fare is 1.60 euros. The hotel was very easy to check in with ambassadors always available if you require any help. Check in is at 2pm so if you want to check in straight away on arrival it is a 20 euro charge or they are happy to keep your suitcase locked away if you want to go out and check in later. The appearance of the hotel is well kept with outstanding detail and d\u00c3\u00a9cor, very contemporary, even the designer portfolios on display such as Gucci and dior etc. They have a small canteen area, with a lounge area and a work station to use the macs or further down a study area etc. The rooms: Rooms are compact, clean and stylish with everything you need. Beds are comfortable with extra pillows located beneath the bed. shower and toilet pods with mood lights. The windows in the hotel rooms cannot be opened so there is aircon on 24/7 however you can adjust the temperature to a maximum of 23c which it can still be a bit cold so I would suggest bringing pyjama's or something if you will feel cold during the night. All features of the room are controlled with a computerised remote which can adjust the temperature, blinds and shades, the tv and mood lighting very practical so you do not have to get out of bed to do this. There is not much privacy in the room if you are sharing so bear this in mind, you can pull a shower curtain across the room which separates the bed from the bathroom area however it can be a little see through if you have the blinds and shades open so you have to be comfortable with whoever you may share with. The TV is satellite so you do get English channels and movies on demand if you want to watch TV. The room also has European and English 3 pin plugs also so adapter is not needed. Rooms are cleaned daily and very well, however they do not have a dry cleaning service if you may require that. Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel and free access to the macs as well with a printer. Canteen: Can get a range of food from fruit priced at 1 euros, pastry, confectionery and deli priced from 0.70 - 5 euros, drinks priced from 2 - 3 euros, I would not say overpriced as these seem to be standard prices unless you go to a supermarket. Checkout: Is easy and simple. Checkout is at 11am or for a later checkout of 3pm is 20 euros. We had no issues at all with this hotel, it is quiet so out of the hustle and bustle of dam square.

There are always plenty Citizen M staff about if you have problem with checking-in or to serve you in the cafe.

As there was only 1 drink ready, and we were a couple, they asked us to come back later to enjoy our drinks. The welcome drink was very delicious -fruity, sweet and light. Next morning we went to the canteen. We were really surprised by wide range of coffee offered (capuccino, espresso, etc. They had even hot chocolate milk, and range of tea was also impressive.). As in our country we usually drink black coffee adding a bit milk to it, we offered two Americano coffees and asked if we may get a bit of milk. Barista asked, if we wanted hot or cold milk! I have never experienced such a care for customer in other hotels! Canteen works 24/7; although we didn't choose breakfast (we don't like continental breakfast very much), there was wide range of sandwiches to buy in the morning, and if you want, they can warm it up. Hot ham and cheese sandwiches were great for breakfast. Room was nice, and room-service was made every day. Minus is that they didn't have wardrobe in the room, but hangers near the door was enough for us. Idea of having personal safe in the room to lock your valuables in, while you are away, is perfect! The staff was extremely friendly, asking in the evening how our day was, and what we've seen.

The toilet and shower are basically in the center of the room, each surrounded by a glass pod with sliding doors. The room is literally the width of a king-sized bed (the square bed reaches wall to wall, so you just need to climb up on the end of the bed). The beds are comfortable and the duvets are lovely. The room doesn't feel overly cramped, however, because it is so cleverly designed and unfussy. The layout and size of the room were absolutely fine for me, a solo traveler, who was staying a short time. Had I been planning a longer stay, or traveling with a friend or partner, I would not have considered this a good option. But then everyone has a different comfort level with privacy or lack thereof! The hotel is not central to all the action in town, but the tram stop is steps away and it's an easy, short ride to all the major attractions. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant per se, but it does have some snacks, fruit, baked goods, and prepared food you can purchase--either things meant to be eaten cold, or meals that can be heated in their microwave. There is also a nice bar, and coffee drinks are available 24 hours a day. The lobbies are homey (in a mod sort of way), with couches, lounge chairs, coffee tables, and TVs, and they are meant to be used by hotel guests as places to meet and relax. This makes up for lack of sitting room in the rooms themselves. When I first saw pictures of the place, before I booked a reservation, I was worried I would be made to feel too old and uncool to stay there! (I'm in my 40s.) But that turned out not to be the case. Well, I might be old and uncool, but I was never made to feel that way! All of the staff were friendly and accommodating.

The location is convenient for travel to the airport - it's just one stop from Schiphol by train and a short walk from Zuid station. The standard of cleanliness is good and the staff, when approached, are happy to help. However, there are an awful lot of things with this hotel which are not quite right and which prevent it being anything more than average. The rooms are \"quirky\", to say the least. It's not the Star Trek toilet and shower combo in the room. Actually they're OK provided you're comfortable with the limited privacy they offer (and there's a curtain which can be drawn across the room for the truly shy). No, the room is an exercise in how to design things which are just not quite right. Some examples: The bed is large and comfortable but only has space on one side. Two people occupying this bed have the option of lying \"lengthways\" and crawling down the bed to get out, or \"sideways\" where one person will have to clamber over the other. Inconvenient, especially in the middle of the night! The shower only works when the doors are shut. Fine. However, the doors must be shut and positioned into exactly the right place for the shower to start running. It took me fifteen minutes of fiddling the first time to work this out. There is a safe in the room and it's free to use - and it will even fit an iPad or netbook. It is, unfortunately the narrowest safe I've ever seen and whatever you put in there WILL fall out as you close the door and when you open it again. There's a general lack of storage space in the room and what space there is isn't always used effectively. There are too few hangers, for example. There's a tiny shelf to the side of the sink which will hold a few items at the risk of knocking them off with the aforementioned privacy curtain which brushes up against it. There is some more shelf space under the only mirror in the room but one of the two shelves is occupied by the hair dryer (which doesn't fit very well and has a tendency to fall off). I liked the concept of the \"mood pad\" which can control the television, the lighting, the aircon and the blinds but I found it a bit unresponsive and, especially where the lights are concerned, rather random. Also: One of the lifts has two parallel vertical rows of identical buttons. If you press the buttons on the right hand side, the doors open to the rooms. If you press the left hand side buttons, the doors open to some sort of housekeeping store. The other door will not then open unless you press the floor number on the right hand side. There are no signs or notices which explain this. OK, you only need to make this mistake a couple of times but that's two times more than necessary. There are toilets on the ground floor for the convenience of people using the expensively-priced canteen area. Rather than having the usual symbols on the doors to indicate whether they are gents or ladies, there are instead tiny, tiny pictures of people - one of whom is a woman and the other appears to be a man in drag - or, at least, I hope it's a man in drag or I've just been to the ladies loo! If all the above sounds like nitpicking then maybe you'll be perfectly happy at this hotel. It is, after all, clean and reasonably priced compared to many hotels in Amsterdam. Lots of people seem to like it, as evidenced by the Trip Advisor rating. If, however, the above sounds like IT WOULD REALLY WIND YOU UP... (remain calm)... then find somewhere else or the place will surely drive you bonkers - like the people who designed it!", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is out of this world!\u201d", "Author": "Breukleen", "ReviewID": "UR116285410", "Content": "First of all, I loved the location: steps away from the #5 tram which takes you to all the attractions in a matter of a few stops, and only one train stop away from the airport.

Not much happening in a direct vicinity of the hotel, but it's a nice setting to come back to after a day of sightseeing.

Self check in/out, fresh food for purchase in the lobby, Mac computers and printer, plus free wi-fi throughout the hotel. The lobby is very welcoming, and comfy. The room: was small, as noted in other reviews, but the way it was arranged made it functional. I wished it had a closet to hang the clothes though. With two luggages, and carry-on's we found ourselves with little room to put away our baggage. The bed: super comfy and clean, with a European style duvet sheets. There were even extra pillows in the drawer under the bed. The cool factor: the shower cabin and the toilet are built into capsules, that look like something from the future. The wash basin is small, but it okay. The TV remote is actually a master controller of many things: lighting (including mood lighting), wake up alarm, A/C, window shades, and of course, the TV.

The location was one of the best features for us, but may disappoint those looking to stay in the middle of the city. One can hop on the 5 tram at the Prinses Irenestraat station directly across from the hotel and be in the middle of the city in about 5 minutes. Even better, when you get tired of bumbling through crowds in the city center, you can be back on the hotel's quiet street in the same 10 minutes. The only potential complaint we could have about the hotel is that the standard room is a bit too small for any kind of an extended stay, but the hotel seems more geared towered weekend visitors or short term business travelers. The only problem we had personally was that the \"mood pad\" the hotel proudly touts on their website wasn't working. We asked the front desk staff about it on our way out to see some sites, and it was fixed by the time we got back. So: not a problem at all!

The bed is indeed huge but very firm, and the \"tubes\" for the shower and toilet are novel if nothing else.

The moonpad in each room is designed to control all aspects of the ambience - temp, lighting, TV, music, etc. - but at least in our room it couldn't be off its charging pad for more than a couple of minutes before the battery died. Also, the wireless internet was truly worthless. We could not connect at all most of the day, and during off-peak hours when we could connect it was painfully slow. There are several computers in the lobby for guest use, but again they were tough to get on except at odd hours. The canteen is convenient if you need a quick bite to eat, although it's egregiously overpriced and even the selection of food seems to lean toward trendiness (sushi, spring rolls, etc.). Unfortunately there are few other nearby choices. The location is nice if you don't want to overload your senses by staying in cental Amsterdam. It's easily reachable by rail from the airport and then it's a quick and easy tram ride into the city. Be aware if you're a night owl that the trams do stop running fairly early and the options for returning after that are quite limited.

It also has to be said that the reception staff were very helpful indeed, especially Deara. I travel quite a bit and cannot remember someone being as pleasant and genuinely helpful as she was and is a real credit to the hotel. The rooms are very original and have an oriental style to them (the ethos of the whole hotel in fact) and the toilet and shower with their multicoloured lighting was an interesting touch. Also if you can, get a room on the higher levels with a city view of the World Trade Center, which looks fantastic at night.

First of all the location may seem a bit random but it's within easy reach of the centre (10 mins on the tram which is round the corner from the hotel) and 5 mins from the train station (World Trade Centre) which takes you to the airport for EUR 3 in 10 minutes! You might want to take a taxi to get to the airport though if you don't want to go around trying to find the hotel from the train station (although it's not hard). The first impression is really good, you come in and use the machines to check in, someone will help you with that. The ground floor area has lots of seating and modern facilities. The canteen is open 24 hours and sells snacks more than actual meals. It's a bit pricey but if you want something it's there. They also do cocktails at the bar which is a plus! I bought breakfast from a supermarket we found in town but it's not that pricey to get something small in the morning. I wouldn't recommend paying EUR 10 for their breakfast special though as it's only juice, a croissant and yoghurt. The hotel room is the fun part, it's got a remote control that controls the whole room. You can change the temperature, the colour of the lighting to suit your mood, control the blinds... there's playlists on the TV for when you're getting ready to go out, loads of movies to choose from and normal tv. The shower and toilet are two separate pods, the toilet having frosted windows. The showers are completely transparent so you might feel a bit awkward taking a shower stark naked in front of your roommate (if they're not your partner!) but don't worry there's a white mesh curtain you can draw which although you can still see the outline, makes you not so exposed and it's not too bad really! The room is small though and can be difficult to manoeuvre, it's best for hand luggage sized suitcases and you'll need to be tidy otherwise you'll trip over your stuff! The bed is really comfortable and the tv is on the wall so you can watch tv and fall asleep. Overall it's a really good hotel, and really cheap so it's worth staying there and taking the tram into the centre since hotels there are more expensive and a lot older!", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Navi Mumbai, India", "Title": "\u201cVery innovative concept - very, very innovative\u201d", "Author": "vcchicago", "ReviewID": "UR115177958", "Content": "This is a very unique concept hotel.

We were greeted immediately when we went in and were checked in very quickly even though we had arrived earlier than the check-in time. The room itself is small but not at all claustrophobic. There's a small area to hang some clothes just in side the door and there is a safe underneath that, which is quite small you could probably only get one laptop in it. Beside that is your toilet and across from that is the rain fall shower.Then there is the fabulous bed which is as wide as the room and square so you can sleep facing which ever way you want. There is also a little desk and a chair and additional storage under the bed which would fit maybe 2 large suitcases so we had no issues with storage. Getting to and from the city is a breeze, you just catch the number 5 tram across the road from the hotel which runs maybe every 10 minutes. From there it only takes 5 minutes to get to the Rijksmuseum, The House of Bols, The Van Gogh museum and a few more I can't recall. It takes maybe another 5 minutes to get to Dam Square which is very central. The only problems I encountered were that on the first night we stayed we came back to the hotel in hopes that we could get something to eat nearby. It wasn't too late maybe 9pm and we asked if there was anywhere around and we were told to walk up the street along the tram line and there would be loads of places, which there was but they were all closed. I would have thought the people working in the hotel would have to have a good knowledge of the local area but it didn't seem they did as we asked about getting a train another day and they told us to go to the wrong platform, thankfully we asked in the station and they sent us in the right direction.

I was traveling with a male friend and although I am not a prude it was a shock to me to find out that the hotel did not have any double beds so we made do. The first thing I noticed about the room was that the shower was encased in all glass in the middle of the room (a little strange I must say). I got used to it and it turned out to be quite fun. I did however make my \"guy\" friend leave the room when I wanted to shower though haha. Check out the pics I've attached. The staff I must say was phenomenal!! They were sooo helpful and knew a lot of about transportation and help arrange so tours for us. Thanks guys! This hotel is in the southern part of the city ( I preferred to stay away from \"downtown\" this time and very glad I did). Staying here allows you to explore new and exciting parts of Amsterdam as well as still be \"in touch\" with the goings on at Dam Square. There is a tram and bus stop right outside of the hotel which makes it very convenient. You can get to just about anything from the tram stop; Museumplein, Leidseplein and Dam Square. The Amsterdam Zuid WTC station is right behind the hotel and is how we got there from the airport. The Amsterdam Olympic Stadium is only a bus ride away too! I could go on and on but I won't.

While it was a nice hotel, it wasn't worth 250 euros per night (which was a deal in that area) - 10 minutes away via a tram across from the hotel, the CitizenM is an amazing value, and delivers everything it promises and more. The one problem I had? The rooms cater more to European outlets, and after mentioning US plugs in the room, I didn't bring my adapters. Turns out there's only (1) 110V AC US based plug-in, which is by the sink, pretty hard to charge / use a laptop. Besides that tiny design flaw, it was amazing. Yes there isn't a desk for writing or getting expense reports done, but you're in a chic modern hotel in Amsterdam. You shouldn't be doing that, and quite honestly I found it quite hard to get get into any type of proper 'work' mindset with such an amazing city. The room I was in was spotless, I honestly looked for even 1 fingerprint, smudge, or anything on the glass shower capsule.. nothing - That was very welcome. After a day in the city of Amsterdam, not being up for going back out to the bar / red-light district for a drink, I chose the 'Canteen' which is centralized in the very 'chic-modern' living room motif lobby they have. The bartenders were amazingly friendly and even offered me advice on local attractions and places to go and experience (better than the tourist guides you can get) The croissants I found were very good, I'd personally scout them out around 5-6AM when made on site (or delivered from a bakery) because the aroma filled the lobby floor, I found them to be amazing. After a week of having their 'breakfast basket' which includes a croissant, I went back to NJ, had a croissant, and threw it away. Trust me, the food is great at the Canteen, and even includes Sushi / Teriyaki sticks in addition to ice-cream and a full bar. I never had one problem with the control, but then again I'm an IT consultant. I found it amazingly easy to use, and never had to contact the front desk to due to 'a buggy remote' - Sometimes it took 2-3 seconds to respond upon wake up, but think of the technology that's inside, and give it a second to load. At 99 euros, this place is better than a hidden gem, I'll be back (with my CitizenM card still on my luggage, so no need for a new one, apparently they save your preferences and settings as well) on June 12th in a few weeks, looking forward to it Thanks again guys!", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201ctrendy hotel - best bed ever...\u201d", "Author": "SuperSigne", "ReviewID": "UR112039267", "Content": "A very small but functional hotel room.

We realised that the time we'd be spending at the hotel would be limited, however, we still wanted somewhere comfortable to come back to after a day's exploration of the city. I'm happy to say that CitizenM did not disappoint. On arrival, your introduction to CitizenM quickly confirms that this isn't your typical hotel. There's a great deal of open space within the lobby area, with TVs, artwork, comfortable chairs, tables, workstations and a large 24hr refreshments area, selling food and hot and cold drinks. There are guests milling around, chatting and relaxing and I have to say that I liked it. It felt informal, friendly and laid-back. The check-in process was largely automated, but there were plenty of staff on hand to help out if needed. The rooms were like no other that I've stayed in before. Everything is contained within a single space, with the powerful shower and WC enclosed within opening 'capsules'. The bed was incredible - huge and very comfortable. The entertainment provision is excellent, with a large flat-screen TV and a wide selection of channels (including free movies). The one possible drawback is the hotel's location. It's a 3 minute walk from the WTC square, which would clearly make it ideal if you were visiting those offices on business, but it's a reasonable distance from the city centre. However, you very quickly learn what your options are in terms of transport into the various areas of the capital. There's a tram stop minutes from the hotel that will take you to the museums and galleries (and then allow you to connect to the centre), or you can catch a metro train from the WTC square straight into the heart of the city. Not having the hotel within walking distance of the centre simply means that you need to plan your day a bit more wisely and know how you're going to get back in the evening...and there are always cabs. I would also add that the hotel is very easy to get to from the airport - only 3 or 4 stops on the train - it's really not worth paying for a taxi. Check the location details on the hotel's website for more info. The area around CitizenM doesn't have much in the way of entertainment, particularly on the weekend when the nearby offices are shut. Again, this didn't really cause a problem, as the hotel 'lobby' is perfect for sitting in and relaxing and refreshments are available from the 24hr cafe. Furthermore, I'd imagine that most guests will be heading into the centre for their entertainment. CitizenM met our requirements perfectly and did it with style, comfort and convenience. It would be perfect for those who intend to spend most of their time in the city and only really need to come back to the hotel to sleep.

Bar area great to look at, Macs handy for web access (free), and the minor down-side of being a little out of town is well compensated by the quiet location (slept really well here) and the ease of getting into town on the number 5 tram. Hint: when arriving at Schipol airport don't get a taxi (about 35 euros), as the Station Zuid is one quick stop down the line with a 6 euro ticket. From there the hotel is a 5-minute walk - go out of the main exit, straight on under the tram, 2nd right. When in Station Zuid get a tram travelcard, eg 72-hour pass gives you unlimited use of all trams for 15.50 euros. The clock doesn't start ticking til your first journey so you can still buy it the day before you start using it.

Get a travel pass from one of the machines at Station Zuid - valid on trams, metro and buses including the night bus service. Hotel was easy to find and as I was on an early incoming flight it was great that I could check in straight away at 10.30am. Check in is all self service, there was a member of staff there to help but she was helping someone else so I didn't get a greeting at all or any contact with the staff The funny thing about check in was the option of 'garden view' or 'city view' ... the first being directly into the block of flats on one side, the other the street ... throughout the hotel, there are lots of quirky and humourous statements and I'm not sure whether this was meant to be one of them ... The rooms are all the same - quirky and small ... They are great if you are on your own and staying for only a couple of days. I didn't find the mood system as exciting as some other reviewers ... it was fun for a few minutes, but quickly became a little annoying as often it was unresponsive The rooms are small, no other word for it. But they serve their purpose. Storage space is VERY poor - a tiny rack with 3 hangers on it - this was just about enough for me for 2 days, but any longer and with two people in a room it wouldnt have been enough. The only other storage is the big drawer under the bed where I ended up having to throw everything Standard European hotel so there was no kettle in room (there would have been nowhere for it anyway!). Toilet and shower are just in the middle of the room ... frosted pull round doors on toilet and clear on shower ... so if you are sharing, make sure you know the person really well or it could be a little uncomfortable .. As per other reviews, if you want to do any work in your room, there is nowhere to do this other that laying on the bed I had a look in the cafe/bar downstairs - a reasonable selection of sandwiches and other snacks but very overpriced and the quality was distinctly average. I ordered a coffee to take away and that was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.50 ! Given that the room rates are good, they seem to be trying to get this back by charging far too much downstairs There are restaurants and cafes and a few small shops on the area - head back to Station Zuid and go through to the other side. Take note that as this is a business area, a lot of places are closed there at weekends (this also includes the transport office) Wifi in the hotel is excellent - free, connects first time and good strong signal. There are also four free terminals in the lobby with a printer that actually works and was also free (other hotels take note - wifi is not an oportunity to make money !!) All in all a good hotel if you can secure a good room rate. It's not overly central so one to avoid if you don't want to spend a lot of time on public transport. A lot of effort has gone into the hotel design and when I visited, it still looked clean and fresh. Less effort seems to have gone on staff interaction - apart from ordering a coffee, I hardly had any acknowledgement from the staff although there were plenty of them around.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLight and shadow\u201d", "Author": "metatraveller", "ReviewID": "UR99139204", "Content": "The citizenM is a stylish hotel with some drawbacks, you have to know.

This place particularly stuck out (a) $$ lower than comparable hotels and a new boutique so probably strove to impress (b) Location seemed right--easy to get to from airport and close to major trains/buses (Ams Zuid sta. is 5 min walk; locals right across street) but not in heart of city which would have been loud; and (c) wifi/computers and availability to print tickets or directions was very useful, all made it sound appealing. We were there from June 27th to July 3rd, 2010. Checked in no problem pretty early (1100a) after flight from MSP and took 2 hr nap. Rooms are exactly as advertised--really clean, 'boxy', trendy, but not a place you'll hang if the weather turns sour (downstairs bar isn't bad though). Underbed storage was plenty as Pooh and I both stowed our roll-a-boards under there with room to spare--little light on hangars though if you've got 'traveling' clothes. Loo has fogged/opaque glass so there is some modicum of privacy--warning, I don't remember a fan though!!!; the shower not so much--glass and exposed, but it's a great waterfalll shower [or you could option the wand] and didn't seem to run out of hot water. Ask for more towels--even with the funky drain system you tend to get water on the floor outside the cylinder. Remote pad took a little getting used to [specifically for the window shades] and since I didn't play with it ad nauseum and put it back in its cradle, I didn't really have an issue with low battery often noted. Check out was equally a snap, took < 5minutes at 0500 in the morning. Always seem to be plenty of [young, mind you] staff (even late at night about 3 milling around) so any complaints (I had one about heater--fixed; one about 'critter'--sorta fixed) are usually dealt with fairly quickly. Friends from PHX also got three rooms and they seems to like it as well (3 adults, 1 teen, one preteen--heads up on those latter two, for the adult channels gratis in room). Didn't option the breakfast but the a la carte munchies weren't too expensive...beer on tap flows until any time of the night. Really no complaints and got what we expected/was reviewed--probably stay at the one in Scotland when we go there as I see it's now opened. The only 'wish' for this would be either two twins or slightly bigger 'similar' rooms that hold more than two folks--be nice to travel with Dad or brother or friend and be able to have two non-partners in same room for slightly larger charge. For just leisure travelers with no kids and not needed a bunch of the business-related stuff found at many hotels, this is a great alternative...

If I am traveling to a city that has a CitizenM hotel, I will without a doubt be staying there. I have never stayed at a hotel in this price range with such a high level of quality, services provided, comfort, cleanliness, location... the list goes on. I found the neighborhood to be great. It was quiet but still had restaurants if we felt like staying out of the city center. The tram, one of the main lines, runs right by and it was very easy to make it to the places we wanted to go. It was also a brief walk from the train from the airport. Very easy! The lobby was huge, clean and very comfortable. The room was large enough for what my wife and I needed. Our huge American Tourister luggage fit in the drawer under the bed, a nice way to keep it out of sight and declutter the room. The bed was AMAZING! It was the best hotel mattress I've ever slept on. It was also very large, especially by European hotel standards. I really appreciated the free English tv movies (and two free channels of porn!) as a way to end the day/night. The shower was great, as was the entire list of bathroom amenities. No need for plug converters, there is a US one built into the vanity. The one \"complaint\" I've heard about the shower is the lack of privacy. This was not an issue for my wife and I, we've seen each other in the buff before. I think this is more of a concern for the natural \"prudeness\" of us Americans. If you are traveling with someone you'd rather not see nude, a short trip down to the lobby would be more than acceptable. There are plenty of TVs to watch down there, food to enjoy in the canteen (Heineken Extra Cold on draught, how I miss thee), or even using the complimentary iMacs. I found the staff to also be great. Of course CitizenM lacks the charm of a B&B or even a small family run hotel. But, the staff really does a great job of helping with anything we had asked (suggestions, checking in our luggage, phrases, directions).

If you like your hotels fuss free, modern and comfortable this is for you. My partner and I booked a trip to Amsterdam for my birthday. I was looking for a cheap comfortable hotel and this was by far the cheapest I could find and I was surprised to see how popular and so modern it was. The hotel is placed a convenient 15mins from the main central station in Amsterdam on tram line 5 and handily the tram stop is a few yards from the hotel. On arrival we were greeted by an ambassador on taken through the self check in which only took a few mins. Once we did that we headed to our room on the third floor. The rooms are so well designed, they are small but totally functional. The bed takes up the entire width of the room and is at the far end under the window. You are supplied with very comfy large pillows (with 2 more in the drawer under the bed) and a very soft large duvet all linen is white and clean. The large window has venetian blinds built in and for total darkness a black out blind comes down from the ceiling. The flat screen tv on the wall, provides music (although a bit generic and lift like) also BBC channels and free movies - and there is quite a selection, we watched a movie each night. The tv is set up when you walk in the room to take you through the room features via the 'mood pad' which looks like a remote and controls the lighting, tv , temperature and blinds. There is a VOIP/ Skype phone in the room which I used to call home and I can confirm it was free! Initially a little dubious of the shower 'pod' as it had no frosting on the glass I soon forgot about it, but I would advise that if you are shy or sharing with someone you are not happy stripping off in front of then this could be a problem! There is a curtain by the bed which pulls accross but it is fairly transparent. It is a large shower, definitely big enough for two and the water comes out directly above you. Shower gel is provided. The toilet is a pod did have frosted glass but little in the way of sound proofing! Turn the tv up...! There is a full length mirror this turns round and on the other side is another mirror which has a built in hairdryer (better than usual hotel hairdryers) and both a european and uk plug socket - genius! The sink is separate freestanding and next to the mirror unit and soap is provided. Underneath is a bin tissues spare loo roll and a couple of plastic cups. Also in the room in a very stylish chair, small bed side tables attached to the bed. The is a very small area by the door for hanging clothes, only 3 hangers the main place to keep clothes is under the bed in a drawer - it will take a case. By the door is a room safe operated by code which you set yourself. Towels were changed everyday and the bedclothes changed on our 2nd day (we stayed 3 nights) I was surprised how quiet it was on our floor, I expected to hear lots of noise from ajoining rooms but apart from the odd creak now and then nothing kept me awake. The communal area downstairs is straight out of a design magazine, lots of little social areas for sitting, with books and TV's around. There are also Mac's for going online - free of course. The Bar/cafe is well stocked, slightly pricey in my opinion - especially alcohol but the coffee is completely awesome so I didn't mind paying for the quality. You can pay in cash or charge it to your room. It's open 24hrs. Check out is 11am and completely painless, with staff on hand if you have any queries, you also get to keep your room key for future use as a luggage tag! If you are wanting an inexpensive quality hotel conveniently located you'd be daft not to stay here.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOne of a kind experience!\u201d", "Author": "Costasxlv", "ReviewID": "UR92843742", "Content": "Excellent hotel, very modern and great design!

The hotel lobby was cool and trendy with a nice bar located centrally. Finding the hotel from the airport was no problem at all, a train from the airport for a few mins to the very first stop amsterdam zuid, hten literally a 2 min walk and you are at the hotel. We arrived too early to check in but you could pay a 20 euro early check in fee and could check in early. We didnt do this as felt it a little cheeky. A room was obviously ready if we could pay to go to it and we felt having already paid for the room, this should not be the case. However thats about the only bad thing I can say about this place. It was excellent. The staff were brilliant, always friendly, always helpful. The room was great. Small enough for girls maybe who might want to do make up and all the rest as there is just a stand alone wall mounted sink and not really places for whatever make up and that girls normally have around the place. But the room is plenty sizeable for two people. No problem at all with the size. The mood pad is cool and not only does it change the mood colour but you can also use it as tv control or indeed to play music on the tv with a selection of themed music stations (pop, VIP area, dance hits etc.). The bed is the best thing about the room - huge and so comfortable. The duvets are soft and keep you warm - the bed was amazing. Shower a little weird given the glass is not frosted around it like it is around the toilet - but as was just me and gf it was ok - she seen it all before!!! But might be something to consider if travelling with a friend or brother or something. The location is a little outside the centre but there is a tram stop right outside for the number 5 tram which brings you into the heart of the ity in 10, 15 mins and also has stops at the mueseums and main shopping areas. Bar is a little pricey and breakfast is grand - nothing too special. The food here may be the least attractive thing about the hotel for me.

Getting there: Took the train from schipol airport to Zuid station, took around 8 mins i think. Then its a few minutes walk to hotel. Cost of train 2eur each. Felt safe enough walking from station. From Centraal take tram 5. Check-in: Done on self-service machine, took a couple of minutes. Staff there to assist if needed. You can pick city or garden view at check-in and was able to add an extra person for free if you booked room for 1, also able to add breakfast or late checkout at this point.Check out was done in the same manner. Rooms:I absolutely loved the rooms. The room isnt huge but there was more floor space than in other european hotels i've been in. The bed is huge and duvets and pillows were all soft and clean. Extra pillows were under the bed alongside extra towels. the underbed storage space could be used for luggage and there was a few hangers above the safe for coats. There was shampoo and shower gel in the rooms which smelled gorgeous. We requested toothbrushes at reception were given them for free alongside toothpaste. There is a hairdryer in the room which is attached the a mirror with lights attatched. The mirror can be flipped, with a full size mirror at the other side. The toilet is in the room, inside a \"pod\", the glass was frosted and there is also a kind of privacy curtain which can be used to split the room. The shower is in another pod, without frosted glass. It can be used normally or in rain shower mode. It is very spacious and fantatsic in rain shower in. Both the shower and toilet had lighting above them, which can be controlled using the mood pad. The mood pad, is used to control the temperature, lighting, tv etc. The tv had loads of channels including bbc, cnn. there was loads of free on-demand movies and was quite up to date with films like shutter island, shrek 4 etc. There were also adult movies, which you can block if you like.The TV was a wall mounted plasma. The alarm on our mood pad was unreliable, but we had been warned about that. There was also a phone in the room which we didnt use. The temperature was fine and easy to control/change.There was an electronic safe. The rooms had free WI-FI access. We felt the rooms were great and couldnt fault them. Hotel lobby: The hotel lobby was made upof several \"living rooms\" which looked like IKEA showrooms. There were several TV's throughout the lobby. There was also iMac computers which were free to use.You could also buy everything from magazines, socks to condoms and \"personal massagers\" in the lobby. CanteenM: Was open 24hrs a day. It was reasoanbly priced for drinks 2.50 euros for soft drinks and also served food like sushi and curry which was a bit pricier. Breakfast was great, you could get a grab and go bag for 9.95 eur which i didnt buy. There was a choice of coffees, teas, fruit, pastries, rolls, cheese, yoghurt etc. The bar was also great, serving huge measures. Location: The hotel is next to Zuid station/ WTC. It is about 10 mins from Leidesplein by tram and about 15-20 mins to Centraal. Trams are really regular, several an hour and you can get nightbus 358 from Centraal to hotel too.

It is very easy to get to from Schipol airport and is only 5 minutres easy walk from the Amsterdam Zuid station. But it is a long way out of the city centre and the immediate area is souless and is short of amenities. The hotel is well serviced by the number 5 tram line, with two stations (Zuid and Princess Irenstraat only being 5 minutes away. But then it is about 20 minutes to Dam Square (actually just at the back of the Palace). 20 minutes doesn't sound very long, but considering that you have to wait perhaps 10 minutes for a tram and then we found that the trams were full and quite often standing room only, it does detract from a short stay.

The hotel is an ideal base for people wanting to explore Amsterdam and surrounding area.

A quite location about 10 mins by public transport to city centre. As we travelled by car, we made use of the P+R parking in the Arena (Bijlmer), this is 6 Euros per day per car and includes return tickets for all passengers (1 hour tickets) to anywhere you want. Arena is about 10 mins by underground to Zuid (WTC) where the hotel is located. The hotel itself caters for the more adventures traveller, lobbies and rooms are sleek and uses every inch of space possible. The rooms are small but have all mod coms with a modern twist, basically all you need for a good night's rest. The lounges are made to feel like living rooms, lounging all around. I would only recommend to have breakfast, snacks and coffee/tea at the hotel, breakfast is pretty much continental. You can pre-order breakfast when checking-in for just under a tenner. We did opt to get Breakfast direct at the bar, which came to the same price but at least you can have what you want. Snacks seem to be Japanese based (sushi, green teas, sashimi,....) The only minor point (if you want to call this a minor point) is that this is an in-personal place, don't go here if you like a talk/chat with hotel manager, room service, concierge, etc.... This is a self-service hotel. If you like gadgets, timeless pieces of art/furniture, lounging, podding, wifi-ing, staying incognito with all mod coms you can thing of than this hotel is for you.

We did not experience any problems with the moodpad as related in the previous reviews. Staff was very nice and always willing to help. I think that the only minus about the hotel is its location. While very conveniently located to get to from Schipol airport (only a train stop), it is a bit far from the mais attractions. Yes, there is a tram stop just around the corner. But if you want to go to a restaurant at night, I suggest you do not get back to the hotel to go out later or you might get a bit lazy just thinking that your ride back town would take another 20 minutes.

I was not impressed with the color themes, it seemed a lot of trouble. the coffee in the morning was delicious though not the cappucino, it was cold and the cup was hald full. you have free access to the computors which is really great and . The tram station is just across the street and tram 5 will take you to leideplein, and there is a train station 3 minutes away from the hotel which will take you to schipol airport for 2.5euros.you can always walk to leidsplein and it takes around 45 minutes!!! one last thing don't take the 9 .9 euros breakfast. it's not a good deal. We ate 2 croissants, one egg, 2 pcs of cheese , one juice and 2 coffees in the hotel for around 11 euros. so buy each item that you need separately. would I go there again: definately, its clean and convenient, and the staff are friendly", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing & Affordale hotel especially for the budget traveller\u201d", "Author": "theals", "ReviewID": "UR84503439", "Content": "My wife and I found out about citizenM when it was voted as one of the trendiest hotels of 2010.

Although it was 20-25 mins from the city by tram, the trams were easy to use and ran late. The neighbourhood was nice, with some good cafes and shops a tram stop or two away (and it's always nice to see non-tourist areas of a city). I like the idea of food being available 24/7 to purchase (especially when there are no shops within short walking distance). However, it fell down on value for money. At 114 euro a night I wouldn't call it a budget hotel, especially when it is so far out of the city. In other cities this usually indicates cheaper prices. A non-cooked breakfast of 9.99 euro is extremely high. Other things were more reminiscent of a budget hotel rather than the price, such as the water (handbasin as well as shower!) not working on a Sunday morning for at least half an hour as everyone was apparently showering - not acceptable in a hotel of that price in my opinion, and the staff member I spoke to didn't sound suprised about it - they really should book less people in or buy a larger water tank.

And to say I was disappointed will also be eligible for an award - the understatement of the year 2010 ! To the point, the following were my issues and they started from check in and ended at check out: 1) the hotel had check in time of 0200PM and check out of 1100AM (with extra costs for extensions) ! I dont know if that is general business practice, but I sure felt short changed. So if one stayed for just 1 night, one would be getting just 21 hours against the 24 hours they paid for (12.5% less) 2) the hotel had crammed the most rooms into the real estate it had available(which was not much), with the result, each room was just a rectangle of 12'X8'. Since there was not enough space for a separate bathroom, they did the \"design innovation\" of having circular glass bath and toilet cubicles and an open wash basin 3) the circular wash basin was just 14 inches in diameter and worse was out in the open, with the result, even washing one's face was impossible without getting half the room wet 4) there was no space for keeping one's luggage at all...except for a pull out draw under the bed. No shelves for keeping one's clothes etc...with the result that one had to operate out of the suitcase, literally. And how the hotel expected the guest to do that in a pull-out-draw-under-the-bed scenario is beyond me ! 5) the shower in the circular bath cubicle wouldnt work unless the cubicle is closed shut by sliding the doors. Now, we all know when we open the shower, atleast 2 litres of ICE COLD water will come out even if we have turned the shower setting to hot water, as this is the water in the plumbing pipelines that gets expelled first. I am sure the hotel enjoys hearing all the 'ooh's and 'ouch'es when guests enter the shower and get dumped with ice cold water before they can get hot water running 6) the bed was wall to wall, with three sides closed out and only the fourth available to get off and get on from. So if its two of you, one has to climb over the other to get off/on. 7) I am not sure if the fire escape is as per standards....as it was steps that were quite narrow and steep..... thank god there was no need for me to use the same when I was there 8) apart from shampoo and a soap (changed once in 3 days), there was no other cosmetics offered. 9) the much advertised moodpad that I had in my room was simply showing \"Wait...connecting to room XXX\" for about 90% of my time in the room Compared to where I had stayed just the previous day(sorry, can't help comparing - Hotel Pearl, Frankfurt), the difference is as between heaven and hell. The hotel has plastered a lot of \"CitizenM says......\" all over the property...well, I couldn't help thinking, it sure says a lot more than it does.....

The mood pad was an excellent feature and my partner was happy messing around with it changing light colours, blinds etc whenever we were in our room.

Location wise I would say was perfect, far enough from any noise but near enough for a short taxi ride into the popular areas such as Leidseplein. A nice small bar in the lobby was perfect for a wind down before bed or a quick croissant and a juice of a morning. All in all definately value for money. The only negatives I would say were apart from the manager, the reception staff were slightly rude and unhelpful and when asked a question or a request gave a bit of a huff and puff but don't let that put you off, maybe this is the dutch way.

Breakfast: We had breakfast every morning in a prepackaged bag that contained: croissant, fruit, jam, butter, yoghurt, juice and coffee from the bar. Full and healthy but still not much freedom of choice. However, it is well worth the 9 euros since Amsterdam does not really have much to offer other than junk food for that price. Rooms: The concept of the rooms is futuristic. They have managed to fit many things and keep it very functional at the same time. It is not particularly spacious though. The bed is very comfortable (a third of the room is the bed) and the TV offers a wide variety of free on-demand movies (and music as well). The fact that you can customize the lighting and the music to the mood is very fun. Staff: the staff is amazing, definitely the strongest advantage for this hotel. Young and enthusiastic, from various locations around the world, they are willing to offer the best service possible. They gave us great tips about the city. A big thank you to all. Services: The hotel has an excellent bar with some cold dishes (some microwaveable as well). Also available is a great lounge (very stylish as the rest of the hotel) with many TVs and books.

No coffee/tea options in the room. - The concept of a space age glass enclosure for the shower is great, but it would not close completely and the shower kept turning off when it the enclosure opened up by itself. - The toilet is also another glass bubble/enclosure in the room with very little privacy.

As a first time booker with them I thought this was exceptionally helpful. I can only imagine that they had the space available to help us and were able to be generous, but nevertheless, we were really impressed that they were so accommodating. The hotel is great. We're not the most conventional people so the little touches like the mood pad, the \"tubes\" in which you shower and toilet, and the Macs available on reception, to the art book collections (and the saucy poster by the lifts - don't view if you're a prude!) and the really high end free shower gel/shampoo all made us feel that we were somewhere that understood the kind of travellers we are.

The room was lovely, with the bed so comfortable that we spent one whole day not moving from it, watching the range of free high end movies. To add to earlier comments, we didn't stumble over any \"adult\" content, although others seem to have found it freely accessible. However on the first page for the movies you have an option to block so that couldn't be easier. The other thing I'd mention is that yes, you can see each other on the loo, but you have a curtain to pull across from the bed to shield the rest of the room, and if you really want a bit more privacy, the lobby loos are the cleanest and nicest smelling public loos I've ever encountered.

For me it does not work and I will tell you why: When I stay in a hotel I want service and there is very little of that. There is not room service, no phone in the room, limited staff in the hotel and in the mornings and afternoon they are always far too understaffed for the number of people they have checking out or just wanting to ask a question. The Bar is nice and I like the atmosphere around it but the food that they sell in there is a low quality version of Pret a Manger and very much over priced. They have a microwave to heat your food up!!! Is that not what you find in a petrol station on the motorway?? Surely it can not be too hard to install a small kitchen and offer a small selection of dishes? Anyway be careful of the food on offer as it is expensive and does not fill you up so you end up spending a small fortune on rubbish. The rooms - well these are cool if you were on your own but for 2 people they are very cramped and there is no where to put your luggage so when there is 2 of you the room just looks a tip the whole time. The remote control for everything in the room is a bit too fiddly for my liking. You can not open the window to get any fresh air in the room so you would hope that the air con would work but it hardly puts any air in the room so it is just airless - you have no desire to be in the room any longer than you have to and I think that is a shame. Even if you are there for travel or business there is always a time when just lying on the bed for 30 mins reading or watching TV is nice to relax but in these rooms which as I think about it are like futuristic prison cells you just feel trapped. I am sorry Citizen M, I know some people think you are great but for me it is a no and I am going to stick to the traditional model of hotel room. BTW before you think I am an old fuddy duddy, I am 30 years old and a Man, I have traveled around the world and stayed in many good and bad hotels. You are not bad by any means but you just do not fit what I am looking for. I would say you are great at airports, but not on holiday or business.

To get to the hotel from Schipol Airport was a matter of locating the train station in the airport and from there finding the right platform, the local staff team were happy to help, at the time this was platform 3. Please note that the ticketing machines do not accept UK credit and debit cards, requiring cash or to purchase the tickets from the ticket booth. Finding Zuid Station was relatively straight forward and roughly 8mins ride from the airport, from there head right to a small grassy square right outside the station and head right again past a nursery on the right and a modern church on your left, the Citizen M is at the end of this street and approx. 200m from the square. On arriving at the Citizen M it is obvious that this is not an ordinary, generic hotel, especially for the monetary cost of staying here. As soon as entering the initial very red entrance area, it is obvious that this hotel is very, very different. The check-in area is a bank of touch screen terminals to check in or out with a staff member close by to help out if required. The hotel itself is vibrant, quirky, interesting and above all a feast for the senses. The design a mixture of contemporary/modern, kitsch and design classics through out the spacious reception area, with many volumes of design, fashion and photography literature. There is a small cafe/bar area where small snacks/breakfast items as well as drinks can be purchased and close by there are several Apple Macs for guest usage. The room is the ultimate compact design with a blend of technological gadgetary and minimal chic. The mood lighting above the shower and toilet pods, adding to the ambience. While the remote control blinds is just plain cool! The storage space is very tight but manageable for a short stay. The bed occupies a major part of the room from wall to wall and is truly luxurious offering one of the most peaceful hotel sleeps I had ever encountered. All in all incredibly comfortable... The hotel itself has a tram stop 50m (Princes Irene Straat) from it and from here to the centre of town is a 20min ride. Tram line 5 is very, very regular and approximately every 10mins a tram stops here. This service lasts till midnight with a taxi costing around 14 euros. Value for money, good location for getting to all the main sights (despite being a small distance from the city centre), trendy and chic, a hub of busy vibrant travellers and an amazing hotel experience.

Check-in was a breeze. The rooms are extremely quiet and wonderful! I would most definitely stay there again. For the price, it couldn't be beat! The bed was a king-size comfy bed with a down cover and plenty of pillows. I would advise against bringing large suitcases due to the small amount (but smart use of) space. My husband and I each had a backpack and it was nice to tuck it under the bed in a drawer. A carry on or two would also fit.

Main reason we picked the hotel was because we were a group of 4 women travelling and we wanted our own rooms so the CitizenM was good value for this as city centre hotels were much more expensive for single occupancy. We are late 30s with kids and value having some privacy and our own space. The rooms were nice and fine if you are on your own. I'm not sure I would stay here sharing with anyone due to the lack of space and privacy. Fine for one person with one suitcase for under the bed. The hotel rooms are almost too high - tech and when the mood board doesn't work it can be very annoying. On the first night I struggled to turn off all the lights; somepeople had problems opening and closing the blinds, when you increased the temp in your room the walls all creaked as they expanded and contracted and the heating seems to be in the walls. Nice things included the bed, the TV and free movies, very cheap phone calls, free wifi, ability to buy snacks and coffee downstairs; very clean rooms and plenty of towels, good hairdryer, and mirrors. In terms of location, easy to get into town on the tram and get the train to Schipol airport but like any hotel not in the city centre not convenvient if you want to go back for an hour in the evening due to the trip in and out of town, Very nice neighbourhood and a few nice coffee shops and restaurants, easy walk to the Museums - around 20 minutes .", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keighley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean, big, comfy bed in a small, but fun room with quirky shower/toilet and a big screen TV.\u201d", "Author": "Lizzz1", "ReviewID": "UR72540564", "Content": "Was a little further out of the city centre than expected, but onced we sussed out the tram system it was pretty easy to get around from the hotel.

You must be comfortable with your room-mate! The universal control for the blinds, temperature, tv, etc is a little slow to react to your input, and once in a while didn't respond at all for changing the colours of the mood lights. The breakfast is served with all \"single serving\" portions, and creates a lot of waste from the packaging (eg. plastic yogurt package, single glass jar for jam, plastic knives and forks, etc.). Hopefully citizenM recycles all of this packaging thoroughly, and composts un-eaten portions of the apples, etc (because we noticed that compared to Germany for example, Amsterdam does not appear to have as good a recycling program in place). ...really, other than this, we LOVED our stay.

If not, you can buy a 1 hour pass from the driver for 2.60. It takes 8-10 minutes to get into the city center on the tram. Hotel and Room: Fantastic hotel. Very interesting room. The mood pad worked fine in general. Music wan't working which was quite annoying and they were not able to fix it during our stay of 4 days. Staff were helpful in general. Huge bed and no noise results in fantastic sleep! The room was very clean when we checked in.

From the outside you would not think it was a new modern hotel as it looks very much like an apartment block, but when you enter you are greeted by a modern, fashionable hotel. The decor is very uptodate with inventive designs in each room. The Mood pad is great! This enables you to change the mood lighting in the room, amend music, TV and even close your blinds without having to get up off the luxurious King Size Bed. If you are a little shy then be aware of the toilet and shower. They are intergrated within the rooms as glass cyclinders which are frosted but you can still see the outline of the person showering or going to the toilet. The room was always clean and they even have a handy safe in the room for storing valuable items while you are away from your room. The staff were very friendly and were always happy to help us. The food however was a little limited and we found alot of Sushi in the fridges so if you dont like raw fish you are better off going out to eat as we did. The tram to the city centre is just across the road and Tram 5 takes you to the centre of town within 10 minutes for only 2.60 euros. Beware the trams can get full and can even break down as we unfortunately discovered! :-( Overall the hotel was great to stay in as we prefered being a little out of the city centre as it was much quieter but still had a good location as the Zuid Train station was just a 2 minute walk away and there was even a nice quiet canal nearby which we sat by and watched the world go by.

We were bowled over by first impressions from the self-service check in through to the distinctly different room. We even came to terms with the glass tubes containing the shower and the loo, the latter, perhaps with a nod in the direction of convention, being discreetly cloaked in frosted glass. The bed was spectacular in taking up one end of the entire room and in addition tp offering space it was comfortable. The mechanics of the room were operated via a 'mood' console which unfortunately for us was defective and this created a problem when it came to turning off the flat screen above the bed; so two nights disrupted sleep which particuarly agitated my wife. The staff were helpful but the first attempt at rectifying the problem was unsuccessfully done at a distance by computer and the second night attempt at contacting the service staff was unsuccessful. So although we were generally very impressed and the staff we dealt with were very helpful, we were left questioning the immediacy of the service. Facilities at the hotel were fine and very much consistent with its general ambience; that is there were plenty of free access macs, a slightly plastic self-service buffet and quite generous sitting areas. The location isn't quaint as you might expect within the canal ring but it is relatively covenient being within walking distance of the Zuid station[one stop from Schipol] and on the 5 tram route which goes into the centre. It is at the end of the upmarket Beethoven Straat which has plenty of bars and restaurants and about a 30 minute walk from the Leidseplein and the museums, not much further to Dam Square and the area around the Central Station.

We had originally hoped to stay at a B&B in Amsterdam, but were unfortunately unable to find one that we liked that still had some availability. Tip #1: BOOK EARLY! However, via TripAdvisor we came across Citizen M and decided to give it a go. We were very glad that we did. For the price, it is a great option in Amsterdam and we would definitely recommend it to others. It is a little out of the central city (12-15 mins via tram), but - like many have said before - the trams run very regularly and stop right outside the hotel. We bought 'I AMsterdam' cards which gave us unlimited travel around the city. We arrived a little earlier than the stated check-in time, but thankfully were able to access our room. There was a young lady assisting guests at the check-in/out stations who was friendly and helpful. The rooms were exactly as we expected - which was great! As we were only there for a weekend and therefore only had 2 backpacks between us, we had ample luggage storage space. Yes, the rooms are small, but not uncomfortably so. In this city, you won't want to spend too much time hanging around at your hotel anyway! The shower and toilet cubicles offer neither visual nor auditory privacy, but you just deal with that. We enjoyed the am/pm shower gels! The bed is supremely comfortable and we both enjoyed 2 wonderful nights of restful sleep. We also really enjoyed being able to access free wifi and the opportunity to relax with unlimited free movies in our room in the evenings. Bonus! We did not experience any issues with excessive noise during our stay. We didn't order the breakfast, but instead just grabbed single croissants / coffee on the run. Both were reasonably priced (by Amsterdam standards) and tasty! The staff in the cafe were always attentive and very friendly. As we had a late evening flight, we were able to store our luggage at the hotel while we explored the sights during the day. It was wonderful to be able to relax in the uber cool lounge and watch the football for an hour upon our return before heading to the airport at the end of a busy day. I especially enjoyed the great range of 'coffee table' books available. It is very easy to get to /from the hotel from the airport - just get off at Amsterdam Zuid (1st stop) and it is right around the corner. Keep in mind that some of the ticket machines at the stations don't accept coins (and most don't accept notes), so you may need to pay with your credit card, which costs an extra euro. Overall, we found the hotel to be comfortable, very trendy, friendly, convenient, fun and great value for money. As you can see from earlier reviews, many agree!

The croissant with breakfast was terrible and the yogurt was commercial, not the delicious yogurt with granola and fruit I had at another Dutch hotel earlier, so I would certainly not eat here. I really found I liked the neighborhood just a little closer to downtown from this place, so I didn't find the tram ride a disadvantage, in fact I was glad to have the chance to see the nicely designed apartment buildings and pleasant residential district to counteract the sense of cramped craziness that Amsterdam has that often feels excessive.

Also watched a bunch of free movies from a pretty extensive list of movies late at night. Huge selection of tv channels (english or otherwise). Moodpad was kind of fun to play around, with the color lights, but the idea gets old pretty quickly. Still, it does the job of being able to control everything in the room pretty much from one control. Free wifi in the rooms, as well as the free computers in the lobby when I needed to print things out. Staff was helpful but not in your face, and the lobby has all sorts of cool designer chairs and furniture and a lot of designer books should you ever get bored in Amsterdam (which is doubtful, but just in case, I guess!) Location is a bit further away, but very easy access to the tram or the bus or the metro (or if you rent a bike, you could bike it). But also good, because it's pretty quiet as well. For the price it's pretty great compared with some other hotels in Amsterdam that may be closer to the city centre, but would be much smaller. And nothing beats that huge bed. All in all, exactly what it appears to be - a very cool designy looking hotel. So, not for those who are looking for a homey personal hotel experience, because it is rather impersonal, but a great comfortable hotel otherwise. One con: the Moodpad seems to need constant recharging. I leave it out for 10 minutes, it already is a little low on battery and has trouble connecting to the room, so I need to return it to the dock to use it.

There is no space for an additional bed for them, and if they wake up early in your bed, they will have nowhere to go. - It is not the hotel to go to with someone you don't intend to know well.

Downstairs they have a well stocked bar but it is pricey (9 euros for a vodka and red bull !!!) so buying alcohol here is not advised. Foodwise it is mostly sandwiches,sushi, and cold snacks if you are peckish and want something on the go. I was a bit concerned about it's location but getting here from Schipol was easy being 1 stop on the train to Zuid station. Likewise getting into town is very easy as the number 5 tram stops just around the corner from the hotel and will take you into the town centre in 15 mins. Buy a 1,2 or 3 day pass which covers trams,metro and buses (3 day cost 15 euro) which is well worth it.

We decided to keep the cost a little less than our last trip so we booked the CitizenM. What a cool hotel!! My husband is very tech-savvy and neither of us had any issues with checking in, operating the mood pad, or anything else here. Now, it's not by the canal so if you're here for romance/a nice view you won't get it at CitizenM. I can see this hotel being perfect for business/short stays/people who can get around on their own easily. Our taxi arrived at the hotel, we checked in via the kiosks right out front (paid for very early check-in and it was SO worth it!!). Within 2 minutes we were in the elevators and walking to our room. There are \"ambassadors\" standing by to help whenever needed and provide all sorts of information if you should require/desire it. The bed was everything we had been looking forward to-gigantic! I wish I had one like it at home. Tram/Train/Bus all VERY close to hotel. We bought 24 hour passes and rode the tram all over the city. We referred to maps quite often but got the hang of it pretty quick. Coffee bar was just the thing I needed in the mornings. Fresh, strong cafe lattes. You can pick up all sorts of things to eat/drink at the little shop/coffee area in the lobby. Free movies!!! We stopped at a delicious pastry shop and stayed up watching free movies till all hours of the night. Everything is just as it should be and very well appointed for the small room. The rate was outstanding and so was the hotel. I wouldn't stay here for more than 3 nights most likely and you should really go with someone you're comfortable with (bathrooms are not very private in the room).

Fair enough, the idea of the shower and toilet in the middle of the room is perhaps only for the closest of people, and it did make the room small, but aside from that it was great.

The hotel is in a great location for tourists, -only 1 train stop direct from the airport, and then hotel is a 2 minute walk from train station. The number 5 tram stops right outside the hotel and goes direct to the town centre very frequently (we never waited longer than 10 minutes for one to arrive). It takes 10-15 minutes to get into the main town by tram. I imagine it's also a good location for business travellers as it's right by the world trade centre. The area around the hotel is up-market residential and business buildings. It feels very safe and is quiet in the evenings. The WTC business area (2 minute walk) has some bars/cafes and a Wagamama, but these seemed to shut around 9pm. The hotel itself is very stylish and clean. The downstairs area is open plan, with a bar and eating area, access to free internet, lounge areas and TVs and tables/desks for business use. All the furniture is modern and eye-catching. Background music was good and not intrusive. You check in by computer, but staff are available to assist and were very friendly. We arrived early but were able to check in straight away. During our stay, others arriving early were able to store their luggage until their rooms became ready. You can pre-book breakfast, but we just bought a pastry and coffee each morning. Small meals are available which you can heat up, along with salads/sandwiches etc. There's a very good range of hot/cold/alcoholic drinks available. The food we ate there was very nice, I'd say probably a little on the expensive side though (partly influenced by the poor exchange rate for British at present!). The room was fantastic, spotlessly clean, modern and very cleverly designed to use the space to it's best. The bed was huge and very very comfortable with great pillows/duvet. There's a massive storage drawer under the bed which we kept our 2 cases plus other bags in. There is only a small hanging area with a couple of hangers only, this could have been improved on by adding another rail above or elsewhere in the room. There is a safe which would probably fit a laptop in it. The moodpad is a fancy remote which controls the room, you can put the blackout blind up/turn tv on/control lights etc on it. The lights above the shower and loo change colour. The shower was great, despite being in the middle of the room, the doors worked well and the rest of the room didn't end up wet after you get out. The showergels provided were also nice. The loo was fine, as others have said the cubicle-arrangement is probably not for those who are bashful about their ablutions, although you can't see through the frosted glass, for some it may feel a bit revealing, - you also have a curtain which can be pulled across to separate the bed area from the rest of the room which can improve the feeling of privacy if you want.

No there is not much space for hanging stuff (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small rail with about 5 hangers on it) but for a weekend stay who really needs to unpack their entire suitcase?! The make-up mirror came with loads of shelves plus a hairdryer, so getting ready for a night out was no problem for the ladies! The self check-in and check-out was fast and simple, and there were staff on hand should you need them, all of which seemed very friendly and helpful. The boyfriend LOVED the moodpad, changing all the colours in the room and switching on the free adult movies! (Thankfully the novelty soon wore off and we watched Mamma Mia before going to bed!!).

The number 5 tram across the road takes you to Centraal Station (which takes about 15-20 minutes) and also stops by the Van Gogh museum, the Dam, and various other places.

First of all I have to say that the pricelevel is very good, the prices vary between 80 and 100 euros excluding breakfast, altough during peektimes prices can rise till 140 euro. For the location, cleanliness and rooms this is absolute value for money. The hotel is located in the South of Amsterdam approx. 20 minutes by tram from the real city center, a tramstop is just a few steps away. Hotelstaff is friendly but in my opinion their skills fluctuate, some staffmembers are very hospitable and friendly while others are unpolite and not trained enough to do their job. Ofcourse this is my personal opinion but with over 120 hotelnights a year and a job in hospitality I know a bit of the hotelworld. The rooms are all the same, equipt with a very large bed with soft bedsheets, a small table and chair is provided. The shower is supposed to be a rainshower but at Citizenm the showers are always a suprise. Housekeeping should know that they have to decalcify the stuffed waterpipes, in some rooms the shower just provides a very very little amount of water that sprays in all different directions due to the stuffed waterpipes, in other words it's almost impossible to take a decent shower. So two options; make sure there's enough waterpressure or use a normal shower! At groundlevel guests can use 4 pc's with free internetconnection and enjoy food or drinks in the Citizenm Canteen. The pricelevel in the canteen is in my opinion to high, 0.25 l applejuice, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 3.25, simple Beefsandwich in carton \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 5.50...... prices are like the pricelevel you can find at foodoutlets at Schiphol Airport. Last point of unsatisfaction: Housekeeping please change the toiletpaper after every guest, I don't want to have a few sheets as a leftover from the guest before!!

Room was great, but I never found it warm despite having the thermostat turned right the way up to the top. Plenty of TV channels, excellent free Wifi, lovely bed. Downsides were no proper work desk (laptop only just fit on the tiny bedside table), no storage for clothes (apart from 3 hangers on a tiny rail), no drawers to put other clothes in, or even tables to put your bits and bobs on apart from the 2 tiny bedside tables. Perfect for 1 person, but awkward for a couple - WC is in the room with only a see through glass panel around it, and with 2 people in the bed you'd have to climb over the other person to get in and out. Breakfast was a bit odd - you can prebook breakfast which comes in a little bag, for 9 euros, but which contained lots of things i didn't want, so I opted for my own mix and match. Which was OK but the whole experience felt a bit like being in an airport. Staff are very friendly and helpful, but the atmosphere is a little clinical.

This is a FUN hotel, not a place for business travellers AT ALL and it is mainly desgined for the YOUNG or YOUNG AT HEART crowd. This is NO place to come with kids or lots of luggage either. It is desgined for a two night stay max with light luggage, after that, the novelty will start to fade and you'll start feeling a little cramped in the small (but extremely well designed) room. Only bring someone you really know here, don't bring someone you just met, since sharing this room will be a VERY intimate experience.There is a transluscent retractable curtain that separates te bed area from the bathroom area but still, you'll be able to constantly see the other person's body shape behind it. If you don't use the curtain you'll have full view of the other person while showering. You'll also see his/her shape while at the toilet (toilet has frosted glass and NO soundproofing). The bed is 2 x 2 meters and it is VERY VERY confortable. The \"moodpad\" remote control is a fantastic thing, you can control everything with it: lights, music, shades, TV, music, etc. I found it easy to manipulate. PLENTY of free movies (even porn that you can block if you want). Self service check-in took about 10 seconds and check-out took 5, there is always someone right next to the 6 check-in booths shall you need help. I didn't have breakfast here, but I did see that is was offered in a paper bag (I didn't like this much, I'd prefer a tray). The food area layout is pretty cool, it is mainly self service with a bar in the middle. You can get plenty of different light and mainly cold dishes day and night (even sushi or champagne to take to your room). Lounge is very inviting and different from the usual hotel. Free iMacs with Internet are a nice touch. The only little annoying thign I noticed was some constant cracking noise when our above neighbours walked on the room, it didn't last much though and, luckily, did not affect my sleep or overall experience. Tram # 5 passes right outside the hotel and will take you to Amsterdam Cesntral Station in about 20 minutes, nice ride. If coming by car I would recommend you check in first and then leave your car at the Park and Ride under the Olympic Stadium not far away. If you park right outside the hotel on the street you'll pay 25\u00e2\u201a\u00ac (free on Sundays) per day and at the P+R at the stadium you'll pay 6\u00e2\u201a\u00ac plus you'll get return tickets on the tram for free (you can even get free bikes there too but you have to arrive early).

To be honest both my wife and I thought CitizenM was average. Yes its different and quirky (which can be a nice change), however it lacks in a lot of other areas. The main of these being customer service (by some staff), I didn't expect a great deal of service but when asking what method of transport best to use to get to the central station I didn't expect the answer being ..\"have a look at the websites\", and when their printer wasn't working the girl had no idea and walked of and ignored the situation. Luckily someone else staying at the hotel had the same problem and had spent time solving it before. After checking in on a late arrival (the system had issues because it said I owed $0.01??) we where told there was no hot water for showers but they where working on it. My wife nearly killed me for booking this place. By the second day we did have the hot water back, but no offer of anything not even a drink for the inconvience of having cold showers. I would hope however that the loss of hot water is a one off thing and we where just unlucky. The shower itself is a plastic tube in the middle of the room, so if your shy in front of your guest don't stay here. The toilet also is a plastic tube but at least with a frosted finish. Not a great fan of the electronic mood pad, a bit finicky and over rated, had to keep re-setting it to work properly. Not a lot of storage space, yes a draw under the bed for luggage but when your traveling on a 5 week European tour for two, not enough space. The other thing is the free CitizenM tourist map we where given did not have the hotel on it (outside the map borders) which we realised late at night trying to get back from the city. So we called the number on their map, but discovered it was no longer in use!! We finally did make it back, and I notified them of this problem, he said ..\"oh yes, that number dosen't work\"??? (CitizenM please update your map) The best thing about the rooom is the large selection of movies for free. The distance to Amsterdam city and the main shopping district is a good 25min tram ride. If you don't mind this trvel time it is a pleasent trip and easy trip and the tram stops almost directly outside CitizenM. I think a solo or business traveller, who is not too concerned being right in the city, isn't staying longer than 3 days, wants something different and likes to be more independant would enjoy this hotel. I'm probably sounding a little harsh, but honestly it is not a terrible place, they just need to address some issues and it would be fine.

I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor and seen that it won 'Trendiest Hotel in the World' award in 2010. All I can say is that it is brilliant and well worth a visit to Amsterdam just to stay there. It is also very good value. The hotel's location is in the south of Amsterdam, at the junction of Prinses Irene straat and Beethoven straat and close to the World Trade Centre. There is a tram stop close by. The number 5 tram takes you right through the city, all the way to Centraal station. There are stops on the way for Museaumplein and Leidesplein. To get to the hotel from Schipol Airport, get the train to Amsterdam Zuid station and it is a short walk from there. The hotel is very modern and stylish. It has been decked out with very expensive furniture in the lobby and has some really nice communal areas. There is a really cool bar with complimentary nuts and olives and serves cold beer. The rooms are very small but amazing inside. The theme seems to be based around intimacy. They are very modern and Japanese-style. Everything is of a futuristic concept. I wouldn't recommend going unless you are with a lover... the shower is see through and the toilet doesn't offer much privacy! I went with my girlfriend and we loved it. The bed is amazing, really big and spacious with nice linen. The staff at the hotel were great. The women at the bar recommended where to go for restaurants etc. My only complaint was that the cleaner repeatedly knocked on our door AND TURNED ON THE LIGHTS (?!?!) at 10.30am on the morning that we were due to check out. We weren't due to check out until 11am and we were asleep so I thought that was outrageous. I complained when we checked out and the staff ensured that they would speak to the cleaner and that it wouldn't happen again. I'm sure it was a one off and that it wont happen again. The cleaner probably got fired. Oops. I must say that the incident was the only indication that I was staying in a \u00c2\u00a379 hotel and not a \u00c2\u00a3200 hotel. Otherwise, it feels very luxuious. However more expensive hotels might have better attention to detail. I've stayed in some 5 star hotels with my job and none of them rival this place.

Storage is minimal however for a weekend break there is plenty. No food or drink is provided with the room, however things can be bought 24 hours a day downstairs in the shop. This is a little pricey though, so it is probably to buy something from a shop in Amsterdam and eat in your room. The location is approximately 2 miles, or 30 mins walk from Dam Square which may seem far, however you can take the tram. If you walk, you pass through Museumplein where the Van Gogh museum and Reiksmuseum are, and there are some nice bakeries on the way too! Check out was easy and all your details are stored in case you visit again.

Check in at the self check in desks is really easy - but I am part of the 'computer generation' I did see lots of other visitors struggling. There is a 'citizen' to help you if you need it - and that brings me to my only bone about this place. The staff are rubbish, in a nut shell, totally awful! Imagine a hotel being run by the same teenagers who serve you a Big Mac - with about the same enthusiasm. My sister left her mobile phone on the coffee kiosk, we went outside for a cigarette (absolutely no smoking inside the building) and when we returned it had gone. The staff on duty were not at all interested and told us what did we expect in a public area? We enquired about contacting the Police and the staff member told us theft was very high in Amsterdam and they would probably not be interested. Secondly on our final night another guest had been smoking in their room and set off the fire alarms in the hotel - we evacuated 3 times over the night as the staff did not know how to reset the alarm. Eventually a member of staff from the CitizenM at Amsterdam Airport arrived to show them how to do it - as you can imagine most residents were not in the best of spirits ... we were offered no apology - not even a cup of coffee to keep us warm while standing in the late October Amsterdam frost. I guess in a way the awesome rooms and inexpensive rate took the edge off this experience and we can look back and laugh as 2 young travellers, but I cant imagine the guests with families were so forgiving. I would certainly visit the CitizenM again, and really hope the concept grows to other large cities across the globe - as long as you don't need any help - and you can be a self sufficient 'citizen' you will LOVE it !", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cFantastic funky hotel - a breath of fresh air!\u201d", "Author": "WeekenderLeeds", "ReviewID": "UR53207095", "Content": "This hotel introduces a whole new concept to the idea of a hotel stay, and is a highly-recommended must-visit.

The hotel has a self check in service, which is fantastic and really easy to use. There is also the option to check in early (normal check in is 14.00) for 19.95 euros.

The toilet - if your a new couple, I wouln't recommend as you can hear everything and pretty much see whoever is sat on the loo too, not very romantic! The shower however is quite nice!! There are loos in the foyer downstairs though so make use of those maybe! The bed is AMAZING, I had the best nights sleep haviong the extra room with my partner and had the worst nights sleep when I got home! The rooms have different lighting sequences which you can alter depending on what your up to ;-) There is also electric blinds and black out blinds which can be operated via switch on the wall or through the 'room' remote control. The room remote control covers lights, temperature and the tv with lots of channels to scan through, even free adult films which my boyfriend found very quickly....The room temperature - it takes a while for the temperature to adjust from hot to cold and vice versa. Depending on time of year I would wack the heating up before you go out and turn down to halfway when you get back so it's nice and warm when you get back and you won't wake up during the night with a mouth like the desert! The room does make a lot or 'cracking' noises though when it's heating up, think this is just the plastic/wood expanding but it woke me up! There is shampoo, conditioner and soap provided along with a hairdryer and towels.

It's not for older people or for children, but if you are a young trendy single person or couple, and not staying too long, you could love it. Positive points are the massive choice of free films, free WiFi in rooms and computers in the lobby, cheap international phone calls (VOIP rates), computerised check-in and check-out, and the wonderful lobby area (best I've ever seen in a hotel, bar none). When in the rooms, you basically have to live on the bed, and when one person has a shower the other one cannot help seeing (clearly aimed at hot young couples). The novelty of the high-tech gadgetry wears off after one day (or when it fails to work, whichever is the earlier). Rooms are basically washrooms with a bed in, very cleverly saving space to pack more rooms into the hotel. For chilling out you have to go to the lobby, with very comfortable sofas and 2 or 3 TVs.

The hotel is conveniently located at the tram station. You can easily reach the city center within 15 minutes. The hotel itself is very stylish and new, nevertheless this innovative hotel concept had several drawbacks. The room itself is rather compact with the toilet and shower within the room. Shower and Toilet can be closed by glass doors. The glass surrounding the toilet is frosted, nevertheless you can see through it. There is also a curtain to separate the bathroom part of the room from the rest of the room, which is basically a very good idea, but for some reason this was also see-through. You got to be aware that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely no privacy when choosing this hotel. I was traveling with my husband, so this was not at all a problem, but travelling as friends under these circumstances might be weird. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest adding a nontransparent curtain to the room. The overall design of the hotel was very nice and modern. The bed was very comfortable. However we were very disappointed about the cleanliness. The room was not at all spotless. Especially the bathroom areas were not very clean (pictures attached). Another major drawback was the temperature within the room. When we arrived the room temperature was only 17 \u00c2\u00b0C. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why, but the temperature in the hallways of the hotel was much higher. After complaining to the reception we got one more blanket. They also told us, that we were the only ones complaining about the room temperature. Stepping out of the room and chatting with other guests in the hallway, this turned out to be untrue. Fortunately the room got a bit warmer at nights. Nevertheless during daytime the temperature was always significantly under 20 \u00c2\u00b0C. It turned out that the hotel had a problem with the water/energy supplier leading to the cold room temperature and cold water in the shower. Not very funny, since the outside temperature was below 0 \u00c2\u00b0C. We are aware that it was not the hotels fault but I have to say that the ambassadors were not very apologetic. Offering a hot coffee is not very generous taking into consideration that a cold room and the lack of hot water are seriously affecting the stay. The mood pad is a nice feature, but sometimes it took very long for connecting, which was a bit annoying. It also kept flashing all night through which was disturbing too. Taken together we have to admit that we were pretty disappointed. Maybe it was bad luck. The concept is great but the dirty room, cold room/shower and the lack of courtesy were not acceptable.

I'll be honest and say that when this web page downloaded I was deeply disappointed. Nothing about CitizenM ressembled what I have in mind about a \"decent\" hotel. It was way too modern for my taste. The design was too extreme and the photos I saw on their site were supporting this idea of modern,minimal style. Anyway,having no alternative since we had already made the reservation, we arrived on Citizen M on Nov 23rd. The site ofthe hotel was yet another surprise for me. It's located near...every means of transprt you can name: tram,bus,subway, train, they are all there to facilitate your transportation.This,however doesn't mean that it's noisy or uncomfortable because of that,on the contrary: this very fact is one of it's major advantages! Anyway, the minute I etered CitizenM I knew it was a love at first sight situation! The staff was excellent! They were helpful and smiling whatever we asked them for. The bed of the room is the reason I didn't want to leave!! The only reason why I rated the room with 4 stars is beacause it was a bit small. But then again,which room isn't in the entire Holland? However, every function in this room is controlled by a panel.And I mean EVERY function: the density of the lights,the color of the lights, the temperature of the room,the operation of the huge,flat TV, the \"curtains\", everything.So,if you are not really a gadget freak, you'll either have fun pressing all these buttons and finding out what they do or you'll be frustrated having to call the reception every few minutes!!

Despite some of the staff being very friendly and helpful, I had the worst stay at this hotel and I will not return. According to the manager there was a problem with the air conditioning. Unfortunately, when I asked a member of the hotel after my first night to turn up the heat in my room (it was freezing, I had to turn on hot shower to get some warm air in the room) and turn off the extremely strong and ice cold draft when lying in bed, I was told that this will be taken care of. When I came back to my room late at night nothing had changed and after spending the second night with this ice cold draft blowing directly on me, I fell ill with the flu for 7 days. My business trip turned into a nightmare. In all fairness, the manager tried to make it up to me and they gave me a hot tea the second morning when I complained, he even wrote me an email but the fact remains that he knew about issues with the air conditioning and this should not have happened in the first place. I also agree with some reviewers that the technology is ridiculous.

Getting in the city is a 15min tram ride. The tram stop is 2 minutes away from the hotel and they run every 5 minutes until midnight, which is fabulous. A taxi ride from the Oude Kerk cost us midnight around 15EUR, which is also not expensive. Welcome, lobby: although it's supposed to be a \"do it yourself\" check-in, we were actually greeted by very friendly staff, who also did the check-in for us (no big deal, just punch in the reservation number, your name and decide whether you want the South or the North side). We chose the latter, with views over the World Trade Center. The lobby has a posh cafeteria. We would not recommend booking the breakfast as it's rather expensive (19EUR per person, if I recall correctly; you can have a much more varied breakfast for 10 EUR around Leidesplein). The rest of the lobby is, basically, a showroom for Vitra furniture (http://www.vitra.com): really cool and modern, but also very comfy. Highly recommended. The coolest thing in the lobby: there are two elevators. Waiting for them becomes way enjoyable if you browse through the supersized photo album about... sex. Quite R-rated, but seems like everyone liked it, judging by the fact that almost every time someone was browsing through it. The lobby also hosts about 4 or 6 Macs with free Internet, a printer and basic Office applications. Good if you want to book a ticket for a museum, your flight ticket, check your mail or update your all-too-important blog. Room: it's not very large, but not too small either. I'd dare to say that finishing is at par with a second-class yacht: the \"wooden\" floor and ceiling match perfectly, the bed is supersized and comfy, just a bit high. There's a drawer beneath it which can hold even two large suitcases (some 70-80L each of them), provided you get the extra pillow out. The solution with the shower and loo cabins are interesting. If you're a bit shy from your partner, there's also a courtain which acts as a divider and gives you a bit more privacy. But, definitely, it's not the kind of room you'd share with your boss, or even work colleague. All rooms are standard two-persons and given the way they are \"furnished\" there's no place for a crib. So not really for families with children, unless one parent shares the room with one child and the other parent gets a second room. The only real drawback of the setup is the fact that there are only three coat hangers (and there isn't really space for more than that). The shower cabin needs some improvements: the doors don't always close perfectly. If they leave a 2mm gap, you can sort of flood the room. If they decide they want to leave a 4-5mm gap, then the interlock stops your shower; can happen any time. There's also a selector between a hand shower and an overhead shower and \"no water\"; sometimes changing from \"stop\" to hand shower would let also the top one dripping on your head.; shower cap (not included in the toiletry) highly recommended! Also the selector is more a piece of design than of functionality: try rotating a polished, chromed knob, with a 5mm pin while having a soapy hand. The moodpad is everything Phillips used us to: fancy and unreliable: sometimes it would reset itself while working on it; once it failed to actually set the wake-up call; if you watch telly and want to turn down or up the TV, it may take as long as 15 seconds to re-establish the link with the room, which is annoying at best. Plenty of TV stations, including two channels for adults; but, hey, you're in Amsterdam, so go to the RLD instead! The rooms are quiet. I mean really quiet. The only quieter room we had was in Kempinski Heiligendamm. The doors are really thick (and heavy). And since each \"container\" has also a technical hatch, there's a 30cm gap between rooms, which, sure, helps with soundproofing. Bottom line: really cool experiment, really nice and very international staff. Location is good for getting to the airport and decent for getting in the city. Prices are unbeatable and, at least when we were there, they waived the EUR 0.02 worth of international phone conversationS (that's plural!).", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWow - wish Citizen M Hotels were in every city\u201d", "Author": "Room_101_London", "ReviewID": "UR48146949", "Content": "This is a great concept for an inexpensive city stay which is excecuted excellently.

We arrived at Central Station as we missed our stop in Zuid, and hopped straight into a taxi to bring us to the hotel. At first, I have to admit, it was a bit daunting as the journey took well over 1/2 an hour by car (I was panicking as I felt I had booked a hotel in the middle of nowhere!) When we arrived, it was only 9am, but I was so tired I wanted to see this HUGE bed ASAP. We paid a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.95 early check in fee, checked in, and went up to the room. It was just like the pictures, so no surprises. I have been reading other reviews where guests said there was no luggage space, no tables and no chair. Well, there is luggage space under the bed, and quite a lot of it. There are 2 bedside tables with lamps. There is a chair (nice and comfy too). The bed is more comfortable than you could ever imagine, and is MASSIVE! (You can roll over 5 times!) And it has one of those duvets that just hug around you! The shower is loads of fun as you can use the handheld shower,or the rain shower, which is lovely (and surprisingly easy to not get your hair wet in). The two shower gels that the hotel supply are really nice (I was a fan of the PM gel). 1 bad thing though- when housekeeping came in and changed the towels, they always rolled one up and left it in the shower cubicle. This was never noticed until it was far too late and the towel was soaking. No problem really, just felt a bit bad to be leaving such wet towels for housekeeping every day! The selection of movies was great, and the moonpad was so much fun to use. We ended up keeping the coloured lights on random, and we could sleep all day if we wanted to by shutting the blackout blinds! (suprisingly the room only has 1 european socket! and we had 2 phones to charge, and a camera!) The hotel was not as far from the city as the taxi driver made it out to be. We used the Mac computers in the lobby to print out a map so we knew how to get to the city centre. It took about an hour (we got a bit lost), but when we arrived we rented bikes straight away. Cycling is the only way to travel in Amsterdam! It only then took us 10-15 mins to travel from the hotel to the city, and vice versa, We also chained our bikes to a pole beside the hotel, so we knew they were safe. One night we ordered cocktails at the bar- Mmmmm! I ordered the mobile martini (i think) - and it was purple! and the barman put a purple flower in it to float on top (and then told me it was edible- WOW!) We then bought a bottle of wine and were given wine glasses to bring up to the room. The hotel also allowed us to order a pizza,and even rang the room when it arrived. The door signs are funky (dont come in- there's someone naked in here!), the halls are brilliant, there is so many places to hang out. I loved it! Hmm, anything else? Oh the croissants are yummy and can be heated up.

Fortunately the nearest supermarket is a mere 10 min walk away. The best thing about this hotel was that it gave us a chance to get to know Amsterdam from a different perspective. Avoid the obvious red light canal Amsterdam and get to know the Concertgebouwarea, Oud Zuid , t Vondelpark, theyre just lovely areas to stroll around on a sunny day.

I am not a techie and I figured out the system in a few minutes. The location is a 20 minute walk to the museum area and 30 to central Amsterdam- through a beautiful,safe neighborhood with many upscale stores and restaurants. The tram to downtown is steps away from the front door and the train to the airport is a 10 minute walk. After a day of touring we would walk back by the FIDELIO restaurant, have a great meal, then walk a further 10 minutes to the hotel,check our email (free access) and then climb into a most comfortable huge bed with a big screen TV over it. Just perfect. DOWNSIDE: There is little storage in the room so you need to live out of your suitcase. You need to be very neat as the rooms are really small. The shower was a bit annoying as it never got really, really hot and the \"rainshower\" is just useless. You need to start the shower by closing the door and coming back a minute later so the hot water is running well. Otherwise you get doused with cold water. The sliding curved doors for the shower and toilet \"pods\" are heavy and don't always glide easily. May be tough if you are not in shape or elderly. So some minor irritants. Some unavoidable artwork is typical in your face European (you are in Amsterdam) and may be sexually offensive to some and the coffee downstairs is very expensive- a problem if you like a few cups to get you going. ALL IN ALL: A nice hotel with helpful staff I would stay again without question. We paid about 86 Euros/night and you can't do better for what you get.

The bad: I did not like the shower at all, its supposed to be a 'rain shower', its just like that, as if your standing in the rain the water is mostly missing you and spitting on you, you have to encase yourself in a glass chamber for the water to come out so if your clostraphoebic... you simply cannot have a shower. There is also no part of the cubicle that doesnt get a little water so you cant step away for a moment, when trying to turn off the taps you get squirted in the eye as you cant look up! Also, as you have to be in the shower with the door closed with nowhere to go before you get any water you test it on the hand shower first then flip to the main and bam... 2 seconds of HA HEH HA THATS COLD before it warms. The whole hotel theme is snazy and informal with a very hands off feel. This notices as your pre paid breakfast sits on a coat hanger waiting for you to pick it up (1 Croissant, pot of jam, nice coffee, 1 bottle of juice, packet of joghurt with those cereal pots on top) its all in a bag, costing 9.95euro, which i think is poor value. I would not opt for this option. You have to check yourself on a computer system, the entire bedroom is controlled by a hand console, which is not that easy to use and NOT for the technophobe. On the whole, this place suits one who doesnt like staff fussing over him, is ok with technology and an informal approach.

After flying into Amsterdam late one weekday evening, I found myself locked out of my accommodations by an overzealous painter. Needing somewhere to stay, and having heard about citizenM previously, I was impressed by managing to get a room for that night for under one hundred euro. Check-in was painless and self service, and a nice feature was that the system offered me a number of rooms to choose from. A \"pod\" concept had left me worried I'd be staying in a glorified broom-cupboard in a dingy youth hostel, but I was pleasantly surprised. Common areas were finished to a high standard and were clean, nicely designed and well kept. The room itself was of a good size: hanging area and safe inside the entrance, leading to a wet area with monsoon rainforest shower and lavatory in glass tubes with sliding doors (lavatory glass frosted), a large sink (shower and sink with complimentary toiletries), mirror with plugs, storage space and good lights, and a curtain that could be pulled over to separate washing areas from sleeping areas. The bed was absolutely huge and reached to the window, with a television on the wall over it. The entire pod was controlled from a single touch pad remote - mood lighting (including several pre-selected moods which controlled lights and background music), television, temperature and blinds. A wide range of television stations, on-demand and rolling films were also available for free. Peckish, I visited the ground floor bar and canteen. A range of sushi, snacks and salads were available for purchase - sterile and pre-packaged but, given the time of day, they served to fill a hungry stomach. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the shower brisk and refreshing. A nice touch in the morning was the choice of two shower-gels - one for the morning person and one for the more late-night among us. Check-out in the morning was equally painless and self-powered, and a nice touch was that the system emailed me my invoice to save on paper. In terms of location, it's something of an exaggeration to call this \"Amsterdam city\" - it's in the WTC business district and a 20 - 25 minute tram ride into the city centre. However, it's a nice neighbourhood and close to the Zuid/WTC train station with good connections to the airport and onward destinations as well as a range of bus and metro options. An excellent place to rest my head, I enjoyed my stay. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone in need of large amounts of wardrobe or stowage space, and the fact that the lavatory is in the room (albeit in its own frosted glass compartment) might put some off - for a brief stay, it was more than adequate for what I needed - comfortable, well designed, well serviced, but not overstuffed with unnecessary hotel services I wouldn't use or want to pay for.

My room had a great large comfortable bed, the tv is good, the place is spotlessly clean, the staff are friendly and the hotel is cheap at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac85 excluding breakfast. However there are also a number of things about this hotel that irritated me hugely so I will not be returning. The concept is sort of fun but once you get beneath the surface the fun turns into a very poor experience. I arrived late, about 10pm. I am tired so the last thing I want to do is faff around familiarising myself with a self-service check in, even when there is someone there to help. And especially when there are no queues anyway. If I want that personal touch, and make special requests - a certain kind of room, alarm call, then I have to speak to someone anyway. In the lift there is a notice about how the experience will lift your spirits. Once I am in the room the first thing I want to do is have a shower. I am looking forward to my rainshower. However the rainshower just spits little strands of water and is not true to the hotel's claim that it is like standing in warm summer rain. So I use the handheld shower instead. Once showered I have to go downstairs again to exchange a broken trouser hanger for a new one, and once I have done my ironing I go back to my room and prepare for bed. The bed is wonderful and big, very comfortable, and the tv is good. There is a lot of technology in the room, the operation of which is far from obvious, and again, when you arrive and it's late and you're tired, this is the last thing you need. Turning off the lights is no easy task because once the main lights are out the coloured lights around the shower and loo are still on, and finally (even more tired by this point) I work out that you have to press the dimmer again to turn all lights out. When I try to lower the electronically operated blackout curtain using the switch (why not have a manually operated one) I find it doesn't work. so I have to call down to reception who send someone (a nice friendly guy) to show me how to do it via the special technology console - which also operates everything else in the room - the tv, lights, wifi etc. Ok so I am ready for bed now. I place the console back in its charger and hit the sack. But a light on the console is still flashing so I have to place it in the big drawer in the bed for the night. The \"pre-made rooms\", as it describes them, have a problem. During the night I was woken by creaking, loud and frequent enough to create a disturbance. It sounded like the walls and kept me awake for the rest of the night. Breakfast. I prepaid for breakfast, saving me \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.55 over the standard price of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.50. But: not great value. There is buffet, just some pre-selected items - yoghurt with granola, small juice, pre-packed waffles, croissant, a cheap apple, and even though I am seated at the bar it is served to me in a bag rather than on a plate. And get this: whoever heard of a breakfast package where you have to pay extra for the coffee? Excellent (large) coffee, but a whopping \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.75 for the privilege. If they have to charge, then half that price would have been fair in a hotel that claims to offer good value. There is also a 24-hour cafeteria with pre-packed items for purchase, but the pre-packed fruit, sandwiches etc had condensation inside the packaging - not a good sign. Some sandwiches had so much condensation I couldn't see what was inside. A couple more things about the room. There is space to store your suitcases - in the bed - but there is almost no space to store clothes, and I always like to hang my clothes up. A tiny hanging rail with three hangers - not much use if you are staying for a few days or if there are two of you. There is no space to rest a laptop unless you don't mind working on the bed. There are some wonderful big Macs downstairs, which you can use free of charge, great, but there are too few of them for the size of hotel. In some ways - location, cleanliness and comfortable bed - this hotel is great for the price. But it is let down by some poor detail. The construction is poor to the point of being ridiculous, the technology is too complicated and unreliable - to the point of being ridiculous - and the provision of food/drink is unimaginative and unprofessional. Maybe fun as a new holiday experience, but it doesn't work for the business traveller.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cA good design hotel for a reasonbale money in a good location\u201d", "Author": "navytr", "ReviewID": "UR38890580", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in August 2009.

After viewing information online, we were ready to really enjoy our stay at CitizenM Amsterdam City. We liked the attitude, the concept (affordable luxury) and the whimsical approach to their marketing. Indeed, the youthful staff was attentive, friendly and dealt courteously and efficiently when issues arose - and they did arise. The lobby is wonderfully designed and has plenty of area to sit and use the IMac computers, read and watch television. We enjoyed the 24 hour food area and coffee/liquor bar. There was a nice variety of prepared food items available for snacks and light meals. The whimsy of the marketing extended to the amenities and decor with several rather interesting and provocative art and photography books available around the lobby area. (The hotel poster near the elevator is hilarious and a bit shocking). The small and rather narrow room reminded us of a cruise ship cabin and would be fine for a short stay (i.e., 3 days or so). For a week we found the lack of storage space and room to hang clothes rather limiting. The nice sized bed is very comfortable. The major issue was the plumbing. On the first morning we noticed a odor emanating from the shower drain. It was the smell of sewage. We called down to the front desk and staff arrived promptly and changed our room. Things seemed to be fine until day 3 when the water in the shower failed to drain. Due to the shower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern design (flush with the floor) it was impossible to notice that water was seeping out and flooding the room floor. Again, the staff was summoned and the shower drain was dealt with and the 1/2 inch of water on the floor of the room had to be mopped up and our things dried off. We took \u00e2\u20ac\u0153navy showers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (turn off water while soaping up and turn it on just to rinse) for the rest of the stay. The Philips master control that managed the lighting, TV, music and window shades was a fascinating novelty for about an hour. After that it became an annoyance. It constantly had to search for the signal to connect to the room and was a bit of a bother. We had a stubborn motor driven (loud) window shade that we would lower using the wall switch and it would immediately roll itself back up. Finally got it to stay down using a combination of the wall switch and the Philips electronic unit. The hotel is rather new, having been only open several months, and it appears they have some kinks to work out.

However the rooms are small and lack some traditional basics such as wardrobe, drawers and desks. There is no space to unpack. If you are there on business you will need to work in the lobby - this is pleasant enough, but I would prefer to work in the privacy of my rooms. None of these issues are that difficult to cope with and you can find a way of adapting to manage around them. The biggest issue is the lack of a bathroom. The bedroom contains a shower cubicle that is clear glass - there is a curtain to stop anyone in bed seeing you, but is is fairly transparent and so if you are sharing the room you better not mind being looked at by them! Also, the toilet is in a similar cubicle but with frosted glass - again not quite opaque enough as you can still see what is going on in there. The hotel is very stylised ('Citizen M says Welcome home' as you use your key!) and will not appeal to everyone. I am suprised how many 4 and 5 star reviews have been written.

I decided to try it, if only because I knew I'd regret not doing so. I stayed for four nights. The lobby is beautiful and the simple 24 hour cafe is a huge plus for a business traveler. The lobby staff varied enormously in quality. One provided incorrect recommendations, e.g., wrong names, addresses, opening times for restaurants, etc. If this were a \"serious\" business hotel, I would have contacted management, but it feels more like an upscale youth hostel run by college-aged students. Some of the staff were very helpful, so it's fairly random. These are most certainly not, however, graduates of Cornell's Hotel Management Program. The room was the real problem. The neat looking tube shower leaked all over the floor. I regularly had 1/4\" of water on the floor when I was done with fairly quick showers. (I even turned off the water when I was soaping up.) I immediately let management know; they promised to fix it but never did. Try getting dressed on a floor filled with water. Not fun. The remote control that runs the room barely worked. It constantly displayed \"Connecting to room...\" and could take up to 20 seconds to do so. When I asked them to fix this, they were immediately familiar with the problem and even finished my sentence for me describing the problem. But again, they never fixed it and I had trouble doing basic things like turning off the lights to go to sleep. And the remote's very bright blue LEDs flashed all night long as it was apparently constantly reconnecting to the room. That was beyond annoying. Also, the physical light switch to turn off the lights simply dimmed them. You must use the remove to get actual darkness. Very poorly designed. And while they claim the room's are \"sound proof,\" that is with respect to the outside. You will literally here every person and conversation passing outside your room, all night long. I've never stayed in a hotel with such poor internal acoustic isolation. Finally, the air conditioning, which works fine during the day, apparently turns off at night. My room was incredibly uncomfortable with zero airflow whatsoever. And of course the windows don't open. In short, it's a cool design but even given how new this hotel is, the infrastructure seems to be falling apart already. (This phenomenon is quite common in experimental buildings.) I will say the bed was extremely comfortable. (I don't understand some of the complains here about that.) And the free wifi was slow but very welcome. I would certainly not recommend this hotel and would never stay here again. I suspect some future generation of these boutique mini-room hotels will be ready for prime time but citizenM is absolutely not. No doubt, the management will post some deep felt apology here, as they do with all negative reviews. I suggest they spend the effort fixing the flaws in the rooms, rather than arguing why their hotel is so wonderful. The fact of the matter is it is lacking in the most basic of ways.

All things a contemporary, young, technology oriented, novelty embracing person needs, put together in a compact package. When my girlfriend and I were planning our trip to Europe we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure how many days we would stay in Amsterdam. So I decided to make a reservation for 2 nights. I called the hotel to make sure we can pay in cash if we decide to prolong our stay and I was told that only credit card is accepted as a payment method. As a matter of fact, internet is the only way to make a reservation there. I opted for a flexible rate which is obviously higher but then a reservation can be canceled up until 18:00 on the day of the arrival. From Schiphol airport you take a train and get off at the first stop ( Amsterdam Zuid ). The hotel is within walking distance from the station ( 5 minutes walk). So, when you walk in you see a couple of stations with a touch screen display right in front of you. To check in, all you need to do is to enter your last name to identify yourself, swipe the credit card, pick up one of the card keys from the stack (or pick up two if you spouse needs one), wave the key in front of the card reader and once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programmed you will be given your room number .That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it! There is always somebody from the hotel staff (ambassadors as they call themselves) behind the front desk. They are very friendly and will be happy to assist you. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a canteen on the right \u00e2\u20ac\u201csnacks, sandwiches, drinks, etc.(everything is seriously overpriced there) . A giant catalogue of David LaChapelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s photographs next to the elevators (which I regret I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had the time to flip through) :) The room: The room is cool. It is compact. As people who designed it though to themselves : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ok, how do we provide a maximum comfort and functionality in a minimal space\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And they succeeded. There a toilet and a shower literally in the room. While the frosted glass of the toilet will give you some sense of privacy, when taking a shower you will be perfectly visible from every corner of the room. There is a semi-transparent curtain separating the bed from the rest of the room thought. A wall to wall king size bed. A relatively big LCD TV with free TV channels, movies, and adult films. A safe deposit box (which is wide enough to put a laptop in, but too shallow for my Canon 450D cameras). Air conditioning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a touch screen remote control ( mood pad as they call it ) which controls lighting , TV , AC and jalousie. It comes with a pre-programmed activity modes you can choose from. For instance when you want to go to sleep, you select Activities->Sleep and all the lights and TV are turned off. Note that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no smoking in the room and the window cannot be opened. Connectivity: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a FREE WiFi in the hotel which is awesome. There is a couple of mac computers in the lobby ( all hooked up to the net) . The staff: The staff is really friendly. On one occasion I asked them for a screwdriver ( my laptop charger comes with a type P plug which they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a socket for, so I decided to remove the extra blade ) and they provided me with a toolbox full of screwdrivers :). On another occasion, when I made a second reservation to prolong our stay, I received two different confirmation numbers, and it turned out that somehow two reservations were made in their system, while I made just one. The problem was that I made a pre-paid reservation (which means that the credit card is charged on the spot and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no cancelation option). I explained the situation to the receptionist. They told me not to worry, that they will contact their head office to resolve the problem and get back to me. And indeed, when we came back at night, there was a little note from the front desk informing me that the extra reservation was canceled and my credit card was refunded. Additionally I received an email from their head office to confirm that the problem was resolved. Location: The hotel is NOT in the city centre. It is in the business district of Amsterdam ( WTC can be seen from the window ). All public transportation is within walking distance ( tram, metro, train ) . To get to the city centre you take tram #5. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take around 10 minutes to get to Dam Square. To get to Schiphol airport you take a train. 5 minutes and you are there. The hotel is located in a very quiet place, so if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care for a 10 minute tram ride to the city centre, it will be perfect for you. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small supermarket nearby the train station which comes in handy. CONCLUSIONS : PROS: 1. King size 2x2 bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very comfortable ! 2. Rain shower. 3. Big LCD TV with free movies ( including porno ) 4. Safe deposit box is big enough for a laptop. 5. Free WiFi. 6. Computers in the lobby 7.

Windows cannot be opened. 5. No bar or restaurant. 6. Stuff in the canteen is ridiculously overpriced.

Room was great, decor in hotel was wonderfully different. We were a bit concerned that it seemed to be a long way from city centre, but this proved an advantage. Train from Schiphol to Amsterdam Suid station was easier than to Central station, and going home was easier as we left our bags in the (free) left luggage at hotel, explored some more Amsterdam, and picked them up on the way to Suid (2 mins walk). The walk to Amsterdam centre isn't long (follow number 5 tram tracks, 20-30 mins) and takes you past lots of good shopping areas that you probably wouldn't find if staying in the centre. We found a fantastic cafe close to the hotel called Fidelio's (try their Soto Iyam soup!). The staff were friendly and helpful.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say what the best parts of the hotel are but the bed is certainly up there - 2x2 meters and the comfiest pillows and quilts. Next is the shower, its in a pod and has two settings rain and normal both of which are equally sumptuous!! On the hotel spec it specifies free movies and Wifi.... all really good. You can even use the Apple Mac's and printer in the foyer for online check in. Me and my boyfriend actually chose to walk to the centre all the time...we really enjoyed this as Amsterdam is lovely (and you can also pass through a mile long market :) I know this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be for everyone but tram 5 stops near by and they seem extremely frequent and take you right to the centre. The area it is in is next to the World Trade Centre and residential, very well presented and safe.

The room in itself is very functional and a little on the small side but the design and use of the moodpad control make up for it! We had a lot of fun using it in our room. There are no hidden extras for costs and it is exactly as it is said on the website. I can understand that for some there can be an issue for the toilet/shower being so open, but there is a curtain by the bed to give a little privacy and it is easy to have music on.

You'll see a small garden with a a bicycle trail on the right. Follow along and then turn right at the first cross. The hotel is located at the end of the street (quiet residencial area). Check-in / Rooms: After you self-check-in (with help available if you need) you'll find a confortable room with some gadgets. Everything is controlled by a small console: lights, blinds, TV, temperature, alarm clock... Very comfy, big bed. Nice shower with see-through panels. Though there's a curtain if you want more privacy. The toilet is surrounded by opaque glass. The shower has a rain forest-type effect, the water pressure varying throughout the day. The TV has games, music and some movie (adult movies included) channels. Bar: Open 24h. The prices are ok, according to Amsterdam's standards (example: Earl Grey tea- 1.95 euros) Internet: A few Macintosh computers in the lobby or you can take advantage of the free wifi (some rooms have difficulty in acquiring signal- in this case, go to a public area, let your laptop acquire the signal and then go back to your room).", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larissa", "Title": "\u201cA Bad joke\u201d", "Author": "nickaraxnos", "ReviewID": "UR34812744", "Content": "Although we were very excited finding this hotel we had too many problems in our 6 nights staying there.

Same thing in the shower 5) Last day and we package our things when we realize that a pair of sleepers and a t-shirt (bought from Amsterdam) were missing although the rest of our staff were inside the bug. So it is unlikely to lost them somewhere outside For all of that (i made complains in the reception desk just before the check out) we only had an e-mail from the assistant(!) manager for apologies with the remark that next time we go they will have something good for us!!!!!!

Also, canteenM is DREADFULLY overpriced-- one can find the same thing in central london for less. It's not a huge issue though, because it's easy to avoid having to eat there.
