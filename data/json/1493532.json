You get plenty of food outlets and Mustafa centre is very close by. I do recommend this hotel for families who would look for a hotel in Singapore. No free WiFi/ Internet. Wifi/Internet charges bit expensive than the outside. You can find reasonable places nearby than the hotel. Staff were not very friendly, their busy with their own work but supportive. And not very strict with check in.

I booked triple room and it was very spacious for singapore hotels standard, especially for the price you pay. The room i stayed had just been renovated, so it was nice, clean and new, the only downside was the room had no window. So make sure you request a room with window if you want. The location also very great, you only have to cross the street to get to the mall and MRT. 7-11 on walking distance, food court just across the street.

They were renovating some floors above mine (I was on 2nd floor) on 9am-6pm. The great thing about this hotel is the convenient location. It's within walking distance to Mustafa Centre, lots of food hawkers around, City Square Mall, and to Farrer Park MRT station. They don't provide breakfast, but they provide instant coffee and teh tarik in every room. No toiletries, only towels and tissue every day. Room itself was not sparkling clean, but overall it was ok. No bed bugs or smelly odors. You have to pay for wi-fi, and the connection sucks. My room was at the farthest corner and to get a connection I need to stand in front of my door.

Outside, it looks okay, being near the malls, train stations and other stores... but inside, it wasn't good at all! The lobby was so small and lots of luggages (maybe from other hotel guests) were just lying near the elevator! There wasn't even any staff to greet you or open the door for you. Only the receptionist who is so preoccupied with a lot of things. When we got to our room, beds were a bit hard. The room was not at all inviting! The bathroom was so dirty! Molds and fungi have been building up on the tiles! It was totally disgusting. If you operate a hotel, at least maintain it so that people will come back .

The staff were gruff to the point of rudeness. Towards the end of my three-day stay I began to feel insecure about my possessions. I have been to over a hundred hotels and never felt like that. I escaped to a Hotel 81 and it was small and simple and nothing special but very professionally run compared to this place. I think even a hostel like Checkers would have been a better choice than Tai Hoe. In Singapore the cheap hotels are generally in Little India and Geylang. Little India is quite an insular Indian community, and Geylang is quite an insular Chinese community. I would have a preference for staying in the center of town where English is well tolerated, even though it's a bit more expensive.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cGood location, budget option\u201d", "Author": "quarryking", "ReviewID": "UR93495230", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights on a work trip.
