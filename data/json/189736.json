When we were given the key to our room we were then sent to the 3rd floor. When we got there we couldn't find our room, we had to go down 2 flights up half a flight across a landing down another 1/2 flight then eventually up another flight until we got to our room!!! This was all unexplained by receptionist!! When we eventually got to the room we were pleasantly surprised. The room was brand new and looked like we were the 1st to stay in it. It was crisp clean and modern. Only when we got into bed did we realise it was 2 unsecured single beds. The sheet didn't fit the 2 beds and a king size quilt was on side ways so didn't the bed properly. Whilst we were having a nap, there was a knock on the door which my husband answered, it was the manager, he wanted to check something in the bathroom, my husband said that I was asleep but manager said it would only take a minute, the manager said he needed to check do hubby felt pressured to leg him in. He'd went to bathroom switched light on and off then left!!! I was v annoyed and embarrassed particularly as I was still in bed!!! The bathroom was v well equipped with excellent power shower, only down side was it had a towel rail which u were unable to switch off which left the room v warm. Room also did not have a telephone. Next morning for breakfast we arrived about 9.20am ( breakfast available until 9.30). When we walked in I said hello to staff member and asked did we just seat ourselves. She just looked at me then walked away!! We seated ourselves then proceeded with breakfast. At about 9.35am a workman entered the breakfast room and a couple of minutes later he asked us to finish off our breakfast as staff wanted to clear up!!! He said again 5 mins later!! So in the end we just had to up and leave our unfinished breakfast. In all the years visiting hotels I have never been asked to leave half way through our meals!!! Over all we enjoyed our stay but our main gripe was the staff. A lot of we had dealings with did not have good English which is hard for communication purposes!! Staff were grumpy and rude ( all except the receptionist on the 2 nd day). We would return but only if staff had customer service training and understand they are in the hospitality industry!!", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "renfrewshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Poor Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ela03", "ReviewID": "UR124821467", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at City Continental admittedly we got a really good deal through Superbreak including Rail and Accommodation so we did not have high exceptions of hotel. However we did not expect to get locked out of hotel on our first day at 6pm! We spent 10 mins trying to get back into the hotel buzzer on door did not work and girl at desk seemed to be oblivious until we continually banged on door! We stayed in a room that was still to be refurbished. Room and bathroom were clean but small, bed is a double but as one side is against the wall made it very small for 2 people also rubber sheets on bed which made bed uncomfortable. On arrival heater was on full we had no way to turn heating off we complained to reception who gave us a remote to control heating. We also had an old heater in room that the plug was melted into wall which left us with only one socket in room. There was no ventilation in bathroom and no window that could be opened in bedroom, this made room very warm and stuffy even with no heating on. There was lack of storage space in room but this would be due to room being small there was one open wardrobe with 4 coat hangers there were no drawers not enough storage for those on a short break we didn't even unpack! There is however a digital security box in room. Breakfast was good for a continental breakfast. Range of yoghurt, fruit, cereal, breads, croissants, cheese and boiled eggs. Range of fruit juices and a good coffee machine. Breakfast area could be busy especially around food area not much room at all. On the whole we didn't expect much from hotel the main reason we booked was for location which was excellent. Hotel is around corner from Earls Court Tube and is a great base for exploring London if your willing to stay in basic accommodation. There is a vast range of restaurants, fast food, pubs and shops near hotel. The hotel is in the midst of being refurbished this didn't have an impact on our stay but hopefully means hotel will be of a higher standard in the future.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cI didn't enjoy my stay here - only plus was location\u201d", "Author": "saritamar", "ReviewID": "UR122273628", "Content": "+ The only plus as I said - the location. It's just a couple of minutes from Earl's Court tube station * - This hotel is average at best. It/s very calstrophobic.

It didn't work for me and I called reception and told them to cancel it right as I figured out it doesn't work, they agreed. On checkout they \"forgot\" they agreed and still wanted to charge me for it. - This was a business trip, and I had to sleep in a single room and then a double room with a colleague. I switched three rooms in less than a week - although we asked for it, they refused to let us stay in the same double room!!! That biggest trouble with that was that.. - The elevator doesn't reach 4th floor, so we had to carry our heavy bags in the steep, spiral and crackling staircase from 3rd floor to the 4th - hotel staff didn't offer any help. It was quite scary. * During my stay, the elevators at Earl's Court tube station didn't work, so I had to carry my heavy luggage for 3 floors of the station.

This hotel satisfied both sets of criteria: 1) it was a one-minute walk from the tube station Earl's Court (on the District and Piccadilli lines), surrounded by supermarkets (M&S, Tesco) and nice pubs (*tip to avoid the horrid, sad breakfast in the hotel) 2) it cost me under 400 Pounds for 4 nights (including the w/e) which is pretty great, for London (makes me want to cry though, on the inside, when I compare that to other amazing European cities and the qualities of their hotels) I was travelling alone, so I got a tiny single room. When I say tiny, I mean: TINY. There's a single bed, and a closet/safe/tv tower of objects all stacked on top of one another, there's a bed-side table with a lamp, there's a little desk with a kettle and tea bags/coffee (thank God they had this; I preferred this to breakfast downstairs on a couple of the mornings) .. the shower was in a separate room with the toilet. Both were very clean, working very well, good water pressure, hot water available (though never between 8-9am). The bed was comfortable ... I slept very well all 4 nights. I see other people mentioned plastic sheets, cold/hot rooms, dirty sheets ... I didn't have any of these problems. It was all a very triste sight, but I had prepared myself for it mentally. Check-out is at 11am in the hotel, but you can keep your luggage there past that time, until you have your flight/train ... which is a nice touch. Breakfast was just sad ... I only went once. Sat next to a nice couple from Switzerland, chatted with them. The real problem, I guess, is not even so much the food (which sucks) but the fact that the 'dining area' is in the BASEMENT, so there's no light, and they need to open the door to get some light/air in there (=COLD, on an October morning), and there's another door in there, wide open, that looks like some rotting hobbit-cave, full of linens, towels, shovels, etc ... basically, stuff I don't necessarily want to see when I'm having breakfast. Food there: 2 types of toast, tea, coffee, peeled oranges (?), croissants (I never eat them anyway, but they looked foul), jam, butter, cheese, hard-boiled egg ... The staff: cleaning staff were all very friendly and smiley and polite. Though they sure don't let you sleep past 8.30am in this place! The front-desk staff: the chap who was there (don't remember his name) was friendly and kind, but was utterly useless at his job: he couldn't point out Trafalgar Square or Westminster on a map for me, couldn't tell me how to get to Piccadili Circus either ... but the girl (Martina, I think? She's Italian) was SUPER helpful, very nice, and very efficient. Conclusion: The breakfast services, the room and hotel are quite shabby, really, but - as other people said before: if your thoughts are SIGHTSEEING and BUDGET (sleep being a secondary factor!) then go for it: very easy to get to by public transport, nice neighbourhood, and OK price (for London).", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires", "Title": "\u201cBasic, small but cheap and with great location.\u201d", "Author": "koko1978", "ReviewID": "UR119282625", "Content": "In an expensive city like London, if you find a hotel with good location that is cheaper than most of the rest you search, of course you cant expect too much. With than idea in our minds, we spend our 7 days in this hotel. The location is great, just 2 minutes away from Earl Court station. Besides this area has many places to eat, including a Mark and Spencer, and a couple of pubs. From this station to Westminster you arrive in less than 10 minutes with the tube. The hotel from the outside it\u00c2\u00b4s not bad, the street in fact is quite nice and apparently quiet, although since there are many hotels in this street, it turns to be somehow noisy during the night while many tourists come back at night yelling so you have to get used to it. Most of the staff is really helpful, specially Adrien and the Italian girl. On the bad side\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..the room is extremely small and does not have any room to leave the clothes. The carpet and the walls are really old and the general aspect is not nice at all. We really had a hard time organizing where to put our baggage without blocking the room. We finally were able to do it but it was still pretty uncomfortable. On the positive side, the bed was comfortable and the shower was absolutely great.

All in all, I don\u00c2\u00b4t regret the choice since I was in a budget, it\u00c2\u00b4s not a bad choice if you plan to be outside all day long and just come back to take a shower and sleep. This is a hotel were you can\u00c2\u00b4t go and spend some time chilling out since there is no space for anything.

The outside view of the Hotel (and street in general) looks quite nice, but that's where all the positive points end. Hotel staff are not necessarily rude, they are just not very welcoming or friendly. When asking them a question they have a sort of 'Oh god not you again' sort of vibe going on. I have to say, knowing that the hotel was situated in Kensington (One of the high class areas of London) I automatically assumed that there would be nothing to worry about. The saying; \"Never assume or you will make an [--] of you and me\", has never been so true!! Upon arriving at the hotel in a taxi, just getting out, behind me on the opposite side of the street there was some drunken louts being their usual loutish selves and about to start a fight with some other students who were situated opposite (in London Electronics College) but I must say this fight didn't kick off. During the late hours of the evening say 10pm - 2am it wont be uncommon to hear drunken arguments spewing out from the street below you, however no need to worry as this is very common everywhere throughout the UK. Walking in the hotel lobby and trying to check in to my room didn't take very long however the guy behind the desk wasn't very welcoming, didn't smile once and at no point did he leave me with the impression that in the event of me needing something would he offer assistance. This was the general impression I got from all of the hotel staff behind the desk in the lobby. Not particularly rude, just not welcoming, not very helpful and they never seem to smile. Take my advice and don't book your room to include breakfast as well as you will basically be throwing your money down the drain. They advertise their breakfast as being 'Continental' which basically is a nice way of them saying that if you are looking for a hot/cooked breakfast you wont find it here. They offer very basic, toast and cereal. Its worth going out on to the high-street as there is a large variety of cafe's, restaurants, sandwich bars and pubs to eat at, as well as all the usual fast food outlets. They also have a Marks & Spencer's simply food supermarket just at the top of the road where you can buy lots of nice things at a reasonable and cheap price. The hotels carpets inside the rooms and also out on the landings look.... how can I put it.... not new, nor do they look very clean. Blotches and stains on the carpeting here and there, is not uncommon. They have wooden floor boards with carpeting plastered on top, I'm sure the floor boards are the same as when the hotel building was first erected and they tend creak and make noise any time you are walking or standing on top. The floor boards are destroyed and or cracked underneath. Now let me get to the part about the room.... Anybody wishing to relive their university days will feel at home, as the rooms and lobby in general give a strong feel of University/College dormitories. The fittings and furniture inside are very similar to what you would expect to find in a dormitory. Basically as you enter the room there is a narrow corridor with the toilet/bathroom on the left hand side. The tiles on the bathroom floor looked very shabby, with dirt in the grooves, and stains in the corner. The toilet itself (I'll let that be a surprise for you, let me just say don't expect it to be anything good). The shower, to give you an idea of what my impression of the shower was let me just tell you this... when taking a shower I would wear flip flops and keep the curtains opened as I wouldn't want anything touching me. Also something I regretted was not taking any of my own towels, so if you have the opportunity take some towels with you, you should. The bed was comfortable and the sheets on it looked fairly clean, and were changed daily. The blanket they put on top of the duvet, the moment I got into the room I peeled it off to find a small red stain on the inside, so I just unrolled the whole thing and left it on the floor. I didn't actually sleep in the bed, I slept on top, not even using the duvet... just used the four wafer thin pillows they provide you to sort of make up my own cover/blanket. The cupboard in my room didn't have a door on it, the small box like TV was placed on top, thank god I took my laptop with me! Plus TV has channels 1 - 4 no satellite here. Wireless Internet costs quite a lot, 24 hours costs \u00c2\u00a325 they also give you the option of 2 hours and 4 hours but cant remember what the costs were. Best thing to go for is the 24 hours if you are staying for a few days. Cleaners tend to knock on and enter your room everyday at about 11am whether you have the do not disturb sign outside or not. Every room has a small safe inside, my advice put all money, credit cards and travel documents including passport in there. I'm not saying the cleaners will steal your stuff, but I caught one of the cleaners (brunette small tattoo on neck) coming into my room on two separate occasions when I knew the room had already been cleaned, she said she didn't finish the bathroom. If it happened once id believe her but as it happened twice she probably had the impression that shed be playing supermarket sweep in my room (should re-title it to room sweep). As the rooms don't have any mini fridges inside the only option you have for keeping your groceries cold is to take ice from the machine downstairs and create your own little fridge with a plastic bag full of ice. Only problem is the ice machine downstairs although it provides ice (free of charge) there is no scoop to scoop the ice nor is there an ice bucket to store the ice. When I asked the guy at the lobby how am I expected to take and store the ice from the machine, his response was.... Er not sure..... maybe try putting it in your glass (cocky response) to which I replied, well if it wasn't the size of an egg cup I might have considered it. Lastly they did order me a taxi on my last day there, I also asked for a wake up call which is basically like a missed call they give you, so if you are a heavy sleeper don't even bother asking for one. The taxi was a fixed price of \u00c2\u00a345 to London Heathrow airport.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cNot a good choice\u201d", "Author": "Tomto147", "ReviewID": "UR56914378", "Content": "Maybe for that price you can not expect more but still there is a need for a good temperature in your room during winter.

The Good: location very good because of Earls Court Tube Station and Pennywern is a quiet street compared to other hotels in this price range situated on noisy streets such as Cromwell Rd. Sandra at the front desk is very helpful and saved my back by supplying four extra pillows to allow me to elevate my knees in order to relieve the horrendous back pain due to the inadequate and soft mattress! If you do suffer from occasional back problems, I advise against this choice. On arrival I asked why the hotel was so hot, and they advised me I was lucky I did not arrive in summer as it is more difficult to bear. I know some advertise this place as air conditioned, and, of course it is not! It is definitely a HOT house. Windows and doors are left open, and this, of course, is a huge energy waste. Apparently they are unable to temper the hot temps in this building heated by gas? Don't know why. I was situated in the back, so that was another good thing: I woke to birds singing rather than the rattle and rush of traffic. I walked a great deal while staying in this location (I stayed at several other UK locations during 2-week trip) because I needed to walk off the back pain. It is possible to walk to Victoria and Albert along with its neighboring museums: Science Museum and Natural History Museum...all free. There is inexpensive internet cafe upstairs, next to a bakery that sits directly across from Earls Court Road Exit of the Earls Court Tube. (This station has two exits, the other being closer to the Exhibition hall that has Dr Who aplenty at the moment.) As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a fairly fast and convenient Piccadilly Line ride from Heathrow Airport. Half a block away from the hotel is Marks and Spencer providing well priced easy meals. This is obviously very convenient! There are also many fast food options along the Earls Court Road both west and east of that tube exit. No reason to pay hotel 10 pounds for a continental breakfast. From pictures I see if I had been willing to spend more than over $500 for those 4 nights I may have gotten a larger bed, but I do not know if the mattress quality could have been better. Someone else will have to contribute that information. I saw the price per night double after my stay, so I would never recommend paying $200 per night for such a small room and most particularly not during hot summer weather.

On the whole I would recommend it, but be aware that there can be communication difficulties with some of the staff, who seem to have English as an additional language, or who have trouble understanding North American accents. Having said that however, I found the staff to be very helpful, even going the extra mile to let me check in early after a very tiring flight. They also took very good care of valuables which I had to leave in the office safe, since the in-room safe wasn't working. I originally booked in for a single/twin room but got a double instead for the same price, thanks to the early check-in. The room was on the third floor and thankfully there is a lift, which isn't always the case with hotels in old terraced houses. The room itself was quite cramped and in serious need of redecorating. I'd have a hard time imagining how 2 people could maneuver in the space, but for a single traveller it was fine. It came equipped with a TV, electronic safe, hair dryer, in-room hot drinks and an in-room air conditioner, which does need to be used. Even though I was there in late March during a cold snap, I did have to run the noisy A/C and/or leave the window open, which can also be noisy since it overlooks the street. I would think seriously about getting a third floor room in the summer! The bathroom was pretty impressive for a room of this size, with lots of elbow room and both a shower & tub. A note about the hair dryer - it is hardwired and placed directly under the fire/heat detector, so the alarms go off every time it's used. I was assured that the problem would be fixed, but saw no evidence of maintenance work on the dryer or the defective safe during my stay. Everything was very clean and well maintained, and the bed was comfortable. A self-serve continental breakfast buffet was included in the price, served in a bright basement level cafeteria. The selection of food was quite good: croissants, toast, choice of cereals, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cheese, jams, juice, tea and coffee from a dispenser that has a range of drinks like espresso or cafe au lait. The hotel provides both wireless and regular Internet access, for a price. The hotel's street, Penywern Road, is just off Earl's Court Road, and very close to the Earl's Court tube station. This part of Earl's Court is very lively with lots of shops, restaurants & services. Don't miss the Masala Zone if you like Indian cuisine. The food is excellent and they have a budget earlybird menu. Security is good with a card swipe system and a staffed reception desk .

Not a bad hotel either.\u201d", "Author": "culchied", "ReviewID": "UR8279376", "Content": "I booked the Comfort Inn at Earls Court through Expedia as a last minute trip, staying four nights in total. It was one of those hotels that always came up in searches on the numerous occasions that I'd gone to book a trip in the past. With that in mind I thought to myself it can't be great if there's always availability. Swayed by a cheap deal and the mantra of it being the best of a bad bunch I booked nonetheless. Thankfully it offered a pleasant surprise. I've stayed in many London hotels, from the high end 'posh' hotels to the cheap and nasty budget hotels. As anyone who's stayed in London before will be aware - you get what you pay for. Rooms are often small and cramped in comparison to what you might get for the same money elsewhere in the UK or abroad. If you've never been to the capital before you ought to bear this in mind so as not to ruin your trip with a cheap but tiny hotel room. The hotel itself is based on a quiet residential street off Earls Court Road. It's location couldn't be better. The tube station is a five minute walk around the corner and is served by the Picadilly Line (with connections to Heathrow) and the District and Circle Lines. Earls Court Road itself offers a plethora of shops and eateries; from the quintessential supermarkets of M&S and Somerfield to a rather large Boots pharmacy, McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, a few pubs, cafes and bars. There's also a Post Office which is great for sending any postcards - that's if people still do that nowadays. Upon arrival at the hotel I was greeted by a warm and friendly receptionist - foreign, naturally, but helpful and polite and not the atypical receptionist you find in some London hotels. The foyer itself is clean and bright with a vending machine for cold drinks, some chairs and a PC for Internet access. As a single traveller I plumped for a single room. And that, precisely, is what I got. Located on the first floor, room 131 was a rather small room with a single bed, desk, chair, storage area for clothes and a small ensuite bathroom. It was clean and practical with a TV and adjustable air conditioning. I rarely use my hotel room in London for anything other than sleeping or watching TV before bed so it served my needs beautifully. My only gripe with my room would be its location in the hotel. It was at the end of a corridor next to the main stairwell so everyone could be heard trundling past first thing in the morning. It didn't bother me that much but I expect if you were a light sleeper it would trouble you immensely. One other issue I found was that the towels were incredibly small. Fine if, like me, you are of relatively small build but not so if you are particularly large. A minor gripe for me nonetheless. Likewise, the shower in the bathroom was rather small and certainly would have proved difficult to negotiate for anyone who happened to be overweight or of larger build. I paid around \u00c2\u00a350 per night for my single room and that didn't include breakfast. It was optional at \u00c2\u00a35 each and I didn't try it so can't comment on the quality. I think a continental breakfast was all that was on offer anyway. I'd definitely stay here again purely for the location and the fact my room was comfortable and more than adequate for my needs.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zagreb, Croatia", "Title": "\u201csmall but nice\u201d", "Author": "Croatian_flag", "ReviewID": "UR8066453", "Content": "Mario, Croatia My wife and me stayed in this hotel in June.

The rooms are small (as other reviewers state) but are clean and tidy with TV and tea/coffee making. The bathroom was not one of those horrible cubicle things that you see in so many cheaper London hotels and there was great water pressure for the shower. The hotel claim to be in the process of fitting air conditioning to all rooms and all three of my rooms had A/C fitted. I can't say that I noticed aircraft noise any worse than what you get anywhere in London (you're certainly not sat at the end of the runway) and there is no noise from the Underground. I stayed here three nights and i'd certainly stay again!", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cwould not recommend\u201d", "Author": "pumpkin28", "ReviewID": "UR4995236", "Content": "I have just back from a short break in london and wanted to share my thoughts with you on this hotel. I booked Earls court comfort inn based on the reviews on this site which seemed all in all to be pretty postive. I wasnt at all impressed i went with my partner so had double room and father he had single room. The rooms were very small and no space for your belongings they were not very well kept. Both rooms were very noisy my father specially at night when he could hear the planes going over his room. The worst thing i found was the unbearable heat in the rooms and hotel the radiators were not on it made us feel ill. And it has not been patically hot during my stay although the rooms have a fan obviously there is a problem with ventalation. I found breakfast basic toast, cerials which was self serve and all in all i have stayed in much better acommadation in london for the same price. the only positive was it was only a 2 min walk to tube but would not recommend or ever use again.", "Date": "April 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Black Forest, Germany", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel, good location.\u201d", "Author": "FmhR4ad", "ReviewID": "UR4987279", "Content": "We stayed at this Hotel on April 2006. Our overall experience was better than expected. The Hotel is located in a nice area with stores, restaurants and pubs. Best of all is that it is just a few steps away from the subway station, or if you feel adventurous you could take the 30 min. walk to London main downtown area. It is actually pretty enjoyable, especially after a hearty breakfast. Which would be in my opinion the only point that needs improvement: food variety at breakfast could be better.

I start with the cons, most of them already mentioned before: rooms are small but ok if you don't have esp. bulky luggage, the shower is small too (you stand pretty close to the curtain with your face...), room-temperature was very high - we turned the heating down in the room and hallway and left the window open all the time (it was early spring, how about summer...?). There is no AC just a fan. Double-bed pretty small for two - you have to really like eachother - (not even sure it was 1,40m in size)maybe think about going for a twin... Our room-windows were very dirty, need a cleanover. One of our reading lights was not working. At times the room was a bit noisy: you heard other people slamming doors and noise caused by the aircrafts going to Heathrow (but then we left the window open all the time...) Breakfast not too special, but ok, better than I found it elsewhere (but I guess Germans are very picky about that ;-)) - including as much as you like: toast, croissant, jam, nutella, cheese, cereals, butter, boiled eggs, juices, coffee, tea, milk, yoghurt, fruit-cocktail. Now the pros: Great location, nice neighborhood, good starting point to all tourist attractions (District and Picadilly-tubeline right around the corner) and very close to nice areas like Notting Hill, Kensington...Shops and restaurants very close by, nice, friendly and clean area, seemed safe, nice airy tube station (District Line). Friendly staff, except for one blonde lady - from the Eastern European? who was a bit - let`s say - shortspoken but not all offending or anything like that (not that it is a specific attribute for Eastern Europe- don't get me wrong!), but the rest of them very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Clean room and bathroom - much cleaner than I expected it to be! We had a room on first floor facing the backyard, very sunny, green, just nice. (There are rooms in the basement though, I would not accept one of those). We could store our luggage in a small luggage room on arrival and departure day for several hours for free which was very helpful. Overall, we had a wonderful stay (even considered the cons), found it to be very good value for money in Central London and would recommend it to everybody who can arrange with the minor negative things mentioned above.

I had been concerned about finding reasonably priced accomodations for our stay in London and figured going with a \"chain\" such as the Comfort Inn would minimize our risk. We got a very good rate and the location worked out very well. Planning to tour London mainly on the Tube, the Earl's Court location is in our opinion, one of the best places you can be - with quick access to many of the different train lines and sites nearby. We also found the neighborhood to be great with many restaurants (Thai, Chinese, Italian) and English pubs around.

The room was definitely smaller than a comparable hotel in USA, but had enough place for our 3 large suitcases and us. The bed was also on the smaller side, but was as comfortable as any other hotel bed is. The staff was friendly at all times. We had our 3yr old daughter with us, and all the staff was very nice to her. The room was very neat and tidy and was cleaned thoroughly everyday. The bathroom had a nice size shower tub. The breakfast was a little better than the \"packaged breakfast\" I have found at other hotels. It included among other things(like yogurt/cereals/juice/coffee) boiled eggs and toast. The only cons were, my room wasn't directly off the elevator. There was one flight of steps to manaeuvr before I could get to my room. And because I was travelling with a lot of luggage, it wasn't easy! The other problem was, my room didn't have wireless access. But the staff had agreed to shift my room, but I didn't want to deal with all that. There is also a computer in the lobby for internet access. And a cheap international call center was about 3min walk from the hotel(right across Burger King). The tube station was only a 5-7min walk away. There are lot of eating choices(though none too special) closer to the hotel including Burger King. A Mark and Spencer grocery is just 3min walk from there, which provided us with fresh milk and juice and other snacks for my 3yr old. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

The hotel itself, is clean, tidy, & the staff very friendly, & very helpful. My room (A double) was however very small, with just enough space to walk around the edges of the bed. The TV, was a small portable, mounted at a ridiculous height, in the very top corner of my room - I got a pain in my neck from tipping my head back far enough to see it. The en-suite bathroom, was excellent - as I would expect to find it in ANY hotel. The 'buffet/continental' breakfast was adequate, only let down by the fact the milk for cereals wasn't fresh, & was the awful tasting cheap UHT variety. However, I did get this room at a really excellent price of \u00c2\u00a361.00 - which is exceptional value for the centre of London. The location was as said 1st class, & in a nice little area. If your staying in the Earls Court area, & plan to just use your room/hotel as just a place to sleep - you'll be hard pushed to find better value.
