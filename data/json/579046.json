Smells horrible. Gritty floors due to sand. They make you pay everything up front before seeing the room . Rules are unbelievable. Itchy bed, doors were almost impossible to open or close. Furniture was as old as the greek gods. Tv was dirty and small about 19inches, satellite kept knocking out. Spiders in the corner. No towels in bathroom.

Second if something of your will be stolen police will not respond right away since the management abuses their services so much calling the cops for NO reason. For example when our friend who DOESN'T stay with us wanted to use the restroom in our room not only the cops were called but also we were yelled by the management. So if you wanna have a good vacation spend extra dollars but stay away from that place. A quote from one of the managers \"We have our clientele so you can pack your stuff and leave\".

It is not the Ritz, don't expect 300 thread count sheets, or anything like that. There were no toiletries, which is fine for us as we brought our own. Really the only cons for me was that the mattress wasn't super comfortable, and that there were people smoking & drinking out front most of the day & night. I traveled with my young daughter, mom, & sister. Over all, the value is pretty good! You ice get cold A/C, mini-fridge, microwave, pool with outdoor shower (so you can clean up from the beach), its 1 block from the beach, and our room had laminate wood floors. Restaraunts are within walking distance, there is a beach store next door which came in handy for my family, pancake restaurant a few doors down, Jolly Roger amusement park is right across the street, 1 block down.

The rooms were not great, smelled and were very dark. Even the main lobby area was so mildew smelling that I had to cover my nose when we walked in. The only thing nice about the place was the pool and I think it was only because it was so hot! I would never stay in this motel ever again.

The room was clean and included a table and two chairs. We had a king bed - pillows and bed were both comfortable. There was plenty of room for our coolers, bicycles, and luggage. Room included a microwave and a refrigerator. Initially the refrigerator was turned off and i was worried it didn't work, but it was up and running well by the time we came back from dinner. The microwave worked fine. We couldn't find the channel we wanted to watch. The service guy was very sweet and came back twice to help us find the program. The pool was clean with plenty of chairs, but located next to a busy street. They have an outside foot shower. Bring your own shampoo/conditioner and tissues. The towels were small and thin but did the job. The maid gave us some extra towels. A (7-11) convenience store is two blocks away, the beach and boardwalk is one very small block away. The motel is situated just outside the busiest area of the boardwalk so the traffic is a little lighter. A great location. Close to miniature golf, restaurants, and amusement park.

One person commented on how bad their clothes all smelled of mold, she was right. At first it smells damp when you walk in and then you shut the door and you feel like you are in a dungeon. It was very dark. I noticed the smell on my sweater I wore out to dinner one night, it made me sick. Not to mention that we weren't told that it was Senior Week the week we made our reservation. The mouths on these teenagers. We couldn't even sit out on the chairs because of their language. So I have decided for all future vacations I will only at better name hotels or condos, yes I expect to pay more but after having to wash every piece of clothing twice and having the feeling I did everytime we had to walk back in that place, I don't care how much it costs me.

Then the kids were running all around the room and then sat on the bed and I saw their feet. They were BLACK! The carpets are extremely disgusting! The bathrooms are cleaned daily but u would never have known it. I think it is because the place has not been updated ina really long time. Also if u stay here please make sure you bring your own towels and wash cloths!! They give you ones that are paper thin and don't smell the best. I probably would recommend this place to a very young couple without children or a single young person. I couldn't get my kids to understand the concept that they had to wear their shoes in the room. There was also no where to hang up your beach towels and if u did hang them up in the restroom they didn't dry. Don't ask for anything extra or you might have the person from the desk at your door. Also do not take your laptop expecting to be able to access the internet. There are no directions and they say they have wireless internet and tell you how to get on it in another language. I am very computer savvy and I could not figure out how to use it. I thankfully brought my aircard on the trip. Also make sure you have a cell phone because there are no phones in the rooms. I have never in my life stayed at a motel where there was no phone in the room. I personally didn't feel comfortable having no phone in the room. The pool opens in the morning late and closes in the morning early. I just felt like the owners were constantly watching ur every move. I can understand that you probably get all kinds of people but u shouldn't run away new customers due to past bad experiences. But again, you get what you pay for. The beds are so uncomfortable and u will have to see ur chiropractor upon return. But other than that, the location itself is wonderful!!", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNot the worst I've ever stayed, but far from the best\u201d", "Author": "cherryiice", "ReviewID": "UR69974413", "Content": "I guess it depends on how high your standards are, but I must say that I was pretty disappointed with my stay at this motel. My ex (who was pretty cheap with pretty low standards) did not seem bothered by it however. The rooms were not as clean as I would have liked, and were incredibly unattractive. The tv in our room was broken, and so we had to be moved to a different room upon discovery of this fact. What bothered me the most, however, was the service. Not only were the people in charge completely unbothered by any of the problems brought to their attention, they were also completely unmotivated to make up for the inconveniences experienced. And when I needed an extra blanket in the middle of the night, I was S.O.L, because the front desk is completely unmanned from 11pm to 6am and no one answers the number posted on the door.

The staff spoke poor english and were not very helpful. Our back window had a view of trash in the grass. There were not enough towels. The person writes the hotel policies is contradictory and does not know any proper grammar. It really needs remodeled and given some TLC. It could be a nice motel.

Great for young children to see and to look forward to all year! Then it gets better. Swimming at the pool is an experience to remeber.
