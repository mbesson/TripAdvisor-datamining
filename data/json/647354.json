The rooms are bigger than expected and there's plenty of space to leave luggage open. Pretty clean too. The staff was friendly and offers good suggestions for dinner / lunch / snack options. The hotel bar is nice. The ok parts: Shower has no shower curtain or piece of glass so I ended flooding the floor each time and there's also no air vent in the bathroom and this can get quite hot. The air conditioning also magically turns on/off in the middle of the night every night. The strange part On 2 of the evenings, our neighbour kept slamming the door at 4am and calling \"luca\" for about 15min. It felt like he was standing at the foot of our bed and yelling at us.

Since La Rambla itself is all about walking, it's better to take the Metro to save your energy. Make sure you have either a GPS on your phone or a street-view map on-hand when reaching the hotel for the first time. Their instructions of taking a certain bus, is not enough.

I booked in for 8 nights, and found the accommodation very nice. I got a double room on the street side with a small balcony, and loved that. Double-glazed windows kept most all of the exterior noise from the street out. I read others' reviews in which it was noted the rooms were not insulated well one from another, but I did not experience that. The Zen-like atmosphere of the accommodation was lovely and conducive to relaxing. The large rain shower in the en suite bath was a nice touch. Front desk assistance was excellent; all personnel were gracious and forthcoming with directions, restaurant recommendations, and the like. There were only two drawbacks. There are no refrigerators in the rooms. When one prefers to eat at least one meal a day in, it makes it for a bit of a challenge, as there's no place for perishables. (On the other hand, several bakeries, butchers, and grocery stores are nearby, so fresh food is readily available.) Second, the room was maintained/cleaned only very late some days (as late as 5PM). As an early riser who prefers getting out and about by 8AM, then coming back to take a mid-day nap, this was a little off-putting, as I was interrupted twice mid-day for room cleaning.

Location of the Hotel was great for us, away from all the crowds & noise but still close enough to walk down to the Ramble (10-15 mins) & some great restaurant & bars. The other advantage of the location for us was parking, the hotel has discounted parking across the road for 20\u20ac a day.

My wife, an architect, noticed that all the details are right from the workmanship of the tiles to the design of the lights and furniture. Service is very eager even if English is not perfect. Breakfast is excellent with freshly baked pastries as well as frsh chopped tomatoes in olive oil. Wifi is free. Finally, the best thing about this hotel... the price we paid: 65 euros/night for a double room.

You can actually hear the people in the adjacent rooms talking. - The room was not cleaned everyday until I requested. But maybe because I put the sign \"Do not disturb\" on my first night.

If we had stayed only one night, I think I would've given the place a bad review, but after staying there a few days (for 3 days in the beginning of our trip, then we traveled to southern Spain, then we stayed again at the hotel for 2 more days at the end of our trip), I grew to love this place, especially for the last 2 days we spent there. Here's the deal: the first room we got smelled like smoke. When we called down to the front desk, they said smoking is allowed in all rooms. If I'd known that, I probably wouldn't have booked a room here (but I'm glad I did). On the other hand, with the window open, the smell went away almost completely, and it didn't invade my clothes at all. And the second room we got (after we'd returned from southern Spain) didn't smell like smoke at all. One other negative: our first room was facing the alley, and it was quite loud - but not constantly so. Every once in awhile, there would be trash pick up (in the middle of the night), or someone drilling something, or someone making some loud noise. But it was only every once in awhile, and we were so tired from sightseeing, that it never kept us awake. (We didn't hear noise from other hotel guests in nearby rooms). The second room we had was totally, completely quiet, even though the two rooms were on the same floor. Now for the good: the room decor is fantastic, the rooms and bathrooms are comfortable. The front desk staff is helpful and friendly. The restaurant is delicious and a bargain (the hotel is bargain, for that matter). The location is nice because it's a little off-the-beaten path, but a quick walk to the Metro and a pretty easy (15 min) walk to La Rambla and surrounding neighborhoods. Another plus: the Aerobus to and from the airport picks up and drops off two blocks away. Wish we'd known that when we arrived in Barcelona. I really recommend this hotel, but room location is important. Ask for a room that faces the back. (Room 308 is great!).

It's a bit hard to found, nestled in a narrow alley, so make sure you get good directions before you blunder there! The location is overall quite good, close to the Sant Antoni metro and a large outdoor market (hence the name). It's a bit of a hike to the more nightlife-ish areas (Barri Gothic, Born, etc.), but not more than 15 minutes. Nearby, Els Tres Tombs is a good greasy-spoon-type place for late night cravings, and Inopia, one of the area's best tapas bars, is down the street. The rooms are very chic and modern. The bathrooms are stunning: lovely stone-bowl sink and an enormous Vichy-style shower. My husband and I actually took a photo of the shower because we liked it so much! The beds are fairly comfortable and the TV is adequate, with mainly Spanish stations and BBC and SkyNews. WiFi is free. Complaints: There was no clock in our room. On several nights, I discovered small bloodstains (!) on my supposedly freshly laundered pillowcase. Ew! The major drawback is the NOISE. I can't adequately explain how noisy this place is. The walls are thin. On one evening, we were rooming next to some sort of drunken brawl that featured howling, shattering glass, and slamming doors. On another occasion, we were treated to the sounds of hammering and trash-removal at 3:30am. Every night, I was awoken at least once by some sort of bizarre noise. Bring earplugs! Overall, I would recommend Hotel Market with the caveat that it's extremely loud, and there might be better hotels location-wise closer to the nightlife. However, at 130 euros per night, the value is good and, additionally, breakfast is included - a nice touch. We did not dine at the hotel restaurant but heard good things.

The restaurant is crowded with a good vibe and nicely decorated - two seatings in the evening 09:00 and 23:15. The junior suite #904 was stylish and HUGE by European standards with a large terrace and spacious bathroom (including a tub for two and a waterfall shower). The suite is facing the courtyard so it wasn't any noise from the street. And the price was ridiculously low incl taxes and breakfast. And you can eat as many apples or drink as much water as you like from the fridge next to the reception\u2026 We thought it was strange that they didn\u2019t have a mini bar in the suite and no room service or a movie channel (they do have a CD-player with the hotel\u2019s lounge music) \u2013 but then again, you should spend less time indoors and more time outside in the sun when you are in this gorgeous city. The hotel is not as far from the city centre as I thought, and you can easily walk for 10-15 minutes to reach La Rambla/ the old town. Taxi isn't too expensive either. The front desk was mostly helpful, depending on who was on call, and we were recommended a great massage place called Masajes a 1000 in C/Mallorca 233 who has drop-in massages for couples for whatever time period you want! Perfect after shopping at Passeig de Gracia before you eat lunch at La Polpa www.lapolpa-restaurant.com. I would highly recommend eating at the mansion Can Cortada (www.gruptravi.com) while in Barcelona, especially if you go as a couple, the place is beautiful and the food is simply delicious. Try the steak which they offer as one of their specialities, they prepare it at the table and grill it right in front of you. It was the tenderest meat I have ever tasted. Taxi from the hotel is approximately 15 euros. Well worth it! I will recommend the hotel to all my friends and will definitely go back next time I\u2019m in Barcelona.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent.... unsure why the review was so negative\u201d", "Author": "sephine", "ReviewID": "UR10085421", "Content": "At the time of booking this hotel, there was almost no reviews. It was recommended by Telegraph or something. Then the day before my trip, I read the review and was really worried. I was tempted into cancelling as I cannot withstand noises. However my bf pointed out that we wouldn\u2019t be spending much time there anyway. At arrival, the receptionist seem a little cold at first, but soon warmed up. She recommended loads of lovely walk for us, thank you. We booked the junior suite, room 904. My god, it was amazing for that price. Huge room, huge bathroom and extremely large terrace. The bath tub can actually 2 ppl in it. The shower is huge and strong jet. The terrace was lovely with 2 nice deck chair. I couldn\u2019t hear any noise so may be I was very lucky. The breakfast was ok. There\u2019s Wi-fi in room, but you are borrow laptop to be use downstairs. The restaurant is actually very very cheap, but excellent for that price. Location is good, it\u2019s about 15min walk from Rambla. Or 2 mins from Urgell or Sant Antoni station. BEWARE of Bird poo scam in Barcelona. Someone squirked as with some bird poo stuff, and his team rushed to clean us up. Then another one stole valuables from our bags. Overall, beware of your stuff in Barcelona, but Market hotel is very very good.

On arrival the staff appeared disinterested and unwelcoming. There is no porter or assistance with bags, and you are vaguely pointed in the direction of your room. In our case, having booked a Junior Suite, we had to walk through the restaurant with our suitcases. Our room was nicely decorated, the bathroom is great, and we had a small whitewashed terrace with 2 sunloungers. The wardrobes are ridiculously small and inadequate for even a weekend stay. There is no mini bar, no kettle or coffee-making facilities, and no room service that we were aware of. On the plus side there is Sky and BBC News 24, and free broadband access. A few minutes after arrival we became aware of the soundproofing issue, being able to hear absolutely everything going on in the room next door. When we returned to our room in the evening we were also able to hear a lot of noise from the restaurant below. When we complained about this the staff were unable to give us a different room, and astonishingly (given the reviews on this site) claimed that no one else had ever complained about noise from the restaurant! Clearly there is nothing that can be done about this, so if you do stay at the hotel don't forget to bring earplugs. We were awoken at 5am and 7am respectively by the shower being used in the suite next door. Continental breakfast is served in the restaurant; the food is excellent- bread, croissants, ham, cheese, cereal, fruit juice etc, all fresh and of good quality. However, the service was unfriendly and the waitresses needed a lot of prompting to bring your tea or coffee, which was eventually slammed heavily down on the table with a sigh rather than a smile. Not being prepared to put up with such a poor experience, we made quite a lot of fuss on a number of separate occasions with the front desk staff, who were unfriendly/ unwilling/ unable to help. There was never a manager on duty, and not once were we apologised to or any attempt made by the staff to rectify our dissatisfaction.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cA triumph of style over substance\u201d", "Author": "oscillator", "ReviewID": "UR10002516", "Content": "Once you find the place it looks and feels very stylish - we were in a \"junior suite\" which are in the opposite end of the hotel to the rooms, which means traipsing through the restaurant to get to the lift, but which was large, with a walled terrace.
