First day many towels..big, medium and small. After three days..only two big towels :-(. Ok, i didn't agree with the bad reports about the lifts, it seems the hotel worked on this problem with a new electronic. Ok. for travellers/shopaholics. Dubai mall is not far...but don't walk!

Frankly if this hotel had been as satisfactory as a roadside Best Western in the US, I would not have reviewed it either. There is something deeply unpleasant about this place. It's right on a hugely busy super highway (sheik Zayed Road) that produces an infernal roar 24 hours a day. The soundproofing is poor so you hear it everywhere you go from the rooftop to the bedroom to the lobby. It's like Chinese water torture. The room was large, clean and new, but kind of uncomfortable, everything is badly designed, drawers too low, closets that hit doors, a bathroom with no where to put anything. Also, no light switches near the bed so you have to get up after reading. I don't think I've seen that mistake in any hotel I've stayed in! The Suite also has a large section devoted to a kitchen. Why I don;t know. It even has a dishwasher and clothes machine...odd, I must be missing a point here. The windows were super filthy, barely able to see out of them onto a view, which in any case was very ugly. And the elevators are clearly a mistake. The architect of the building deserves to be banned from the UAE. He put 5 lifts into a 47 story building. Schindler has retrofitted them with a system that makes them as efficient as possible, but they are still inadequate. In fact I wonder if this was ever designed as a hotel from the start. The lobby is kind of scrunched.

The location is great. We chose it, because it is close to Dubai Mall. The trip to the mall is easy, taxi ride 10-15 dirhams. Do not go by metro - too long, the price will be the same. The breakfast is decent, however the service in the restaurant is slow and a little disorganized during rush hour which is around 8.00 -10.00.You will wait for your cup of tea for 20 min. But if you do not want tea it is faster of course :))) Now the elevator system, well, whoever thought it would work has unlimited time resources, the elevators are complete nightmare. We lived on floor 8 and i was thanking God we are not any higher in this building, though the street noise is pretty bad (our room was on the road side). No chance to CATCH the elevator during breakfast time. There is a long line on floor 43, where the restaurant is. People become hostages of the floor they are in. Of course, you CAN walk down from floor 43, but will not the rest of the day be FREE? Because you will be wasted. The line of people is accumulated on the Ground floor to get to their floors, but no lift comes for a looooong time. Please do not forget anything, so you will have to come back, it took me 20 min to make a trip up and down to get my cell. 18 minutes of THIS TIME i was waiting for the elevator. The swimming pool is on floor 47, it is ok size, there is a jacuzzi, but somehow the swimming pool is in the shade most part of the day.

With amazing staff & a beautiful building, emirates grand is one of the best places to stay in Dubai where you have value for your money. The deluxe room was so good with a small table at the side & a beautiful bed. The room costs around 1000 dirham\u2019s. The view we got from our room was that of the city so it was exciting to see the busy mode of life in Dubai. It is advisable to book a Dubai tour package as travel companies give u a a comprehensive service including sightseeing,dhowcruise,hotel stay,airport transfers at a lower cost.We booked from Antilog Vacations , an Indian company , as they are famous for arranging Dubai hotels.Their rates were cheaper than other companies as well.Services were better too. The other wonderful aspect about Dubai is that they have lovely beaches like the Jumeriah Beach & the Palm Beach. Did u know that Jumeriah means beautiful so this beach is termed as beautiful beach. Jumeriah beach is the most popular beach & has lovely white sands. Most of the tourists from western countries like America love this beach as in America most of the beaches have black sand which is quite sick for swimming & just having fun on the beach. From the beach you can get a view of Dubai amazing 7 star hotels Burj Al Arab which is also one of the tallest buildings in Dubai. There are also many hotels & private clubs on the beach where you can relax & have fun. Palm Beach is the beach which is at Palm Island hence very close to everything anyone can wish for an ideal place for shopping & water sports.

We are a family of 4 and stayed for 3 nights from December 30th. Check in was fast. Many people were sitting in the lobby and I was afraid our room wouldn't be ready yet but this was not the case. The 2 BR apartment was comfortable, not luxurious by any means but clean enough. We were satisfied for the price we paid. It was about 150 euro's including breakfast through Southtravels. We only ate breakfast at the first morning because it was quite a challenge to take the elevators to the upper floors (43rd it was if I'm correct). It took a long time to go up and down again after breakfast. Breakfast was a complete chaos, the floor was sticky because of the juice spoiled, although they were cleaning this immediately, many tables weren't cleaned and the food wasn't that nice. I guess it will be better on any other day but not during the high season. The restaurant was really understaffed. We waited for 30 minutes to get some coffee. It was better if they just made a self service for this. On NYE it was an easy walk to the Burj Khalifa, about 15-20 minutes and completely safe to walk because of the traffic lights. Will we stay again? Probably not, next time I make sure to book in time for NYE so the hotelprices aren't OTT in Dubai downtown.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Location\u201d", "Author": "aizdeen", "ReviewID": "UR121968753", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel with my family for 5 nights, the location is ideal on sheikh Zayed Road , very close to the Finance metro station , in walking distance to Dubai center mall & Burj Khalifa ,Rooms are great and the breakfast was perfect , friendly staff.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNo problems with this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bilje29", "ReviewID": "UR121926722", "Content": "My partner and I stayed for two nights in the beginning of December 2011 prior to starting a cruise.

We actually arrived at 3am and were booked in promptly even though a large group has arrived just before us. Our travel agent had booked the room for us, requesting a twin, when we arrived we were asked if we wanted a kingsize we said yes and actually received and upgrade to an apartment/suite. Very large bedroom with ensuite bath room the bed was very comfortable and huge. The bathroom was fine but nothing exceptional. Fully fitted kitchen, lounge dining room, very clean and comfortable.

We were there two full days and had no problem accessing a lift at any time, when out for the day the room was always cleaned when we returned incuding washing our coffee cups! It was only 150 meters to the monorail, we bought day tickets at a very reasonable cost, the system is very easy to use and we zipped about both to the old town and the Burg Kalipha to see the fountains, you get a shuttle bus from the Mono rail station direct to the mall. The hotel is in the business area but there are eateries close by. There is a Waitrose in the Dubai Mall where you can buy anything you might need we bought breakfast pastries yum.

The staff could not locate the reservation and requested he call back to allow the system time to update. Calling back as requested the following morning, the staff was rude and unpleasant and the call ended with the same instructions as the initial call. Because the funds were deducted we continued with our travels to reach the hotel. Upon arriving to and entering the 2 bedroom suite, the space was smaller than pictured and the furniture was worn. Overall, the hotel was clean (there were some stains on the carpeted floor) and centrally located \u2013 it is approximately a 10 minute drive from The Mall of Dubai and a five minute walk from the train station. Also, numerous restaurants are scattered throughout the area. Obtaining assistance from the staff was a crap shoot: service was either excellent or exceptionally poor and unaccommodating. The bathrooms were standard and did not have a bidet, but served their purpose. The suite had a washer that also doubled as a dryer, but the trick was to figure out how to adjust the setting from washing to drying. Upon consulting with the hotel staff, the same load ended up being washed 3 times and still no luck drying. We ended up searching for the unit model and instructions online to convert the washer to a dryer. In the end, we had to remove half of the newly washed, wet clothes to allow the dryer to thoroughly dry the other portion. The hotel charged per device for the internet, not per room. Additionally, the WI-FI service was poor as it was only available in one area in the suite. We had a LAN cable, but it was inoperable and we ended up utilizing the cord for the phone. However, once you get online, the internet is sufficient. The elevators were a bit of a hassle. There was one set on five chutes present, but only 4 worked (one was under construction) and waiting usually was a timely process. There were 2 bedrooms, but only one room had a television, phone, and a clock. The other room essentially only had a bed and counter and the extra blanket located in the closet was unclean as upon retrieving it for use, it was sprinkled with hairs. As this hotel is listed as a four-star and we reserved one of the better rooms, we were thinking breakfast was included, but upon inquiring, we were told it was not. The first morning, we ordered room service and the pancakes arrived cold and no milk was included with the muesli. There were a few blueberries and a strawberry on the plate, but not a part of the fruit plate. We requested a bowl of fruit to include blueberries and strawberries and were told those fruits were not permitted to be served as they were only utilized for garnish purposes. As soon as breakfast arrived, the housekeeping staff followed wanting to clean the room, however we requested they come back at a later time. On one occasion, we left the room relatively early and turned on the \u201cservice room\u201d light, but once we returned in the evening, the room had not been serviced and would not be serviced until the next morning as the housekeeping staff completes their duties by 6pm daily.

And I am glad that I was there for one night only. I reached hotel at 2:30 p.m. and was told that room is not ready. Despite asking repeatidly, the reception staff was not willing to commit a time. They eventually gave me a room after 1.5 hour. When I reached the room, it did not open with the key provided and I had to waste another 15 minutes to get the key. It took so long because lifts took ages to come to you. This is a 40+ story building with 5 lifts. However, these seem to be grossly insufficient. I went out for an hour and came back. My room wouldn't open once again. I asked the house keeping guy, who was around, to open the room. He was kind enough to try. However, the room did not open even with the master key that he had. He said the room is double locked and only Reception can resolve this matter. So, I was back to Reception and it took me no less than 1 hour coupled with a lot of shouting after which their manager came up with a key that opened the lock. To make up for the frustration that they had caused, he offered me and my colleague to have breakfast with him. We accepted the offer which never materialized. This guy never came back nor sent any message. When I was shouting at the Reception for opening the room, a lady was shouting about stinking bedsheets that were not changed. I can now understand why this hotel does not get good ratings despite being located next to Financial Center Metro Station and walking distance to DIFC. The hotel has only two restaurants. Food quality during lunch buffet was good and service in the restaurant was satisfactory. It looks like the building was originally built to be an apartment building and was later converted into hotel. Lobby is very small. The room given to me was a studio apartment. The bedroom was too small. There was barely any space to walk besides the bed. Bathroom was separate and had big ugly (refillable) bottles of shampoo, soap and lotion.

I stayed in 1 bedroom suites all along ( do push for view, it's worth it) PROS: - clean, spacious, comfortable layout - comfortable bed - excellent food (breakfast buffet on the 46th or 47th floor), and excellent room service food from hotel restaurants - friendly and attentive staff. If there is any problem in the room, let them know and consider it fixed. - Equipped kitchen, and washing machine - Beautiful and complete gym on high floor, towels, music, even attending personal trainer CONS: - elevators..they can take forever and due to high traffic in this hotel you have to budget time to get to the lobby or to your room - internet can be slow not to the point of annoyance but not the fastest at times My last point is not a pro nor a con, it's an observation worth mentioning. This hotel hosts many families and usually many kids. As joyful as kids are, if you are trully looking for peace and quiet you might not always get that with kids occasionally running from room to room in the hall...again not frequent at all but during my long stay there were occasions when a large family occupied few rooms in the same floor and the consequences were unavoidable...but all good :)", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Journey Ever\u201d", "Author": "paulnmaria86", "ReviewID": "UR110764829", "Content": "The location was fantastic, breakfast was divine and the service from all the staff was exception, first class overall.

The staffs are efficient and charming. The food is great, and there is nothing like sitting out on the roof top on a beautiful afternoon enjoying the Shish and the crowd.

It was a little hard to find it since we were looking for the Angsana but lucky us, we stopped at our hotel to ask to directions and found it....lol! The service has been fast and with a smile. Don't mess with the little door lady. If she wants to take your bag, let her:) We had booked a suite but Garielle decided to treat us and upgrade us up to a 1 bedroom apartment since it was our first time here. How sweet! They are very quick in getting what you need too. We had come in from a long day and forgot to get toothpaste and asked if they had any at the reception. By the time we got up to our room, the guy was there waiting to give it to us. The most important part for me is that it is very cozy here. Yeah, the surrounding area isn't as pretty but I'm not sleeping outside. A starbucks, P&Q and a lebanese restaurant are a quick 3 minute walk to your right. A mini mart is in the back of there too. Haven't tried the breakfast and don't know if I will just because I'm not a big eater in the morning. If you like swimming, the pool is on the roof. It's a bit small for my taste, but I'm not swimming anyways. Location is great as its central and its not that hard to get a taxi like someone suggested...trust me...they are all over...you'll get one. You do have to pay for internet but with the price that Im paying of $80 a night, I didn't mind paying an extra 20 a day. The beds are super comfy and I slept really good. Love how the bathroom soap and lotions are in little dispensers. The ambience of the hotel reminds me of walking into a spa....very relaxing....especially as you go to your room......loved it here!", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cExceeded my expectations.\u201d", "Author": "aikman1", "ReviewID": "UR104610974", "Content": "I chose this hotel as it is beside a metro station and is only across the road from Etihad's check-in office and bus transfer to Abu Dhabi.

What I liked: -good size rooms with kitchen and a washing machine - really great! -amazingly comfortable pillows -aircon that you could adjust yourself -good assortment of breakfast items - i loved the pancakes especially. - taxis always out the front - door man/woman always friendly and helpful - waiters at breakfast always friendly and helpful What I didn't like: 1. Food - No restaurant food until 7.00 pm - this is a problem if youve travelled from Australia, and are very tired and hungry and want to go to bed early! - thus, ordered room service on th1st night - the food was unimaginable abominations of burgers and club sandwiches - what is a dried up \"ficken\" pattie? yuk! barely ate and so the fact that there was - - no minibar of any sort, not even a soft drink or packet of chips made it hard... 2. Cleaner does not clean properly - the left over food (from 1 above) was put on the kitchen bench in a neat pile, it was obviously rubbish and plates for taking away - the cleaner left it there all day and would not take it away. I put the rubbish in the bin that night and left the room service dishes - they were still there the next day! 2 days! - no cups, spoons, glasses etc. were ever replaced. - had to keep asking for a cake of soap as items in the bathroom were never replenished except for towels. - i dont think the room was ever vacuumed in 6 days. - thus the cleaner - did not much cleaning! 3. - expensive internet charges. 4. You cannot walk anywhere from here, you need a taxi or a train. Its a very boring area. 5. Ugly rooftop pool. Dont be deceived by the photos on the website, the pool is ugly on an ugly rooftop- you would have to be desperate to swim here - and it opens late at 8.00 am - this is crazy if you want to do a few laps before your meetings etc. 6. Reception Desk Staff - reception desk staff are mindless drones! They cannot answer a simple question, they have no opinions, they do not know how to say anything except the \"do you want fries with that\" kind of response. One example, there were of us travelling, one was to leave a day early but she was using the work credit card to pay for all 3 rooms - we \"thought\" we arranged to do this as I spent 15 min at the reception desk the day before I left with her to arrange it. At the time of my checkout the next day, I was asked to pay - I said why when it had been taken care of, I was told not it hadnt i said but I spent 15 min with you yesterday arranging this - she said the credit card holder needed to sign, I said but she is in Paris which is why we did it yesterday - she kept saying - the same thing again and again - it would not register in her small brain- lets say i gave her an earfull but I had to pay - I hope we have not paid twice - I dont know yet! She and that desk of drones really ruined the hotel as my review would not have been so bad.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cRecommend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "groovysho", "ReviewID": "UR96696392", "Content": "Iberotel Grand Emirates Hotel is very nice, the rooms are great, our room had a kitchen, washing machine, microwave, stove, cutlery, plates & fridge which was all very handy.

The rooftop pool admittedly is small, however, during our stay we were more often than not the only ones using the pool - surprising given that our stay was during UK half term. There were quite a few guests using the rooftop mainly for sunbathing. Though mentioned in their website, I did not notice a drinks area by the pool. A huge plus for the hotel is the location. It is almost adjacent to Dubai Metro marker 24 'Financial Centre'. This makes it very easy and economical to move around Dubai including the major Shopping Malls, (Dubai, Emirates, Deira City centre etc. ) using this metro service. The Dubai metro is fully automated, frequent, clean, air conditioned and cheap - make sure you buy a card.
