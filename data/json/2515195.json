There is apparently a McDonalds near by that we couldn't find, and we literally scanned all streets close to our hotel.

We were pleasantly suprised by its serene and captivating atomosphere, We immediately felt at home.

We ascribe the success of our vacation to this wonderful hotel, where unlike, on previous occasions, we found the rare luxury of undisturbed all-night sleep. The staff was friendly and accomodative in a most sincere and touching way (and in Sophie's case - immaculately dressed, what as we all know, in Paris is the token of politeness).They did everything within their power to render our experience enjoyable, and we would certainly stay there again not singularily on one, but numerous occasions. The elevator, shower, television, e.t.c - all worked perfectly, our family room was spacious, bright and clean. Our teenage daughter who accompanied us on our trip ( mostly to visit her several Parisian friends), even returned to sleep at Lindbergh at 5 am in the morning, saying, \" I planned a sleepover, but their ( typical Parisian) apartments are horrible! I want a good night's sleep.\" She also commented on the \" intellectual profundity\" of the young people she met \" at the reception desk\", so that's another plus. To put it short, this comfortable, affordable, and oustandingly located hotel, has left us with a beautiful impression, both in the emotional and physical sense of the term, and we've already recommended it to our friends. The only point on which we believe visitors might be dissapointed is that there's no breakfast included, unless payed for (10 euros).

We love Paris so much that we have written a book about the City of Light that we'll be self-publishing. (We're not trying to promote the book..simply suggesting that we've had some experience with Paris.) And, believe it or not, what first comes to mind when we think of Paris is the Lindbergh. Our deep affection for Paris translates to a desire to stay in an authentically Parisian hotel. Nothing fancy or huge; but neat and clean, well-situated; and, most important, accommodating. That's the Lindbergh in a nutshell. It lacks only air conditioning, which could be a problem in the heat of the summer, but we no longer visit Paris in July or August because we can see loads of Americans in the U.S. for free. Owners Sophie and Patrice are so warm and welcoming that we consider them to be like family. The place has a distinctly French flavor despite the excellent English spoken by the hosts. We are totally in love with the area...notably the Caf\u00e9 Sip around the corner, very nice nearby restaurants, excellent shopping, the park that features a little carousel and is an oasis of plants, proximity to the M\u00e9tro, and a fairly nearby taxi station. It's about a 10-15 minute walk (and obviously a much shorter ride) to the Latin Quarter, the Seine, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (which we find to be an art mecca that is much more manageable than the Louvre), Notre Dame Cathedral, and all sorts of shops and boutiques. Paris for us is what we choose to make it. We love people-watching (from breakfast until il WAY after dinner), eating good French meals that offer acceptable value, shopping (mainly my wife), sitting and reading in parks, strolling by the Seine, cruising the Latin Quarter, and ogling street markets. The Lindbergh facilitates our enjoyment of all of the above, and it does so at excellent room rates. We also need to maintain contact by e-mail with our own small company in the U.S. while away, and the Lindbergh has proven very suitable for that. We like to stay in a room overlooking the street, and we try to stay high enough to avoid traffic noise (which isn't too bad because it's a side street). We find that courtyards anywhere in Paris have a tendency to retain noise and smoke. There is a school across the street, and the sounds of young children are apparent twice a weekday; but we really enjoy watching from our balcony as the cute kids parade by. We happen to enjoy breakfast (and people-watching) outdoors at the Caf\u00e9 Sip (best croissants ever), but we've heard from a friend that the Lindbergh's breakfast is very good and an excellent value. By the way, our friend is permanently in a wheelchair, and the small elevator accommodates it. (But we'd advise anyone in a wheelchair to compare measurements of the chair and the elevator before booking.) If you want finery, a fawning staff, commercialism, extensive camera clicking, and plenty of fellow tourists, go elsewhere (like the Right Bank). If you want to experience the real Paris and a springboard to the little unplanned adventures that abound in Paris, consider the Lindbergh. And tell Sophie and Patrice that Sally and Richard send their best and can't wait for our next visit.

Could only call the staff COOL!!. We booked the hotel on the CHARMING HOTELS IN PARIS. Still wondering where thecharming element of this hotel is. Our room was very small, have stayed in bigger in Paris for the same money. The most disappointing thing was our beds were not made up on our 2nd day, but the towels had been changed, and bathroom freshened up. Would not really desire to go back, there are nicer hotels. Breakfast was average, but good coffee!!! A little gem we found before was THE NEW ORIENT HOTEL, near VILLIERS metro. This hotel is also near a fab street where there is an open air food market.

On the upside...the hotel itsef was very pretty and charming (cute little lobby) , I think we were the only Americans (which I liked), the owners were very welcoming and extremely helpful, and the neighborhood and convenient location (proximity to metro and great areas) was excellent. Unless we can afford some really really super swank hotel, I am sure we would stay here again.

Location was great (smack in the middle of a lovely area) and the hotel very cozy and very French. I was there with my husband and two small children (aged one and two and a half) and we got a really spacious room on the fifth floor. The floors cracked (which I think is very cozy) and the room was clean. My sisters also were staying there with a kid each, and my parents, and we all were happy with our rooms - except maybe for the strong smell of smoking in one of the rooms. But hey, we were in France, what do you expect! The breakfast room was tiny, in the basement, but the food was nice. Good quality croissants, better than average coffee and fruits and yogurt and the like. Something for everyone. The service in the breakfast room was so and so. Some of the ladies were not too eager about all them kids making a bit of a mess, but that\u00b4s something you get used to in Paris... The staff in the reception was friendly, and helped with the restaurant selection (a bit hard to find a restaurant that you are comfortable to sit in with four young children...) and they pointed us towards a great one very close by where we got a room of our own (it was the oldest restaurant in Paris, I believe, but the name has escaped me) and wonderful food. We actually went there for two nights in a row, because it was just so handy with the kids. Also, I must mention that there is an elevator in the hotel, which helped us a lot in spite of the small size. And the tiny room in the lobby was very handy to keep our double buggy...which would have been difficult to carry all the way up to the fifth floor :) Overall, a very nice stay, for a reasonable price.

After an exhaustive search, we settled on the Lindbergh, located around the block from Bon Marche and the Lutetia. We chose the hotel based on location and the fact that a room for three (1 double bed, one twin) was affordable (140 Euros a night). The hotel has several strong points, the most important of which is the friendliness of the staff, especially the owners, Patrice and Sophie. They treated us like family and were especially fond of our 6 year old daughter. When my daughter developed an ear infection in the middle of the night, the night manager (really a student) was able to arrange for a doctor to come to our room. In the end, the warm feeling of the owners and the staff more than compensated for the small complaints we had with the room. I know many people read these reviews, and since the Lindbergh was mentioned in the NYT and is in Frommers, I suspect there are several potential guests who know and love the area but, like us, are unable to afford hotels that are now 200-350 Euros a night. Here is what you can expect at the hotel. The lobby is very small. There is a sitting room off reception with a computer and a few sofas. It is perfectly comfortable, but has the feeling more of a living room or B&B than of a hotel. The rooms themselves are perfectly adequate, if you have low expectations. Our room, a triple, was big enough not to feel completely cramped. The main bed was comfortable, but the linens and blankets were subpar. (My wife bought a duvet to counteract the worn and unsavory blanket.) Cleanliness was also just adequate. The bathroom definitely needed a good scrubbing, and housekeeping was uneven at best. That said, when I asked for a new shower curtain (the old one stank), a replacement was promptly provided, and when I mentioned that perhaps the bedding be updated, the owners were happy that I had made the suggestion. We had a courtyard room, quiet except for the incessant low rumble of the metro. (One of the few perks of the transit strike we endured was not hearing the train.) If you can't hack the sound of the train, stay elsewhere... There is a small convenience store across the street with a colorful employee. At least I thought he was colorful - I think some women at the hotel found him less than pleasant. Breakfast was dreary in the basement room. I would pass... In sum, the Lindbergh is a good value in a great area run by legitimately friendly proprietors who care about their property and their guests. If you have low expectations, and you don't mind small rooms with bedding and some cleanliness issues, but that are nevertheless not without charm, you will not be frantically surfing the web looking for alternatives. It is not the Cayre or the Pont Royal, but you won't go wrong for the money.

A ten minute walk in the opposite direction will bring you to the St. Germain Des Pres area which is a lively, attractive area to visit by day or by night. It has many cafes and restaurants and while very popular with visitors gives the feeling of the Parisien Cafe Society. The hotel served a very satisfactory breakfast which included fruit juice, fresh fruit, choice of cereals, croissants and fresh baguette each morning. This was included in the web price we paid. We felt we got very good value for money as the three nights accomodation with breakfast cost 210 euro for both of us.The only downside was the tea at breakfast.
