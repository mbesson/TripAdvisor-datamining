I stay there in March 2007 and I had a very nice experience. The room was very big, clean and nice decorated. The breakfast was simple: coffee, toasts and crackers. The only con is the location. To take the metro, you should walk about 600 mts, and the ride will take 15 minutes to Termini. You also have the option to go by bus. The B&B is three blocks away from the bus station but the ride is 30mins away from Termini. The neighborhood is very nice an secure so you can walk during the night, so if you don't mind being a little far from the attractions, this is a nice place to stay", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arnhem", "Title": "\u201crealy nice B&B\u201d", "Author": "SuperJoep", "ReviewID": "UR7665329", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed for 5 nights in this B&B, it was a realy nice stay. From the B&B You can easily take a metro to everywhere in Rome. The breakfast is good and the owners are always willing to help, or give you advice on where and how to go somewhere. We had a great time in Rome!

The bedroom was clean, comfortable and their people friendly 100% of the time. This B&B is located in a residential neighborhood and very close to public transit and the train serving all Downtown Rome. They helped me with maps and directions of the varios places to visit in Rome. They also warned me of how to spot a pick pocket (thief) in buses and how to prevent being robed. When I visit again Rome next year hopefully I will stay there again.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "queensland, australia", "Title": "\u201cNot wheelchair friendly, breafast terrible\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4301052", "Content": "This B&B is in a very good location, out in the suburbs away from the noise and with parklands close by, so its a pity that the owners don't put some effort into making one's stay there comfortable. The 'B' for 'Breakfast' is a joke. The old woman who puts the breakfast items out on the table doesnt speak any English, and there are several cats eating in the same room where the 'breakfast' is set. The breakfast consists of mostly stale bread with some small portions of jam to spread on it, and a small cup of coffee. The rooms were not wheelchair accessible - especially the bathroom. Unfortunately, I believed the owners assurance that everything was OK, leaving me with no alternative B&B to transfer to when I found it was inaccessible. Besides being totally unsuitable for wheelchair users and those with mobility problems - there is a very steep drive to negotiate to get in and out of the 'B&B', this is not a true B&B with respect to breakfast. Stale bread, small jam packets and a small coffee is not breakfast!", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eur Lake Bed and Breakfast", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d628528-Reviews-Eur_Lake_Bed_and_Breakfast-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Kenia 31</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00144</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "628528", "ImgURL": ""}}
