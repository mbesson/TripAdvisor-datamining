Going to Ritz Carlton, you have a certain expectation of things. And this hotel, supersedes all of them. After a full day of work and then an evening flight, you just want to get to your hotel room. My only problem, after checking in, my girlfriend and I were brought to a gorgeous 1 bedroom suite which stunk of smoke. Unfortunately, I was told that all the suites with balconies are taken by smokers. After waiting for a quick 10 minutes, a very nice woman came upstairs and moved us to another one bedroom suite. This one was much larger, due to the lack of no balcony. My only wish for the room, windows that open. The room was very large and open with a large bathroom and very comfy bed. The room also had a guest closet and guest bathroom. The one drawback for the two closets, only 10 hangars all together. Otherwise, the room amenities were wonderful. The shower was nice and large, wonderful bath, and I LOVED the bed. I had club access with my room, but never used it. We ate breakfast daily in Fearings, which was perfect.The food was always cooked perfectly, and the one day that I used the buffet, let's just say, I was impressed. We never had dinner at Fearings though. One would think, being a hotel guest you'd be given preference, but that's a big NO. The hotel's location was perfect. It was in the nicest part of Dallas, and walking distance to EVERYTHING. But for those times that you don't want to walk, the hotel has a flying spur which took us everywhere within 3 miles of the property. The concierges Adon and Robert, were both worthy of being noted. Those two guys went out of their ways to make sure we were happy and treated us not just like hotel guests, but as friends. Another thing to be noted, Adon recommended a great shop (within 3 miles and you do need a car) called Pink's western wear. Their prices are cheap, their service is above par, and you're part of the family when you're there. I must say, I highly recommend this hotel.

I had a king size, corner room. As you would expect of a Ritz, it was very nice. decor was a little dated...but not bad by any means. Being in Dallas, I expected more of a High End Texas theme...but it was a standard, high end hotel theme. Valet was quick, but overnight was $25....very steep for the area (Dallas does not have New York pricing!). I was greeted quickly and they acknowledged my Birthday, offering suggestions for the night, if I needed. The room was very clean and the bathroom was among the best hotel bathrooms I have been in...excellent job! I requested a high floor...got the 4th floor. It wasn't a bad view, but I wanted a bit higher...not a huge loss though. The only critique i have of the room is the TV size. It was roughly a 32\" (if it was larger, I would be surprised). Because of the distance from the chair and desk, I think they could have splurged for 46\". Just a preference on my part...certainly not a deal breaker. The linens and furniture were excellent. 2 bathrobes were supplied. Service during my stay was great. The bar in the lobby made great drinks and staff was friendly. They have a guacamole and margarita tasting in the lobby in the evenings....this was great! They were the Chef Dean's Signature Margarita, and it was only a shot glass size, but it was a great margarita! I had room service later that night...as is typical, pricing was on the high end. But the food was perfect and service was quick and very friendly! I would not hesitate to stay here again! One warning...weekends in the bar are quite busy! Late night takes on a high end \"night club\" feel, with the crowd spilling over into the hotel lobby. Valet took a very long time, with traffic backed up into the street.

We have stayed at many other Ritz Carlton locations over the year so we had some expectations. Nothing about our stay met those expectations. Th room was shabby. Chipped furniture, worn bedding and our ro om was missing the safe. Literally missing. The hotel sent someone up to look for it. Bizarre. Our room wasn't ready when we checked in, when we came back hours later after visiting a museum or after we sat and waited for over half an hour after being told it just needed to be checked. I finally told the woman at the front desk that we would go enjoy a cocktail in the bar compliments of the hotel and she could come get us when the room was ready. A true Ritz would have had our room ready or made that suggestion on their own. The most shocking part of our stay was the lhe lobby and bar the night we returned from the game. The bar at Fearings had great cocktails and a fabulous bartender we had met the night before, so after the game we decided to stop by for a drink. There was a loud band playing and the place was packed. It had been transformed into a very cheesy nightclub. And there were lots of women there who appeared to be \"ladies of the night\" if you know what I mean. And I don't mean high priced escorts. Trashy looking, working girls. And this must be the norm since there were no less than half a dozen uniformed policemen roaming through the bar all night and a line of security blocking entrance to the hotel elevators. And there was a bathroom \"monitor\" who my husband pointed out seemed to be making sure only one person at a time went into the bathroom.

Why? It is a self-contained oasis of tranquility and luxury. When we are ready to get away but too stressed or tired to deal with airports, this is the perfect solution. It's amusing when we arrive because every staff member asks: \"How was your trip?\" But from the time we walk through the front entrance of the lobby, it is as if we have entered another world. Be sure to book spa treatments when you book your room because they are hard to get. The spa is one of the best: there are fantastic water areas (steam, sauna, showers) and a relaxation room for napping, reading, or a light meal during time before/between/after your treatments. The facials and massages are wonderful and top rate. If you want a manicure and pedicure, I really cannot recommend their services. Same with the hair treatments/salon. Both have been consistent disappointments. But don't let this deter you from the body and facial treatments in the spa. The workout room is immaculately clean with state of the art fitness equipment. It opens to the pool, where there is great service for drinks, towels, food, etc. We typically reserve a suite and have dinner in our room since we dine at the restaurant frequently anyway. Room service is excellent. One of our main criteria is room service: from the variety of offerings to the ease of ordering to the actual service, and of course, the food itself. For breakfast, their coffee is HOT and very strong - just the way I perfer. The beds are comfortable, linens are luxurious. Next time, I'm going to inquire about softer pillows. Bathrooms are typical Ritz-Carlton luxury. If you are at all unsteady, request a slip proof mat for the shower - the stone floors can be very slipery. Amenities are lovely. I always purchase a large container of their shaving creme (the absolute BEST) and their body lotion in the gift shop as we check out. When we had a guest from out of town, rather than putting her in our guest room, I treated her to a room at this Ritz-Carlton so she could indulge herself in the spa and avoid our exceptionally friendly dogs.

I would have felt like an idiot turning on the jets and sitting there while they dined and drank champagne at a formal table set up. But to the hotel's credit the staff showed no signs of mental wear and tear. My little boy was cold from the a/c at breakfast, the hostess brought him a shawl. And the next morning the shawl was waiting for him to arrive! Everyone was so genuinely friendly. When it was time to check out my little boy had a meltdown and would not leave the room. He insisted on staying \"just two more days\" as he put it. Nemiah came up to get our luggage and he was so very helpful in helping me change my son's mood! He took him around to all the staff and introduced him, and EVERYONE did their best to cheer him up! The room was extremely clean, which is very important to me because of my dust allergy. Fearings is the only place you need to dine in Dallas! Muriel at Indulge makes the best coffee drinks! What was a stressful business trip for me ended up being quite blissful and friendly. I hated leaving too, I just didn't have a meltdown and refuse to leave the room! I do think there should be a limit to how much of the hotel a wedding can take over. I was hoping to get club level but that just wasn't in the cards. I am planning a trip to the Ritz Carlton Amelia Island in the near future and suspect that since we could not get a suite or a club level room there is a huge wedding event. I know if I were to have a Ritz Carlton wedding I would want it large, but I wouldn't want to short change other guests either.

I spent part of an afternoon at the spa, which was expensive, but the service was great and the atmosphere just what I needed...peaceful and relaxing. The pool was a little small, but I had no problem finding a lounge chair and the service was excellent. The Ritz-Carlton is much nicer than the Hotel Za Za where I stayed on my previous weekend get-away. The Za Za was cheap construction (you could hear everything in the rooms around you), very noisy in the halls and had rude front desk service. The Ritz-Carlton is quality contstruction, a quiet and relaxing atmosphere and impeccable service.

It was time well spent, one of the most satisfying lodging experiences I've ever had at a very competitive rate for such a property. Comments follow; feel free to email with questions. LOCATION On the south end of McKinney Ave, this hotel is directly adjacent to Crescent Court, and a short walk to numerous bars, cafes, shops and restaurants along McKinney Ave. The free trolley also runs in front of the hotel. I walked one night to/from Idle Rich, a great Irish bar, about an 8-10 minute walk. It's a great location. ROOM We reserved a junior suite at a special b&b rate, and were bumped up to a deluxe suite, a very welcome Christmas present. The king bed was very comfortable, part of the trend toward ultra-plush bedding at the better hotels. The bathroom was large, with a deep soak tub and separate shower. My favorite feature, which will now haunt my wife until we get it, was a TV embedded in the mirror above the sinks. Can you say \"perfect bathroom?\" The TVs had a Bose sound system, a nice touch. All in all, the room was clean, comfortable, well kept, and as good as we could have wanted. LOBBY Never one to pick a hotel on the lobby - I mean, how important is it, really? - I was impressed with the uncluttered elegance and spaciousness that surrounds once you go through the front door. I've been to a couple of Ritz Carltons, and they always seem to have a number of beautiful paintings and sculptures. It's elegant without being stuffy or unapproachable. DINING We had breakfast and lunch at Fearings, the relatively new restaurant by Dean Fearing, formerly the focal point of The Mansion At Turtle Creek (where we also dined, see other review). Breakfast was delicious. Eggs Benedict were poached perfectly. The hollandaise was silky and light. The breakfast potatoes, normally the part I avoid due to grease, were so very good. Potatoes, bell and red peppers, onion, butter, all balanced and addictive. The coffee was rich and chewy, just perfect. And service, which I'll speak more to later, was spot on. Lunch was simple, and clearly from the southwestern libraries of Fearing. We had lobster nachos - simple but delicious, lettuce wedge with quail, and today, the famous tortilla soup and braised pork ribs. All were well presented, served with elegance and timeliness, and perfectly seasoned. We did not have dinner there, but I expect it was on par with the best dining in Dallas. Try the gelato in the lobby shop - very smooth, rich but not overly heavy, it was a good copy of an Italian favorite. FYI, the bed and breakfast rate includes a $57 credit at the restaurant. SERVICE Room, food, and everything else doesn't count at all without tremendous service. The Ritz Carlton never fell short in this crucial area. From arrival to check-in, from dining to check-out, service was impeccable. Consistently attentive without being overbearing, we felt so welcome and comfortable every day. I encourage folks to ask questions about the menu at Fearings. You learn a great deal about food from exploring menus. My daughter had braised ribs at three different places this week, and is now a knowledgable connoisseur of braising. Guess what Dad has to cook soon! All service folks treated my daughter with respect, impressing me immensely. A special thanks to Aubrey in the bar and Rob at concierge who were most attentive and generous. They helped make this a special Christmas. All the doormen and housekeeping were equally gracious. CONS: Really, none to speak of. My daughter wanted to swim in the heated outdoor pool, and unfortunately the heater was not working, so that disappointed. Otherwise, all was well.

I found the service at this hotel to run hot and cold. Upon arriving at the hotel I was graciously greeted by the valets and promptly received help with my bags. At check-in a very helpful gentlemen at the desk made the process painless. I have to say that I was shocked to find out that Wi-Fi is $9.95 a night! C'mon, I just spent a night at a Hampton Inn in San Angelo and they have it FREE! It's a little insulting to charge over $400.00 a night and have to pay for a service that every hotel on the planet provides free of charge. Once I was in my room on the Club Level I was annoyed to realize that the room I was given was nothing like the Club Level room photos shown on their website. They make it look like you're getting a 2 room suite with a living room and bedroom with 2 tv's etc. I got a typical hotel room and a nicely sized bathroom and that's it. Nothing to scream about. I've stayed in nicer. And I too found hair (not mine) all over the bathroom floor and was not pleased with the cleanliness of the room in general. I have to admit that the Club Level is worth it for access to the Club. It's wonderful for light snacks and it's a beautiful quiet space to just sit in and relax. I didn't sleep for the 2 nights I was there because the bed in my room was as hard as a rock and the stupid feather pillows flatten like pancakes in about 10 minutes offering no neck support. For my wedding transportation, I booked a package back in Feb. that included the use of a Mercedes. Two months before my wedding I called the hotel to confirm and was told that the package I had already reserved and paid for was no longer available. I was never contacted by the hotel to alert me of this potentially disasterous mishap. The hotel was nice enough to accomadate me by offering their house car (a very nice Bentley) and a driver which was more than acceptable to me. The day before the wedding I went to the check-in desk to confirm the times the driver needed to take us and pick us up. I was lucky enough to be helped once again by the nice gentlemen that had checked me in earlier. He was very polite and was getting ready to write down the times when out of nowhere the very snotty girl working with him decided to pipe in to rudely tell me that they already knew what time and they were aware of it. I then asked if I would be allowed to bring my photographer into the hotel to take photos and also asked if there would be a rooftop patio on the property that I would be able to access. The nice man said they didn't have a patio, but I might want to check out the pool on the second floor and the girl decided to pipe in again with something about how it probably wasn't what I was looking for. I don't know who she was or why she decided to join in on the conversation that he was handling beautifully, but in my opinion she is not fit for any kind of customer service position anywhere. There is one thing that is kind of confusing about this hotel. There are residences within the property, but no signs letting hotel guests which areas are accessible to them and which areas are not. I had 2 situations where I accidentally roamed into the residential side and the first time I was treated with absolute professionalism and the second time I was treated like I had committed the biggest crime in the world. I was again rudely told that their residents pay a lot of money to live there and deserve to have their private space protected. Which I agree with completely. Put up some signs then! Provide outdoor seating for hotel guests like you do for your residents and maybe hotel guests won't roam the property for a place to sit down! And nevermind the fact that I'm spending over $1,000.00 for my stay! To sum it up, I wasn't impressed with this hotel at all. I would stay at a Westin for the Heavenly bed alone. The hardest working people at this hotel are the valets and the nice guy with the little glasses at the front desk. That's it. Customer service as a whole has some serious renovating to do. I don't know, maybe I expected way too much. It's kind of like shopping at Saks and paying $100.00 for a t-shirt and finding the same shirt at Marshall's the next day for half price.

The hotel was within 10 minutes walking distance to the major office towers in downtown Dallas. The walk is ok on a nice day. Check in is was very efficient.

A polite bell man showed me to my room, giving an explanation of the hotel and filling the room ice bucket upon arrival. I requested a razor from the bell man (I forgot mine) but it was never delivered - apparently forgotten. In a pinch I was able to buy one later in the hotel gift shop for $2.50. The room was very nice. The bed is very fluffy with an assortment of pillows on hand - hard, soft, feather, non feather. A large flat screen TV and DVD player was provided, along with a fully stocked in room bar (not utilized). The bathroom was spacious, with both a bathtub and shower provided. Hot water was very slow in the shower, taking up to 5 minutes to come out. Soap and amenities are Bulgari, a nice touch but too perfumed for me. In room internet was very fast, true broadband speed. My slingbox test showed about 500 kbps. Room service was very good. The menu is not too extensive and heavy on comfort foods. Both the salad and hamburger menu take up one page each in the menu book. The menu is sufficient for most business and leisure travelers. The bar off the lobby is a great design and very attractive. In the early evening it can get crowded and customers spill out into the lobby. Drinks can be expensive - $15 for a cocktail. The restaurant is similarly well designed. Went for breakfast one morning, but slow service caused me to abandon my table prior to ordering. After 15 minutes and one request my order was not taken and I timed out. Breakfast prices expensive - coffee is $6, bagels over $10. The fitness center is well equiped and perfect for a business traveler. One comment on DFW airport- access to the city is horrible. The choices are shared ride or taxi. Taxi is about $50 to the hotel. Shared ride can take over an hour. Public transportation is basically unavailable. Aside from availability, travel to the airport is fairly quick, about 30 min direct if there is no traffic.

There was a separate bath and shower. The shower had a no-fog shaving mirror in it but it was up too high for a short lady like me to even see myself. Double sinks also in the bathroom. My view however was the rooftop of a lower level of the hotel, with some trash on it. Not a nice view. There was an IPOD dock in the room which also served as an alarm clock however it was hooked up to the light switch so it wouldn't work without the lights on. There was a DVD player in the room as well. It was a very nice set-up. The negatives--the bathmats were a little threadworn, one of the faucets was really loose, and I kept stepping on what must have been a tack in the rug by the bathroom. Something sharp sticking out. Also I personally hated the bath products offered. They were Bulgari and smelled of strong perfume. If you are sensitive to scents don't even open the soap. It's really strong. The pluses for this hotel were the staff and service. We were able to use the house car for all our travel needs. We just needed to go short distances within Dallas and were offered the use of the house car which was free, and the driver works for tips. It was a Bentley. It was gorgeous. The concierge worked with us to find a dinner option that would suit both my picky co-worker and me. I made a call for laundry pick-up and they were at my door instantly. They were able to press my suits within an hour. It was very helpful.

It has taken us eight months, but we're finally getting around to actually dining at Fearing's next weekend.

In some aspects this is a fantastic hotel. However we had a few problems. My husband and I spent 2 nights here in order to attend a concert at the American Airlines Center (which is within walking distance) and to celebrate his birthday. Initially I booked the room online, but decided to upgrade to the Club level. To do this I called the hotel directly. The lady on the phone was very helpful in getting this accomplished. In addition to moving to the club level she was able to offer us a corner room for the same price. Our corner room was very nice (724). It had views in 2 directions.The bathroom was a very nice size and had a double vanity. The room was very clean and I really liked the big closet. Our problems came in the service arena. We made reservations for Fearings. The only openings they had were early or late. We took the late opening. When we finally found the restaurant hostess desk through the huge bar crowd, it took minutes for either hostess to acknowledge us. We were told a table was not currently available, but should be soon and they would come find us in the huge crowd when a table was free.(really?) After 20 minutes, we decided to check back, again in took minutes to be acknowledged and told it would just be a few more minutes. Told another guy the same thing. When we finally decided to leave and order room service we informed the hostess we were leaving, we were offered a drink but please, it is approaching 11pm, we had been travelling and were tired and just wanted to have a nice dinner. It seemed obvious to us that they were not too concerned with the hotel guests. So we went up to the room and ordered room service which arrived quickly and wasn't bad. When we finished we called to have the cart packed up and removed from the room. It shouldn't take more than 1 call to get this accomplished at a Ritz-Carlton. No one ever came. We finally got the cart near the door and there it stayed until the next day. Gross. There was no where to put the cart outside the room without going halfway down the hall with it. So my advise if you do want to try the highly touted restaurant, call early for a reasonable reservation time. We found the house keeping staff to be friendly. The club personnel were OK. Other guests usually had them tied up and we were not able to have much interaction with them. For some presentations we hoped for a bit larger selection of food items. This trip was a splurge for us and for the price paid I expect better service than we experienced.

Physically the hotel is very well maintained and handsomely decorated, with loads of marble and rich woods evident in the lobby and guest rooms.

I especially appreciated the large flat panel TV, clock radio with iPod dock and easy-to-use safe. The wireless access in the room was easy to configure, though I could never get the wired version to work. The gym was very nice for a hotel fitness center too, with new equipment with built in TV monitors. My one beef is that the lobby bar can get crazy busy, so if you're looking to relax with a cocktail you may be better off somewhere else. As nice as the physical setting was, I think the service was particularly distinguished. Every request was greeted with a smile and it was clear that the employees were dedicated to pleasing their customers. A few examples: I asked for a NY Times instead of USA Today on day 2. When day 3 brought the unwanted USA Today to my door, I called downstairs and within a minute or two a bellman was at my door with the Times and profuse apologies. Later during my stay that same bellman greeted by name when I encountered him again. When I asked an employee where the restrooms were in the banquet area, rather than just tell me, she escorted me there. The concierge prepared hand written directions to local attractions in alternate versions, one if I were walking, and another if I were taking the tram since I hadn't made up my mind.

The bathroom was seperate tub and shower with double vanities and storage space and very well lit for ladies. The closet was big and there is a chest of drawers in the room for clothes, too.

The restaurant on property, Fearings is an absolute must.

Expensive, but creative, top-notch and innovative cuisine. The surroundings of the restaurant vary depending on which area you sit in. There is an outside patio and bar with a fireplace that was packed with all the \"Beautiful\" people. Just people watching from the restaurant was fun. The Mavs had an event there the same night so a lot of them were on property. The rattlesnake bar is a nice place to sit and have a drink before the crowds arrive.

CLEANLINESS: This hotel was impeccably clean. Not one complaint. LOCATION: tucked in the beautiful downtown area of Dallas. There is a trolley that runs just outside of the hotel entrance, but we used personal transport. There are several high quality fine dining restaurants around this area. One in the hotel, a must! Chef Dean Faring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creations are tasty. And others fine dining and casual restaurants just across the street. You can have access all of the major Downtown sites from this point with ease, taxis are quick and easy: the symphony, Dallas Museum of Art, Sixth Floor Museum, the America Airlines entertainment area, etc. AMBIANCE: my husband and I dislike fussy and overly ornate d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The hotel is exquisitely decorated. Tones of gold and cream with touches of amber and chocolate. The outside of the hotel is very plain and unassuming. This small hotel is quiet and pleasant to return to after long days of site seeing. The staff were always pleasant to talk to and frequently asked for any way in which they could be of service.

One stay we had a separated living area from the bedroom and one we had a living area and bedroom all in one room. I think I prefer the more open larger feeling all in one floor plan. We had a medium sized flat screened TV, a desk and nice sized closet. The bed and linens were superior and comfy. The bathroom was wonderful. Marble countertops, huge step-in marble shower, large soaking tub and separate toilet room. The bath products were Bvlgari.

I expect more perfection from this property at these rates. That said, I'd be happy to stay here again. I stayed 6 nights alone in a \"Deluxe\" room. The room was spacious with a lovely view, and the furniture and appointments were all high quality and attractive. The bed was quite comfortable. I would have liked another chair perhaps, and some artwork on a relatively blank wall would have been nice, but it was a very pleasant space. Room service (breakfast) was excellent, and staff were very nice and accommodating when I encountered them. The rough edges: - I was delighted to see a coffeemaker in the room, with two doses of coffee. But after two days they had not noticed that I was actually drinking it, and I had to ask them to deliver more. Minor, of course, unless you don't notice it until 6am! - There was no room service menu in the room and I had to call and request one. - I like to sleep in a coldish room and set the temperature to 60 or so (outside temp at night probably 40s). In fact this was somewhat important because the bed had a top sheet and then a duvet, which tended to make me warm. I felt like the room temperature really never dropped that much (the wall unit did not tell you the current temperature, only the set point), and the A/C unit sometimes had a spasm of dull clunking when starting up. Pretty distracting. - Footsteps at 6am from above, hard shoes on hard floor. My room was carpeted so I'm not sure what was upstairs. I'm very surprised that this brand-new building allows this sort of sound to travel between floors. Earplugs to the rescue. - At one point the hotel staff wanted to deliver me a message about my stay, and so they sent me what they call a \"text message\" -- delivered somehow through their voice mail system. Using the \"messages\" button on my room phone, the robot said something like \"to retrieve your text messages, press 5\". When I pressed 5, it transferred me to another line that rang forever with no pickup. After 2 days of having all 3 of the phones in the room blinking madly and brightly (think nighttime), I asked the front desk to make it stop. I mentioned that my attempt to retrieve the message sent me into phone purgatory, but I'm not sure they picked up on the need to investigate this whole system's reliability. I really don't get the concept. Just leave me a voice message! - I couldn't figure out how to make the TV display the signal from the provided DVD player, after pressing many buttons. I called the front desk for assistance, asking to speak to someone who knew how to work it. They forwarded my call to engineering when I ended up in an apparently off-duty employee's voice mailbox (8:30 pm). This was not helpful. - $10/day for WiFi. While not exactly a rough edge, it's extremely peculiar to me that the high end hotels all charge for this and the lower end hotels never do. - One of the things about this level of hotel is the huge amounts of staff hanging around wanting to greet and help you. On one occasion I must have seen 8 staff members lingering in the front vestibule -- they weren't in the way, but it seemed like overkill. The doors themselves are somewhat heavy, and there is no power assist on them. The theory must be that the plentiful staff means you rarely have to handle them. Except that the staff aren't always there! I'd say I had to open at least one of the doors about 1/4 of the time coming and going. When I arrived at 1am from a late flight, there was no one in sight. Now I don't mind opening doors!-- even with my luggage, these weren't bad. But I did find myself wondering how elderly guests feel about this.

The hotel management even left a welcoming gift for us in our rooms. The public areas of the hotel are elegant yet inviting.

The food presentations in the Club Lounge were tempting and enticing, and all of us made multiple trips there to partake of the offerings. The hotel is located in the Uptown area of Dallas, and several great restaurants are within walking distance. Fearing's Restaurant is located in the hotel, and we enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch there during our stay. The selections were sophisticated yet true to the Dean Fearing's well-known Southern roots. The scene at the Rattlesnake Bar (part of the restaurant) on Friday and Saturday nights looked exciting, although our group (which included my teenage nephew and my \"tween-age\" niece) didn't participate. Although it wasn't open yet during the first few days after the hotel opened, the spa has since opened, and I have already become a regular visitor. It is very very large (12,000 square feet, I believe) as well as peaceful, clean and relaxing. The men's locker room is one of the nicest I've ever seen in the many hotel spas I've visited over the years. Marcus, one the massage therapists, provides one of the best treatments you will ever experience. The entire staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. All in all, I can enthusiastically recommend The Ritz-Carlton Dallas to anyone visiting Dallas for pleasure, business or a mixture of the two. My family enjoyed our stay so much that we've already booked a return visit during the Christmas holidays.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southeast Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cLovely Ritz Carlton\u201d", "Author": "bellaherna", "ReviewID": "UR10042159", "Content": "My husband & I just returned from our stay. We booked directly with the hotel's online reservations. I had mentioned to a staff member via email when inquiring about specific spa services that my husband & i would be celebration our 10th ann & his bday. In the evening after we had checked in they had brought up a lovely chocolate & fruit desert which we thoroughly enjoyed. The entire staff was very helpful & cheery. Beautiful hotel. This is a new hotel so it was neat being the first one to stay in our room. It is in good location. We either walked were we wanted to go or took the trolley. We did have to take cabs a few times for a few things. Increase the cab rate about $5-$15 from what the hotel tells you. They said cab would be $35 from airport--it was $48. They said cab would be $15 to Northpark Mall--it was $22. Food in Ritz restaurant--ok, this was a disappointment for us. To ecclectic & just not very good. But service was great & again when they found out we were celebrating our ann./bday they brought us out these complimentary little deserts which were very good. Spa----excellant! If I had to come up with a complaint on this hotel it would only be that in our room the TV was on the dresser to the side of the bed rather than in front so if you are watching a movie, after awhile it becomes uncomfortable. But this was minor. Overall--we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. Dallas--well, not too much to do......", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ritz-Carlton Dallas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d659532-Reviews-Ritz_Carlton_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$383 - $500*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2121 McKinney Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75201</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "659532", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/51/63/5163b6d156891f44f9912835a6947a024large.jpg"}}
