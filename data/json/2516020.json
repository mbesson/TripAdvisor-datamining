The bed was uncomfortable and very hot - I think there were blankets between the sheet and mattress. The sheets didn't fit the bed and kept coming off in the night.

I stayed here for a conference and it was the same price as a hostel/hotel within the downtown core. I wish I stayed at the hostel/hotel because of the networking opportunities, but that's a personal choice and nothing related to the hotel. Pros: - Good value - Manager was kind enough to drive me to the convention center (LACC) on the first day because the DASH wasn't running yet. - Good location to downtown - DASH to LACC was only 3 blocks away (DASH is only $0.50/ride) - Flat screen TVs w/ DirectTV & HBO and free wi-fi (main reason why I chose to stay here vs, the hostel/hotel, where there's not in-room wi-fi, or tvs larger than my laptop screen) - Free in-room safe, locked using personal digital code or credit card Cons: - Outside facade looks like an hourly hotel where people go to get serviced... - No real office. Just a doorbell and a plexiglass screen w/ a small pass tray (like at a bank) while you stand at the front door. - While management was great the first day, never saw them after. Two examples: 1) Left key card in room one day and realized it right after I closed my room door. I walked down to the office and rang the bell, waited for 5 minutes and no one ever came. Was running late, so I called them later that day. I knew I was coming back to the motel late that night (midnight or 1am), so I called to tell them so and ask them to just slip the room key under the welcome mat so I wouldn't have to bother them later. Woman who answered said \"Just come to the office; we're here all the time\" and \"Don't worry about coming late, we're night owls.\" Went to the \"office\" and rang the bell. Waited; no one came. Called the office, no one answered. 10 minutes later, I rang the bell again, waited a few minutes, the manager slipped my key through the \"cash tray\" and was grumbling (obviously I woke him up, even though I tried to avoid this through my previous phone call) 2) For check-out, went to the \"office\", rang the bell, and no one answered. Had to use an ad from the rack on the door (holds menus, ads for events near by etc.) to make an envelope to make sure my keycard didn't get lost as I put it in the mailbox. Also, the motel is pay upfront for your whole stay which could be a con for some people, but I didn't mind. I didn't have a car nor did I have time to see much touristy stuff, so I can't address those issues.

Because? Yes the price which is good for LA. I had to pay upfront for all nights and received a bag of snacks & water. I am not too sure about the neighborhood though but i am sure it's pretty safe . Jerry 's run by an Indian family. Yes Jerry the owner I guess is friendly and I hardly see any staff around as their office window/doors always closed. No! they do not call you up and bring you breakfast or offer you coffee. Unlike other motels we've been to during our travel they provided you coffee and muffins. The office which is half covered by tainted glass mirror\u00a0.You will need to press the doorbell and they 'll open the half door . Not very welcoming. Why they do that way is because probably for safety reasons. Well again this is LA motel after all. At night it can be really quiet there. Surprisingly it is actually located near business district ( about 5 mins drive) and a few blocks from a hospital. So I think the neighborhood should be safe enough.You will encounter police / ambulance sirens at the wee hours of the morning. We stayed in motels during our travels in California and I must say this one was a little disappointing. This could be the factors : 1. the room #6 were given located at a \"quieter\" side of the building was dated . You may also refer to the photos provided by other reviewers. 2..Once I came back to my room early evening and discovered the window were opened. Must be the cleaning lady forgotten to closed it back. Since our room location at the very end with high fences/gates and it's very private so no one can get in. Thank god nothing was stolen But again this should not be happening. I did not report this to the owner as we had to leave very early the next day. No doubt Jerry's is a small, old-fashioned-looking motel and needs a good facelift. However they have all the basics that you need of course if you are not too picky : 1.Good clean shower 2. Safety box 3.Wifi ( not the best connection but ok) 4.Flat Screen Tv 5.Free Parking The beds are OK..not the best but OK. I'm surprised my travel partner slept quite well that night. Maybe it was because he was very tired driving around the whole day! If I would come back and stay again ? Nope. I am pretty sure there are plenty motels around LA with the same price list?

Furthermore, it's got to be good to be ranked 8th amongst all the hotels in Los Angeles, right? However, after a wonderful trip to Vegas at a cheaper-priced resort at a more convenient location, we were unsure how to make a true comparison. On the bright side of things:The location was good with Universal Studios a freeway away, the reservation service was prompt and no fuss, the free parking / free wifi / flat-screen HD TV with multiple channels rocked. Though small, the room came complete with all the facilities of a standard motel room. When you check in, Jerry gives you a small bag with snacks and drinks (all my favourites!). The water pressure and pillows were quite satisfactory. On the other hand: There isn't an elevator in the motel so if you bring heavy luggage, you'll have to get it up the stairs. The walls and floors feel flimsy as we could hear/feel our next door neighbours moving about their room. The motel is located near a hospital so we were awoken by sirens through the night. It is also located in between two taller buildings so the area feels hemmed in. The toilet is a little cramped and there isn't any light in the shower area so you either bathe in semi-darkness or wet the bathroom because you leave the shower curtain open to let the light in. There isn't a heater in the toilet as well, so if you shower too late, you can get quite cold during the winter months. The verdict: Considering the other hotels in the nearby vicinity were very much more expensive than Jerry's, I would say that Jerry's Motel is a good place to stay if 1) you're on a budget 2) only concerned if you have a place to sleep (and can sleep through loud noises). We saw the owner every morning about his chores and was always nice and polite but wasn't particularly very warm or friendly as the other reviewers mentioned. In the end, we're confused. We don't like giving bad reviews but we have to say, Jerry's Motel was an \"experience\" of a lifetime. Would we come back? Not likely.

Luckily, Jerry had a cancellation, and called me to tell me a room would be available not long before my trip. So, I cancelled my replacement booking, and made a reservation with Jerry. I'm glad I did! Everything the other reviewers say is true: My room was clean, charmingly-appointed and very comfortable. I particularly liked the seafoam-green bathroom tile, and the spacious walk-in closet. The TV had LOADS of channels, the Wi-Fi was free and worked well, and there was even a refrigerator and microwave. The room was so nice, I had friends who were also attending the Expo express frustration that their hotel was not only more expensive and farther away, but also not as well-appointed with amenities! As many others have also pointed out, Jerry is an incredibly nice man who is very knowledgeable about the area. He was able to let me know what buses I needed to take to get anywhere I needed to go as quickly and as cheaply as possible. In fact, he told me about a 35\u00a2 shuttle to the Convention Center that stopped just two blocks away, and that dropped me off at the front door to the Expo in about 10 minutes! Add to this the fact that I was only a 10-minute walk from downtown. Really great location. I can't recommend Jerry's Motel highly enough to my fellow travelers. If you want a posh, black-tie, five-star experience, you're certainly welcome to pay through the nose for it at one of the chains. But if you're looking for clean, comfortable and friendly accommodations that are close to everything and for an EXTREMELY reasonable price, make sure you book with Jerry.

The bed is comfortable, the TV is huge that comes with many channels, and, importantly, the service is EXCELLET. Mrs Jerry, her son, and daugther, were all so helpful in making our stay there an forgetful one. Mrs Jerry is always checking on us if we need help, or additional stuffs, and even asked if we need any food during our arrival on the 1st night as we had arrived later in the evening than what was initially arranged. She even went out of the way to accompany us to a nearby shop to check on some bus pass rates, and directed us which bus stop to get onto. Her son even helped arrange and coordinate a shuttle to the airport for us. Her daughter also helped us with our food ordering when we had difficulty dialing in to the telephone codes. When have you come across a lodging service that is so hospitable and warmth, with almost practically the whole family involved? Here, at Jerry's, is the place. There may not be a bath tub in the toilet, or a giant live-in space, or fantastic panaromic window view, but hey, the service here beats all.

I was a little taken back by the neighborhood, but I had grown up on the south side of Chicago, so I could deal with it. I wasn't worried that my car would be stolen either. The rooms were a decent size, with a closet area to put your luggage in. The bathroom had only a shower (no bathtub), and it was kind of dark in there. The rooms were cleaned daily, along with the towels being replaced.

Unconventional and while a little unnerving for some business travelers (who connect giving a CC# with locking in a reservation), it is, on the other hand, a fair gesture and one that conveys trust. Rest of story: Through a business contact I secure lodging closer to my business event (E3 at the LACC, the largest convention in Los Angeles), at no cost to me, so of course I choose to stay at that hotel. However, I forget to inform Jerry that I no longer need the previously reserved room at his motel. Fast forward to the first day of the event -- the day after I was to have checked in at Jerry's. I get a call on my cell phone and it is Jerry, who in the friendliest and an almost gentle manner, asks if I intend to stay at the hotel. I am shocked at my own forgetfulness. I feel terrible. I apologize to Jerry. I offer to make good on the reservation. Repeat apologies. Jerry will have none of it. He understands. He asks if I made it to Los Angeles safely. How my accommodations are. He says there is no need to send any money but to come by the motel to have a look and to please consider his operation on my next trip. Bottom line: Jerry is clearly a fair, honest, stand-up guy. I flaked on him and he never made me feel like the idiot I was. I certainly cost Jerry a couple hundred dollars in lost revenue during the biggest business week in Los Angeles.

The owner was helpful in recommending nearby restaurants, and I found other restaurants and a laundromat (lavanderia) with my GPS. The motel is close to downtown, though the neighborhood was noisy at times (but not while I was sleeping). It took me 1/2 hour to get to some tourist sites like Hollywood, due to LA traffic and not knowing the best routes. At the motel, there were a few more guest rooms than parking spots, but the motel wasn't fully booked at the time, so I had no trouble parking. I stayed in room 8 and didn't have any bedbugs or other problems. The room was small but included a dresser, desk, and walk-in closet. There was no tub, and the shower lacked a showerhead, so the water just came out of a metal pipe. Overall, you could choose this motel if you don't need posh surroundings, and would like someplace inexpensive (and for me, clean) near downtown.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego, california", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice!\u201d", "Author": "mrfrontrow", "ReviewID": "UR44993541", "Content": "Stayed at Jerry's 2 nights in Sept. The outside looks a litlle dated but, I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and neatness. The room appeared to have new carpet and a new beautiful flat screen TV with lots of channels. Linens were very clean and the bathroom was spotless with some new fixtures. Furthermore, the owner Jerry, gave me a free ride to downtown for business and was extremely pleasant and informative. A really great price considering how close to downtown it is and I will definitely stay again when I come to LA!", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Jerry's Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d1439222-Reviews-Jerry_s_Motel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$75 - $85*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">285 South Lucas Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90026</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516020", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4d/2b/96/jerry-s-motel-1-queen.jpg"}}
