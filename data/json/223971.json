This one is beautiful. The views of the Doral Resort golf course are absolutely stunning and every villas offers them. They have activities like every other MVCI resorts, some for adults, some for kids and some for everyone. We took the resort-organized trip to the everglades and it was awesome. They provided transportation from the resort and we went to an Indian village, air boating and to some great BBQ. The resort offers a pool, BBQ grills, bocce, shuffleboard, cornhole, on-site fishing and a complimentary shuttle to the Doral Golf & Country Club across the street. The country club is currently managed by Marriott but it being bought out by Trump hotels in June 2012 so I don't know if MVCI guests will still have complimentary access to it after. The only thing different about this resort is that the villas are somewhat small compared to other MVCI resorts I've stayed at. The villa still offers all the same amenities, but on a much smaller scale. But I would still definitely stay here again. The staff is amazing and incredibly friendly.

Check in was easy but the crib we requested and confirmed was not in the room and it was late at night. The room itself is very nice. Great kitchen, dining room, three flat screen tv's, two bathrooms, a shower that could fit 8 people, a large soaking tub in the master, a nice balcony and comfortable beds. It is a updated, spacious apartment. The cleaning was not up to usual hotel standards. They call it a \"tidying service\" meaning they change the towels, sometimes the sheets, empty the garbage and wipe down but no toilet or shower or floor cleaning. Can get messy with a young child in the room. I know the rooms are larger but I imagine many of the vacation timeshare owners don't even use the housekeeping service everyday. The room was still clean except there were definitely scattered small hairs in the bathroom when we arrived and some mold in the shower. The sound between the rooms is good. I rarely every heard the neighbors talking except through the vents in the bathroom. The planes fly RIGHT next to the hotel (on both sides) but it isn't too bad and they were usually done by bedtime. The grounds are nice. There is a walking path, nice bbq's to use, a large hot tub and a large pool. Unfortunately the pool is cold and only gets sun in the morning. Once noon hits, it is too cold to swim and we are swimming fanatics. The chairs around the pool also don't get much sun in the afternoon so the few people that wanted the fresh air were huddled around the pool fully dressed. If you want GREAT pools, go across the street to Doral Golf and Spa Resort (where you have privileges and a shuttle to take you to and fro). The pools are beautiful, plentiful and one is as hot as bath water. It was great. They also have a waterslide but it was broken while we were there. When it is 90 degrees out, the pool temperature is probably not a problem but high season is winter. The pool should be heated as much as Doral's. There are lots of activities planned daily but many of them require reservations or cost money. Seemed like very few people did the activities. Some were great and some were a real rip off. $15 for them to give you plain, white t-shirts and some squirty dye for YOU to make tie dye t-shirts? Seriously? And you needed a reservation for that ahead of time. The activities could use some work. No free breakfast here. The distance to Miami Beach/Downtown and Ft Lauderdale is a haul to do everyday. At least 30 mins to Miami Downtown and 45 to Ft Lauderdale. If you are staying for business in the (industrial) area or golfing at the Doral and need a large room, it is a great option. If you are going to be in Miami Beach everyday, stay somewhere closer. There is a lot of stuff around the hotel such as grocery stores, restaurants and shopping. All in all, the room was nice but I wouldn't pay $325 a night again to stay here (we didn't but that was the house rate). The space in the room doesn't make up for the other small annoyances at that price.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat week in Jan 2012\u201d", "Author": "roamer007", "ReviewID": "UR123568379", "Content": "Good apartments,all overlooking a lake.

The Villas at Doral are across the street from another fancier marriott property and we had full use of the grounds next door. You can walk there or take a free 30 second shuttle. The marriott next door seems to cater to convention groups and is kind of retro-swanky but overpriced in the bar and restaurants. They do have live music in the ritzy bar. The pool next door has a water fall and slide. I guess the Doral golf course that runs through both properties is well known. We had a view of the royal palms on the course from the balcony and did some bird watching there as well.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "Belle2o3", "ReviewID": "UR104951354", "Content": "This was the only resort available through II exchange.

Ample amount of pillows, and a patio that overlooks the resort's pond and golf course. The price is just out-of-this-world amazing. We stayed for 5 days and paid a total of about $750 -- an average of $150 per night for a two-bedroom condo. The people who work there are extremely pleasant and though we ran into some cleaning staff members who did not speak Engligh it wasn't too difficult to get our requests across. The only knock is the location. There are some resturants but no attractions in the area. However, if you like Cuban coffee there is a gas station near by that makes the best. Also, local Cuban nationals hang out and eat there, making me think that their coffee and wide array of food is at least semi authentic. Parking is not a problem, you just need a pass. There parking area is secured with a security booth that was manned every time we came in or left.

The resort is well-maintained and secure. The views from the upper floor villas are fantastic! They overlook the lake and fountain and the Doral Golf Course. The units are spacious with all the amenities needed. There were many activities throughout the week for all ages. We didn't take advantage of many, but we did enjoy the Fourth of July barbecue by the pool. The service was great, especially at the front desk at check in. We arrived early, and even though we expressed a desire via an e-mail survey sent out by the Concierge prior to our visit for Building 7 and a high floor unit, that one wasn't quite ready yet. However, the front desk clerk was very accommodating in offering a similar unit in Building 5, which was a perfect place for us, as it's near the pool but not right overlooking the pool and lobby/arrival area. Some previous posts mentioned outdated or older furnishings, but we didn't experience that. The clerk explained that Building 4 has been remodeled, and the other buildings are newer. In any case, I appreciated the fact that we got an e-mail asking for our preferences on not just the building and unit, but also for any activities they could help with during our stay. This is the first time I remember getting a pre-arrival survey. In my opinion, after many exchanges to many areas and different resorts, Marriott always offers a higher quality stay and service. We had a rental car during the week and found it necessary to get to the Miami beaches, the Keys (nice trip for two days!), and restaurants and shopping. There are several large malls nearby. It was nice to be away from the city traffic in a quiet area. However, there are many planes that fly right over the resort due to the nearby Miami Airport. This did not bother us at all. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, was that the thermostats in the units were set to a minimum temperature that was just not cool enough for me at night for comfortable sleeping. I slept anyway because there are overhead paddle fans in each bedroom. It was a very hot, humid week, not atypical at this time of year, so again, this is just a minor issue.

My wife and I played the White Shark on Saturday and were treated to a very nice round. Good holes, good length, challenging par 3's and not a lot of trouble on the sides. It kept a good pace of play. Saturday afternoon we hit the Spa. Historically we are not \"SPA\" people, but I have become a convert. The faciity was beautiful. Marriott has put a lot of money into the building and the quality level was A+++++. SInce I am a SPA neophyte the routine was foreigh to me, but I caught on quickly. I recommend getting to your massage at least 45 minutes to an hour early. I hit the whirlpool first, got all warmed up and then jumped into the 40 degree cold icy plunge. Yikes! Got my attention but also was invigorating. I then went into the \"Steam Bath, the dry heat Sauna and then they had an amazing Kohler shower with 7 sprayer heads coming from the top and 2 sides. Wiuth the sound of classical music playing a happily stood there relaxing all my muscles. It was then time for my massage which found a new level of relaxation. Don't skimp...go for the 80 minte massage or longer. Also try trhe anti-oxident drink which was rejuvinating. Both Friday and Saturday nights we ate at their first class restaurant called Mesazul. The view of the Blue Monster 18th hole, the sunset plus great food combined to make it a perfect evening. On Sunday morning we teed off at 8:30 on the Blue MOnster which immediatly showed us why it's called a monster. If you are in the rough it has a tendancy to gobble up your ball. Now I know why the pros have such a hard time. If you are a golder, you don't want to miss playing this classic course. It will test all aspects of your game for length, creativity and the par 3's, 2 at over 210 are real challenges. I shot an 84 and was grateful that it wasn't more. The service was excellent. From the arrival, to the pro shop to the spa the employees were welcoming, cheerful, eager to please and friendly.

Well, I must say that I liked the other Marriott I've been more than this one, although the property has many good qualities. If I had been a golfer, my rating would have been much higher. The Villas are fully integrated with the Doral Golf Resort, a beautiful hotel with world chanpionship golf courses, which is said to be one of the best in the world - no kidding. But unfortunatly, I don't play golf so a golf course for me is nice only for taking a couple of pictures. The worst thing of the resort is location, next to Miami International Airport and right under the American Airlines terminal landing route. So there is one airplane every 2/3 minutes landing off your head and that's not nice!! One more thing I didn't like was that daily housekeeping was not complimentary. That means that you had to pay to have your unit cleaned. That usually never happens at Marriott. But of course your towels were changed on request with no extra charge. The resort had many good qualities though. The units are very beautiful and huge with two marble bedrooms, two bathrooms, three plasma tvs, a huge living room and fully equipped kitchen. The furniture is of excellent quality and refined. The pool is quite big and there is also a small whirpool overlooking the green. There are sunchairs even in the garden, overlooking the beautiful lake and the Doral golf course, bbq areas which can be used by guests, fitness centre, game room and free wireless internet access from rooms and public areas. Free transportation is provided complimentary between the Villas and the Doral, and guests can use the facilities of both. The Doral offers a wide choice of restaurant and a renowed spa. The free use of the Doral pool areas is a great deal. The pools are simply wonderful. There are four outside pools and an inside one, plus a funny waterslide (which I enjoyed, though being 27 years old!...) and many whirpools. You are given as many towels as you wish, free lemonade and other beverages and there are also many free magazines that guests can read. If you don't play golf, I suggest renting a car and visiting around beacuse staying by the pool all day can be boring.

The master bath shower has a steel medical seat in the walk in shower. All the fixtures and furniture, including tables and chairs are low and appropriately porportioned for wheel chair access. Not comfortable for anyone over five feet two. The hotel site also fails to mention that there are truly only 2 beds, a king in the master and a queen in the 2nd bedroom. The 2nd bedroom also has a sofa bed in it that if it was opened for usage would block the access to the bedroom's door and closet. Not practical at all. The 2nd bath is actually roomy and comfortable. There is a 2nd sofabed with a flimsy mattress in the living room. Because we were in 5101, 1st floor, the living room leads to an exterior patio that is not secured from the outside area in any way, so anyone can sit and walk through the exterior area. Security is meek in an area that is heavily populated and with a metro airport, miami international, as a neighbor to offer the background noise. The 3 barbeques and pool area were literally within 25 feet of the patio off our living room. So if it had been a longer stay, I am sure we would have had to endure others cooking and socializing right by our livingroom doors at all hours of the night. At 8:15 am, we were awoken by the foul language of property employees who were turning on the water hose, that appeared to be directly under our bedroom windows. Once the faucets was turned on, the water sound was enough to wake up the dead. So between the language of the staff and the water turmoil from our bedroom window, we were rudely awoken and upset. Not exactly a good experience. The room in itself was nice and roomy, with the exception of it being designed for someone with disabilities. If ALL the villa suites are like this, then perhaps the units need to be identified appropriately before we rent them. The parking was plentiful, and the location was convenient. The staff is inept and uncaring. With all the options in the area, look for something else, especially if traveling for a short visit.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brasilia", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, pleasant, great experience.\u201d", "Author": "Carolinne", "ReviewID": "UR10982191", "Content": "My family and I (group of 7 adults) took two 2-bedroom villas.

The area is beautiful. Parking was a major hassle. If you valet it is done at the main lodge which is a couple of minutes from the outermost buildings. If you self-park it is a few more minutes of a walk, which is the Florida heat isn't too great. When you check in, take advantage of a bellman to take you to your room. My colleague and I attempted to find our building and it took 15 minutes in the dark because it was not easily accessible or clearly marked. The rooms were great and most opened out into a courtyard. Good beds and it was quite clean. Strangely you had to turn the AC down very low to get a workable temperature - not sure why. However, mine sat on 60 for most of the week. Area is beautiful and well landscaped. The hotel was easy to find and only about 10-12 minutes from the MIA. Just down the road is a McDonalds and Burger King for breakfast. And a little farther west is a Starbucks. The main building of the hotel has a coffee shop, but not as good as Starbucks. The exercise room is fairly big and nice. It is kind of hidden but once you go there once it is easy to find. I'd love to return to the hotel and golf, but I have a feeling the regular rate would be quite costly.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cFantastic getaway\u201d", "Author": "Brimin2", "ReviewID": "UR8129483", "Content": "Excellent little getaway.

It was clean, new-looking, comfortable. The soaking tub was huge - not jetted, and the bathroom in the larger bedroom is open to the room (the shower and toilet are in a separate space with a door.) As a villa, on-site dining isn't available, but there is a shuttle to the Marriott Doral Resort across the street; we didn't go there. Check-in was smooth, friendly. We stayed only one night, and didn't go to the pool or any other facilities. Standing by the front door, you could hear the traffic on the street, but it wasn't noticable in the front bedroom.
