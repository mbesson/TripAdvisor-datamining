I tried to call the bank in malaysia but it was midnight there and the bank had a system upgrade until 6am! finally I paid 400USD cash until we could fix the credit card.

I was booked a suite for 3 persons but everything was for 2 persons except the sofa which could open up at night for sleep. I went to reception and mentioned them that we are 3 persons but all the services and even chairs of dinning table in the suite are for two but they told it is like that! so I dont understand why they are giving the room for 3 people? I felt very bad and I was not satisfied with the amount of money we paid and the things we get back. the weather in the room was terrible too. room doesnt have any ventilation and the window was un-oppenable! I couldnt sleep with comfort for even 1 night and I was there for a week so I was just counting the days until finish. I guess the hotel has snacks in the evening but nobody told us about it! we only took our breakfast there which was ok.

I'm a former Marriott employee, Marriott credit union member, Marriott rewards member, Marriott vacation club owner and a very frequent business traveler. To say that I have high expectations of Marriott (the brand) is an understatement. This means I expect the same general look, feel and servcie, across all brands. I realize that the different products speak to a different demographic, but when you pay 100,000 points for a San Diego Residence Inn that has the look, feel and smell of a cheap motel, something has gone really really wrong. This location, the one we moved from, off PCH was awful and my 9 year old said it smelled like rotten eggs. It did. One look at the tiny space (called a 1 bedroom suite) told me we were being \"punk'd\". I immediately called Marriott reservations and reached out to the \"residence inn's\" management for an immediate change. Gratefully, there were other Marriott properties available in the area, but unfortunately, none were at the same points or room type. When neither, Marriott reservations or the Residence in on PCH could help, I called the Residence Inn in the Gas Lamp Quarter and spoke with the most helpful, empathetic and professional Marriott employee, I've ever had the pleasure of begging for help. Kelly Montes (guest services rep) took me seriously and got right down to helping me solve my problem. Not only did she make things happen quickly, she went above and beyond by working with Marriott Reservations and the other Residence Inn, in order to get my points (all 100,000) transferred to the their location, for the same room type (the REAL thing). This Easter Sunday was looking to be a long and disappointing day, but Kelly made everything work for me and my family and we are truly appreciative and grateful for her efforts to make something so wrong...right.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They hailed me a cab when I was checking out and were always available to answer my qeustions.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cNice stay during quiet season\u201d", "Author": "apodis10", "ReviewID": "UR123458165", "Content": "I stayed here 4 nights (Monday-Friday) during what was probably a non-convention time. The hotel was mostly quiet and restaurants weren't packed. I think this probably made a (positive) difference. Check-in was very quick as was check-out. Staff was friendly. The hotel, as others have mentioned, is quite new. The hotel was well situated to shopping, good dining and the obvious, convention center and ballpark. There is a CVS 2 blocks down which was nice for things I forgot to pack and didn't want to check if the hotel had any. My room was very nice. Clean, well laid-out. I only made use of the kitchenette for the refrigerator. It is a full sized refrigerator. The dishes, pans, utensils, etc. were ample. The bathroom was impeccably clean noting that the the sink is outside of the sliding bathroom \"door\". I had 2 (non-opening) windows in my room. The bed was reasonably comfortable. My colleague's room was slightly different in layout but not by much. His room was also impeccably clean and tidy. Internet wasn't charged which is nice since the Marriott across the street and, well, basically all other nearby hotels charge for it. I saw other guests at the computer terminals in the lobby though I didn't personally take part. The breakfast was fairly standard. My colleague and I ate there once but decided to try local restaurants for the other breakfasts. We didn't partake of the happy hour. I noticed that in the room, you can make a grocery list and they will shop for you (plus a convenience fee) which I thought was kind of neat. The valets were very quick. They always opened the doors for the passengers. The car was always quick to arrive. They even began to know our faces so they didn't need to ask for the tag. $35/day for parking is a little ridiculous even though it is the regular price anywhere nearby. I can't really blame them for keeping up with the Jones's. There is not a self-parking option. I used the coin laundry not the send-away laundry option. It was convenient. There were probably 6 washers and 6 driers. The change machine didn't work but the front desk was able to give me change. My only complaint with the laundry was that I had NO idea how long the drier was going to take. Some of the machines had timers on them but many did not. I certainly wasn't going to wait around until it finished but I really didn't know when to come back. Since no one else was using the machines at the time, it wasn't a big deal that my laundry hijacked a machine after finishing and before I returned. The workout room was clean and stocked. There were towels, antibacterial wipes, lotion and water. There were TVs on the (2) treadmills and (2) ellipticals in addition to one on the wall for people who were weightlifting. It is a small hallway with windows on either side. I served its purpose and was more than I have had at other similar hotels. The only complaints I had were minor. First, as others have noted, the walls are paper-thin. Inside walls and outside walls. So, in addition to the sirens outside (not often), I could easily hear my neighbor up puking all night. Fortunately, (s)he only occupied the room that 1 night. Because the hotel wasn't fully occupied, the sounds of doors opening/closing wasn't a big deal. If it had been full, I would probably have been driven crazy by the noise. The second complaint was that the hotel staff didn't know much about some of the restaurants nearby. When I asked for recommendations, neither the staff at the front desk nor the 2 valets could give me a recommendation. I was asking about 3 different restaurants and none of them had been to any of those 3. It is very helpful as an out of town guest for the hotel staff to have at least visited the restaurants within walking distance (3 blocks even) so they can make personal recommendations. Again this is a very minor point. The third complaint I had was that you had to use your room key to get anywhere in the hotel. You had to insert it to take the elevator up/down. You had to use it to get into the pool area and again to get into the workout room. It became a hassle, especially when my room key wasn't keyed well, so it sometimes took 5 tries for it to register. I finally took the key to the desk and got a replacement. The only other minor thing to note is that there is a small place for smokers. It is immediately when you leave the 3rd floor headed out to the swimming pool. So, you have to walk past the billows of smoke to go to the pool or workout room. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. I typically only stay at Hiltons or Hilton chains (Embassy Suites or other). This was my first stay at a Residence Inn and I was delighted. I will consider these in the future. I would also stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cOne of the nicer Residence Inns with a great location\u201d", "Author": "Heckler987", "ReviewID": "UR123411081", "Content": "My wife booked us here over the holidays and honestly I didn't expect too much because I've stayed at a few Residence Inns and most of them have been very basic and are usually in an out of the way location. I was completely surprised. The hotel seems brand new and modern, with a very nice room. Even the little kitchen area is modern and nicely integrated into the room. The hotel is in the Gaslamp District with tons of restaurants and bars within a few blocks. The lobby was very nicely done and modern. Everybody we dealt with in the hotel was helpful and courteous. We went to the lobby bar both nights and the staff there was great. The hotel has a a free breakfast in the morning that not only has the usual high carb/high sugar cold items, but some hot items like eggs and potatoes. They also had fruit and yogurt. It was a pretty nice spread. The days we stayed there were some large families with kids who did a pretty good job of eating just about everything in sight and would leave everything a mess. The staff did a wonderful job of keeping everything stocked and clean. The only things I think I could complain about were how expensive it was to valet park and have our dog stay with us. The parking issue isn't totally their fault. It is a city and parking is always a premium, but $20 day is pretty steep. I went to see how much it was in the garage next door and pricing seems to vary on what day and what time you come in, etc. so I didn't bother. It's great that they are dog friendly and we even got to have our dog sit with us in the lobby bar area near the fireplace. $100 is pretty steep for a non-shedding, well behaved, seven pound dog and I'm sure it's pure profit for them. You can't tell me they had to clean any more than usual. When I complained they reduced it a little, but still it's a bit much.

My sister and I were visiting San Diego in November. We choose the hotel for it's great location and closeness to the convention center, which was only a 4 block walk away. From the beginning the staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The bell boys, front desk staff, maid service and morning breakfast staff all made our stay at the hotel amazing. The area in itself was also great. The Gas Lamp is a busy area with numerous restaurants for eating and stores to shop in. In the evening many of the homeless come out, which makes the area seem a little seedy, but I've heard this is the case all over California. We arrived at the hotel early for check in, but the staff was happy to give us a room. We had booked a King bed, but our room had a Queen. When we mentioned this to the staff they were more than happy to change us to a room with a bigger bed. The rooms themselves were beautiful. From the decor to the kitchen, which had every tool and device I could ask for, the room was contemporary and comfortable. Being from NY I can tell you that the entire room would be the envy of any resident used to small apartment living. One of the other reasons we chose the hotel was for the morning breakfast that was included. I had to arrive early at the convention so I didn't want the hassle of trying to find someplace to eat. I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of the food that was offered. They had different types of hot/cold cereal, breads, hot eggs, sausage and a waffle maker so you can custom make your own waffles. Of course, coffee/tea and various juices. All presented in a very clean and pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little small for the number of people that were staying at the hotel. At the end of our stay, checkout was a breeze. I had an early morning flight to catch and had to leave before breakfast. When I inquired about where I could get breakfast before leaving they told me not to worry. The breakfast attendant was there and he made me up a box of food to take with me on my trip home. It was so very nice of them.

The staff was wonderful and accommodating in every way, truly making us feel at home. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which was very helpful when you need to put a 2 year old to bed at 8pm while Mom and Dad still want to watch TV or read in the living area until later in the evening. The hotel's location is excellent, right in the middle of the Gaslamp tourist area, the Convention Center, and the baseball stadium. The Bad: It is very noisy outside in the evening. There are many clubs/bars in the area, and we heard music pumping/girls screaming until the wee hours of the morning nearly every night. The complimentary breakfast is nice (and substantive), with cereals, eggs, pancakes, yogurt, waffles, etc. each morning.

Not a big deal but we were there the long weekend and parking was limited -street noise can be loud at times even though we were on the 11th floor (the occasional suped up car or loud motorcycle could be heard) -no bathtub (we had a standup shower only and it made it challenging to bathe a 2 year old) Although the room has sliding doors to separate the living room and washroom. Don't expect 100% privacy. The sliding doors have frosted glass so light and shadows will be seen. Bed is fair although I do prefer the ones at Hampton Inn. The Queen bed we had was a little too bouncy and soft for my liking. It almost felt like plywood on top of springs. We would definitely stay here again. The staff were very helpful, friendly and eager to help us. Room was very clean and we had no issues asking for extra linens. The kitchenette came in real handy since we bought some groceries and were able to bring them back with us. Note: long weekend in September is very busy around the city.

We're Marriott Rewards members, and my husband travels for business, spending between a month and three months each year at Marriotts. I asked again, \"you don't have anything in a King?\" to which he replied, \"oh, I do have one available.\" The room was fine, other than some outdoor noise and the fact that the cable kept going out and the volume didn't work on the bedroom TV. When we checked out the receipt had 2 valet charges on it, although we used the garage next door. We brought it to the attention of the heavyset man at the front desk, who picked up the phone and said \"I need you to verify that a customer didn't use the valet.\" He might as well have said \"I need you to verify that this customer isn't lying\", because that's what we heard. Another woman comes to the desk, and starts flipping through a book with names and room numbers - apparently a valet book. She spends approximately 3 minutes flipping pages before my husband says \"you're not going to find our name because it's not in there\", and she replies, \"it could be under a different name\". She continued to read the same pages over and over, convinced that we were liars. Wow. They eventually conceded that we were, in fact, not liars, and credited the charges. By that point, however, they had lost our business forever, and cost us over 10 minutes while they investigated THEIR mistake. The girl who eventually checked us out was named Mona, but the heavyset man wasn't wearing a nametag, nor was the tall, thin girl who is likely still looking for proof that we used the valet. The man never spoke again after making the initial phone call, and pointed anyone who walked up to him over to Mona for assistance, making them wait in line while he served no one. Both Mona and the other girl finally asked \"How was your stay, other than this?\" after I walked silently to the other end of the counter and picked up business cards for both the Guest Service Manager and TripAdvisor reviews.

There was the traditional frig, stovetop etc. However, it was tightly wedged within the room. The room certainly isn't any larger than a traditional downtown hotel. The bathroom vanity is actually in the room itself, which is just odd. I wouldn't stay in the room with anyone other than a spouse, because it's a little close. The location is really wonderful. However, looking around there are two very nice hotels within the same block. I certainly would consider investigating them if I were to return. The workout room was undersized.

This is an extremely clean hotel throughout and the rooms are in like new condition as the hotel is only a year old. The kitchenette in the room included a full size fridge, a mini-dishwasher, a full size sink, a full size coffee maker, and an electric cooktop (no oven). The overall soundproofing of the rooms was above average, the beds and bedding were exceptionally comfortable, and the free breakfast buffet was a delicious value. The laundromat area could be a bit larger--there are 4 washers and 4 dryers for over 200 guest rooms--but it was a much appreciated convenience having a clean and bright laundry in the hotel. The pool is definitely lacking here--it is very small, more like an oversized spa--and it is only 3 feet deep. The exercise facility was adequate; however, be advised that skilled photography on the website makes the gym appear larger than it actually is. There are 4 pieces of cardio equipment but only a tiny weight bench with a few dumbells. As an avid gym-goer, I got around this issue by joining a 24 Hour Fitness facility in Horton Plaza, about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. The staff at The Residence Inn were truly professional and always courteous. It was a pleasure dealing with each and every employee here! Valet parking is mandatory (and expensive at $32/night), however, the valets were extremely prompt, polite, and attentive--on some occasions, they literally RAN to open the lobby doors for us. The dining room staff is extremely efficient and friendly as are the front desk and housekeeping staff. In addition, the maintenance department is equally attentive; I broke a coffee carafe and in under 5 minutes, a maintenance worker had removed the broken glass and thoroughly swept and vacuumed the room! The service here is truly exemplary. The location, in the Gaslamp area of downtown, is a vibrant, exciting one.

They weren't there when we arrived, but he thought maybe the flowers would be brought later after we got back from dinner. No flowers ever showed up. So when we checked out the next day my husband checked at the front desk about the flowers and apparently they had been in a side office since the day before. Nobody knew why they weren't taken up to us. The flowers had our name on them. Also, we had called down to the front desk to have someone come up and assist us with our luggage, we also contacted valet to have our car brought to the front so that we could leave. Our car made it. Nobody ever showed up to get our luggage after we waited 30 minutes. So we decided to bring our luggage down ourselves. When when got down to our car we told the valet we were sorry our car had to sit so long, we told him we had been waiting for a half hour for help.

We had called ahead and asked for a room cleaned without strong chemicals and there was virtually no 'typical hotel' smell when we walked in. The hotel's location provides multiple grocery and supply options within walking distance including CVS, Ralph's supermarket, and Cine mini mart (convenience store). The only parking is valet at $32 per day but you can just call from your room and the car is down there when you get down making it a very convenient option for loading/unloading kids. Anything we asked the front desk for (extra towels, pillows) was delivered within 10 minutes. The front desk and valet personnel were very helpful and would give you a pedestrian map with highlighted directions every time you asked for a specific type of destination close by. The free breakfast was great with ample sitting room and the takeout option was helpful as well. Given the hotel is less than 2 years old I wasn't surprised by the chic decor and fast elevators. The restaurants within walking distance were great as well. Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Italian and American establishments in Gaslamp quarter offer a variety of delicious options including vegetarian. The hotel is a short drive from the 5 freeway for day trips up to Legoland and Los Angeles.

The Inn was renovated not long ago and looks nice. It's a 5 minute, 2-block walk from the conference center, or about 15 minutes' walk to Seaport Village. Ask for a map at the front desk. it's a big help finding your way around. The front desk people are always nice. You need your room key to use the elevator. Our room on nearly the top floor was beautifully clean, spacious, quiet, and had a great view looking north towards 5th Avenue. If you can get a high floor room looking west towards the water, that's awesome. The kitchenette is perfect, having a full size refrigerator, lots of counter and cabinet space, a cooking surface, coffee maker, dishwasher, paper towels, plus all the dishes, silverware and cookpots you might need. You can buy groceries at Ralph's, a 15 minute walk, or you can take a bus or taxi to the Trader Joe's farther north. Better yet, take advantage of the hotel's free grocery-stocking service. Check the info sheet in your kitchenette for details or ask at the front desk. There is a small dining table in the kitchen, plus the usual coffee table and desk in the living area. The bathroom door was opaque and on sliding overhead rails, like a barn door. You definitely can't see through it, but if you're very shy it might bother you. What I liked less was the dressing/sink area between the bath and bed --- there's a huge clothes armoire up against the wall and a tall sink/counter cabinet standing between the kitchen and bath area facing the armoire, so that when you're trying to wash up or dress there the other person/people can't get to the bathroom easily. (The Residence Inn in Salinas has the perfect floorplan). The bed was totally comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. The free breakfast in the breakfast room on the 2nd floor was tremendous -- tons of choices, lots of seating, nice atmosphere. If something needs to be restocked, just ask, and the food service people will help you. You won't need or want a car while attending a conference, but there is a parking lot right across the street from the hotel, north on Sixth Avenue. The prices are extremely reasonable there. I think we paid $18 to park from one afternoon through to the next day at noontime or so. A signboard out front has the prices. We used the kitchenette daily as the Gaslamp restaurants are not only astronomically expensive but also serve nothing but fatty, greasy stuff typical of tourist traps. There is no 'healthy California food\" here unless you buy the groceries yourself. By way of comparison, Chicago is far less expensive and the food is worlds better. On our last day in San Diego we went to Balboa Park and found Prado Restaurant, which was fabulous!!! Great food, great service. Well worth the trip out there. Hub Market, a few blocks north of the hotel on 748 Sixth, serves a very decent sandwich, side dish and drink for around $7.50. Freshly made and delicious, this sandwich was far superior to the meal we got at the only vegetarian restaurant listed for this area. Beware the Toscana cafe about a block west of this Residence Inn. They'll serve you about 50 cents worth of spaghetti with a spoonful of tomato sauce for $19. In sum: the Residence Inn Gaslamp offered extremely clean, comfortable, modern rooms with great service and free breakfast for a reasonable price. The ability to prepare your own meals is a huge money-saving plus. It is also within easy walking distance of the conference center, Seaport Village, and other lovely areas and has both valet parking and a reasonably priced parking lot next door.

I am really glad that I chose this hotel, as opposed to the designated conference hotels (Omni, Hyatt, ginormous Marriott). I got a reasonable rate for the area, which I was glad included breakfast and free internet, since my conference breakfast left much to be desired... Anyways. I stayed in a king suite, which was a great corner room with 2 different views of the city (stay on higher floors for better views-- I was on the 11th). I was impressed by the tiny, yet full kitchen with quite modern, stainless steel appliances, including a dishwasher. My only complaint is that the burners on the stove are really close together, so two big pans don't fit at the same time. Oh well. No oven, either, but I don't think most people would need one. The decor was modern and very clean, and I liked the layout of the room: a studio, but the kitchen was around the corner from the living/sleeping area. There is a vanity that serves as a half wall between the kitchen area and the bathroom, and the bathroom was very spacious. My only complaint with that was the lack of lotion, which of course, I had forgotten at home. The daily free appetizers down in the lobby were really nice, and one could fill up on them as dinner if you so chose. The bar looked nice, but I didn't partake. Breakfast was basic but good, and there seemed to be enough space to sit, unlike many other Residence Inns I've been to. The location of the hotel is perfect: enough off of the beaten path so that it's a little private, but within walking distance of tons of restaurants, shops, bars, public transportation and the convention center. The fitness center is pretty tiny, so you might have to wait to use the equipment if it were a busy time. The equipment was nice, though. I also liked having valet services outside, and you had to use your key to access the elevator. Both made me feel just a bit safer, as I was traveling alone.

The hotel price was excellent for this location, there was a least one large convention going on and hotel prices were very high. We booked the room 5 months ahead of time and got a great deal. The door, front desk, breakfast and housekeeping staff were all great. The room was very clean and modern, they only flaw being the great looking sliding glass doors to both the bathroom and bedroom which didn't provide much privacy (especially to the bathroom). Our teenager said the hideabed was fine and he slept well, our bed was good but firm. The kitchen was well stocked and included decent wine glasses. We looked at but didn't use the pool, it is very small but in a private protected area. The location is great, with easy access to transit and close to lots of dining and entertainment options. The hotel is trying to cut down on room parties and you have to sign a form saying you won't host parties. You need to insert your room key to select your floor. We didn't think anything of it when 4 young women joined us in the elevator and waited until we selected our floor to select theirs. On the way up they were talking about the party they attended the previous weekend in one of the rooms in the Hard Rock hotel , they got off at a different floor so we don't know if this was a party too. Later there was a large number of people arriving and knocking at the room next door, followed by some noise. It wasn't horrible so we didn't call the front desk. In retrospect we should have called the desk about both things to give them a chance to deal with it. I don't think these incidents were related to the convention (usually that kind of noise comes much later in the evening) or unique to this hotel but were instead pre-clubbing warmup parties.

Husband had a convention at the conference center and this a very quick 5 minute walk away! We were given room 805 which is a lovely corner unit so you have 4 windows to look out. I had read reviews and knew not to be to low or on the top to floors....well - all I can say is ANYWHERE you stay in the gaslamp disrict will be noisy! Firetrucks, police cars, partying etc! What I felt like the Residence Inn did a TERRIBLE job of was informing the guests of a Halloween multi block outdoor party. The streets around us were closed of and from around 2:30 pm in the afternoon on October 30th until 3 am - Sunday October 31st - our whole room vibrated! We could see the stage of this massive event out our window....I called down to see about ear plugs - you could hear it in the shower it was so loud as the night went on - vibrating bed (at no extra cost!) Eric at the front desk was downright rude when I called to question them and ask to have a manager call me the next day....no one called me at all. Eric did not appoligize, just said if you stay in the gaslamp district, expect partying...well that's fine if you know what to expect but the prices had gone up $150 from a Friday night stay to a Saturday night because of this convention in town which was for cancer and they could have given their guests a heads up. You could hear the police officers blowing their whistles to direct traffic for hours! Yes - Valet is the parking they have...I always called down and they had it ready for us - very nice New Hotel-our room was kept very clean - beds are a little on the hard side! One thing to note is that the bedroom door is sliding with a frosted glass so it really is hard to have someone with a light on in the living room or bedroom with out it bothering the other. This same concept for the bathroom....we had to exit the bedroom, walk past the couch with someone sleeping on it, past the small table with 2 chairs, chest to hang clothes in, and sink (outside of bathroom) to get to the bathroom - another sliding frosted door. The bathroom was plenty large so a fan is not needed. Just plan on not much storage space! You will need to use your suitcase some....there is room for a chest in the bedroom but it's not there! I really couldn't believe the 2 nightstands....all the reviews are so right....you can not open them all the way so...there are only able to be opened 3-4 inches! CRAZY - so....2 nightstand with 3 drawers each.....nothing else in bedroom, chest by sink - to hang up and 2 small drawers - that's it! Hardly any kitchen space- Had to put most everything on counter - SO nice to have a full fridge, microwave & stove top! There is a big plasma tv in bedroom and another one on the wall in the living room....same wall on opposite side so...you really could not use them both at the same time! Pool is a JOKE! it is about 16 feet x 16 feet and the maximum occupancy is 11! Really! It's in a blocked off area with no view so don't stay here is you would like a pool - lots of better options around the area - The breakfast was good and they had 1 or two different choices every day. No, they did not always have a seat available but...there were many more seats here than at most Residence Inn's and because it is new...a little more modern. There was always: scrambled eggs, a meat, fresh fruit, waffle maker, cereal, yoguart, milk, oatmeal, juice, and potatoe, muffins, english muffins, salsa....they rotated the meat and potatoe item on each of the days we were there. If they ran out of something....I would just ask and they got it. Having 2 boys with me, this was excellent way to get breakfast in! Monday and Tuesday night they had a manager's reception. One had much more variety than the other but....for a little munchies, treat and soda...it was nice to have something. So....with 2 major Halloween Party nights happening in downtown it was a little hard to have sleep but - overall, the hotel was good.

All i can say is, do NOT believe what you see in the photos on the website! We were in utter and total shock when we walked into our room and saw the size of it. The \"full kitchen\" is literally 5 feet long with a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and 2-burner electric cooktop all wedged into a tiny corner of the room. Well I immediately called the front desk to confirm that this was the room seen on the webstite that i had booked. What i was told was, Every room is the exact same sq footage but some are laid out different than others. The room was very clean and well kept, and the staff was very friendly but we simply couldnt get over the size of the room. It looks NOTHING like the pictures online. Here were some of the more strange and confusing things about the room and the hotel in general: THE BAD 1) There was no sink in the bathroom!?!? The sink and counter is setup outside the bathroom right next to the bed. Great, the last thing i wanna see is other people washing up, brushing their teeth and shaving. 2) No vent in the bathroom!?!? First time ever i have seen a hotel bathroom with no vent system whatsoever. 3) The hotel pool maxed out a 3.5' deep!?!? For a hotel this size how do you not have a pool where the water level comes above adults waists?? 4) The hotel resteraunt and bar. OK im used to paying huge overblown prices for small portions, i mean it is a hotel resteraunt, but when my buddy spent $15 for 4 buffalo wings and 10 french fries, i was kind of shocked. Also the resteraunt/bar area is like the room, tiny! On the website they make the resteraunt look huge and the bar look like a seperate area for drinking, its not and its not. 5) The elevators. I dont know if this is a new trend in hotels but you have to swipe your room card in the elevator panel everytime you want to use it....EVERY TIME. Gets very old when your going in and out a lot. THE GOOD 1) Hotel and room were sparkling clean and updated with new carpet, fixtures and very stylish decor. 2) Staff was very friendly and helpfull. 3) There was a free breakfast every morning, but i didnt have a chance to get at it, but the area they served it in looked very cozy.

I watched the price fluctuate between $5 during the day to $25 at night and dont even THINK about it if there is a ballgame in town. We came back one evening to find overwhelming traffic and unusually large crowd because the Dodgers/Padres game had just let out. Another suggestion to the valets might be to \"become friendly\" with some of the many pedicabs that are available in that area.

Despite my request for a higher floor, we ended up on the third floor, and since the hotel was booked full, we had to stick with the room for the first night. Room(s) are not massive, but space enough for two people to survive a week. The building has some nice features to remind visitors of its history - including exposed brick at reception, and sliding \"barn-style\" frosted glass doors in rooms. Ultra cool. The only issue is that such a door doesn't allow for much privacy when it's between the bedroom and the bathroom. Our first room was a king with a full bathroom (including small tub/shower) and pull out sofa, as well as kitchen. When we finally got moved to a higher floor on our second night (I had to pull some attitude with front desk, who maintained that the hotel was still \"very full\"...though in the end, it turned out there were several other rooms available) we were downgraded to a queen bed -- still with pull-out sofa, full kitchen. Our bathroom had a glass and tile shower, though, and no tub. This was fine -- the shower was spacious. Noise from hallways was an issue -- the elevators chime very loudly, and voices of other guests seem to travel right in to the room. When tucked away into the bedroom with the sliding door shut, it wasn't an issue. The kitchen is fully stocked. I was a bit wary of the housekeeping staff replacing used glasses in cupboards, as we knew they weren't going through the dishwasher in our suite. (Hopefully the new glassware came off a cart, and wasn't just wiped and replaced!) Overall, the suite was well-cleaned each day, though the couches in both rooms we had were already fairly grimy. Our shower door leaked a lot of water, but since housekeeping was so good at replacing towels, we just mopped up as we went. Our only issue was not being able to open a window -- long term stays in hotels can make one claustrophobic. An opening window would have been nice...but obviously that's just not possible the way things were built. The free breakfast is a bit of a zoo -- this is a family hotel, and as such, the eating area is over-run with families of all sizes. Still, the food is varied and healthy options are available. Staff work really hard to clear tables and meet the demands of even the rudest guests -- and should be commended for keeping a smile on their faces! Pool itself is small, but the roof top terrace it's on offers a relaxing space to lounge in the hot SoCal sun. Didn't use the fitness room, but loved its location looking down on busy 5th Avenue. Laundry facilities were a most welcome thing as I was travelling over 12 days in total. Free internet was a great perk. Lobby was large, with seating for several groups, a business centre of sorts, and a bar/resto around the corner. The mini-shop in the lobby was handy though priced high. Parking may be priced a bit steep, but the valet guys were amazing at fetching cars and hailing cabs. Overall, this hotel is a relatively cool and fairly reasonable option for staying in the Gaslamp District. Far enough away from train tracks as to avoid those midnight blaring cargo trains, but still in thr heart of the busy and noisy bar/restaurant zone of the Gaslamp.

Full kitchen!\u201d", "Author": "detjason", "ReviewID": "UR71529940", "Content": "I think that really nice hotels like this Residence Inn get nitpicked by reviewers in an attempt to find something to complain about. While some of the complaints in the previous reviews are accurate (parking fee, long lines for breakfast), many are trivial when you take into consideration the many amenities at this hotel. At the end of this review, I address some of the complaints from previous reviewers as well as add some of my own pet peeves. We stayed here for one week over 4th of July weekend. It is important to note that there are two types of rooms, a studio suite and a 1BR suite. The 1BR is larger and has a divider between the living area and the bed. I am pretty sure you can either have 1 queen or 1 king, but there are no double beds. Some suites have sofa beds, some do not. If you need one, make sure you reserve one. We stayed in the smaller studio suite and found it suitable for 2 adults and a small child. The full kitchen is only missing a traditional oven, but has a full refrigerator, microwave, electric range, pots, pans, silverware and cooking utensils. This was a big advantage for us during our week stay. The location is \u201cas good as it gets\u201d for Gaslamp. If you aren\u2019t familiar with this area, it is the busiest part of downtown with the most shopping and restaurants. However, it isn\u2019t Rodeo Drive. This is \"downtown\" so you will see plenty of homeless people and drunk rowdy young adults on most nights, especially weekends. Many of the restaurants and bars cater to the party crowds as there are drink specials and happy hours galore. But there are also many high-end and fancy restaurants and others that accommodate families too. The location is within walking distance are the convention center, Padres Petco Park, Seaport Village, Horton Plaza, and the train station. 3 minutes to the zoo. When we arrived on Thursday night at 9:00 PM, there was a guest complaining about a music concert outside. Although the concert was over a block away, we could here it on the 10th floor. Fortunately, it stopped at 9:30 PM before we went to sleep. We didn\u2019t have any other city noise issues for the week. As previously reviewed, the hotel is very clean and very new. The decor and ambiance is really modern and the lobby/lounge area has many places to sit and relax or enjoy a drink. There is also a large communal table in the lobby where there are outlets to plug in your laptop and enjoy the free Internet. The small market has drinks, beer, wine, ice cream, snacks and other sundries. One interesting thing about this hotel is that they don\u2019t offer \"Do Not Disturb\" signs for your door. At first, I was sure that there was some high-tech way that house keeping could detect the room was occupied when locked from the inside. No such luck. After being awaken by housekeeping twice, I realized the inside lock only prevents them from unlocking the door, not from knocking on it. I guess I could have requested a sign. I believe all Residence Inns allow pets. I was the lucky guest who was woken up 4th of July morning at zero-dark-thirty by two large barking dogs next door. Their owner had gone for a jog and left them to howl for 30 minutes. After I complained to the front desk and the owner, I never heard them again. Another pet peeve (pun intended) of mine are slamming hotel doors. I realize the doors must be self-closing for fire safety, but I refuse to believe that they have to close so violently that they rattle the halls. The doors at this new Residence Inn get the \"Best in Show\" award for the loudest slamming doors in their class. I wish guests had the common sense to hold the door as it closes to prevent their neighbors from thinking we were having an after-shock of the latest California earthquake. Previous reviews complain about the parking fee and it also gave me pause. But I learned that all of downtown is overpriced parking. Many hotels in this area are close to $30/day and the parking lots are $18 to $25. I figured it was worth the price of valet and was very pleased with the valet service. Even when there were several people waiting for their car, it never took more than 5 minutes. I justified the expense by figuring out I save $30/day with the free breakfast the hotel serves as well as free Internet. We only found long lines for breakfast on Sunday morning (4th of July) of our week stay. This seems to only occur in the last hour of breakfast. Despite the final hour chaos, the hotel has at least 4 employees running around cleaning tables, bringing out more food and coffee. However, we found a place to sit even on Sunday. Taking the food back to your room was also a nice alternative. For the reviewers who thought that there was insufficient lighting to shave or put on make-up in front of the mirror in the morning; open the curtains and let the abundance of sunlight in. I\u2019m sorry one reviewer didn\u2019t think nine dresser drawers and an armoire were enough storage space. Yes, some drawers only pull out half-way to prevent tipping, but they are full sized drawers. You just have to put one or two items of clothing in at a time instead of a stack. For the reviewers who complained that the vanity/sink is outside of the bathroom and that the tub and shower are one unit instead of separate: Clearly, the sink is outside of the bathroom for the sake of efficiency so that one person isn\u2019t dominating all three at once. As for separating the tub and shower: Marriott is trying to do as much as it can with a limited space per room both to make it efficient for extended-stay travelers and keep costs to the consumer down. Remember that full kitchen you get? That is where your separate tub was supposed to go.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "LJVC", "ReviewID": "UR70846485", "Content": "We have fully enjoyed this Residence Inn and the service has been outstanding.

He also gave us a choice between a king bed and a lower floor and a queen bed and a higher floor. We chose the former.

DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTING: Although the king size bed and crisp lines are accommodating; comfort is absent because the mattress is exceedingly rigid and the pillows are not firm. Sleep-deprived best describes our excruciating un-restful experience. Management is unsympathetic and apathetic to our request to cancel, penalty free, a pre-paid reservation for next September. BENEATH EXPECTATIONS: Room, in general, is clean; we found a hair beret on the floor next to the sink. Bathroom is extremely small; toilet and shower (no tub) are co-located; with the sink vanity located in the sleeping area. Shower stall is scarcely sufficient to move around in. Roof top pool is small and the chairs and tables are limited even though the space will accommodate twice as many chairs and tables. No in-room safe; only safe deposit boxes at the front desk, which we did not use. Hotel only offers valet parking, which is an expensive $32 per night. MET EXPECTATIONS: Inviting front desk and lobby includes a two-way fireplace. Location is walking distances to many downtown activities and by private or public transportation only minutes away from numerous other attractions and landmarks. Check-in is a quick and effortless experience. Employees provide standard Marriott service; Kelly is sociable and exceptionally courteous. Room d\u00e9cor is well appointed, and the neighboring occupants cannot be heard. Windows do not open; however, the panorama view of downtown is pleasing. San Diego bay is partially visible from the 9th floor. Television is 32\u201d flat screen, mounted on the wall, with a decent cable/satellite channel selection that includes local channels, CNN, ESPN, Explorer, and HBO. However, noticeably missing from the choices are the Travel and Discover channels. Make sure to bring your portable DVD player or laptop; on the side of the television composite plug-ins are available. Sofa and overstuffed chair are comfortable for relaxing, reading, or watching television. Additional furnishings include small kitchen table, and coffee table; no desk. Medium closet contains three drawers, extra blanket and sheet and small ironing board with standard size iron. Individual climate control is simple to operate. Standard amenities, coffee and tea maker, alarm clock, and hair dryer are available. Breakfast is continental; muffins, bagels, fruit juices, fresh fruit, egg sandwiches \u2013 with ham or bacon \u2013 cereal, yogurt, milk, coffee, and waffles are made hot and fresh by the guest. Fitness Facilities include a reasonable amount of exercise machines. Express check out is uncomplicated. Building interior and exterior architecture is attractive. BEYOND EXPECTATIONS: Car valet is quick and first-rate; after calling ahead, we did not wait for our car as is customary. Dinning choices are abundant. Kitchenette amenities are ample and include dishwasher, stove, microwave, toaster, refrigerator, icemaker, pots, pans, serving dishes, and silverware. Exceptional: The brand new Residence Inn is a short walk to Petco Park, which are the two reasons we choose this hotel.

Traffic was smooth since we reached SD around 2 pm. We parked in front of the hotel and unloaded our car. Our car was taken away by the valet service at a whooping price of $32.00 per day. Check in was smooth and we got the corner room on the eighth floor in the end of the hallway. This is a new hotel just opened and once again, like with a number of other newer Marriott's hotels, windows do not open. We had to leave a door opened for a while to get rid of smell of some cleaning stuff. Our suite consisted of a nice sized living room with a large flat TV and not very comfortable but usable sofa (why not sofabed?), big bathroom, bedroom with comfortable king bed and another flat screen TV. Because we were to spend there 6 days the most important for us was a kitchen with a stove top. No oven but that was fine with us for 6 days. We had plenty of windows on both sides but one flaw of this room was not much storage place. One armoire was small, had one shelf and half of it was taken by ironing board and other useless to us equipment. We were planning to keep some of our clothing in two night stands which had three drawers each. This was funny but the drawers did not open fully so another space wasted. We don't know who makes decision about furnishing for Marriott hotels but this new hotel with nice size rooms, in good location it didn't have any place to store clothes or any area in the kitchen to store food. So we kept food on the small counter and our clothes in our suitcases. The bathroom is big, has a large great shower with a bathtub but a sink is outside and the counter space almost nonexistent. No place to put anything besides toothpaste and toothbrushes. The sink is located in a dark corner and insufficient light for putting make up or shaving. We liked sliding screened doors between bedroom and living room and between living room and bathroom as long as we didn't have a company visiting us and using the bathroom. We should asked them to use it quietly, not willingly we learned a lot. Another big shortcoming is the breakfast area on the second floor. There are not enough tables to accommodate all guests. This hotel has 13 floors, so there are lots of people staying and it looks like the hotel was full and there were many kids and teenagers especially on weekend. I used exercise room which is very small and a pool is also small enough for splashing only. During six mornings we went for breakfast at different times and each time (except one) there were crowds, waiting for tables and food. The lines were long, the staff was very nice but couldn't\u2019t keep up with refilling needed breakfast items. I ended up taking all we needed for breakfast upstairs to our room so we could eat in peace and quiet. Another thing, there are some night clubs in the area and on Saturday (or maybe it was Sunday) morning around 2 am there was lots of commotion, screaming, shouting, cars and more. Nonetheless, because our main reason for visiting SD was for my husband to attend the AAAS meeting we were pleased with staying at the Residence Inn which was a short walking distance from the convention center.

The Loss Prevention Manager stated that he was investigating the room from which marijuana smoke was emanating. \"Don't you smell the pot,\" he asked.\" He soon realized that this crowd of adult men was bouncing from room to room with my \"Suite\" in the middle. You will probably have your room comp'ed, he explains. I told him that as a corporate traveler that is not a small comfort and does nothing for me. At eight AM on the 21st of December, I heard door knocking from a distance approach my room only to have housekeeping knock on my door and ask if I was checking out. When I asked if it was necessary or SOP for the hotel, she showed me a checklist of rooms and said it was. After explaining on the 20th of December that their bath soap is too harsh and stating that their hand soap is my preference, house keeping left me a tiny soap to shuttle between shower and vanity in the middle of the \"suite.\" My room key expired on the 20th of December, a day before my departure, it took several calls by hotel staffer and one from myself to front desk before they were able to confirm I should be allowed into hotel room. After enquiring with front desk about the breakfast, I was sent to the second floor only to be told I missed it by half an hour. After asking for the newspaper, staff stated \u201cthat pile of newspapers is what the guests have done with the papers. You can go through the pile if you'd like.\" When I asked for a complete newspaper I was told to see front desk. There was no one at front desk and, not unlike previous morning, there were no newspapers in the lobby. On the morning of the 21st of December, I asked for directions to Interstate 5 North through the maze of one-way streets only to receive a pretty pre-printed card which gets one to airport terminal via city streets and not Hancock Street, via Interstate 5 North, where I had a rental car to return. When attempting to wash and dry clothing I experienced the following, washing machines were sub-par and twice as expensive as at other Residence Inns. Dryer lint traps were full of lint, pulped paper and hair. I speculate that \"guests\" kept turning off the dryer as the laundry room is only three feet away from three guest \"suites.\" I was not able to dry my sneakers before heading to the airport since guests did not allow dryer to run. After explaining to hotel staff that I did not have the list of channels they rushed a binder with list of channels that is not cross-referenced to a number, I could not determine if CNBC is channel 5, 8, 99 or 12. Bathroom vanity is in the middle of the suite and tissue paper hidden away on the bottom shelf where I noticed it when checking for my belongings before checkout. For a hotel that offers no shuttle to airport, it charges $35 for parking.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn San Diego Downtown/Gaslamp Quarter", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d1502048-Reviews-Residence_Inn_San_Diego_Downtown_Gaslamp_Quarter-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$193 - $350*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">356 6th Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515642", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/62/0f/82/residence-inn-san-diego.jpg"}}
