The first impression as one enters is of old-world, almost rural French charm. We booked a junior suite (35) and were surprised how spacious and quiet it was for central Paris. The bedroom with superking - or two twins - with two attractive canopies was a decent size, with antique/reproduction furniture. The lighting could have been better for reading in bed, and we are more used to a duvet than a blanket, but the beds were comfortable. Between the bedroom and the bathroom was a separate room with a TV and sleigh bed that doubled up as a sofa. The roomy, airy travertine-tiled bathroom - with two windows overlooking and internal courtyard as did our bedroom - had a bath (with shower attachment), two inset basins and a separate WC. The towels could have been larger and fluffier. Everything was clean, with typically-French, fabric-covered walls - either in a deep red or beige and white floral, the latter the same as used on the bed canopies. The whole effect was classic but classy. Everyone at reception was very friendly and helpful and although our room was not cheap, we felt it was worth the outlay.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonita Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201clovely piece of Paris\u201d", "Author": "kathleenp437", "ReviewID": "UR127034008", "Content": "My husband and I visit Paris for a few days every year when travel to Europe.

Because of Paris traffic, getting to the hotel in a taxi from Gare du Nord was a nightmare; on our way back we just took the Metro and it was really easy and quick.

Next, the hotel is not \"sparkling new\" in its decor, but more importantly it is very clean and comfortable. My family and I occupied a junior suite for the duration of our stay, and we found it to be plenty big enough to accommodate us well. It was also very quiet. Last, it would be difficult to find a hotel better located in relation to the Metro, the Marais, and the heart of Paris. It's maybe a 5 minute walk to Notre Dame, less to Hotel de Ville and the Metro, there are plenty of bakeries, markets, and restaurants nearby, and shopping on Rue de Rivoli is just steps away.

The furniture is somewhat rustic. Do not expect a flat screen TV. They offer a breakfast in the basement of the hotel (very unique cavelike decor) which covers most of your basics for 9 1/2 euro.

The only slight drawbacks of the room were the somewhat weak lighting and the lack of drawer space. The bathroom was sparkling clean and had a huge corner bathtub; water pressure and temperature were both great. The lobby was smallish but very well-decorated and welcoming. Two much appreciated features: the computer with free Internet access (though the French keyboard was a bit challenging) and the many free books, many of them in English, left by previous guests. The staff working at the front desk were all gracious and helpful, especially Karen. A bountiful and excellent continental breakfast is served in a tranquil, cheerful cellar breakfast room with vaulted ceilings. Fresh squeezed orange juice, excellent cafe au lait and first-rate breakfast breads and pastries made for a great start to the day. Cold meats and cheeses were also served, but I didn't try those.

Firstly, the room and bed were pretty small (we stayed in room 9 which looks really nice and spacious on the site); secondly, they have tried to save money in odd areas such as the 1970s hairdryer which gets really hot if you have it on for more than a minute and the lack of shower curtain which means you have to sit in the small bath to shower!; thirdly, the breakfast room is a bit depressing and was experiencing heavy leaks through the ceiling during our stay and finally, on the last day we returned to our room at around 11pm to find our door had been left open - the chambermaid had left it on the latch by mistake and it had been open for almost 12 hours! fortunately, no-one had noticed/taken advantage and nothing had been taken.

If you are after a small character hotel in a central location then this hotel is right for you. We were travelling as a family of four, my husband, myself and two young daughters and we were very happy with our family room which by the looks of it had been renovated recently. It was decorated in red and white material, and although a little ornate, we found it very much typical of French decor. It was very clean, the bathroom was marble with huge bath (lovely to stretch out in) and hand held shower attachement which is very adequate and typcial of European style. There is a separate toilet which was useful for the four of us. Our girls were in the same room but at the opposite end (the room is in the shape of a capital I) which made it more separate - each had their own bed. The hotel itself is located in an ideal area- not far at all from Notre Dame and had lots of trendy shops and bars around. The nearest metro is minutes away, in fact I think there are two nearby to the hotel. People have commented that it is a gay area and this is true but we had no problem with that (made it more intersting). Be prepared for queues at the Eiffel Tower, and check that you can go right to the top of Notre Dame before paying to go up as the very top was closed until the afternoon on the day we went. Walking along the Seine River is a delight and Paris itself is very beautiful, the architecture and atmosphere is wonderful. Somehow the French manage to still retain their autonomy despite a changing Europe which is rare in the European countries. And it will be this that will hopefully delight the traveller. Having two young daughters we also (bravely and with some dread) ventured into spending a day at Paris Disneyland. Fortunately the day was very bearable -going out of season helped - we were there the 2nd week of June. We took the RER Ile-de-France train from Chatelet right through to Marne-la-Vallee-Chessy all clearly marked to Parcs Disneyland. The train actually takes you right into Disneyland, about 40 mins. We arrived at around 10:00 am with no tickets and waited for less than 10 mins to buy the Park entry ticket (Adult was 41 Euros each and 33 Euros for Children). We only queued for two rides (from 20 - 30 mins) and managed to see everything we set out to see making it easy and getting our value for money. Unless you are really into \"theme parks\" I wouldn't suggest staying in the Themed hotels on site - we were definitely ready to go by 6:30 pm. My only negative point on our 3 days in Paris was we were (surprisingly) disappointed with our meals out. We have been to France before and remember the great cooking and meals but this time sadly no. I don't know if this was whether we unlucky or if we just picked the wrong places. We did ask the hotel where the best place to eat was and they told us of one place called Camille (I think) but although the food was adequate it wasn't anything special and to make matters worse it was filled with lots of English tourists and they even handed us an English worded menu - not the French experience that we were after! Even the breakfast, which the hotel recommended was, although very good, run by Belgiums. We did manage to see a great vegetarian place (in the same road as the hotel) showing their pastries, quiches and flans in the window and we went in and had two helpings of the tarts which were wonderful (and there they did speak only French). My daughter loved her Croque Madame! Apart from the bad choice of restaurants we loved our time in Paris - it's a magical city and I can recommend Hotel de la Bretonnerie as a charming hotel to stay in!", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in Marais, but some flaws\u201d", "Author": "Frequent_TravelsSF", "ReviewID": "UR3537989", "Content": "Good points = this hotel is located in the heart of the Marais, a beautiful neighborhood with great shops (Petit Bateau, Mariage Freres -- a wonderful tea shop, myriad others) and cafes/restaurants. Exactly what you hope Paris will be. You can spend the whole day productively without going farther than a few blocks. Service was friendly, and housekeeping was excellent. There is a computer in the lobby so that you can check the internet. The bathroom had been recently renovated and was generally very nice -- double vanity, large soaking tub. Unfortunately, despite this renovation, the shower was a hand held one. Sitting down and holding this shower handle over your head may not go over well with many visitors. Couple things on the negative side: interior of hotel looks a bit down-at-the-heels, carpets are worn to threadbare, and, most problematically, the bed was truly uncomfortable. We had a junior suite (180 Euro), supposedly one of their top rooms, but this bed made sleeping quite tough. Additionally, smoke from the smokers staying next door got into our room in the mornings, which was unpleasant. Finally, the windows are very thick, double-paned, and shut out all noise. However, unless they were closed, too much street noise from nearby cafes/bars got in, but if they were closed, the room became far too stuffy to sleep. Also, there was no assistance with our luggage, so we were on our own to cram suitcases inside the world's tiniest elevator, and drag them to our room. To address one thing raised in another review on this site -- someone implied this was an extremely (\"uncomfortably\") gay area of Paris. That is crazy -- there are a couple gay establishments in the area, but this area is far more like Pacific Heights rather than the Castro in San Francisco, or the Upper West Side in NYC rather than the Village. Not that there's anything wrong with the Castro/Village, but it's just not the vibe of this area.", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cexcellent 3-star (for Paris)\u201d", "Author": "ChrisVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR3484727", "Content": "We stayed here for a week in the late April, 2005. It is in the heart of the Marais district which is a great place to base your exploration of this great city. Le Marais is charming, bustling, gay, Jewish (part of it) and central. You can walk anywhere in Paris from here or take the metro if it is raining. This hotel is on one of many narrow, quaint cobblestone streets with lots of nearby bars, restaurants, cafes, etc. The people who run the hotel are friendly and helpful (by Parisian standards). Make sure you book way in advance (months) or you will be disappointed. After looking around this and other central areas we realized this place is a bargain and great value (for Paris). We were in their least expensive room type at 110 Euros per night - no multiple day discounts. This city is expensive - if you think the accommodation is expensive, wait until you start paying to eat out! It is easy to walk (2 short blocks) with your wheeled luggage from the metro stop at hotel de ville. There is a tiny elevator (2 people or 2 bags, not both) and 5 floors. The decor is traditional with exposed timbers in places. Everything is clean and basic, this is not a luxury hotel. Our room was small and the bed even smaller. A standard bed for Paris but very difficult for 2 people - about the size of a standard double bed in North America but seemed shorter. This is the standard in Paris though unless you want to pay $500 US equivalent a night. Don't know why - the people seem to be the same height (though much thinner) and the bed is small even if you find a large room. The bathrooms were large, somewhat modern, clean and complete with bidet. They unfortunately have the large tub with no shower or curtain so you have to sit and spray yourself if you don't want to flood the entire place (again - why? - a shower would easily fit). The bed was uncomfortable by North American standards but adequate (except that size thing). There was barely enough room for your luggage on the floor and we kept tripping on it. There are no amenities in the hotel except for free internet in the lobby - kudos to this this hotel as this is very unsusual and if a hotel has it here they often charge a lot (20 Euros per hour) to use it. Customer service is not a big thing in Paris - hotels or restaurants - but that is part of the charm :) Hint about food - avoid the cafes for meals and go to a restaurant for much better value and quality. Better than that , frequently picnic - the food (and wine!) in the groceries (one around the corner from this hotel) is cheap by comparison and excellent quality. Our best meals were sitting on a bench in a park or on the wall of the Seine. Word of warning - this, and seemingly most hotels in Paris are fire traps. Alternate exits or fire escapes are unheard of. Smoke detectors are rare, no one seemed to know what a sprinkler was! The outside of most buildings were not made for climbing. We almost bought a rope and would consider it next time. A travel smoke detector would not be a bad idea either. This is not to single out this hotel as this is standard but the one very narrow stairway from the top floor was very sobering. All the above aside, this place is a find (for Paris) and we would definitely go back. Learn some French (just \"bonjour\" helps immensely) and roll with the \"rudeness\" and you will have a great time in this city. The staff at the hotel are there 24 hours a day and always willing to help. Take a day or two to skip the museums, etc and just wander the streets in Le Marais - one of the best things we found to do in Paris!", "Date": "May 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca, NY", "Title": "\u201cVery Charming, Good Value\u201d", "Author": "smh222", "ReviewID": "UR3297399", "Content": "We just returned from Paris and stayed in this hotel March 20-22. What a charming little gem! The decor is beautiful - our room had lots of toile fabrics in deep red and mustard (room 36). The bathrooms seemed to have been remodeled recently and I loved how the toilet was in one room, and the sink and tub were in another - great setup. FYI - the tub has just a handheld shower device (no shower curtain)- just a little different if you are not used to that. The huge french windows with beautiful wrought iron railings opened onto the busy street below, but surprisingly the street noise did not keep us up - it seemed to die down and with the windows closed, you could not hear much. This was a Sunday and Monday night though. We loved just keeping the window open and enjoying the buzz of activity from the street below before going to sleep. We paid 110E for this room and I think it was a great value. The previous week we paid just a little less than that for a less charming 2-star in the Latin Quarter. Even the lobby area and other common areas were very charming - exposed beams, lace curtains, etc. Oh, and the complimentary internet in the lobby was great! Just don't hog it like on particular guest did while we were there ( : The location is great too. Close to Notre Dame, a plethora of cafes and shops, and also Metro/RER stops.
