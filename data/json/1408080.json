For my stay, the first room they gave me had closet doors that would not close and the room smelled strongly of perfume one might use to mask order. I returned to the lobby and rejected the room at which time they offered another room. The new room was smaller, also had doors with non-working hinges, and the paint on the all was chipping. As well, both rooms had old and uncomfortable beds. I continued to be displeased and informed the manager. I was then given a room on the top floor. This third room did have working doors and the bed was a little more modern. The room's main lighting did not work the first day, but it would appear that housekeeping identified and correct the problem as the lighting functioned the next day. As well, the shower was arranged in such a way that the entire bathroom was flooded when in use. Also, the third room had a balcony - it had moss all about it, had cigarette butts in the drain, and was overall poorly maintained. I do not recommend this hotel. The staff was very nice and accommodating - I wish that they may all see their hotel renovated or else transferred to a more accommodating hotel.

Dark woods, bad lighting and worn carpets do not provide a welcome ambience. This ambience expands to the large rooms. The \"air conditioning\" cuts out when you select a temperature higher than 17\u00baC There are no plugs in the bathroom and subsequently no washing line. Overused towels with holes complete the picture. There is no noise insulation to the rooms around you nor the street below. Our sliding door could not be locked. The \"free high speed internet\" is a joke. The standard access code give you a 128 speed - remember dial-up?. After complaining, I got the business access. Even that was unusable in the room. You have to go to the lobby or sit under the router on you floor to get a connection at all. To take a book to give you something to do while the pages load.

The hotel itself is modern in design and very clean. The buffet breakfast has a huge selection and you can go back as many times as you like. I would recommend paying a few pounds extra when booking for B&B rather than room only as I believe to pay for breakfast on the day is quite expensive.

I asked for 4 star in Las Rambla area for $180. The Silken Hotel accepted my bid.Once we arrived we learned that our price should have seen us in a jr suite, instead we were given a room that on their own website is $60 less. The hotel looks like a 4 star upon arrival but I wouldn\u2019t rate the room any more than a 3 star. It is clean, and the location of the hotel is wonderful. However the walls and windows seem paper thin. We could hear the man in the room next to us snoring clearly, and we felt terrible that the couple in the room on the other side had to be moved in the middle of the night as our 1 year old woke up at 3am (still not adjusted to the time change) and was noisy. If you are traveling with an infant- the Bjorn travel crib (which we have traveled with a ton and it is fabulous) fits in the room just fine, but a pack and play would not be able to be opened properly. The room is typically small for a european hotel and the beds and pillows are very firm. Granted, we had a 1 year old with us, so that makes a room smaller and I am pregnant, so hard beds are not a favorite at the moment. The bed was advertised as a king, but it is 2 singles- made up separately- pushed together. It didn\u2019t bother us for just a two nights, but I suspect some couples wouldn\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t say I would recommend this hotel to a friend, particularly at $180 or if you have kids. For kids, the room is way too noisy for naps as there is scooters and construction going on and the pool is refreshing for a hot day, but too cold for little ones. Aside from that it just doesn\u2019t meet 4 star standards in my opinion. That said, if you are not traveling with kids and you bring ear plugs, this is a clean stop in a perfect location! Also, a hot tip for parents, bring your umbrella stroller as the big ones would be very tough to get around in the crowds. The jump on, jump off bus tours are ideal with kids (or without) as you get to see the city and only get off when you need a walk or some eats. Lastly, if you are trying to change your timezone but fear you or your kids will get hungry at night, get groceries before you go to bed as the only thing open past 2 am is Burger king and they only serve fries and ice cream at that hour.

I don\u2019t think so!\u201d", "Author": "CliveNewcastle", "ReviewID": "UR88201289", "Content": "The one thing this hotel definitely has going for it is location \u2013 it\u2019s perfect for the Ramblas, approx 50 metres away. The reception area is nice, as well as the bar area. The reception staff are friendly and helpful too. However, that\u2019s the good part. On the first floor, the Mahogany veneer was peeling and chipped off the wood in the corridor. We asked for a double room, and were given a Twin room on first Floor (117) The room was very dim, dark and depressing. No light came in the window, and it had a view of a concrete wall a few feet away, which had been decorated with art work to make it more pleasing to the eye \u2013 with little or no effect. All the rooms on that side of the corridor will have the same view \u2013 so beware. (rooms 119 \u2013 115, and subsequent corresponding floors above) The dark mahogany effect furniture only added to the gloom of the room. Two lamps didn\u2019t work, and the socket for the kettle was faulty, so we had to boil the kettle on the floor, where there was a working socket. The mahogany wood effect cupboard was hanging off the front of the mini bar, it wouldn\u2019t close. The walls of the room were \u201cscuffed, \u201d marked and dirty, and needed painting \u2013 in no way are the rooms \u201cExquisitely decorated\u201d, as stated in the hotel\u2019s own literature (available from reception). In the bathroom, the lid of the bidet needed a clean, there was no bath or sink plug, and the shower screen was totally useless. It consisted of a mahogany style partition that only came up to shoulder height, and extended about a foot and a half from the wall. No matter how careful one was, the water from the shower (loads of it) went all over the floor every time, which we had to mop up ourselves. I called Reception to ask for an iron and ironing board. The hotel did not supply these; however I was informed that there was a laundry service, and you could have jeans and T-shirts ironed for 8 euros each! Apparently this is common practice, so I strongly recommend you take a travel iron wherever you go to. We requested a room change, but there were no other rooms available until the next day. Thankfully the helpful reception staff were able to move us the next afternoon. (Just as well. We hated the room so much that I was using the Hotel\u2019s Internet facility to search for other hotels in the area. I was prepared to lose the money we had paid, and move somewhere else, regardless of the extra cost!) We were moved to room 114, further along the corridor. A much nicer room. With an adequate amount of light from the window (unfortunately still the dark mahogany furniture though!). The walls were not dirty and \u201cscuffed\u201d as before. It had a view of a narrow street outside, and a small balcony to sit on. The kettle socket worked, however, one of the table lamps did not. I reported it immediately, but nothing was done about it. The controls for the TV were slightly different in this room, and I couldn\u2019t get it to work properly. One of the reception staff came to the room and gave a very helpful demonstration on how to operate the TV and change the programme language to English (sorry, but I cannot remember his name) for which I was grateful. So to summarise, first room horrible, second room acceptable. But no way should this hotel be classed as 4 stars. We didn\u2019t eat in the hotel restaurant. No particular reason. I would recommend any of the restaurants in the area. Especially the pizza place about 50 metres up La Ramblas from end of the street (especially for the buffet breakfast), and none were, what I would class as, expensive. However I have to report that when we were going out one night, we were asked by one of the staff on reception, if we would \u201cLike a woman sent to our room, as it is a service that I can provide\u201d!! He was talking about a Prostitute!! At the time I thought this was amusing, but it is not what I expected from the hotel. With my employment, I stay in hotels all over the UK, so I am quite used to 4 stars. I think rating standards must drop when outside the UK. With regard to things to do in Barcelona Sagrada Familia (the cathedral by Goudi) is outstanding. Hire an audio guide for full appreciation. The hop on / off bus tours \u2013 very informative. Get on and off where you want. Glad we did them. Park Well (Goudi\u2019s park), very good, but very steep climb to reach Cable cars (there are two different ones) one to the castle, and one to a terrace bar , with a breathtaking view of the city.

I presume that it was initially awarded four stars on the basis of its facilities, but amenities do not make a squalid, run-down hovel into a four-star hotel. Filthy. This hotel is very, very, very dirty. The carpets along the corridor and in my room were hideous \u2013 covered in huge and very unappetising stains and bits of debris left by the previous occupant (the room had clearly not been hoovered). These are floors you definitely do not want to put your bare feet on in case you catch something horrible, or in case your feet stick to the gunk on the carpet. The bathroom floor was covered in disgusting stains \u2013 particularly around the toilet (clearly dribbles of some previous occupant\u2019s urine which had not been cleaned away). When I rubbed at these stains with tissue paper and soap, the paper came up black and filthy \u2013 obviously because the floor had never been properly cleaned. The bath had not been scrubbed, the shower screen and the back of the bathroom door were covered in splashes, drips, and dribbles, and the underside of the toilet seat and lid were covered in horrific yellow splashes \u2013 once again clearly reminders of the previous guest\u2019s urinary habits. The small rubbish bin in the bathroom was still full of the previous occupant\u2019s deposits; it is not pleasant to find somebody else\u2019s used sanitary products and used condoms in your bathroom rubbish bin. Surfaces in the room \u2013 such as the t.v. base, along tops of switches, etc. \u2013 were coated in a fur of thick dust, and drawers in the desk and bedside table contained crumbs and a collection of varied bits of debris. The whole effect is one of ingrained filth and grime. Truly horrible. Tatty and rundown. Don\u2019t be fooled by the reception area when you enter this hotel. Its cool white lines and \u2018designer\u2019 touches combine to furnish the guest with the belief that this is indeed a four-star hotel. The rest of the place, however, is tatty, tatty, tatty. Like a sad old apartment in which an ancient person has lived without doing any repairs or upgrading anything for the last thirty years of their life. Every single surface is scratched, corners are knocked off, panels of veneer are missing along corridors and in the room, the glass tops on the bedside tables are chipped, the ends of curtains are hanging off rails, lighting is broken (the bathroom light kept flickering on and off and the table lamp was broken), the mini-bar was not cold, the t.v. socket was hanging out of the wall, the bathroom looks like something from the 1970s \u2013 cold, dirty and functional, the shower screen is lower than the top location for the shower so water sprays out all over the bathroom\u2026 The list of decrepitude in this hotel is endless. And as for the sad little \u2018swimming pool\u2019 on the roof \u2013 it\u2019s the size of a bath. The rooftop patio is as dirty as the rest of the hotel. Similarly, towels in the hotel bathroom are thin, hard, and stink of bleach (better, one must admit, than stinking of the previous guest\u2019s urine, but still not one expects in what is supposed to be a four-star hotel). Noisy. The Silken chain has clearly never heard of soundproofing. The walls in this hotel are as thin as paper, and every single sound from the next-door room can be heard in full and glorious technicolour. That\u2019s great if you want to hear every word your neighbours say during \u2018phone conversations, if you want your room to shake to the rhythm of their music blasting away, or if you want to listen to every development in what appears to be the making of a cheap porn movie in the next room (not that I\u2019ve ever viewed a porn film, but one can imagine that the soundtrack must be something similar to what I heard coming from the next room). If that\u2019s not your scene, then stay far away from this ghastly hotel. Part of the problem, of course, is the hotel\u2019s clientele. While this place sells itself on the Web as a cool, relaxing retreat for business people, it is in fact a very poor quality dive that seems to attract a poor quality clientele, and it is of course the clients who make the racket and who have no regard whatsoever for others in nearby rooms. If you get back to your hotel room at 3 a.m. it is not acceptable that you shout in the corridor or slam the door so hard that the entire building reverberate. That said, however, the hotel staff have no regard for peace and quiet, either. 8 a.m. and it\u2019s your morning wake-up call in the form of the maid smashing her trolley out of her store cupboard. 4 p.m., the middle of siesta time, and you\u2019re roused from your doze by the hotel\u2019s handyman hammering three broken beds for an hour\u2026 Unsafe. This hotel goes to great lengths to advise guests to leave no valuables in their room, to close the door at all times (even when in the room), to take extreme care when checking out (so that bags and cases are not stolen from reception as you pay your bill), etc., etc. Altogether an unsafe place to stay. Staff. The staff at this hotel are in general a surly, ill-mannered, aggressive, useless, incompetent, and inept bunch (rare exceptions include Iv\u00e1n and Luis on reception, both of whom were extremely friendly and efficient). The very worst of this dreadful bunch were the two girls who worked the reception desk in the afternoon. One of them could barely speak Spanish, and neither of them had any idea whatsoever of customer service. Just for the record, it doesn\u2019t include making eternal excuses to guests. The number one rule in customer services is this: your client doesn\u2019t want excuses; he or she wants solutions and results. The two girls on reception made no effort whatsoever to resolve the multiple problems arising from the filthy, rundown nature of the hotel in which they work. They were rude in the extreme. They were also more than incompetent, and past masters in the art of the feeble excuse. One can only assume that there is such a dearth of people who want reception work in Barcelona that the Silken Ramblas is obliged to employ whatever turns up on its doorstep (probably sleeping in a cardboard box outside the front door when they open up in the morning...). General. Despite its Web description suggesting that this hotel is suited to the business traveller who will find within its walls a calm place to relax after a hard day\u2019s work, this establishment appears to be used almost exclusively by raucous tourists who have no consideration for others. Staff are rude and useless and make no effort to assist guests. If you are indeed a business traveller, do not make the serious error of staying here. Look for a real business-class hotel somewhere away from the centre of the city \u2013 an establishment that will be clean, quiet, will provide free Internet access (the Silken Ramblas has wifi, but guests have to pay for Internet access if they don\u2019t have their laptop with them), and where staff will be attentive to your needs. If you\u2019re a noisy, no-frills tourist who wants to be in the centre of Barcelona, then you can surely find somewhere that is as filthy, rundown, tatty, unsafe and generally shoddy as this place for far less money. In fact, this hostelry is such a doss-house that the Silken chain should pay guests for having to put up with its awfulness. Problems with this hotel are also exacerbated by the absence of any management whatsoever during holiday periods. I stayed here during the St. John\u2019s day holiday, and the hotel\u2019s manageress was away on leave. There was thus nobody in charge to take important decisions or to deal with the multitudinous guest problems that arose. This blatant lack of concern for actually running and managing the hotel pretty much sums up Silken\u2019s attitude: get \u2018em in through the door, grab their cash, and provide an inferior product; after all, who cares about tourists? \u2013 there are plenty more where this lot came from.

Firstly, the location of the hotel, off the \"top\" end of La Ramblas (el corte ingles end) is fantastic. Right in the centre of everything. The buffet breakfast is really great, with a good choice of everything and topped up regularly. The breakfast room staff were most pleasant too. Unfortunately, the reception staff aren't from the same charm school. As a previous reviewer said, we were also left standing at reception while they had a private chat and did some computer work. In the finish, we did the polite cough trick. The room, in my opinion, wasn't at all nice. It's exactly as the photographs depict it, but is really dark and horrible in reality. Our room also looked out at a wall. Granted there was art work of sorts on the wall - I don't know if it is official art or just graffiti - but it wasn't a pleasant site. The bathroom was smaller than our downstairs loo at home. The shower (in bath) was powerful though so I didn't really have any complaints about that. The bathroom door opened against the bath, making the room very confined. The bed was very comfy though on a positive note and very clean. We didn't take a look at the gym or pool so won't comment on them. The lobby bar is typical hotel bar - a few people sitting around but no atmosphere. There's a really nice restaurant about two doors from the hotel, towards La Ramblas which is really nice and I'd recommend it. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of it.

Would have gone back to the Royal but this time wanted a pool as one of the reasons for the 4 day break was to get away from the rain and to relax. Hotel very convenient - clean and functional - like a lot of city hotels, not a lot of people in the bar area at night as atmosphere too good out in the streets. Room was nice but very dark due to the proximity of the next building so there was no view - you had to practically strain to see what the weather was like outside - and because the room was dark we slept in most mornings. Didnt eat at all in the hotel as there was a large selection of street cafes etc and breakfast was too expensive in the hotel. The rooftop pool was small but very welcoming - the only thing was that there was only 10 sunbeds available - however it wasnt too busy and there was a good supply of seats/tables. Bathrooms were okay in that the toiletries were plentiful and very good - although shower was above the bath, and there is no natural light. Beds huge and comfortable, bedlinen pristine,plasma tv, good music system. Noise levels from bedrooms above annoying with a child who never stopped crying from early morning and parents who seemed to continually speak as if they were shouting. Would I go back? - if the swimming pool/convenience was important yes - if swimming pool not important would put the Royal Ramblas above it because of its bright rooms/open airy breakfast dining room and good value breakfast - 10Euro as opposed to 17 euro) Very nice bar behind the 1898 hotel called bar lobo. Two excellent restaurants 'The Attic' just opposite the 1898 hotel in La Ramlas - there is a rooftop terrace if you want to eat outside, and Sinatra restaurant - unfortunately cannot remember the street name - but if you go to the large courtyard of restaurants on further down the left hand side of the Ramblas and take the alley out the back of it you will find it - well worth a visit - collect one of the fliers of the staff who are advertising it and you get a free glass of cava. The taglietta is perfect - it is sirloin of veal cooked medium to perfection - the Passion fruit dessert is really lovely. We took the tourist buses for two days - 20 euro for 1 day, 26 euro for two days - used it to go to the beach on one of the days. The Nou Camp - Barcelonas home ground is well worth a visit - we went to a match, and whilst I am not into football the stadium is really impressive - we took the metro which was convenient and cheap. Being late home from the match did show a different side to the late night streets - there were a lot of undesirables about - so much nicer to go out early and come back at a reasonable time.

All I can say is what a very modern cool hotel, well situated, just off La Rambla in a small side street literally 150m from Placa de Catalunya. This was perfect as we took the Aerobus directly from the airport straight to Placa de Catalunya and we just had a very short walk with our cases. Anyway back to the hotel, the reception was very modern in dark woods and marble and led straight into the lobby bar. We didn't use that because of the abundance of bars in Barcelona but it looked nice all the same, just a little quiet. The reception staff were freindly and professional. We had a standard room which was air conditioned, had a large bed, sofa, TV, dressing area and good bath/shower. The room was immaculate and again very contemporary. A nice touch to my mind was the constant 'chillout' music available if you should so wish. Also, the room was toward the rear of the hotel so we did not get much of the street noise. On the roof was a nice terrace with great views and a compact swimming pool, you could order drinks from the bar if you wanted via a telephone. There is a gym but this was very limited to one bench with a light barbell and a stationery bike. We did not take breakfast at the Hotel as there was a good little cafe in the adjacent square which did a nice bocadillo. We did not eat in the hotel at all as there are plenty of good eateries in Barcelona, most of which you will find in the narrow side streets off La Rambla.

Ideal for touring the City as it is close to the Metro, close to the shops and restaurants, and is most of all a nice Hotel. The room was lovely and spacious and the bathroom was lovely as it had both a bath and bidet, the bath was a real bonus after a day's touring I was delighted that it didn't just have a shower. The air conditioning was great and there was a TV but mostly spanish channels or American News, but it was still nice to have the facility. There was a sauna and pool but we didn't have time to use any of these facilities, the pool is on the roof and there is a lovely view from up there, but the weather was quite cool in May so we didn't use it. The Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed for five nights, we didn't eat in the Hotel at all as there were so many choices of restaurants in the City. It was so reasonable to eat out, and we were so glad to be within walking distance of everything in the evenings as touring all day could prove very tiring, and heading out on the metro at night again would not be appealing. Ideal Hotel for a City break and Barcelona has so much to offer. Very accommodating too when we had an evening flight, the porter took our bags for the day so we could spend the day in the City before heading for the Airport. There is no problem getting to the Airport, the shuttle bus leaves every six minutes from the nearby square, the porter will give directions and it only costs about 10 euro or less for two people. So no need to spend a fortune on a taxi if you have loads of time to get to the Airport. We did get a taxi on arrival as we arrived in on an evening flight, cost about thirty euro but worth it to get to the Hotel door.

I found this hotel through a search again and I was impressed with the hotel's website. The hotel was very modern, chic, and contemporary. Check in at the hotel was very easy. The front desk staff were very helpful and after spending 7 nights at the hotel, you got to know most of the front desk staff after walking by them several times a day. We had a King size bed in our room. This was a real king size bed by North American standards and not two twin/double beds stuck together like they do in many European hotels. The bed was extremely comfortable with nice clean sheets, deep rich colours and lots of pillows. The room was very spacious and extremely clean. We had desk, sofa with pull out bed, recliner and cocktail table in our room. The coolest part of the room was the built-in music system. At the flick of a switch you could listen to some house/jazz music throughout the room, including the bathroom and shower!! Pretty cool. The bathroom was huge...marble countertops and flooring. There's also a bidet in the bathroom which I thought was funny. Again, a fairly common thing to have in Europe. The only thing that was a bit of a drag is that there was no shower door/curtain in the bathroom. The shower/tub has half a wall covering it and then the rest of the space is all open concept. Sometimes water would splash onto the floor of the bathroom while you showered...but these types of showers seem to be quite common in Europe. The hotel had a small business centre with a computer for internet access. There was also a small lounge/bar area just after the main lobby which was pretty hip and stylish. The waterfall feature was a nice touch as well. We never did eat the hotel. There are tons of cafes/restaurants all around the hotel and Ramblas. Across the street from the hotel is a small restaurant serving typical Catalunyan dishes and tapas. There's a small grocery store around the corner as well as a Starbucks.

Just far enough off the main road that the noise was reduced to a bearable level - didn't need my earplugs for once.

Lifts were fine. Corridors a bit dark. Room excellent, but they all smelt of smoke, even the non-smoking ones. Not badly, just enough to make to want to open the windows a bit when you came in. Not an enormous room, but OK. Bed was huge, clean and very comfortable, with chocs on the pillows. Bathroom was new looking. Desk was more than big enough to get some work done. The wireless internet is free, and you need to get a password from reception. But it was a reasonable speed and the connection was good.

Initial impressions are good; on a quiet side street just off La Rambla and about 100 meters from Placa Catlalunya and with a contemporary though not cold reception area. Just down from Reception is a small lounge area containing a small but seemingly fully stocked bar and at the end of the lounge an impressive water feature. Check-in was painless, however the room we had been allocated was a twin room even though I had booked a room with a King bed. A quick call to Reception resulted in a change of rooms, but we had to wait an hour for it to be cleaned (we had arrived early so we had already waited an hour for the first room, not the Hotel\u2019s fault and we didn\u2019t mind). Returning after lunch there was no luggage in the room, another call to Reception and they insisted it had to be there; no it isn\u2019t. Finally a receptionist came up and asked if we would help them look in the luggage area; they were still on the baggage cart from the first room effort. Again the initial impression of the rooms is favorable; dark wood veneer, a generous sized room (even by American hotel standards) and the standard bathroom with granite sink top and wall tiles. Closer inspection reveals shabbiness: badly scuffed walls, scratches and chips on doors and door frames \u2013 one bedroom door (not ours) had a large chunk of veneer missing. There was a medium sized work desk part of which was occupied by a television with poor reception and one English language channel - the CNN channel was in Spanish \u2013 and with only a single electrical outlet, in addition to the one for the desk lamp. There was complimentary Hotel WiFi in the room which was basically useless with minimal to no signal. I had better luck parking on a nearby open network. One had to go down to the bar area to get a useable signal. The bathroom was a modest though acceptable size with a sink and tub containing a wall shower and a toilet and bidet. Caveat: this arrangement may be disconcerting for anyone who likes their privacy when using the toilet, both the toilet and bidet are behind a partition with an open doorway (no door) to the sink and tub area. The King bed turned out to be a puzzling matter. It was two twins pushed together and a pad across both of them. Not terribly unusual but why they couldn\u2019t have done that with the original room isn\u2019t clear. Furthermore it transpired that they presumably didn\u2019t have duvets for a King size bed, they used two duvets for twin beds with one overlapping the other as one does for roof tiles; not very comfortable down the seam where one ended. The biggest disappointment was the handling of the fire alarms, which activated at 5 AM on our first night. The emergency stairs emptied into a storage room in darkness and the exit doors were barred with a crossbar. Neither of these turned out to be major but in an actual fire could have slowed the exit sufficient to incur unnecessary casualties. In addition the behavior of the night staff at reception (after we walked all around the outside) was less than inspiring. They were totally uncommunicative as to the cause of the alarm and as to what was being done in evaluate the situation. They had turned it off and simply continued with their work, refusing to answer any questions. A comment to the front desk manager later that morning solicited a weak apology and a shrug. The bedroom walls are thin, for two nights we were awoken by our neighbors coming in at around 4:30 and proceeding to argue violently for almost two hours. I recently stayed at the Ayer Hotel Caspe and my observation is that that hotel is better for someone on business (a much bigger work area, complimentary wired broadband, and WiFi, and a view out of the window while sitting at the desk), also the room safe at Ayer Hotel Caspe will hold a laptop, whereas the Silken Ramblas will not. Given its location, the Silken Ramblas is a better choice for a tourist.

We had requested a smoking room and were orginally booked into the 1st floor which is entirely non smoking. But there was no problem, we asked reception and were immediately given a room on a smoking floor. The rooms were spotless and the people at reception were lovely. We could hear the TV from next door but not enough to disturb sleep. The room we were given overlooked a street at the back of the hotel and was very noisy in the early evening but no disturbance at night. There is a large wall type fountain/waterfall in the bar/lobby which is interesting.

The city hotels were filled for a sporting event and we were walking down La Rambla going from hotel to hotel. We saw some hotels down a side street and ended up at the Ambassador. They had one room left--a two-room suite that they gave us for what I thought was a song. It was a corner room overlooking a picturesque side street and though a busy street, the soundproofing was excellent. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. We had a king-size bed while our daughter had a twin in the next room. There was also free wireless internet service. The buffet breakfast was included in the price and was adequate. We had no other meals there as there are many restuarants two blocks away on La Rambla. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel also had English language newspapers. When checking in the clerk said that the hotel garage cost $20/day. That was in line with what I've paid in big U.S. cities, so it wasn't any shock. The nearby public garage would have been a little more for a 24-hour period. When I checked out, I didn't see a parking charge on the bill. I mentioned it and they said forget it, they weren't going to charge anything. We never tried the rooftop pool, but the views of the city were interesting.

However by luck more than judgement we found that the Ambassador was for us a perfect location. Just off La Ramblas and a short walk away from Place Catalunya, which was ideal for catching the aerobus to and from Barcelona airport. The Hotel was clean, fairly modern and the staff were freindly. We had a room overlooking the small street above the entrance to the hotel, so could be a little noisy, but if you are in the middle of a city I guess that's normal.

We didn't experience any unwanted noise others have mentioned - this may have been because our room overlooked some kind of ventilation shaft, which while it made our room very dark, kept it quiet. It's very well run, good helpful staff, immaculately clean and tidy, and a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside (like Dr Who's Tardis). It took a minute to Las ramblas which is where the main tourist part is. Our only complaint was the swimming pool was out of action, and although on arrival there was a sign saying it was closed for 2 days for cleaning, it was closed all 4 days we were there, and the sign was still up when we left! Other than that, I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel. However, be very very careful around Las Ramblas, particularly late at night. In our short time there we experienced first hand, 3 pick pocketings, (two wallets and a mobile phone). Also late at night it, walking back to the hotel we were approached nearly every 30 seconds by prostitutes and drug dealers, which was not a pleasant experience, and because of the pick pocketings we spent the whole weekend actually made us all feel quite unsafe.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New jersey, USA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4724913", "Content": "My wife and I got a great deal with breakfast included ( Excellent and varied ).
