If you book this hotel you better bring your good sense of humour. Emin Hotel is a family run facility situated in Sirkeci- probably the best area for first timers to Istanbul. The hotel has 4 floors and no elevator (which is quite common)- staff do offer to carry your luggage. Reception area is tiny and mostly crowded by people who really doesnt have a purpose at the hotel- thats just Turkish socializing- but it does not leave much place for the guests. One day the reception was unmanned all day- you had to help yourself to your key- and also a possability for others to do so. One day my key was missing when I came back- some repairs were going on on my floor- or so i was told- when going to 3rd floor there were no one there- but keys were in the hall way- no one looked after them. I suggest you bring a lock on your suitcase and put any valuables in it- you can not be sure that anyone looks after your key. reception guy is so busy \"caring\" for his extra service for the female guests on the net that he does not have a clue of what is going on. Rooms are VERY tiny- you need to be fit to be able to move around and if you suffer from claustrophobia this is not a place for you. There is not much storage room- only a small cuppboard you can reach by crawling over the bed. Bed is quite comfy and I did not have any problems with bedbugs. There is a tv- but reception is so bad that you are not really able to watch it. Aircon did work- you have to crawl on the bed to put it on, unfortunately you will also see the filters which have probably never been cleaned- yikes! The room decor is somewhat 70\u00c2\u00b4ies kitch- which can be quite fun. Carpet is incredible dirty and sticky- bring slippers. Probably not a good idea to look under the bed. Walls are paperthin- bring earplugs. Bathroom is ok in size- plumming bad, waterpressure is somewhat on the weak side- you will some days be able to squeeze some hot water from the pipes. My biggest worry are the electric installations- all hanging out from the wall- one day I had no electricity and they did the repair themselves- resulting in a small firework when trying to switch on the light. Bathroom lamp hanging out from wall- combined with water- i would rate this as hazardous. I did have my towels and linnen changed every second day- which was fine. Wifi worked fine during my stay. The hotel has a restaurant in Turkish style. Breakfast is typical turkish: olives, egg, cucumber, tomatoe, cheese, honey, butter and marmelade. Tea/coffee and white bread- tasty indeed. Waiter was smoking during service and picked his nose and did not wash his hands. Toilets are discusting and water for wiping floors, pitchblack. Allthough looking very charming from outside I did not have a wish to have any more meals at this place. If you are joining in on excursions (pick ups 730-800) you will not be able to get your bkfast as this hotel only starts its service at 8:30- I did try to arrange early service on my days of excursions- reception guy said yes- morning guy said no and continued to sleep on his couch in the reception....You can get a nice bkfastbuffet just opposite at The Flower palace Hotel at a cost of 20TRY. Ohh one thing- even that the hotel has sightseeing brochures available- do NOT expect them to have any knowledge about the treasures of the city- visit a touroperator on the corner who can help you. You can easily walk to most things from the Emin- or use the tram line. Prebook your airport transfers (plenty on offer on the net) and avoid taxis at all costs- if you do so be prepared to pay quite a lot, and never give them a 50TRY note- it will be changed into a 5TRY note a common thing in Turkey. Never be afraid to go to the police if you encounter the crooks- the tourist police station is just next to the Aya Sofya- yellow wooden building. remember to write down the car number. Having been to istanbul many times- and having a quite good sense of humour and positive outlook on life, I would never choose this hotel again", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Emin Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1464893-Reviews-Emin_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$43 - $102*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Saffettin Pasa Sok.
