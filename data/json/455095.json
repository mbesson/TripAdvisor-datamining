The buffet breakfast and lunch are still excellent and great value for money. The staff were just as charming and helpful as before. The rooms were just as clean and comfortable as they were on our last visit. The price had not changed in the last year and for us this is an important detail. However, there are a couple of things that travellers should be aware of. Firstly, the hotel is advertised as having a bar and a nightclub. For various reasons they are no longer available. This was a bit annoying to us as, although we are not big drinkers, we do like a nightcap before going to bed. We feel that the unavailability of these features should be reflected in the advertising. We feel that in this instance the advertising is misleading! Secondly, hot water\u2026 or lack thereof! On our last visit there was a general lack of hot water. It was barely warm enough for a wash and certainly not hot enough for either a decent bath or shower. We reported this at the time and the water temperature did seem to go up a little. On this visit things had not changed! Despite reporting this three times it did not improve. At the third complaint we were told that the water was on a solar panel heating system and that if we wanted hot water we should bathe or shower between 10:00 and 11:00!!! This is just not acceptable. Who, when on a City break holiday, is in the hotel at these times? We were in Dubai to see the sights and wanted a shower/bath in the evening when we came in dirty from a day\u2019s sightseeing around the city!!! At the end of the day, would we go back to this hotel? Certainly! Even with the lack of a bar and decent hot water it is still a good little hotel and still great value for money.

The reception area is basic but functional and the desk staff efficient and polite. My luggage was taken to my room by a very friendly bell-boy who explained all the features of the room to me. The Standard Room I requested was cutting-edge fashion in the mid-80s but is in serious need of a revamp. The bed was comfortable but the bedding should be burned as an act of mercy for future guests. The sheets were stained by what I hope was food and weren't quite big enough for the mattress size. I had them exchanged and was more satisfied with the less-old ones. Similarly the towels were appalling. I have a better towel at home I use to dry my dog with after he's been washed. WiFi Internet is available in the rooms for a charge. It's not very good but will suffice. There is a personal safe available in the staff office behind the reception desk which is too small for a laptop but more than adequate for all other valuables. The safe requires 2 keys to function, one which you hold and the other kept by the hotel. I tested the principle and it is fine. You have 24hr availability for access. Within the hotel there is Johnnies Bar in the foyer which is loosely based on the idea of a British pub/sports bar. It reeks of smoke but is fine for the occasional drink before going elsewhere. There is also an Indian restaurant and a nightclub on the ground floor so I recommend you request a room on the 5th or 6th floor if you want to sleep before 3am. Breakfast is served in the dining room on the mezzenine floor and is ideal for the non-european guests. I'm not a fussy eater but couldn't face Indian food for breakfast so had to settle for a bowl of cornflakes and some toast each day. The dining facility is available 24 hrs a day apparently and I did have lunch there twice and enjoyed both meals. The Seashell is staffed by Indians and caters for an almost all Indian guest list. This is perfectly acceptable and although I am not Indian I was made to feel welcome by all members of staff. For a good, reasonably priced hotel, the Seashell ticks all the boxes.

Date of stay - Christmastime 2010 SUMMARY : The hotel itself is nice enough, the staff are friendly, the location is fantastic if you need to take public transport and want to be near the shops. However, the standard of cleanliness and the maintenance of the bathrooms need to be reviewed ASAP as they let down the rest of the hotel. Other people have mentioned noise from the nightclub, however we did not hear any noise, except for traffic flow. Possibly the nightclub was closed in December?? 1. THE PROS : A - LOCATION : The location is probably the biggest \"pro\" of this hotel. It is close to the market area with shops, restaurants, bus station hub, abras etc. We chose it for this reason as we hadn't planned on hiring a car. Because the major bus hub (Al Ghubaiba) is just a 5 minute walk away from the hotel, a number of bus routes all pass by the hotel. There are also plenty of taxis passing by, and the metro station is a short distance away. The staff were friendly. The check-in process was no different to any other 3 star hotel, but the return of the passports took longer than we would have liked. B - BEDROOMS : Has both Pros as well as Cons - The bedroom was of a good size and was tastefully decorated with sheer curtains for daytime privacy and lovely red and gold curtains for evening and nighttime privacy. There is a mini-bar which is stocked, and the usual desk and sofas. There were only two pillows and no spares in the cupboard as one would expect from a hotel of its class. Nor was there a private safe, which is usual for a 3-star property. We ended up carrying our stuff with us as using a common hotel safe in the reception is hardly private. However, the closet space was large with shelves and hanging area. This is much better than the Accor Group who tend to cater more for the one or two night business traveller and provide little or no shelving. C - Private Parking : The hotel has parking in its basement, so this is very useful when deciding which hotel to book, especially in Dubai where there is literally no where you can park without attracting stiff charges. 2. THE CONS : Unfortunately more than the \"pros\". A. Breakfast. There are two problems with breakfast - a free table and menu choice. If you are Indian you'll be fine. If you are not, well breakfast wll be a big issue. We stayed there for 8 days and had to go down for breakfast several times each morning to try to find a free table. It appears that the hotel is used for airline passengers (Air India??) who have had flight problems and as a consequence the breakfast room seems to always be full of Indian travellers. This lack of seating caused us huge problems as we were alway late getting out and about in the mornings. One morning we were supposed to drive to Ras Al Khaimah but did not reach there until almost 1pm and as a result nothing was open until 4pm. It ended up as a wasted trip for us, not just in time but in petrol. Menu choice : If you're Indian you're okay because the \"hot\" breakfast option is different everyday. However, menu choice if you are not Indian is very poor and boring. It's fine if you are there only for a day or two, but when out of the 8 breakfasts that we had, 6 of them were basically the same with the same chicken franks in chilli sauce, boiled egg and omlettes it becomes boring. There was cheese omlette mentioned a couple of times, but it was hard to taste any chesse in it. Not sure what type of cheese was being used. Another time \"masala omlette\" was mentioned but again, it tasted no different to the normal daily \"plain omlette\". There was french toast maybe 4 times, in addition to the egg and chicken, and this was a welcome addition. One day there was really nice french fries, but they were swiped within 5 minutes of being put onto the hotplates! As part of their Continental offering, there were danish pastry, croissants and muffins. However, the muffins were extremely dry and the pastry of the danish and the croissants were hard and not to proper standard that a European would expect from a croissant. Anyone who has ever eaten a proper croissant in France will know what I am talking about. Good quality croissant and danish are available in Dubai too so I'm not sure where the hotel is buying their product from! Besides the above there is a choice of fruit juices, cereals, fresh fruit, tea and coffee. Not a bad quantity, however the quality is more of the issue with much of it appearing to be just the same as the day before. B. BATHROOMS: The nice bedroom is let down in a big way by the bathroom! What can I say about it?? The state of repair was far worse than the 20+ year old apartment we used to rent just down the road from the Seashell Inn some years ago. The grouting is dirty, ranging from grey to black mouldy bits in some areas. It gave one a feeling of dirtiness to see the mould on the grouting and discolouration on the corners. On the wall near the floor was a long black hair where it had stuck to the wall by whoever had mopped the floor. This black hair was there the day we checked in and still there the day we checked out! This tells me that supervision of the cleaners is poor and cleaning standards are even poorer. The tiling is dated and old fashioned. The wall behind the toilet tank had several different colours and pattern of tiles, pink, grey etc., obviously due to plumbing problems at different times over the years. No attempt at matching the original tiles had ever been made, simply patching it up with whatever was available to hand. This is unacceptable in a 3 star property. I wouldn't even do it in my own home, let alone expect it in an hotel. The entire bathroom needs to be ripped out and re-decorated to a proper standard. C - WATER FOR BATHING : The bathroom has a bathtub, however there is no hot water to fill it. The temperature of the hot water tap was TEPID at best. Some times of the day there is NO hot water, leaving one shivering through the shower. Again this is inexcusable and unacceptable. If the boiler is not large enough to cater for all guests at any time of the day, then they need to address this issue and put in additional boilers. D - TRAVEL DESK : There is a travel desk run by some third party, where you can make bookings for tours etc. This is convenient for tour booking, however when it comes to vehicle hire, they are not running this themselves. We hired a vehicle through them and ended up paying at least 20% more. Nor is it really convenient since the vehicle is NOT available at the hotel, but you have to go to the actual car hire company's offices to do the paperwork and pick up the car. We could have gone directly to the car hire company ourselves and got a much lower rate than we ended up paying. There are loads of car hire companies in Karama, so unless you are in a hurry and do not want to check out what's available I would recommend that you do not use the travel desk.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salalah, Oman", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel & Staff Made Our Holiday A Success\u201d", "Author": "PRO69", "ReviewID": "UR90195504", "Content": "The Seashell Inn was recommended to us by a friend. We went on line and booked through \u201cbooking.com\u201d. The booking on line was easy and when our dates had to be changed they did this for us within a couple of hours and without any fuss. We emailed the hotel to request an airport pickup and drop off and also to ask for a room on a high floor. Reading on TA we had noticed reports that the nightclub was a bit noisy. The hotel came back to us within 8 hours to confirm the pickup (@ 60dhs or $16.30 each way). They also said that an upper floor room would be provided if possible. Whilst travelling around in Taxis later, we were able to work out that 60dhs was a very fair price! On our arrival in Dubai we asked where to get our free entry visa and were told that it was not necessary as we were only staying four nights. The rest of the entry procedure was simple. Our driver, Abdul, was waiting for us with a large printed sign with our name on it and we were quickly installed in a cool, clean mini bus and on our way through the traffic. After about 25 minutes we pulled up at the Seashell Inn to be greeted with smiling faces. The bell hop quickly had our cases inside and reception was waiting for us with more friendly smiling faces. A quick check in and we were shown to our room on the 5th floor. The room was of an average size, well decorated and furnished and spotlessly clean. There was ample wardrobe and draw space. We had an en-suite bathroom with a large, deep bath with shower over. There were toiletries (bath gel, shampoo, soap and shower cap) on a shelf above the hand basin. These were replaced every day as where the towels. The bed sheets were replaced after only 2 nights. On opening the bedroom curtains I noticed that the inside of the large window had a couple of marks, which had been caused by someone leaning their head against the glass. However, a quick call to reception had \u201chousekeeping\u201d cleaning the windows whilst we went for lunch. We had one other minor problem; the water in the bathroom was only barely warm; once again a quick call to reception sorted that out. THE COFFEE SHOP As we had arrived about lunchtime we decided to try the 24 hour coffee shop. There was an Asian buffet and an al a carte menu. The buffet had a salad starter, several Indian dishes meat and vegetarian, a dhal, a couple of rice dishes, bread and a desert. I found out that the dishes were different each day. I tried this buffet and it was excellent. In fact it was so good we ate lunch there a second time two days later... I do love my Indian food! At 35dhs ($9.50) for as much as you can eat, it was very good value for money. Jean opted for the menu and had a large chicken sandwich one day and a Hawaiian salad on the other. She said that both were well made, moist and tasty. Breakfast, which was included in our room price of 250dhs ($68) per night, was also more than adequate. There was cereal, fruit, salad, cold meats and cheeses, sweet pastries and sliced bread (brown & white) to self toast on a rotary toaster. The buffet dishes changed every day and contained such items as porridge, chicken sausages, baked beans, potatoes, boiled eggs and a couple of Indian items such as upma and dosa. On top of this one could order eggs cooked as required. We had scrambled on the first morning and there was more than enough for three people. When we ordered 2 fried and 2 poached eggs the next day we received 4 eggs each. A portion being 2! All were cooked to perfection, soft, just as we had ordered. The hotel its self is in a good location to reach the various tourist sites. There is a Metro station just a short (10dhs) taxi ride or a ten minute walk away. The road the hotel is in has many shops including several computer shops. There are also a few small restaurants. It is also about a ten minute walk to the creek where you can pick up a water taxi (1dh) and cross over to the other side which is very cosmopolitan and where there are a lot of cheaper shops. The hotel has a small \u201csports\u201d bar and a night club. We visited the bar on a couple of evenings and found it pleasant and reasonably priced. We did not visit the night club but heard it up to about the third floor!!! The internet was Wi-Fi at a cost of 10dhs per hour. Collect the code from reception. All in all this was an excellent hotel for the money, made more so by the staff, that were on all occasions, polite, courteous, cheerful and very well trained.

Non-smoking room are not really non-smoking, they just remove the ash tray. They don't even bother with trying to hide the smell. There is bad smell in the whole hotel. Don't try the food there. I think it is one of the worst I've ever tried. The sirloin ordered turned out to be something way different cheaper meat... but the price remained. The rooms are old and worn out. The beds are clean and general cleanliness is ok. The staff is ok, but they don't speak good English. They are not very accommodating when it comes to complaints.

I showed them my copy of the booking confirmation specifically requesting all 3 room on the 3rd floor or above, all no smoking rooms but they insisted no requests were made. I had proof on paper but they still didn't want to know. Not a good start to the holiday. They did say that if any rooms on the 3rd floor or above did become available we would be shifted. During the first night, in one of the rooms on the 1st floor we saw cockroaches and we immediately informed the hotel that this is not acceptable. They fumigated the room and this went on for 4 days. We see cockroaches and they spray. At no time did they shift us despite our pleas that at the very least we expect an insect free room. On the 5th day we were finally moved from the cockroach room to another room on the 3rd floor. But it was too little too late as we only had 2 nights left before we flew back to the UK.

The hotel is located on a main road in the heart of the computer souk. It was on the route of the Dubai Marathon which we had come to view. The main complaint about the hotel is the nightclub and loud music. We were on the third (European) floor and the nightclub was on the ground floor below us. The sound was very loud until 3 am both nights. Service was fine and the staff was friendly. There was an airport shuttle - apparently this is a hotel used by many who are just stopping over between flights. We had rented a car - the parking is in the basement in a tiny parking garage.
