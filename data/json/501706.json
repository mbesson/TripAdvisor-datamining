{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good option for families This hotel is in a sense self-selecting. It appeals to large families/families with young children because of the apartment accommodation. It appeals less to others, and if you're not travelling with kids or in a group who want to stay together, I'm sure you can find a better option. Families, read on...We (family of 5 with 3 young kids) stayed in a 3 bed apt - very clean and spacious, and pleasant to hang out in with a big lounge/dining area. Pool area was lovely - big pool in nice gardens, drinks and food available poolside (though the staff are a bit inattentive). There's a separate kids-focussed pool with waterslide as part of the Camp Splash kids club. NB the club was a disappointment - activities amounted to not much more than watching the kids in the pool and putting on the occasional DVD - we were happy to use the pool but would not have felt comfortable leaving our kids with the staff there. Hotel is not in a great location (1km inland from the beach, on a busy road) but frankly transport is so easy to organise that this wasn't a problem for us. There's an hourly shuttle beach to shops and the beach. And taxis or minivans are always on hand and are very cheap. The hotel have an area with their sunloungers and towels on the beach, near to a good selection of beachfront restaurants, and you can sort out watersports, massages etc from your sunlounger. Our boys loved jetskiing, which we did several times because it was so cheap. The hotel is a little tired looking overall and could do with some refurbishment/restoration. But everything works (for the time being!) Restaurant was a bit mediocre. Buffet breakfasts were OK for kids but not much of an experience for adults wanting a good holiday breakfast. We only ate there once in the evenings because it was pricier and less good quality than the many fine restaurants in Sanur a mere 3 mins/US$3 away by taxi. There's a small shop at the hotel - only for emergencies as they charge at least double the prices in convenience stores/supermarkets - even for a carton of milk. But overall, we were glad we stayed there - the convenience and space of having a big apartment for the price of a normal hotel room more than outweighed the downsides.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR910346439", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "5intokyo"}, {"Content": "Great for families We spent ten days here in a three-bedroom apartment, travelling with our two small children. Overall, I thought it was great. The pools are lovely, and there is plenty to do for small children. The apartment itself was very spacious. The kitchen was poorly kitted out though. We hired a microwave from Bali Baby Hire and bought some other equipment we needed for even basic cooking.The breakfasts are quite good, but nothing to get excited about. The shuttle bus to the main drag - and supermarket - is handy but we ended up getting taxis often because they are so cheap.

Yes it is a little out of the way of Sanur, but with the Shuttle Bus service and transport drivers on hand (thanks Agung) we found no problems getting around. The staff are fabulous and remember us and the kids each year (Pin, Rupa especially). The kids pool and games rooms are great and the staff are friendly and helpful and love playing with the kids.

Well...... what can I say? We (3 children + 2 adults) stayed in a 3 bedroom apt. for 7 nights. Check-in was smooth, everything was fine. The apartment itself (no.2123) was in dire need of a coat of paint. It looked more tired than me...... but in saying that, also not a bad thing with 3 children. At least we could relax without worrying about them making a mess.Beds were comfortable; bathrooms fine; no traffic noise; good blockout curtains for sleeping in (if you like); EXCELLENT waterslide which served the children (aged 6, 7  13) well. Room service was efficient. We ordered for the children sometimes but preferred to eat out ourselves. Prices were definitely more expensive than eating out BUT it is convenient and still good value.Camp Splash staff were friendly and good with the children. If you're after a 'romantic location' then this probably isn't it . Would I stay there again?? Yes I probably would if I had the children with me. We chose to stay here because we liked the idea of an apartment rather than adjoining rooms and it did work well for us as a family.

We stayed in a 3BR unit that was bigger than our house!!! All BRs were double sized, with two bath rooms. Massive living/Dining area and even had a bar (Not stocked though) Only minimal cooking facilities, but that doesn't matter, because the nearby restaurants are so cheap, you couldn't be bothered buying and cooking. We just got b'fast cereals (so we could sleep in) and ate out the rest. With four kids and drinks, our average meal was AUD$20. Some restaurants will pickup and drop off for free. Sanur is a lot more quieter than Kuta, but offers all the same shopping outlets for similar prices. Is a lot easier to get to Denpasar for shopping and a good base to see all the attractions in Bali (ie Ubud, Monkey Forest, Celuk, Kintamani etc) With kids the first place to visit should be the Marine Safari Park at Taman. Very good value and combines just about all parks into one. Take your swimmers, as there is a water park, suitable to 10yr olds. The SUITES appear to be a former Radisson, with a good kids club 9am-12pm and 1pm-6pm. The kids area has a 30m waterslide, climbing equipment swings, and a b/ball court, soccer field type area. Our kids loved and are itching to get back there. The rooms are in need of a lift, but this would only up the price unnecessarily. There are very clean and well maintained. Great Value.

The lounge and the chairs on the balcony were quite uncomfortable to sit on.There are 2 tv's and the 2 bathrooms are very small. No dvd player but can be hired for 100,000 rupee per night which is quite expensive.The pool area is ok, quite big and plenty of sunbeds and there is a massage area nearby which is quite expensive.We found the hotel food very ordinary and expensive with a limited menu, everything for kids is deep fried, so we ate out down at Sanur beach which was fantastic, very nice italian restaurant and others right on the beach.The hotel provides and hourly shuttle to the beach but generally you need a taxi back to the suites. The suites have a designated area on beach with sunbeds and towels etc which is quite good.If you need to go to Kuta it will cost you between 50 and 70,000 in a taxi or bemo.The suites don't have a security box in the rooms, but have secure boxes at reception where they have to their key and your key to open it. Can be a bit painful getting your cash out etc.The rooms are serviced each day and they a big bottle of drinking water on a hot/cold unit but you only get one bottle per week, ie costs more if you run out only 20,000 though.There is nothing in walking distance from the suites which is a drawback as everything is a taxi ride.Mcdonalds is not far if that takes your fancy and they deliver 24/7.Sanur beach area is very nice and pleasant with shops, markets and some nice hotels.The staff at the suites are nice and try hard, the kids club has a waterslide and lots of other things to do, but I think the staff at the kids club would rather just watch the kids in the pool rather than amuse them with all the other equipment they have.Overall the Plaza suites is to isolated and very average compared to other places we have stayed at. The food tends to taste like roadhouse food and expensive. The taxi fares tend to add up after a while making the overall stay at the suites expensive.Sanur itself is quite nice but unfortunately the suites has very little going for it and wouldn't stay there again. To cap it off every other hotel we have stayed at gives you a complimentary trip back to the airport, but not the suites 80,000 rupee.For the money it costs to stay at the suites it could be better spent on a another hotel. The suites are similar to the Dynasty if you have stayed there. Overall had a good time in Bali but the plaza suites are quite average.Note. From the 13th October is the end of Ramadan and Bali especially Kuta has litterly thousands of Javanese from Jakarta visiting making it quite difficult with the traffic and masses of people.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR746023877", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "WestAustralian"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Fantastic hotel for a family, Clean, friendly and plenty to do for the kids with a great kids club and fantastic staff.
