I would recommend it if you just need a place to stay that's close to Sea-Tac Airport. It was only about a five-minute drive to the airport (even with a little traffic). The room was fairly clean, but the building did have a strange smell that seemed to permeate everything. SECURITY: There were definately a few shady characters hanging around that seemed to be long-term residents. However, they do take precautions to make sure that no one too shady hangs around. They require photo identification for ALL parties staying overnight and require information about the vehicle you are driving. In addition, there did appear to be a security guard on the premises at night (or a least a security guard's car). LOCATION: In addition to being close to the airport, there are a few restaurants within a 10-minute walk. It's close to I-5, but pay attention to the directions given. The motel is visible as soon as you exit the interstate at 188th Street, but you have to make a u-turn to get there (and traffic was heavy when I arrived).

The far back facing away from traffic on S.188th street and I-5 probably has quieter rooms. A pleasant, cooperative receptionist, at our request, assigned to us a room on the upper floor. We stayed one weekday night while on our way south, and it worked out successfully. The double-glazed windows effectively blocked noise from the parking area outside. The motel did not seem completely full, so we cannot say what to expect if all rooms were occupied. It would depend on the behavior of other guests. The gap at the bottom of the door can admit noise from the corridor. The location, very convenient to exit 152 leading to and from I-5, appears popular and to attract a variety of customers. For an extended stay, you might want to consider elsewhere.

The \"wing\" faicing the interstate gets the noise from the road, but if you turn on the airconditioning, you do not hear the road noise, only the ac.
