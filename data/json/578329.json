We love it because all the units are sold and there is no timeshare torcher sales rep you need to talk to. Our unit is on the 4th floor and we have a beautifull screened porch that we really enjoy. You can see the Branson Bell from there. It is really fun to see the deer and racoon in the evenings. They have an outside Tikki Bar that has hamick chairs to sit in and enjoy a cold drink and live bands on Friday and Sat. night. There are swings along the lake side to sit in and watch the sunset. There is a nice resteraunt, but they have become pricy for what they serve. Good food though. Our condo has always been clean and ready when we get there. The staff have always been friendly and helpfull. There is nothing fancy here, just mostly peace and quiet, except friday and Sat night (live band at the Tikki Bar). We are 2 miles from Silverdollar City. It takes maybe 10 min. to get into Branson, but what a beautifull drive!!!! The playground is updated and there is a tennis court. If you bring your boat there is a marina and nightly dock rental. If you don't have a boat they can rent you one for a few hours at a time to enjoy the lake. We love this property because there is no sales rep to bother you. It is very peacefull here. You are RIGHT ON THE Water. There is not an activity program, but who needs one with the lake at your door and Silverdollar City 2 miles down the road. Each year when we go in June they are making repairs to the condo units. It is an older facility. It is a silver crown so don't expect really fancy like gold crown ratings. This place is clean, peacefull, and simple. In the past we have never had a problem with the internet service. There is not charge for it. This year they where having trouble. We asked the front desk and they checked into it right then and there. Unfortunately with wifi there was too many non-guests using it and they were having trouble keeping up with all the extra non-guest users. Boo. Oh well, we where here to get away from all that technogy for the week anyway. We found a new resteraunt at Indian point 2 miles South. It is a floating resteraunt and very nice. The only down side to this condo is that we cannot bring our little dog, and I miss her while we are here. Hope this helps someone else plan a trip to Branson.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cFrustrated\u201d", "Author": "NDBlone", "ReviewID": "UR136139688", "Content": "Where to begin! We have been owners at BYC since 1999 (out first timeshare) and were eager to buy with promises of upgrades such as indoor pools, workout rooms and individual condos down by the water. Hasn't happened! We have often used our ownership as exchanges to other resorts but the past couple of years have been coming here because we have moved closer. Last fall on our stay, we made many observations such as unkempt grounds, threadbare linens (literally see-through), paint chipped off of chairs. We even found a broken vacuum cleaner, empty beer bottles and other garbage strewn behind the security building. As owners, we were invited to meet with a rep from BYC who asked our opinion of the area. So, we told him of our observations and showed pix we had taken. He apologized and gave us \"better\" towels, but also said that if he were to tell the majority owner, he would only get angry. Upon returning to our home, we wrote up our findings with documentation and sent it to the owner. We also explained our position of finding it offensive that the owner has 2 \"reserved\" parking spaces for himself and proudly displays his high price vehicles with personal license plates. We questioned how the \"additional maintenance fee\" all owners paid the previous year to cover defaulted fees, was used. We then made several positive suggestions we felt would encourage more people to buy here and stop \"defaulting\" on their fees. One suggestion is that owners/guests use boats at a much GREATER discount than the measly 10% offered now. BTW the majority owner here owns the marina too...hmmmm. Also, supply owners with itemized account of monies spent for updates. Our received reply: He can do whatever he wants and drive and park whatever car he wants to. Missed our point:( So, here we are again but this time used only a 4 day split which put us in a lock-out unit. Equals an average size hotel room, one bed, small fridg, microwave, small sink. Nice size bathroom. Good enough for sleeping as we were away from the resort all day. If you're just passing through, its a comfortable place to stay...and yes, the view from larger condo's CAN'T be beat:) Agree that those who assist and work here are top notch and work hard to please. Too bad majority owner doesn't. Dislike paying exchange fees, but will do so until upgrades are made or we can sell.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cSome Good, Some Bad\u201d", "Author": "Silkey51", "ReviewID": "UR134942199", "Content": "We stayed at the Yacht Club this week. The room was large and clean. The overall resort was a little dated but not bad. There were no activities for children that we have experienced at most other RCI resorts but there were also no annoying sales pitches to listen to. It had a beautiful lake view. My only real complaint was how far it was from the Branson activities. I can understand not wanting to stay on the strip but this resort was a 30 - 45 minute drive just to get to the shows. It is very close to Silver Dollar City. I think if you were a boater it might be just what you need. Check in / out was quick and smooth. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

The pools were in fantastic condition, and everything about the resort was clean and well maintained.

The stove top is 2 square feet and is so close to the couch, you'd have to be 75 lbs. or less to use it. The dishwasher (the size they must use on very small boats or trailers) door won't open because the sofa arm is too close, so tiny as it is, you can't even use all of it, just the part at the front which you can reach. The bed room does contain a bed (queen) but not much else. There's a light from the parking lot that shines in the bedroom so strongly that we had to buy a roll of packaging paper and tape and cover the window to get it dark enough to sleep.The walls are extremely thin- We could hear every work, almost ever breath, from the people next door.There is a georgous view of the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the condo.

We had a wonderful experience here the entire time. Our check in was very quick and the staff was very friendly. When we asked if there was a room available with a good view of Table Rock Lake, Dan who checked us in said room 643 will be yours. It was a 2 bedroom deluxe room with full kitchen, 2 baths, large sitting room and a dining area and located on the 3rd floor. The balcony gave a commanding view of the lake. The room decor was tastefully done and you could tell a pro decorator did the job. Thanks Dan you made our stay great. The location of the resort is on a point of land right on the lake. Nice and quiet with no traffic. There is a marina for boating enthusiasts. There are two swimming pools. It is only a 15 minute drive into the town where all the shows and other entertainment is located. Then you leave the noise and return to your nice hideaway on Indian Point. Charlies Restaurant is located at the resort and the steaks we had were excellent. Nice and juicy, tender cuts of beef and seasoned perfectly for great taste. Mixed drinks were made very well and our hosteses were all very friendly and added to the fun of our dining experience. The grounds are kept very nice, the swimming pools were in great shape and very clean. Thanks to Scott and Elmo and their maintainance crew they made sure that little problems were no problem. Elmo even checked my tires on the rental car because my indicator light was on. He checked all the tires right in front of the condo and told me if they went low he had a air tank to help me out. One day my wife and I were in the pool all by ourselves and Scott turned on the music for us. It was nice gestures like these that made our stay a wonderful time.

Charlie's Steak, Ribs & Ale was also wonderful. The lunch specials was particularly great. And they had great dinner specials everyday too. My friend said the drinks at the Tiki bar and also the bar in the restaurant were very good. His statement was \"They know how to pour a drink. We visited Silver Dollar City twice and also took an 8:pm dinner cruise on the Branson Belle. We also did a lot of shopping and site seeing. All in all we had a wonderful time.

Our unit was nice...It was a 1 bedroom + a lockout unit so we had plenty of room. You can tell that the unit was older but it was nicely appointed with the Yacht Club theme. It had a private back porch facing the lake which we would have loved to used but it was too hot. If you are looking for an upscale unit this is not for you. If you want to be near the Branson attractions this is not for you. This place is located on Indian Point west of Branson. If you want to be near Table Rock Lake you would enjoy this place. There were a few plumbing problems and the carpet needed replacing. The air conditioning unit was also struggling because of the extreme heat. It is wonderfully located near Silver Dollar City and it was nice to be away from the traffic and hubbub of Branson. There is also a restaurant on the site and the food and prices were very reasonable. We stayed on a weekend and apparently there was a \"party\" scheduled during that time. The Escape Units at the yacht club are located near the party area so it did get somewhat noisy in the evenings but not enough to disturb our sleep. Would we go back?
