The hotel was convenient to the metro and because the park was across the street, we would leave our window open at night for the breeze and had no loud noises that disturbed our sleep.

They were aware of the problem before we arrived and arranged for us a one night stay at the Hotel Victoria. The staff at the Hotel Victoria were very friendly and understanding of the inconvenience that had been caused to us, they got us swiftly checked in and were helpful in pointing out to us where the hotel was located. The location of Hotel Victoria was good, in walking distance of the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon etc. The hotel itself is clean and the decor in the rooms is let\u2019s say interesting; it seemed whoever designed the rooms wanted to include every pattern and pastel colour going! But no one is going to Rome to stay in the hotel room are they! The room was clean, spacious with a very big bathroom. The shower in the bathroom wasn\u2019t great, it didn\u2019t run very fast at all and for you ladies with long hair that need a hairdryer I would advise you take your own, the hairdryer in the bathroom was useless! The breakfast at the hotel was good, there was scrambled egg, small sausages and bacon plenty of fresh fruit, breads, pastries, fresh juices, cereal, jams etc. Taking into consideration the location of the hotel, the breakfast, the rooms, and the staff I would give Hotel Victoria 3 stars, I think it\u2019s pushing it for 4 stars. With a lick of paint and redecoration it wouldn\u2019t be far off though I guess. Word of warning if you stay at the Hotel Victoria \u2013 nothing to do with the hotel but we ate at a place nearby on the main road called Cafe Veneto. (It\u2019s a restaurant next to a restaurant called Harry\u2019s Bar) Don\u2019t waste your money eating here. I have written a lengthy review on trip advisor about this restaurant but in a nutshell, it was poor service, overpriced, ok food - an arrogant money grabbing restaurant!

The front desk staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, especially Nicola and Massimo. We were telling them about a problem we had getting in touch with a company there and before we finished the sentence, they picked up the phone and were calling them for us! We didn't even ask them to do that but they sincerely wanted to be helpful. Breakfast was good: sliced meat, eggs, many bread choices, yogurt, cereals, fresh fruits and juices. Our room was large and comfortable and sparkling clean. It was very cold weather when we were there but our room was warm and comfortable. I asked for an extra pillow and they wanted to know what kind of pillow I prefer, soft or hard! I couldn't believe they cared enough to ask that question. Nearby is Lotti's, a little place that has gelato, panini, bottled drinks, wine, a bakery, and cooked authentic Italian dishes, either to eat there or take away. Great for a quick meal after a long day of touring. There is an underground walkway right near the hotel, and it was very convenient (and dry) to walk toward the Spanish Steps, especially since it snowed when we were there. This is one of the hotels that GreenLine Tour Company designates as a pick-up hotel, so if you book tours, GreenLine tours will pick you up right in the lobby of the hotel, and you won't have to walk anywhere to find them.

The staff at the service desk were great--always friendly and polite, and very helpful in answering all my questions, booking taxis and tours, making change for large bills, etc. The lobby is tastefully decorated and quite sumptuously furnished. Rooms were very comfortable and well-appointed, with a large bathroom, comfy bed, cable TV in several languages, and internet access. A room safe and minibar are also included. Breakfast was very good, with a tasty assortment of croissants and breads, fruits, yogurt, and hot items such as bacon and eggs. The location was excellent (right off the Via Veneto and directly across from the Villa Borghese), a 10-minute walk from the Metro station (Linea A, with direct connections to the Vatican Museums/St. Paul's and Termini station for only 1 euro--I took the metro and it was perfectly safe). Right around the corner from the hotel is a nice restaurant called \"Il Pomodorino\" that serves a variety of traditional Italian dishes for a reasonable price. To get to the colosseum, just take the metro to Termini and transfer for the Linea B to \"Colosseo\" (only 1 euro, much cheaper than a taxi!). Be careful of taxis in Rome, even the \"official\" ones sometimes have shady drivers who will gyp you big-time--when I first arrived, the taxi from Termini to the hotel took the \"long way\" and charged me 18 euros, and then the driver literally stole from me (when I gave him a 50-euro note, he sneakily switched it for a 10 and said it wasn't enough for the fare, then loudly argued with me until I figured it was safer to just give him the other 8 and just walk away). On the way back, I had the hotel concierge book me a taxi to Termini, and the same trip cost only 9 euros and was only about 10 blocks.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marietta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "rwilson1961", "ReviewID": "UR120285625", "Content": "Our group stayed at this hotel in October 2011.

The service at breakfast left a little to be desired but I would put some of this down to something being lost in translation. The \u201cfront of house\u201d staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge was extremely knowledgeable about the tourist attractions of Rome and was more than happy to give advice as to the best way of reaching them. Similarly the hall porter was one of the most helpful and friendly people we have ever come across working in a hotel, nothing was too much trouble for him. Having spent a week there it is unlikely that we will be going back to Rome anytime soon, but I would have no hesitation recommending the Hotel Victoria to anyone.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Karmiel, Israel", "Title": "\u201cAn outstanding hotel in the heart of Rome\u201d", "Author": "rose1055118", "ReviewID": "UR115706514", "Content": "We stayed at the Victoria Hotel for a week .The room we got was big outstandingly clean-when we got it and on the rest of the week as well.

We used Rome as a base camp, travelling to Florence, Assisi, Naples, and Pompeii, a travel agency is just across the street organized our train tickets and plans. Rick Steve's Europe Through the Back Door was very helpful. We only ventured to Termini to catch our train. We only encountered one dishonest taxi driver, most charged around 7 euros to take you to major sites. We tried to do most of the sites following the Rick Steves' guide; the only tour my husband booked for us was to Naples and Pompeii, we were grateful for that, we met a gentleman on the train to Florence, he was Naples native, who sort of recommended we not venture out there by ourselves; I told him we had a tour and said \"good\". The only other negative thing to report happened in Florence; I needed to get some laundry done, went to a Wash & Dry a street down from the Duomo; the facility was clean and good. Everything was going well, my two loads of clothing were washed and I placed them in two separate dryers, I was the only person in the facility, it started to get a little hot, so I stood right outside the door, watching my clothes and taking the breeze from outside; then a Italian man from a Pub, two doors down, walked in, I remained outside, looking in, I thought he was going to get change, and while I turned away for a second, took my son's t-shirt and sox from the dryer. It happened sooo quick I was completely fooled. I realized he had taken the piece of clothing when I was folding my clothes. He looked like a perfect gentleman.

It has a King bed and 2 pulled out twin beds from a sofa. The bathroom is enormous with 2 washbasins and a tub/shower. We were warned by friends to be prepared for very small hotel rooms in Europe.

There are four or five people who rotate at the front desk and they are all very friendly and helpful. They are fluent in English as well as several other languages. Being a mid sized hotel, there is no concierge, per se. The front desk people provide that function and do it exceedingly well. We ate in the hotel restaurant our last night and the food was excellent. It\u2019s a little pricey, but still not as much as the restaurants on Via Veneto. Most nights we ate in little neighborhood restaurant on the next street called La Bruschetta and the food was outstanding as well as reasonably priced. There is one caveat with this hotel. The rooms along the back are on a street with a club that seems to stay open very late. People were out on the street until 2 or 3 am and they were very loud. Apparently, this is not unusual in Rome. On our first few nights we had trouble sleeping due to the noise. In the winter this may not be a problem, because you can shut the windows. It in the summer it may also be alright when the air conditioning is running. But, we were there at the end of April and they hadn\u2019t started running the air conditioning yet, so we wanted to leave the windows open. The hotel management was very understanding and moved us to a front room on the fifth floor. It was a great room with a view of Borghese Park. There is a major highway that runs near the front of the hotel, so there is some traffic noise, but that didn\u2019t keep us up at all. The Hotel Victoria is a terrific hotel and a wonderful oasis, if that is what you want. The toughest part of picking a hotel in Rome is knowing what part of the city you want to sleep in. If you are not familiar with Rome, you need to know that it is crowded, fast, and chaotic. Traffic moves at an incredible pace, stoplights and pedestrian are essentially ignored, and the sidewalks, such as they are, are crowded with tourist and natives. If you don\u2019t\u2019 mind the crowds and commotion and want to be where the \u201caction\u201d is, then you probably want to stay around the Piazza Navona or some other high activity area. But if you want to get away from it all at the end of the day and have a pleasant, friendly home away from home, then by all means stay at the Hotel Victoria.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cFive Star Experience at Three Star Prices!\u201d", "Author": "SilverSideUp", "ReviewID": "UR29172759", "Content": "My family and I first travelled to Milan and came to Rome via air.

The regular prices are about E300 for a room but we got the room at a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" rate of E170! The sweet woman at the counter reccomended it to us. It is a four star hotel housed in a beautiful building in one of the posh areas of Rome so all the shops, restaurants, etc. around are a little overpriced but the area is beautiful, very safe and overlooks the Gate of Rome which we could see just outside our room window. It is walking distance from many of the tourist sights, the main road (one of the most important in Rome) Via Veneto and very close to Spagna and Barberini Paizzas and Metro Stations. It is also surrounded by lovely shops, cafes and restuarants. When in Rome try your best to use public transport or whenever possible WALK because you see something beautiful on every steet corner and always carry a map! The weather was great when we went there so you don't get tired walking. Plus it's healthy for you! The staff at the hotel were very warm like most Italians are! They were very helpful and told us some nice local places to visit and also helped us learn a few Italian words for easier communication with the locals. Most locals DON'T speak English well so it becomes a bit of a problem but they're wonderful people so you figure things out eventually! The breakfast was quite good and if you request something special a day or two in advance, they will readily get it for you. if you ask nicely enough they could pack a wholesome breakfast incase you have an early morning tour. There was an old, grumpy maitre'd in the restaurant but we didn't mind him since he was an old-timer and was always adorably grumpy with everyone!

I had NOTHING to worry about. We had a wonderful stay. The location was excellent. We were less than one minute's walk from Via Veneto (a street filled with shops, restaurants, etc.) and about a five minute's walk from the train station. We took the train almost everywhere. From the airport, I'd recommend taking a shuttle or the Leonardo Express then a taxi (it's a little hard to navigate from the nearest train station with luggage). The Leo Express is about 15 Euro, and a taxi should be about 6 Euro. Don't let the unlicensed taxis get to you! The hotel is very nice. Courteous staff -helpful, considerate and speak English very well. Internet access was provided via keyboard in the room hooked up to a TV (7 Euros for 24 hours), or you could use the computer downstairs for 5 Euros. Didn't check out the restaurant since there were way too many to choose from in the area. The train will take you wherever you want to go if you don't want to walk. We felt this was a perfect location - we felt very safe, yet still in the middle of the action on Via Veneto. Rooms are small (expect this anywhere in Europe), but we didn't feel they were uncomfortable. Bring washcloths. They don't provide them. Again, great service. I'm used to staying in \"nice\" hotels (i.e. 5 star), and although it didn't provide the ammenities a 5 star hotel does (spa, etc.) I didn't have any complaints. After all, we were there to see Rome - not the inside of the hotel. If I return to Rome, I'd definitely stay here again. I'd recommend it to anyone. There is a bar (i think others have mentioned this) literally around the corner with some of the best espresso (cafe) we had anywhere in Rome. It just says \"bar\".

For daytime snack, walk to Via Ventre, turn left, walk across the road and walk a little way and there is an excellent bakery, sells bread, pastries and sandwiches etc. Tips: To get around,use the metro. Walk to end of road, steps down into a sort of underground tunnel, which you can walk to the metro or carry on walking and it come out at the Spanish Steps. Metro cost 1 euro for single journey or 4 euros for day pass. Spanish Steps, Travi fountain and Pantheon are all free and should be done together. Colesium - Take the metro - too far to walk. If taking children, take their passports with you, because if they are under 18 from EU and you have ID they get in free. Adult cost 9 euro. Do this with the Fora Romana (both in admission cost) and this should take all or most of a day. Drinks around the Colesium very expensive = 32 euro for 1 beer, 1 coffee and 2 cokes. so maybe take your own. Vatican - take a tour - this may seem expensive (around 25 euro each adult and 15 for child) but worth it. Without it you miss so much - with it you learn things you cannot find in any books. Admission is 14 euro for adult and 8 euro for child(on top of tour cost). the Basilica is free entry, but if you want to go in the tomb of St Peter and climb the tower you have to pay 6 euro. Coffee shop in Vatican sells drinks and snack and they were the cheapest we paid for in Rome!!! Drinks in Rome are quite expensive - 6 to 8 euro for 1/2 litre of beer, 5 to 6 euro for soft drink ie coke, coffee 5 to 6 euro, bottle of house wine around 25 euro, water 4 euro.

In the 3 days that we stayed in Rome we managed to visit all of the desired attractions, including the Spanish steps, The Pantheon, Trevi fountain, Colliseum and the Vatican we visited on the Monday. The Vatican is the one place we had to queue to get into , there were many tour guides approaching us to say that we could skip the queue and the 2hour wait for an extra 30 euros each , however we refused them and decided to wait in line, the queue was constantly moving and it took approx 45 mins to wait so it wasnt as bad as they tell you. The Vatican is a must to see , it takes several hours to walk around it all as there is just so much to see. We actually took the Subway to get to the Vatican and this was a good way to get around, you can buy a day pass which allowed us to jump on and off the subway and get to many places in minutes.

The Galleria Borghese is very close to the hotel is definitely worth seeing, some of the best paintings and sculptures in the world. Via Veneto is one street over and is a beautifully tree lined street with many shops and restaurants. For the major tourist sites, take the underground tunnel, towards the Spanish steps metro, which seemed to be busy at all hours, it comes out right next to the Spanish steps, from there you can walk to the Trevi fountain, Piazza Navona, etc. The hotel itself is very clean and came with a breakfast buffet. We booked on expedia.ca and paid only $160 a night, which is a bargain for Rome. Since we were travelling with a two year old, we preferred to eat at Trattoria's, but also found Fraterna Domus, which is a type of B&B which also serves lunch and supper, you must book ahead though as it is a very popular place with tourists and locals.

Room was very comfortable and quiet spacious, bathroom well supplied with toiletries - cleaned every day and the bed turned down at night. No tea/coffee making facilities in the room in case anyone assumes there is. Hairdryer ladies or gents is supplied. The staff were friendly and helpful at ALL TIMES. American buffet breakfast was great and loads to choose from, set you up for a day of walking around Rome. Every attraction in Rome (and there are many) are within walking distance, the metro line is a couple of minutes from the hotel. I recommend you bring comfortable walking shoes and that you do walk. You really see and feel so much more of the city. The Vatican is within 45 minutes walk and I recommend that you take the guided tour, it is about \u20ac25 per person plus the cost of the entrance fee, it is well worth it to get the full history behind this fantastic piece of history. Another guided tour is the one of the Colosseum and the Forum is about \u20ac10 per person again plus the entrance fee. Eating out is not expensive and try the eateries where the locals eat always a good bet. Our personal favourite was IL Pomodorio is was the best friendly & helpful staff, great atmosphere and food to die for. The house red wine is very special and leave room for dessert !!!! This restaurant is a 2 minute walk from the front door of the hotel, another one that is good is La Bruschetta around the corner from the hotel very small and cosy. Be aware of the American Bar on a side street off the Via Vento (main road near hotel) it is down stairs in a basement, you are invited in off the street as you pass by a very well dressed gentleman, we ordered a large beer and small beer, got a very uncomfortable feeling about the place and felt as though we were intruding, it was the only time we felt like this in Rome. We finished our drinks and left after being ripped off to the tune of \u20ac24 - don't get caught out there. There are plenty of other good bars and cafe bars around which are much more enjoyable and welcoming. Most of all enjoy and have fun in this beautiful city.

The bathroom was very big although the water in the shower was very tempermental and very difficult to set, it was either too hot or too cold and the shower head was not powerful. The bathroom was in need of some grouting and perhaps replacing the shower would have been better. They did think of things like toiletries, hairdryer, the even had a huge maginified mirror only it was stuck in the corner low down by a shelf in the bathroom that you had to stretch over the sink to look into the mirror - lousy positioning.

I chose the Hotel Victoria for a number of reasons: I needed a good location, I wanted a hotel with a large \"family\" room so my wife and two boys (ages 8 and 12) could stay in one room, and I wanted someplace that was clean. I relied heavily on the reviews posted in Trip Advisor when it came to choosing the Victoria. Because we booked early through an internet service, we received a good rate. First, we found the location to be perfect for us -- close enough to walk to the major sights, but secluded enough to offer some peace and quiet. The hotel was ideally situated next to the Villa Borghese, and the neighborhood was very quiet. It was a welcome sanctuary after a hectic day taking in the sights of Rome. A great coincidence was that the location for our rental car pickup, Avis, was pretty much right next to the hotel; it was easy to drive from there to the main highway north to Tuscany, which was our next stop. The hotel is right off Via Veneto, and a very easy walk to the Trevi fountain, the Pantheon, Piazza Navono and the Spanish Steps. The Colisseum, Palantine Hill and the Forum are about a 30 minute walk away, which we walked as well. My 8-year-old really loved walking everywhere, especially with the many stops for gelato; to us, seeing Rome while walking was one of the most enjoyable aspects of our trip. We did take a taxi to St. Peter's, which is a quick ride away. The hotel itself was low-key and charming. The front desk was very helpful in making dinner reservations and suggestions for us, and the bartender was very friendly. The perfect end to our day was getting drinks at the bar and taking them up to the lovely rooftop terrace. We only had breakfast at the Victoria once, but found it to be fine -- a basic buffet-style breakfast with a reasonable selection. Our room and bathroom were large and immaculately clean. People used to \"American\" style hotels may have an issue with how to take a shower without a proper shower curtain; the key is to sit down in the tub, and don't worry about getting water on the floor -- that's what the drain is for. Overall, we found the Victoria to be the perfect hotel for our situation -- if you're looking to be more in the middle of where the big sights are or are looking for a larger, more upscale hotel, it may not be your cup of tea. However, we will highly recommend the Victoria to family and friends traveling to Rome.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Victoria\u201d", "Author": "glc74", "ReviewID": "UR7295152", "Content": "We loved our stay in the Hotel Victoria!

Stuffy nighttime concierge. Very helpful and friendly bellhop named Clemente. Breakfast is good with a decent buffet selection. The wait staff bring you all the cappuccino\u2019s and coffee you want. Great to load up because they\u2019re free and quite good. Hotel elevator is very small but not a problem because the bellhop brings your luggage to your room. Our room was small but we expected that from other reviews. We had no problems with space. Keep your luggage upright against the wall, in the closet or under the desk and it will not be in your way. We had 5 bags and made do just fine. The room was clean with lots of character. Separate shower room was nice. The place was only a little noisy when we came back to our room for siesta at 6pm. Bed was hard but we slept fine. Our room was non-smoking, although it appeared our floor was not (or people didn\u2019t follow the rules). A few times we smelled cigarette smoke in the hallway and it came into the room a bit. The clientele seemed to be mainly business persons there for a day or so, this may change during high-season as we were there in Nov./Dec. We used the dry cleaning service, which was easy and excellent. All in all we\u2019d stay here again. It\u2019s not the Four Seasons/Westin but the location is fantastic, a couple blocks from the Westin and right across from Harry\u2019s Bar. A very expensive, seemingly safe area. Best of all you\u2019re right across the street from Villa Bourghese Park, which has some of the most amazing views of Rome. A great place to take it all in. There is no wifi available in the room, they do have a computer downstairs that they will allow you to use (5 euros for 30 minutes). There is WiFi available across the street at the park, but you need an \"Orange Account\" to access it. I suggest buying the account before you travel, it's basically like a prepaid phone card for WiFi. The Orange Wifi Account can be used all over Europe which is nice. TAXI TIP: When taking a taxi to/from the airports there is new law that says Taxi\u2019s can only charge a flat fee of 30 or 40 Euros (for all hotels within the Aleutian walls) depending on the airport. The Victoria Hotel IS within the walls. The taxi drivers do not like this law and may try to ignore it, beware. There is literature in the airport on this new law. We found this out the hard way AFTER paying 70 euros for the Taxi to the hotel, live and learn right? The drivers inside of the airport are private drivers who will try to take you in their private cars\u2026needless to say this isn\u2019t a good idea because they aren\u2019t governed by anyone.
