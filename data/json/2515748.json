This campground think that if you have changed your mind, you deserve to be punished and must pay the whole price because you are \"not responsible\". The campground is decided to \"educate\" you. So if you're traveling and want to be flexible, do yourself a favor, and do not commit to anything. And do not worry, the cempground is half empty, and there is another Campground beside with the beach and lake views. In addition, the manager is not present and you can not call her, so there is no one to talk. and the staff does not have the authority to make a decision. We had to leave one day earlier and it cost us $ 45. What would happened if we had to leave 2 days earlier? I understand when you take $ 10 for early departure/cancellation, but I do not forgive about $ 45 and I found it to be an exaggeration.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot helpfull at all.\u201d", "Author": "Rockdog2011", "ReviewID": "UR123463778", "Content": "We stayed in space #138.

We normally stay at Campland which is across the bay, but the spots we like were full and the ones available were outragously priced. I had checked out this campgrounds reviews and decided to try it and was pleasently surprised!! First off this Resort does not allow tent camping which is a huge plus...We got a Bay View site which is a little more pricy but well worth it. The resort is a lot smaller than Campland but is very clean and staff is very friendly. It has a Snack Shack ,does movies for the kids at night and has access to the bay and water activities.There is no store or pool on site which is a bummer but we survived,lol. The people that we met there were great many had been coming for 10 plus years which says a lot about the resort! This resort is a lot quieter than campland which is nice, we could hear them across the bay.But it is not stuffy we are a young family of 5 with 3 kids all over the age of 9 and had no problems at all! The kids rode bikes, fished, kayaked and got to watch Seaworld's firework show every nite, as we had the perfect view. When quiet time rolled around no one was rudly being told to shut everything down like some campgrounds do which was nice and no one was being disrespectfuly loud either which was great!! Overall we had a great experience and will definitly be back soon!", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cWarning: Dirty, depressing, boring, overpriced, rude staff, awful place\u201d", "Author": "bill9989", "ReviewID": "UR115211262", "Content": "If you desire a nice vacation, DON\"T GO HERE !!!!!!

On the good side, it is a great place if you have children. The property is (mostly) fenced in and children of all ages ride around on bikes, skateboards, scooters and anything else they can find. The mgmt. shows movies on Saturday nights. The beach area is waveless and safe. It is a much quieter place than Campland on the Bay which is close by and can be heard across the water at night. The negatives are that the property is basically a giant asphalt parking lot with very little distance between spaces and no privacy. Because the area is safe, many parents let their kids run wild and more than once I've had to tell children that my campsite is not their play area. The mgmt. advertises internet access. It is poor at best. Each year they claim it's new and improved and each year it is crappy. They also claim to have cable tv. Of the 18 or so channels listed as available, I get 6 and most are the quality of an old school aerial antenna. The previous 2 years, I had a spot on the entrance road of the facility. The adults were noisier than the kids late at night. This year I moved over the southernmost row and have found it quiet and peaceful.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, California", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing...great amenities!\u201d", "Author": "fabfam6", "ReviewID": "UR72776903", "Content": "Reasonable rates; friendly, helpful staff; beautiful location; will definitely return!", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cPoor wifi service surrounding neighborhood dilapidated\u201d", "Author": "salem30", "ReviewID": "UR69124921", "Content": "Internet service is very poor. It will boot you off continuously and very slow as well. Interference with cell phones was also an issue. Both my husband and I had issues with our cell phones where the other person on the call couldn't hear us about a minute into the call. That was very frustrating. We would walk around trying to see if other locations were better but same results everywhere in the complex. Working from my computer/phone wasn't even an option and my job is a work from home type of job. They won't let you leave early due to this either which sucked for us. The mobile home park next to the entry is very dilapidated and worn down and we're quite surprised some of them are still standing. Asphalt can also be too hot for pets to walk/lay on and there's little strips of grass that are in between rows, but not convenient to get too. The price is high for the location and amenities especially when you can't use the wifi or talk on your phone. Probably worth a weekend retreat but not an extended stay.

When I called back about a month ago to reserve a spot for next winter, we were told we could not, under any circumstances, pull our motor home into a \"bay view\" space - had to back in. This would put our bedroom next to the bay - not much view there. We should pay extra for that?????? Found another park next to the water that is more flexible.

After reading the one other review on here I was a little worried. To some extend, yes this is a large fenced in parking lot, but for it's location I have to say \"what is to be expected\". Also this is definitely not a resort with amenities and such but is a great place to stay for a few days when in the San Diego area. The campground was very clean, bathrooms clean also (if needed), RV parking seemed adequate, the front desk staff was very polite and helpful and the beach, which is right outside the campground, is very nice with a large sand beach, a small launch ramp for Jet Ski\u2019s or small boats. The water was very calm and clean, it is in the bay and there was very little power boat activity which was nice and quiet and also there were people with little kids out in the water kayaking around the area. There is also a rental facility with Kayaks, Jet ski\u2019s and powerboat right on the beach. We also took our bikes and it\u2019s a 10 minute ride around the whole place so it is not very large and you can also ride right down the street to a VERY large City park with plenty of grass that is on the waters edge with Sand beaches as well. Overall it was a very nice place to stay and we will definitely visit again. It was very quiet at night and they had a movie for the kids on Saturday night. One thing to note is that there is no store at the RV park other than a small snack bar with food icecream and does sell ice and there also in no food restarants or stores within walking distance of the RV park.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mission Bay RV Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d1104554-Reviews-Mission_Bay_RV_Resort-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2727 De Anza Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515748", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d9/b8/b0/mission-bay-rv-resort.jpg"}}
