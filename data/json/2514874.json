Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly member of staff, we quickly checked in and saw our room. It's a good size for Paris and incredibly clean and fresh. The room and the bathroom were nicely decorated and set out. One of the great benefits of the hotel is it's excellent location, as its just two streets away from Place de la Concorde. We used 'Concorde' as the way to navigate around paris as it's the beginning of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, you can see the Eiffel Tower and it's next to Jardin des Tuileries, which from their you'll find Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. After 'Concorde' you'll see the Seine river and all of Paris's elegant bridges. The area close to the hotel is lovely, a small park is 30 seconds away, which is a nice place to spend a morning with a coffee and a Pain Au Chocolat before heading out to explore. A member of staff recommended Le Carr\u00e9, which is a restaurant about a minute from the hotel. The food was excellent and so was the service.

After 8 days enjoying Hotel WO's hospitality, we were left with one question...Why isn't it ranked No. 1 ?! Our flight came in to De Gaulle at 5:55 in the morning and we took a taxi (47 euro + 3 euro tip) straight to the hotel. The staff was awaiting our arrival and facilitated our check-in at 10am! Also, because it was the low season, the owner upgraded us to a 5th floor room with a balcony! We don't need to tell anyone that this was a great start to our Paris vacation :) The hotel and rooms are admittedly small, but then most European hotel rooms are. Hotel WO's rooms however, are intelligently designed and you won't want for anything in the space alloted. Besides, being greeted by the morning sun over Parisian rooftops and the Eiffel Tower shining in the distance makes it all worthwhile. The hotel is in a great location too. It is within walking distance to Galeries Lafayette and Printemps department stores (don't go on weekends, seems like everyone in Paris is here). Gare St. Lazare, one of the main transport hubs is a mere minute down the street. However, we recommend taking the time to learn the bus routes. You miss so many sights if you rely on the Metro. It is quicker but, you're in Paris man, what's your hurry? :) The hotel's excellent staff, especially Sophie, Lorrie and Omar went out of their way to plan day trips and sightseeing strategies for every SINGLE day of our stay. The incomparable owner, Monsieur Sebastien Grandchamp suggested restaurants, showed them to us on Google, booked us tables and even walked us thru the directions necessary to get there. Needless to say, his suggestions were the meals we enjoyed the most!

Just a short (about 2 blocks if even) walk to the St. Lazare Metro Station, you can easily navigate to any area of Paris within 15-20 minutes. This being said, the hotel is also on a quiet street with no disturbance from the ground below. I was worried about being in Paris during Christmas Eve, when many restaurants are closed, and had emailed the hotel a month in advance to help with a reservation. Yadira was beyond helpful and made an amazing recommendation for a quaint, non-touristy, affordable little restaurant on the Ile-St.Louis, Mon Viel Ami. Do try it! I would advise booking directly through the hotel's website, as we got a 3+ night stay discount and the rates were better there than on any other discount travel site (and I checked everywhere).

All of them are fluent English speakers, smiley at all times and very patient with our queries. To our surprise, we managed to receive a generous upgrade to a superior room on the 5th floor with balcony and romantic view of the Eiffel Tower. Especially at night, the illuminated Tower offered an outstanding scenic view. The room was sufficiently spacious, very clean and comfortable. The walls were beautifully decorated with pictures from the Louvre museum, which adds to the overall warm atmosphere. We had courtesy free coffee and tea, flat screen TV, safety box, minibar and complementary high speed Internet connection. The quality of the modern, stylish and cozy furniture was very high and definitely more than satisfactory. Moreover, the colorful lobby offers free newspapers, magazines, a small library, plus Internet access with printing facilities (very helpful for printing maps, last minute things-to-do list and boarding pass). The air-condition was remarkably quiet, fairly important, as it had to run all night long in the cold winter Paris. The bathroom was tidy and spotless with facilities including shower, hair dryer and towel warmer. Shampoo and toiletry amenities were provided on daily basis. We did not notice any street noise. Finally, we appreciated the fact that we were allowed to securely leave our luggage at the hotel after our checking out, in order to enjoy a last romantic stroll in the town free of carrying extra weight. We didn\u2019t have the change to try the buffet breakfast, so no comment on that. To sum up, the flawless Hotel WO contributed greatly to our amazing trip to the City of Light. I cannot overemphasise the importance of an indulging accommodation at a memorable journey; therefore we are pleased for selecting Hotel WO. I would highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for an affordable, excellent value for money, yet superior hosting and romantic stay in France. We will definitely return to Paris and we will be more than willing to stay at the same superb hotel again.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cSpotlessly Clean\u201d", "Author": "ziggyperth", "ReviewID": "UR122306219", "Content": "This hotel is very close to ST Lazare Train Station.

The stations are well marked. Make sure you are going in the right direction. Tickets sold at same window as metro tickes. Cost is E9.10. You will have to schlepp your luggage up and down some steps though. If that's a problem, take a taxi. There is also the Europe metro stop very close by, up the hill off of Rue de Rome. We used it coming back at night to avoid walking up hill from St. Lazare. There is a market on your way to St Lazare that has fresh bread and pain au chocolate, as well as wine, cheese and other picnic items. Department stores are an easy walk as is L'Olympia theatre. We saw Jimmy Buffet there on Monday. We never felt unsafe walking around at night. I can't say enough good things about the staff. They really make the place all that much nicer to stay at. Yadira and Vivien were especially friendly and very helpful. We would highly recommend the WO, and look forward to staying there the next time we come to Paris.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay\u201d", "Author": "Limden", "ReviewID": "UR118784761", "Content": "We spent 4 nights here and it was a brilliant stay,nice clean modern hotel with very helpful staff.not in a dangerous area like some people have said,ideally located to see all the sights!!!", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chattanooga, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "Lorraine N", "ReviewID": "UR118728463", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed at the Wo Hotel.

We were informed that our luggage could be stored immediately and that rooms would be available in a short while. Our fellow travelers were accommodated after a few minutes wait but our wait turned out to be almost an hour. As we sat and squirmed in the lobby we feared that this development could be an omen of events to come. We were pleasantly surprised and constantly reminded during our six-night stay at the Hotel WO that we had indeed made a wise choice. We were given a room upgrade that looked out over a very interesting and diverse Parisian intersection that included a bakery, a brasserie, an ATM and provided unending people watching opportunities. Our room was fairly large by European standards with a very comfortable queen bed and adequate storage. The toilet-shower-basin combo, with no bathtub, was clean and functional with a curtain for additional privacy. Everything was well-maintained and worked properly. The air conditioning worked flawlessly, somewhat of a surprise given what I had read about Parisian boutique hotels, and noise was never a problem. Hotel attendents / receptionists are top-notch. They are all fluent in English and are knowledgeable about almost anything essential regarding city venues and transportation. All of them take a hands-on approach in solving any problem that arises to insure that guests are satisfied. They were particularly helpful in securing taxis in a timely manner and giving reliable estimates for travel by metro (subway) or taxi to any number of tourist sites and eating places throughout the city. Within a short walk of the hotel is the largest metro station in Paris (Gare St.-Lazare), which contains connections for four metro lines and several RER (suburban) trains. Also within reasonable walking distance is a Starbucks, two food markets (one is actually a supermarket), several restaurants and the Galleries Lafayette shopping complex for real power (albeit expensive) shopping. Though the hotel serves breakfast on the lower level we always opted to eat at one of the neighborhood brasseries or cafes each morning. Not only were the prices better but an early morning walk in the area made for an energizing start to the day. For value, location and quality of staff the Hotel Wilson Opera is hard to beat, offers a great experience in a world class city and is the perfect place to enjoy all the city has to offer.

There are also restaurants, cafes, and brasseries nearby, plus a supermarket and pharmacy around the corner. Getting to other attractions and parts of Paris from here is also a breeze either by rail or nice, leisurely walks. The rooms are the usual size for Paris, small by American standards, but well appointed with everything you need. Plus a balcony overlooking the streets of Paris - what more could you want? The bed and pillows were comfortable, the rooms are air conditioned, there is a flatscreen (with mostly French stations and CNN, what surprised me was that there was no BBC?). There is also room for a desk and the wifi connection (included in the cost of the hotel) was fast even way up on the 5th floor. Breakfast at the hotel was an additional 9 Euros (Meats, cheeses, yogurt, breads, coffee, cereal, juices), and was sufficient if you have no other option. Drycleaning service is available with same day turnaround. The staff at the hotel was very friendly, helpful, and accomodating. A big thank you to the front desk staff this morning, that tried very diligently to help me find a cab to the airport. If you are flying out of Paris in the morning I'd recommend booking your cab the evening before. If you'd like to take the train to CDG - allow an hour, especially if you have large luggage to manuever. There are a lot of steps and much walking when you are transfering between trains. It's not difficult, but you will need a fairly portable bag that you can lift easily.

TAKE THE STEPS! Small Rooms? Book the Ritz 5 minutes away and pay 8X what you do here! This is an awesome hotel, don't let anyone tell you differently. We booked two rooms (double standards) for four nights well in advance of our early July vacation. Our two teenage daugthers were traveling with us. When we checked in (Nina) informed us of the fact that we were upgraded to superior and were 'Neighbors' - Sweet - we had rooms 205 & 206 each room faced on different streets (NO NOISE AT ALL) of this triangular block in St. Germain (many differing opinions of this area - it is the 8th on the edge of the 17th I think, and about 600 meters from one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Paris (Parc Monceau). It is even closer to Gare St. Lazare - now - who has been to ANY city in the world near a major train station and didn't think it was busy and a bit gritty? No One - but this area is unique in the fact that it is nearest the train station, but mixed into a very nice residential area and one with commerce and business. Thus it is an EXCELLENT location for your travels). That puts to bed any ideas of a bad location - we were able to travel for five days, four nights on four carnets of metro tickets (50 euro total) - Also you are near the Garnier Opera which has a RoissyBus stop which is direct to DeGaulle Airport (CDG) for 10 Euro. It cost us 18 Euro to take a taxi with 7 large bags to the RoissyBus stop which is literally 1km away - Did anyone mention the shopping on Blvd Hussmann? The most famous shopping plazas there (not the exclusive ones off Champs de L'Eysee) Printemps & Galleries de Layfayette all of which are within 1km of this hotel. While on our visit we were greeted by at least four different desk clerks, none of which had any difficulty with English, so I have no idea where those comments come from, and weeks prior to our stay we used the staff for reservations at local restaurants - or you can make your own at the La Forchette (the fork) website, which is a great resource. We would recommend Au Risi et Bisi - a 5 minute walk up the street for a nice relaxing and incredibly scrumptous Italian Dinner. We walked our arses off in Paris and at times our kids couldn't keep up. When you return for a couple hours rest in the afternoon, there is a Marche (market) just as you approach the hotel that sells everything you might need, and the hotel leaves room in the mini bar fridge to keep your personal drinks cold. Beer, Wine, Liquor, soft drinks, fresh fruit, breads and packaged goods can be purchased here at a fraction of the cost elsewhere in Paris - so use it. Internet problems? I don't think so, we had two ipod touches, an ipad and netbook all working off their WiFi with absolutely no problems and no intervention from the hotel staff - its a bit unfair to blame the hotel on computer issues you might have. Free Wifi is everywhere and if you have a big problem, go down the street to the Starbucks with an upstairs lounge and join all the other Parisians doing business there over thier repas. Relax, enjoy yourself and most definitely stay at this hotel, you will not be dissapoiinted by anything.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

We came back for four days on our honeymoon. After not getting off to such a good start by losing my passport within 5 minutes of landing, the trip could have been a disaster. We spent the first night in an airport hotel and the proceeded onto the hotel Wilson Opera the following morning. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a really friendly lady with brown curly hair (I really wish we had got her name now). She was more than accommodating and made us feel really welcome. She also told us that the had upgraded our room as we were on our honeymoon (emotions still running high from the wedding, I had to turn away before I cried!!!) The room couldn't have been more clean even if every person that worked there suffered with OCD. It was SPOTLESS!!! Fair enough, it was cosy but this is what I love about the charm of the Parisian buildings. Every facility worked, including the air con! This was particularly welcome as it was ridiculously hot that week. We always use the metro or buses when we go to Paris as we find it the easiest way to get around (and a taxi ride can be rather terrifying!). We had a meal pre-booked at the Eiffel Tower and asked the curly haired lady what was the best way to get there. Rather than just saying \"go here, turn right etc\", whilst we were out for the day, she printed us off a bus schedule and plan, highlighted which stops to get off and on at and had also taken note that we had spent the day in Monte Marte and planned us a route to get there again! She was so helpful and lovely, I couldn't praise her more. The location is fantastic, the metro, bus stops and taxis are all at the end of the street. We walked to Monte Marte on the first day and it only took ten minutes (and I have small legs!!!!) so anyone that know Paris will understand that it really is very central. Also, getting the bus from the hotel Wilson Opera to the Eiffel Tower takes you done the \"Expensive\" shopping strip. Being on the bus meant that we couldn't spend - just admire.

As busy as the St Lazarre train station area is, this hotel is tucked away on a quiet street only, so you quickly leave the noise/traffic behind. As noted by others, the reception staff are friendly, and there is a free laptop for guests in the lobby. On the more negative side, as others have commented, we found Paris hotel prices generally higher than in other cities and the room was definitely the smallest we've stayed in. The only way to open our suitcases was to put them on the bed, one at a time. We did not take the breakfast at the hotel.. but there are many cafes a short walk away.

It's close to Saint Lazarre metro/train station which proved to be very convenient when we arrived at Paris Nord from London and when we caught the Artesia night train from Paris Bercy to VSL. We caught an evening train to Venice and they front desk person was more than happy to hold our bags for us after checkout so we could enjoy our last day in Paris without having to worry about where to store our bags. Our room was small, but clean (most important!) and comfortable. The location really was prime for us. Very near to the hotel are a post office for mailing postcards, a little cafe, pharmacy, and a great boulangerie that we visited everyday for our morning croissant/pastries and espresso; although, the hotel does provide a breakfast for an additional cost. As far as restaurants in the area that are open late \u2013 it\u2019s slim pickings. We often found ourselves ready for dinner after 10pm and only bars were open so not the best area for evening dining since the metro stops running at around midnight and you feet are too weary to trek back to the hotel. There's also shopping nearby with Galleries Lafayette and another little mall with H&M, Sephora, and a few other stores. Place de la Madeleine is also nearby and don't forget to stop at Fauchon and Hediard for a few gourmet souvenirs. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay and would definitely stay here again. I can't wait to plan my next trip to Paris and stay at Hotel WO again. A few things you must do/see when in Paris: - Notre Dame, climb the bell tower for beautiful views of the city. I actually preferred Notre Dame over the Vatican\u2019s Sistine Chapel \u2013 much more intimate and a little less touristy - Seine evening river cruise. We randomly picked Vedettes du Pont Neuf since we happened to cross Pont Neuf and see their sign - we were not disappointed. The cruise has live narration in French and English, though her English was sometimes hard to understand...didn't really care though because I was paying more attention to the beautiful sites. I DO wish that they timed their tours so you pass the Eiffel Tower when it sparkles, but we actually caught views of that from Pont Neuf after the cruise on our way to the metro stop. Look for coupons or buy tickets online for the best discount. - Download Rick Steves' free audioguides for the Paris City Walk and the Louvre (he has other tours for Paris too) - they're actually quite good and you can't beat FREE - Stop by the Trocadero for incredible views of the Eiffel as the sun sets. We got the most amazing pictures of the Eiffel here - the sky looked like a beautiful painting. Just be sure to ignore the irritating gypsies and peddlers - DO book your Eiffel tickets online and don't be bummed if you are only able to secure tickets to the second level. I was somewhat upset that only second level tickets at 10pm were available online, but I booked them anyway. When we finally did our ascent to the second level, there was a ticket booth with only 3 people in line where you could quickly purchase a supplement to the top and hop in line for the ascent to the top!

If arriving by bus at night from Beauvais, don't mess about, just get a cab, around 12 euros right to the door. Very friendly, polite and welcoming staff. We had room 602, which is one of two on the 6th floor. The room has a terrace which has spectacular views right onto the Eiffel Tower and the dome of St Augustin's. Sitting with a glass of wine late at night is fantastic. Once you get your bearings, and if you like to walk, you will find all of the sites within a targetted half hour walk. We bought the 2-day ticket for the hop-on-off red bus which we enjoyed much more than the metro. Our room was very, very clean, big bathroom and huge queen size bed. I think overall we struck it very lucky with the room as I had not made any special requests. I would recommend booking through Expedia or similar as our 4 night stay cost \u00a3510 for the room (flights booked independently). The tariff on the room door stated that Room 602 was 295 euros per night, so we saved around \u00a3600 for the same trip. Having said that, the hotel is in the business district and cost would be no odds if you were on company dollar. Our experience, and luck, resulted in excellent value for money and a great base.
