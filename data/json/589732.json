{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great luxurious hotel I stayed in this hotel while on a package tour so the agent handled all the booking. As there were 3 of us, the agent helped us to request for the duplex room. (All parties of 3 were 'upgraded' to a duplex room.) The duplex room is fantastic! As mentioned previously, it was 2 level, with a single bed on the first floor and a double bed on the 2nd level. There were 2 bathrooms and 2 tvs. The hotel was clean and looks fairly new. The toiletries were all provided and were replaced daily.The previous review mentioned about the lack of hot water. Thankfully I did not face that problem, but another person in the tour group did. He called housekeeping, some guy came and fixed something, and he was told that the hot water should be available in half an hour. So i guess if that problem occurs again, to just call housekeeping.Security in the hotel is excellent. You need the keycard to access the room, as well as access the floor you want to go to. It was kinda inconvenient to have to meet friends on the first floor so that they could bring you up to their room on another floor. Also, calling room-to-room was inconvenient as well because you had to call the operator first and tell her the name of the person in the room you want to be connected to. However, all the trouble was all in the name of security so i guess it's ok.Breakfast is international, bacon, eggs, cereal, the works. Taste-wise not too bad as well. Good to be able to find nice-tasting breakfast in China. Staff were polite and helpful, though they could only speak a little English.According to the travel agent, the hotel is located in the Central Business District. It's about 10 minutes walk to the nearest subway, as well as 10 minutes walk to the nearest 24-hr MacDonalds. There are coffee joints such as Starbucks nearby, as well as a Wall-Mart. However, because of its location in the CBD area, the hotel is fairly quiet in the early morning and at night when all the office workers are not around.Overall a fantastic stay. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Beijing!", "Date": "Dec 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR607590919", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "eRiaM"}, {"Content": "Too many discomforts If you are a \u9225\u6e28ater-phobic\u9225?or you don\u9225\u6a9b like to wash yourself, this hotel is for you. I know it could be an unfortunately series of events, but I spent 6 nights in this hotel and only in 2 I took a normal warm shower. When we arrive we were warned that, that evening the hot water would be absent and we could take the shower in the Gym Area. Ok, for one night it could be an acceptable discomfort, but the hot water missed the day after too and another day in my room I couldn\u9225\u6a9b achieve a decent temperature. But the top we get the 4th day when the water (hot  cold) is completely missed for all the night (from 6PM to next morning).And for all these discomforts do you think I have obtained a decent discount or another form of compensation? ONLY 130 RMB (about 15 euro) over a total of 5280 RMB (880 pro nights x 6) !!! Wow\u9225?too much.To add other \u9225\u6e03ons\u9225? my room was very close to the elevator and every night I had to hear a very noisy ring bell (din-don, I could hear just yet in my hears\u9225? when the elevator arrived (not only on my floor). The room was very cold too\u9225?even if I set the temperature to the max, I couldn\u9225\u6a9b arise 22 degrees, while my colleague on the same floor had always 24, 25 degrees (I told that to the reception several times without effort). My TV was out of order for 2 days (there was a fix Apache Linux screenshot) and at checkout they tried to bill me a 20 Rmb Video of Demand cost (probably done by the housekeeping man, who fixed the Tv set).So, maybe I was not lucky with this hotel, but for my experience I could only say to avoid it like a plague.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR700497910", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SandroR"}, {"Content": "Good but typical anonymous 4 star Spent 4 nights in HQ Ritz on business trip. Very good value for money as we paid just 750 rmb per night inc breakfast and got upgraded to a 2 level room. This was something of a mixed blessing, as there really didn't seem to be much point in having a duplex with 2 bathrooms and 2 TVs, one upstairs and one downstairs, but yet not having a master switch beside the bed to turn off all the 50-odd lights in the suite. It was the usual Chinese form over function that you find in hotels all over China, but overall a good experience. Pros: Quiet and secure. Good showers. Good TV. Excellent breakfast buffet. Comfy beds. Good laundry service. Cons: Mini bar was warm, poorly stocked and expensive. Room service menu was limited and only served until 11pm- no good for European jetlag munchies at 2am!! Wooden stairs to bed level will wear badly in a short time with luggage being hauled up and down and if older hotels in China are anything to go buy, probably won't be maintained well. Staff's spoken English not very good. Restaurant service a little daft at times - knife and fork provided for soup, no spoon until 10mins later. While there is a fitness centre and beauty salon advertised in the hotel brochure in the room, we couldn't find this anywhere, and the staff seemed to have no clue of its existance.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR315694079", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ynca"}, {"Content": "We loved the H Q Ritz We recently stayed at the H Q Ritz Hotel for 4 nights and were very impressed with the hotel itself and the excellent breakfast that was included in the price. We had booked the hotel over the Internet and could not find any reviews but the price was reasonable and we felt that any 4 star hotel should be okay. Our standard room was actually a suite, a duplex with 2 full baths, one upstairs and the other downstairs, 2 TV's, refrigerator and safe. The property is only one year old and looks brand new. The staff was helpful although apart from those at the front desk not much English is spoken. The location is not great and the subway about a 15 to 20 minute walk but taxis are so cheap in Beijing that's not a real problem.
