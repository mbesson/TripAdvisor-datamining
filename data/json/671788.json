Wonderful location right on the Bosphorus. Asian side which means using the hotel's free shuttle launch to get across to the city each day. Apart from the grumpy boat pilot (more amusing than irritating) this 20 minute each way ride was the highlight. The Bosphorus is a fascinating stretch of water full of boats from tiny to gigantic. You could spend all day on the hotel terrace watching them go by. If the weather's OK you can eat outside on said terrace. Menu limited but food delicious.

Sumahan also has a Hamam which is booked specially for you for the time no others can use it which is excellent; the buble massage is fabulous try it.

Before we booked we were concerned that, being on the Asian side, we would be a bit out of the way - we needn't have worried as the location was perfect. It is a 35 to 45 (depending on traffic) taxi ride from Ataturk Airport. Then, once you are at Sumahan, there are plenty of ways to get over to the sights at Sultanahmet and the Beyoglu/Taksim Square areas. The Hotel has its own private launch which leaves twice in the morning, at lunch and in the evening, the journey over takes about 25 minutes and drops you at Kabatas where you can pick up a metro to take you directly to Sultanahmet, a road taxi or the funicular up to Taksim Square depending on where you want to go. On the occasions we used it, we had it to ourselves. You can also get a water taxi which will pick you up from the hotel, more expensive but quicker and more direct if you want to go anywhere other than Kabatas. The other option, apart from a road taxi, is one of the ferries that go from Cengelkoy (the ferry station is 5 minutes slow walk from the hotel) to Emminou- they are extremely cheap. Of course, the final option is a road taxi, which are extremely cheap and will get you to central Istanbul very quickly.

A few thoughts: We stayed on the European side for a few days early in our trip to have ready access to the main sites, and this was a good decision for us. After Cappadocia, Sirence, and Ephesus, the more relaxed Asian side was exactly what we wanted. We also felt we came to understand the \"real\" Istanbul from exploring the villages adjacent to the Sumahan. The service is exceptional. Seek out Nural, who is genuine and extremely helpful. We own hotels in the Western US, and I have been telling Nural stories to our managers as examples of the right way to treat guests. The Sumahan staff know a great deal about the local village in particular and Istanbul in general. And they are delighted to help you figure out the best restaurants, experiences, etc. I have seen complaints below about privacy issues (chairs used, etc.). Those are really expectations issues. Istanbul is a large, congested city, so don't expect an expansive resort. The Sumahan is a 20-room boutique hotel with incredible Bosphorus views and impeccable service. It is a real gem of a tiny hotel. The space and privacy are amazing in the context of the teeming, dense city surrounding you, but the site is compact, so have your expectations in line. The boat service to the European side is convenient, but limited, so make sure to reserve seats when you know you are going. Coming back, the boat does not run at night, but ferries are inexpensive and relatively convenient. From the great selection of small pamplets at the front desk, we discovered water taxis, which you should definitely consider. For 75 TL from Kabatas (about $40), you can take a party of 2-10 right back to the hotel, 24 hours a day, and fast. To catch our plane home, we even took a water taxi to Eminonu (100TL), and caught a taxi there. It avoided the bridge traffic, shortened our trip, and we got to say goodbye to Istanbul by water, the best way.

We had previously stayed in Sultanhamet so wanted a different perspective from the Asian side. The location is really perfect...great views of the Bosphorus and just steps from the very charming Cengelkoy. We booked one of the loft suites and the room was beautiful. The only problem is as the previous reviewer commented ,the room is far from private.Actually you open your door to a public area and the ones on the end are near restaurants. Sometimes we found our chairs gone and most of the time our neighbors were out (three young people) and talking loudly on their cell phones. I actually think other room types which are less expensive would offer more privacy. Indeed the room description does not indicate that the garden area is \"private\" so not much to complain about. Were I to return I would opt for another room type and not pay a premium for the direct access. Our welcome was very nice and in general the hotel staff aims to please. Breakfast was very nice and you could order some eggs etc. which were included. Lovely breakfast room and outside terrace. We did not eat in the Kordon Restaurant because I had read about the prices and asked about a less expensive option...they booked Iskele just down the block and it was fantastic...and just as much if not more atmosphere. For our last night they booked Borsa which has a wonderful view but nothing better than you could find at the hotel and we found it business like and rather stuffy...food was good. The private boat shuttle was efficient and they can provide you with an Akbil to be used on the tram which leaves right from where the boat takes you. Fun experience. Because we had done our major sightseeing we only used it once. Stolling around Cengelkoy early morning or evening was really a treat with lots of local color and few if any tourists around. That was great. We wanted a transfer to return to the airport (we had our own to arrive) and hotel seemed only interested in two options local taxi (about 40 Euro) or VIP Limo quoted at 125 Euro. I asked a few times as I was not excited about that ride in a taxi (never know what you will get) and could not justify 125 Euro to go to airport. I did my own research and booked one of the many transfer companies who picked us up promptly in a very nice van and cost was 40 Euro. It seems that option could have been offered given my requests. I understand Sumahan is five star but most hotels would offer all options. I would recommend this hotel for your stay in Istanbul if you are looking for a quiet location and don't mind the transit to the major tourist sights. Excellent for return visit to Istanbul.

We had a Junior Terrace Suite - top floor single level, the \"Beykoz\" room.

The hotel is right on the water. The king bed was very comfortable. Location - this can be a plus or minus depending what you want. We liked being \"away\" from the busier side.

There's a small town a few minutes' walk away. Ensure you get their map, & their address on their card as the hotel is not obvious to most taxis from the street. The location itself is a well-to-do area, though the small town nearby is more typical Istanbul. Service - was impeccable, helpful & friendly. The owner/architect came out to introduce herself given we'd come from Australia. Food - they have a small in-house restaurant with quality & OK-priced local & international meals. Wine is pricey but the local wine choice is better than most restaurants. There's several high standard restaurants close by (used by wealthy locals, judging by the number of Porches!). Sights - not as much as the Euro side, but head south, & also get a cruise up the Bosphorus towards the Black Sea. Facilities - there's a small gym, and a small hammam. No pool.

After a great deal of research, we set aside recommendations of lovely hotels in Sultanahmet and chose Sumahan on the Water. What a perfect choice. We arrived after hours of flying across the Atlantic and Europe and were greeted with smiles and glasses of fragrant and delicious lemonade enhanced with fresh sage leaves. The rooms are coolly elegant and comfortable. The beds and linens supremely comfortable. The interior bathrooms have windows with views of the Bosphorus. Every afternoon a small plate of fresh fruit was waiting for us in the room. In August, Istanbul was beautiful and very hot. Being able to return to Sumahan each afternoon by a beautiful boat trip and then sit and relax outside on the banks of the Bosphorus enjoying the breeze was heaven. Other days, we relaxed in the lovely sitting room and library overlooking the Bosphorus with a public computer. The library is filled with hundreds of books on Istanbul and Turkey. And of course a backgammon set. The restaurant was lovely. Breakfast (included in the price of the room) started with a plate of fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, cheese and cold cuts. Then a basket of fresh rolls. And then eggs prepared as you wished . In the late afternoon, we ordered delicious mezes as we sat in comfortable chairs next to the Bosphorus watching the boats go by and the sun setting behind the hills on the European side. For dinner, all of the Turkish specialties were absolutely delicious (we did not try the Western dishes). One dessert had us asking for a recipe - a pumpkin in syrup with vanilla ice cream was amazing. One night we walked into Cengelkoy and ate at a small local fish restaurant, another night we took a short taxi ride further up the coast to a well recommended and delicious restaurant (Suna's Place). Every guide book tells you that you must take a Bosphorus cruise. We were lucky enough to be taking it daily. The hotel has its own wonderful boat that makes several trips daily between the hotel and the European shore, leaving you right next to the tram. Before arriving, I worried about whether it would be difficult to get back and forth to the hotel if we missed the hotel boat's scheduled trips. I worried needlessly. If you want to travel at another time, the hotel staff can make arrangements or give you information about the local public ferry which docks a 5 minute walk from the hotel (or other ferries that cross the Bosphorus every 15 minutes a cheap taxi ride away.) Beyond the physical loveliness of Sumahan, what makes it even more magical is the staff. Everyone was friendly, helpful and solicitous. But Nural Inciler, a manager, went beyond.

Breakfasts are good and the small hotel restaurant is open in the evening.There are 3 restaurants next door to the hotel, serving mainly fish, but the friendly and efficient staff have lots of good local recommendations. Travellng back to he hotel by launch from the city is only available until 7.30 pm, but ferries ply the water until late. The location may be a little way out of town for some, but the setting, and the thrill of crossing the water more than make up for what could be an inconvenience", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous getaway\u201d", "Author": "privacyplease2", "ReviewID": "UR68419715", "Content": "LOCATION: The Sumahan is a great way to experience the Bosphorus waterfront in a boutique hotel setting. If you're a first-timer to Istanbul, it may be a bit far from the action of Sultanahmet and the trendy shopping/dining districts of the European side. But if you prefer your base to be a relaxing escape from the bustle of the city, this is it. ROOMS: We stayed in a deluxe suite, which was an ideal configuration for two friends, as there were an extra closet and powder room. We loved being able to step out directly onto the riverfront lawn. (Only complaint: since our room was closest to the restaurant, we heard the clanging of dishes. However, I didn't request to change rooms.) SERVICE: The service was friendly and accommodating. Unless you speak Turkish, you will need the staff to help arrange your transportation, reservations, etc. One problem is the English of the night managers. In a hotel with international clientele and at these rates, you expect better. GENERAL: - Food at the Sumahan is good. For breakfast, the Turkish egg dish is excellent. I brought my own gluten-free bread and they toasted it for me in the mornings. - The restaurant two doors down, Rigal, has an excellent though limited menu. Staff there spoke only Turkish. - My favorite restaurant of the trip was Ulus 29-- the views, decor, menu/food, and service were superlative. - Traffic is Istanbul is nightmarish. If you can take a boat to cut travel time, whether the public ferry, scheduled hotel launch, or private sea-taxi, I highly recommend it. A pool would elevate the Sumahan to the next level! As it stands, it's a good, relaxed alternative to the behemoth Ciragan Palace and Four Seasons Bosphorus at a lower price point.

I took a loft room at the garden level, and was able to sit in a deckchair reading a book and enyoing the cocktail and the strawberries kindly offered by the hotel.

A magical oasis in Istanbul.\u201d", "Author": "Free-to-wander", "ReviewID": "UR62890729", "Content": "Where do I start in describing this truly unique small hotel? It's the level of pampering service and attention to detail that made my stay here so outstanding. Its similarity to other European boutique hotels I had experienced in Portugal and Italy struck me, as it successfully blends a historical building with modern design. I found the overall look and feel of the Sumahan to be tasteful and warm. First of all, my stay here came at the end of a two-week trip to Turkey, ending in Istanbul. I thought that staying in Sultanhamet, near the monuments, would have been better. However, that area was very congested and noisy. Moving to the Sumahan was like taking a step into a magical oasis right in Istanbul. The boat transfer pick-up point at Kabatas, on Istanbul's European side, was extremely easy for the taxi driver to find. The captain of Sumahan's little boat helped me on board with a smile and off we went on a sunny April day, admiring the views of Istanbul's minarets and riverside palaces. Arriving at the hotel, I was greeted with a glass of fresh lemonade, a swift check-in, and a gracious escort to my room. My room didn't have a room number, but a name, Tarabya. It had a fireplace and large windows overlooking the Bosphorus; everything in the room was placed to maximize the great views. The marble bathroom was well appointed and I loved the handmade soaps. My last day in Istanbul was my day of rest. I was by then shopped and sight-seed out, so I made the most of the hotel's assets: the Bosphorus itself. I took the shuttle boat across to the nearest point, hopped a bus one stop to the quaint neighbourhood of Ortakoy (the hotel provided an Akbil bus pass); where I ate fried mussels, people watched while sipping a Turkish coffee, meandered a bit, window-shopped, then went back for the return shuttle boat. Going back into Sultanhamet would have been just as easy, with a taxi ride thrown in. That ease of getting to and from the hotel was a pleasant realization, as I hadn't been sure about that. Again, a glass of lemonade greeted my return. I finished the afternoon in the hotel's garden, sitting on an Adirondack chair facing the Bosphorus. Between watching the boats go by, observing the cormorants fish, and trying to read my book, I dozed off in the sun. When I woke, a wonderful young woman brought out an afternoon tea tray with sage tea and homemade cookies. I had mentioned earlier that I was hoping to enjoy this kind of tea again before I left Turkey and she remembered. I had booked an appointment for the hamam and went before dinner. It was blissful! The attendant was a lovely woman, who had magical hands. The products were very high quality, the massage skillful and I came out very relaxed, refreshed and glowing like a shiny new penny! It was the best way to prepare for the long flight home the next day. A final note about the food: Dinner, as well as the breakfasts, were very, very good, as well as the wine selection. The baklava was the best I have ever had - delicate and not syrupy sweet. The presentation was beautiful and the service excellent. Between the seafood restaurants next door and the hotel's own restaurant, I found that a quiet retreat to the hotel at night is a good way to end the day in Istanbul. My only regret was that my husband wasn't with me this time. I hope to go back to the Sumahan with him the next time I come to Turkey. I would recommend this wonderful hotel in a heartbeat...

This year, I have more to add to the list. Not only is my room gorgeous, complete with fireplace and comfortable seating facing the Bosphorus, but so was my sleep last night. The bed is very comfortable, as are the pillows. Linens are top notch too. Turkish breakfast was even better than I remembered it, with the addition of an egg dish and fresh strawberry crepes (in the UK they would call them pancakes, but in NA we call them crepes.) Today I treated myself to my first Turkish Bath in the hotel's hamam, and I can honestly say it was the best I have ever had! Also, the hamam was spotless. I wish I could eat in tonight as I know their manti is delicious, but I have another meeting. This is one hotel you will want to return to. This is the perfect place to unwind for a few days after touring and before returning home, or after staying in Sultanahmet, the old city. A drive up the Bosphorus from Cengilkoy on the Asian side provides one with a real sense of how the locals live and it's a beautiful drive too.

The boat service is very good and efficient when it runs (30 mins between hotel and downtown).

Just right.

It was a wonderful choice, and after months of research of properties in Istanbul, I'm so glad we chose the Sumahan. A word of caution - make sure you realize, when booking this hotel, that it is not centrally located to all the sightseeing attractions in Istanbul. If you prefer to be in the \"center of the action\", stay in Sultanahmet. If you're looking for a quiet retreat at the end of a busy day, the Sumahan is an excellent choice. We booked a standard room and were very happy with it. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom huge and well-appointed, and we arrived home every day to find a bowl of fresh fruit on our table. The best part of the room were the windows, which flung wide to a breathtaking view of the Bosphorus, and allowed the sounds of waves lapping at the coast to enter the room at all hours. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times, and even though we found the hotel's boat to be rather superfluous (it doesn't take you where you need to go, and doesn't go anywhere at convenient times), the local Cengelkoy ferry station was just a short walk down the road, and once we figured out the ferry schedule, we were good to go - the ferries were easy, convenient and cheap, and will take you right to Eminonu, where you can board the tram to Sultanahmet. And you get to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the Bosphorus at the same time! We found that all the public transportation in Istanbul is easy to use and inexpensive. The cafe at the restaurant serves decent food, but it is VERY pricey. The breakfast is extensive and delicious, and they will make you eggs upon request. The Sumahan is a great place for a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of Istanbul - at the end of our trip, we spent a night in Sultanahmet. It was nice, but if I went back to Istabul, I wouldn't hesitate to book the Sumahan again.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newport s wales", "Title": "\u201cfantastic boutique hotel on edge of the Bosphorus\u201d", "Author": "greatweekends", "ReviewID": "UR10428632", "Content": "We had a fantastic stay in this hotel.

We ate breakfast each day outside on the water edge. The bosphorus is within a few metres of the suite and there is so much going on you can just sit there and watch the world go by. The food was excellent - not the wide variety you would get in a big central city hotel but simple tasty local produce prepared and served well. The suite itself was spacious and had excellent facilities. Several people have commented that the hotel is some way from the old part of Istanbul - yes it is but its great fun to get to the old city either by the hotel boat and then either bus taxi or tram or to walk about 200m to the local ferry station. You can then experience real life on the ferry at a cost of about 50 pence (1$) for the trip right into the old city. Next to the hotel and on the edge of the Bosphorus is a fish restaurant where we ate several times. The starters were superb and overall the food excellent. We had no issues with the service levels - staff were discrete but there when needed.

The views from the room were amazing - the best view I've ever had at any hotel (all rooms have a river view). Gorkhan the Manager was wonderful - extremely pleasant and helpful and spoke excellent english (although it is true that some staff have problems with speaking english). The downsides of the hotel were that the evening meal we ate there was extremely overpriced and quite unimpressive. I don't expect to be served macdonalds style chips paying those kind of prices! The drinks were very expensive too. There are no other bar alternatives that we managed to find near the hotel, or licensed restaurants as it on the asian, therefore predominantly muslim. side of the river. We did, however, find a shop selling wine, beers ,etc on the night we ate at the hotel and didn't stay out in the sultanamet area. This was a much cheaper alternative to staying in the hotel restaurant and we enjoyed watching the river from our room instead. Getting into the throng of things was a bit of a hassle. While the hotel offers a complementary service, we never used this as it set off at 9am in the morning (too early for us) and came back at two fixed times that didn't really suit our movements. It is possible to catch the Cenglekoy ferry, or take a taxi from the hotel to another ferry stop (ask Gorkhan) as cheaper alternatives to a taxi door -to -door. We did enjoy our ferry rides on the river with the amazing views, it has to be said and they are much, much cheaper than taxis (agree prices ,on paper as taxi drivers are unlikely to speak english -or pretend not to, beforehand to prevent getting ripped off). Ferrys from Sultanamet coming back to Cenglekoy stop at about 7.30pm so you need to get taxis if staying for a night out.

We stayed only one night. We found the hotel lovely to look at - with gorgeous views. The pictures are absolutely accurate. What one does not see in the pictures is very relevant to your comfort however. -Substandard bedding quality. The duvet and pillows are made of a synthetic fiber-fill material that feels spongey and doesn't breathe. American motels provide better quality bedding. -The air conditioning in our room did not function. The room faced the river - which was lovely, but it also means that the room heats up dramatically in the afternoon sun. Without air conditioning, the air was humid and very hot, enough such that we were sweating while sitting still. -Substandard Problem Resolution. We reported the air conditioning problem upon check-in. We were told that nothing could be done. A hotel that provided service would have placed a fan in the room at a minimum. Instead, we returned from dinner to find that the staff had been testing the unit, and left it on full heat by mistake. -Inadequate staff training. Hotel staff other than the front desk have absolutely no ability to communicate even rudimentarily in English. I don't expect fluency - I do expect a staff-member who provides a service to me (ironing a shirt), to be able to understand payment methods - such as \"charge it to the room\". Instead, the fellow appeared not to understand the concept, just holding out his hand waiting for cash. He accepted $20 US dollars as I had no other cash. This isn't standard hotel service. -Peculiar room design. The visual design of the room is pleasing, however the layout failed to provide a place for a suitcase, a bedside table, or a clock. -Single room key provided. We were instructed to leave the room key at the front desk so that more that one guest could access our room. Not terrible, just peculiar. I did not sleep a wink in the room because of the broken air conditioning and the noise from the street and parties around the hotel. The hotel manager was very courteous and responsive in the morning. He would not cut anything from the room price. Because, I had not seen any ability for hotel staff to solve problems effectively, I made a reservation at another hotel that morning and left the Sumahan.

The hotel delivered, providing one of the most luxurious stays (and best night's sleep) we have ever enjoyed while traveling. The windows from our room, Terabya, provided blow-away views of the Bosphorus and the contemporary furnishings and soothing interior felt more like a residence than a hotel. A few points: yes, it is a distance from Sultanhamet, where you'll likely be spending at least a few days of your trip and the complimentary ferry best serves visits to Dolmabache Palace, the Istanbul Modern Museum (reccomended), and Taksim. But it's a cinch to take the Cengelkoy town ferry to it's final stop from which you can easily walk or take the tram to Hagia Sofia, the Grand Bazaar, etc. We were the first guests to try the Sumahan's just-opened hammam and highly recommend the experience (and you can buy the mohair mitt, peshtemals and white copper bowl -- great gifts -- at Dervis at the Grand Bazaar, and color block rugs similar to those in the hotel at Kurtoglu, close by Dervis). Note: Anticipating a jet-lagged fog we arranged for a car (110 euro) to pick us up at the airport upon arrival; had we known how smooth the entry into Turkey would be, how well-organized and language friendly the airport and the quality and quality of taksi drivers, we would have done that instead and saved the extra 40 lira for two glasses of wine (!!!) on the terrace.

We only managed to book 4 out of 8 days at the Sumahan so our trip to Istanbul was split at two locations (the Sumahan was booked). At the time the Sumahan was not a top rated but I heard about it from a friend. You can look at it as a plus or a minus its distance from old Istanbul. But that time of year I looked at it as a major plus being away from the hustle & bustle of Istanbul. We looked at it as a nice daily retreat from spending the day in Istanbul. The views of Istanbul looking down the Bosphorus are incredible. The Sumahan is located at a bend of the Bosphorus giving you incredible views up and down the Bosphorus. The little town were it was located was a nice contrast from busy Istanbul. We felt totally safe walking around the area around the hotel. We had many romantic dinners at the various waterfront restaurants walking distance from the hotel. The fresh seafood at the restaurants around the hotel was excellent. The ferry service provided by the hotel was kind of lacking but taking the public transportation from the city dock was no problem at all. After 20 minute or so scenic ferry you were in Istanbul. The facility was very unique. It had a very trendy feel to it with its d\u00c3\u00a9cor and lighting. It use to be a cannery at one time and renovated to this gorgeous property. With that being said in order for them to get the best usage of space while maintaining the integrity of the shell of the building they had to use a lot of interior steel construction. I read one of the negative comments about this property being the noise from other rooms due to the steel lofts and stairs founds in some rooms. I personally did not notice the noise being an issue. We stayed in one of the loft rooms which had 2 bathrooms with the one on the second floor being a traditional Turkish hammam. The first floor had overstuffed sectional couch with French doors that opened out to a grassy area where we sat in Adirondack chairs, ate fresh fruit, sipped on beverages watching the busy ship traffic on the Bosphorus. There was a spiral staircase leading to the second floor. The bedroom was also on the second floor. What was nice about the bedroom was you saw the water from the bed and a nice sunset over the hills on the European side of Istanbul. The room service and the bar service was excellent. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat.

This small boutique hotel absolutely captures the charm of Istanbul and boasts some of the greatest Bosporus views in Turkey. From the moment you set foot in the room the ocean envelops you. Chocolates on the table, fireplace to keep you warm, hamam-style bathroom. I must be dreaming. Now, shivering back in Northern VA, I think I was. Alright, enough praise then, I also have some tips if you do choose to stay at Sumahan. The rooms really do make for different experiences. We initially got a loft suite but found it was on the ground floor with only a small window looking out from the upper floor. These may be better for parents who want some separation from kids or for summer-time guests who can just walk outside to take in the views. For us, the deluxe room offered the most affordable way to the magic on the water. The junior & executive suites look to offer the same experience. Dinner initially was to take place at the hotel's posh Kordon fish restaurant, but we made a last minute switch over to Cengelkoy iskelesi, about a five minute walk down the street from Sumahan, after finding some great reviews about it.
