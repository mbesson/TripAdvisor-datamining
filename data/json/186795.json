Every time we wanted to go online we had to go to the public patio area. The pool was way too cold and way to deep to swim in and the sauna had to be preheated. We waited a half hour and it was still cold. The fitness room was a big disappointment too. The cardio machines were good but they only had ONE free weight. The breakfast buffet was good. For $15 you got coffee, juice, bacon, sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, waffles, fruit, yogurt and more. Definitely worth the price.

So picking a Holiday Inn for me made sense and it was close to my contact. It was also well priced. Pros: Good value for the dollar, I paid $109 and $119 and that's good anywhere let alone for a major downtown hotel. It was very clean. There are a number of coffee shops in the area and a few local eateries which turned out to be quite good. It's a very short walk to the Granville Entertainment section although parts of the street are somewhat sketchy. Yaletown is a few blocks away. It's also easy to get to the hotel if you use the Skytrain but you will have to walk several blocks. That might be an issue in rainy season. The decor has been updated to a degree and the bed was very comfortable. Cons: This is an old hotel. Lighting levels are poor and the room design reflects it's age. Very small bathrooms, the closet is open right next to the bathroom, small sink. They still use the old tube TV's. I also found the walls to be thin as I could hear conversations quite easily. That having been said, the weekend I was leaving the hotel was booked out. There were traveling teams in for the weekend. It's also a favorite for Canuck fans who where in for the game.

Bit taken aback one evening to come back to what appeared to be an upmarket pre xmas function happening (didn't think the place could hold so many revellers) but again no hassles or disturbance. The food was good and friendly service to match. The hotels position means that you can walk in almost any direction and find dining (including takeaway or supermarket) and entertainment options. The internet was being upgraded so we had problems, but some free vouchers to the foyer computers some evenings and a late night service call (we returned very late one evening...many thanks!!) from IT found the old lan cable under the bed and we were very happy. Goodness how did tourists cope pre internet days? Surprised to discover they have dedicated tourist desk staffed quite often with folk who really knew the place....great advice.

I'm also not happy with the happy hour that included appetizers I was entitled to as a PC member at the lounge on the main floor. Why I wasn't happy was because there was NO appetizers since it was the holidays. However, I received a letter upon check-in which said there was appetizers and I was able to enjoy around 5PM? Why not edit the letter beforehand if it is not being offered? My family and I waited in the couches outside the lounge for around 15-20 minutes too since we weren't sure if the lounge was actually open as well.

Our major complaint was when a family jumped in the pool wearing shorts, t-shirts, underwear, along with a baby in a diaper. My husband and I were looking forward to an evening swim when this sight appeared before our eyes we changed our mind. When speaking to the hotel staff about this situation it was stated that, \"who are we to say that they can't wear their clothes in the pool?\" and I was questioned as to whether or not I really saw a diaper and not a pull up. Needless to say, I felt that my issue was unheard and she also said that, \"they do not supervise the pool area and someone would go down to take a look at the diaper issue\". Well, if you don't supervise the pool area, who does? Over and over it was stated in the hotel guide and all over holiday inn material that if for some reason you were not satisfied with your stay they would make it better. I was sorry I complained because this hotel employee treated me rudely and did not see this problem as an issue. I'm sorry, but I am not swimming with others who are in their sweaty clothes, most likely stained old underwear, and a diaper with who knows what in it. If you are going to stay here, as stated, this hotel does not supervise the pool area so feel free to do what you want in this area. Hop in fully clothed, bring your glass bottles down, and hey don't bother getting out of the pool to go the bathroom. My advice - For $120 a night try a different hotel.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cNot memorable\u201d", "Author": "AFLtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR58364988", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a month while working on the Olympics.

The hotel's location is good, just out of the main drag and up a couple of blocks from the bustling Yaletown. The bed was comfy. The average: no minibar in many rooms, ageing decor, strange layout. Friends reported that the \"suites\" were \"studios\", with the advantage of a kitchenette but a bed that folded out from the wall and took all the remaining space. The bad: the hotel doesn't cope with too many guests - often barely any hot water at night, restaurant struggled when only 4 tables were full, free wifi is slow when there are too many users and there's no faster, more reliable, paid option in the room. Indeed the wi-fi failed a number of times in one week during my stay but all the desk staff want to do is put you through to off-site tech support (thanks, but it's not my problem, it's yours!).

We arrived for a Saturday night, and I noticed the lobby had been slightly remodeled. I asked about when this occured, and the front desk staff said it was recently done to promote a new Holiday Inn Logo. They were very proud and helpful, which made check in delightful. The room appeared clean on the initial walk in, however a serious odor. This was room 409 in case you wish to avoid it. Smelled like Body Odor. I know it sounds wierd, but the three of us concurred. I also noticed the room was not spotless...but was clean enough...it was just that smell. Opened the window and left for several hours and it did not help....Just made me feel uncomfortable. I see they have upgraded the linens bedding and pillows,whichwas nice except for the pillow labels being dirty. Again, a wierd thing to notice. The bathrooms and tubs have beenremodeled as well whichmakes me believe Holiday Inn Vancouver is trying to upgrade. I just dont feel like it is the cleanest hotel in the area. You know, the staff here is great, and there are no really serious problems with this hotel....it just gives me the creeps. I try tobe objective, and applaud their trying to upgade this property, but I simply cant get comfortable here. In any event, this hotel should hover at the89.00 dollar range. Seriously, any more spent is bad money. Sorry Holiday Inn...I love you....but lower the rates for this particular property.

Check in was accurate and very fast. I was given a room at the fourth floor. My first impression when the lift doors opened was OMG, this floor stinks. At the same time, I noticed that a few rooms (perhaps three) on that wing of the hotel was converted into some sort of retail/ bride shops which gave me a very bad impression. The smell at the fourth floor was as if the floor was flooded and the carpet did not dry properly. The smell faded while walking towards my room, but was still there... For the housekeeping, most of the time, you will need to wash the coffee maker yourself because it is not there job to do it after all and perhaps depending on the person doing the cleaning. I had some problems in configuring the internet so I asked for assistance. I received a phone call within less than 5 minutes from some support lady who obviously knew what she was doing. She asked me to do some configuration and dealing with me as if I had no experience at all (which is good). My problem was solved. Speaking of the internet, yes, it is true they do provide free high speed internet which is controlled and throttled if you exceed a certain bandwidth usage. I downloaded a 50Mb file to update some software and after 25 Mb the bandwidth dropped from >200 kbs to 15Kbs . I called to complain about the situation and the person in charge had to request for a special approval from the hotel to remove the control of bandwidth. By the time they put it back to normal, the file was downloaded. My message is that if you are looking for free flow of internet, it is not. It is controlled and you would most probably not be able to use Skype or MSN Live to communicate. In my case, internet is a very important tool. The pool (which I did not use) did not seem to be adequate for kids as it is deep. Adults supervision would be required at all time. Like, the adults would have to be in the pool at all time. I had dinner once at the restaurant, it is nice and clean. Service was fast , the waitress was pleasant and the food was good. I had my breakfast outside all the time since there were a lot of choices at lower prices. It is true that the location is good. There weren't many homeless people since it was still summer I guess, many times I got stopped by people on the street asking me for 10 dollars for many different reasons, but this has nothing to do with the hotel of course. Taking in consideration the price I have paid (CAD159 to 200 per night) and the hotel condition, I would certainly not stay in the Holiday Inn Downtown Vancouver as I could stay in more presentable hotels in the same area and at the same or slightly cheaper rates.

However, it also means you can go there in the complete confidence that you will have a clean room and a comfortable bed for the night. The room we were allocated was an upgrade, and very large \u2013 about double the norm, with a three piece suite and a conference table with six chairs. The bed was very large and comfortable. Effective air conditioning is provided, with the added bonus of being able to open the window if you prefer. Although clearly marked as a non smoking room, it seemed that the previous occupant had smoked in the room as there was some of that horrible residual smell. The bathroom was surprisingly cramped with the shorter than average bathtub governing the overall size. Overall, the room was OK, but was starting to look a bit on the tired side. Although situated on a busy street, we did not find traffic noise to be a problem with the window closed and the air-con on. (We were also on the 7th floor which no doubt helped). We only ever had breakfast in the hotel; these were excellent with a good choice of both cooked and the \u2018healthy\u2019 option. I particularly liked the eggs being cooked to order and I thought reasonable value for money at around CDN$12-15 (depending on whether you had \u2018cooked\u2019 or the \u2018healthy\u2019 option). Service was excellent, even providing you with paper cups to take away any tea or coffee. One observation was the size of the two lifts \u2013 they were very small. This caused a lot of difficulty when people were leaving with luggage, given that only about 4 people with luggage could squeeze in at a time. I noted people getting in the lift on the \u2018up\u2019 cycle in sheer frustration! I found staff, whether waiting, reception, bar and the person on the Information Desk to be attentive, helpful and provided good service. We had a look at the indoor swimming pool \u2013 rather a tortuous route to get to it! I would describe it more as a leisure pool \u2013 you couldn\u2019t really swim in it on account of its size and odd shape, but everything seemed clean and in order. This hotel is well located, with most downtown places being walkable. It also has the advantage of being right on the route of the Airport Bus. There are several restaurants nearby and one of them is rated quite highly in Tripadvisor\u2019s Restaurants listing \u2013 Bin 941 Tapas Parlour on Davie Street (at most 5 mins walk from hotel). It was excellent \u2013 a great atmosphere and good value for money food. I was surprised that it was so busy at 6.30pm on a Wednesday \u2013 a good sign I suppose; we had to wait 20 mins for a table, but were able to have a drink while we waited. It was worth the wait.

Our end of the hotel was clean and quiet, although it is a bit confusing to navigate. There are multiple elevator banks that stop on slightly different levels - sometimes between levels so you still have to walk up or down short flights of stairs to get to/from rooms.

I have stayed in motels with similar furnishings. Typical Holiday Inn. Not a box of kleenex to be found anywhere though! Coffee maker, mini bar, desk, chair, 2 double beds. The standard stuff. We only needed a clean place to crash that night and it worked for that. I couldn't spend a few days there though. There was a cd player in the room, which was a nice touch, but unfortunately I didn't have any cds with me. My daughter wanted to go to the pool, so we went down. You have to take the elevator to floor 2, then walk down about 4 flights of stairs to get to the pool. Not wheelchair friendly at all. The pool is odd - it is up against a wall and they have painted a big whale on it. Its shaped like a lima bean and I didn't find it 'inviting' at all. We are huge swimmers, but I didn't really have the inclination to go in this pool for some reason. My daughter coaxed me in and it was FRIGID! This pool was not heated. Not even close! I don't know if thier heater is broken, or no one goes down all the flights of stairs to use it so they don't bother to heat it, or what...but do not go to this hotel if swimming is a priority! I stayed in for about 3 mins and realized I couldn't feel my feet they were so cold. My daughter's lips were turning blue and we got outta there pretty quick! When we went up to the room we actually had to put the heat on, put warm clothes and socks on, and make tea before we felt warm again. A little later my daughter (who is 11) really wanted to see the kids playroom. She didn't really want to play (she is too old for that), but I think curiousity was getting the better of her. We went there and its just a joke. Its an empty room with a little tikes climber in the middle. All around are old and disgusting toys I wouldn't be letting a small child play with - they looked like someone's garage sale or worse. It reminded me of one of those hospital playrooms they have for kids, only really OLD! We had room service dinner and breakfast and it was really good. Decent sized portions and prices were not too bad for room service. They do have in room movies, but we didn't watch one. Internet is free - which is a huge bonus.

We were looking for a moderately priced hotel that was clean, comfortable, centrally located, with secure parking. We got what we wanted, and we would stay there again. The only challenge we experienced was parking in the entrance area when we arrived and wanted to check in. We arrived in the late afternoon, when several other guests also were arriving. Things were a bit crowded in front of the hotel, but we managed to park in the semi-circular driveway. The reception staff promptly gave my husband a card to operate the automatic gate for the underground parking garage, and the challenge was short-lived. After that, our stay at the Holiday Inn was comfortable. The reception area was pleasant and well supplied with tourist brochures and computer screens that explained Vancouver's tourist attractions. However, we did not avail ourselves of that information, as we were repeat visitors to Vancouver. The hotel is located half a block from Davie Street, on which there are a lot of reasonably priced restaurants. In the other direction it's three blocks from Robson Street, on which there are many shops and restaurants, some moderately priced and some upscale. . We are middle aged, and we had no difficulty in walking to the English Bay Promenade and to Stanley Park and back again. We felt comfortable walking in the vicinity of the hotel both in daylight hours and after dark. The room had two queen-sized beds. It had a television set, a coffee maker, iron and hair dryer. It was air conditioned. Although we did not use it, we noticed that it had an Internet connection. The bathroom had a tub / shower, and it was clean and well appointed. Our room was next to an elevator, and we feared that we might be disturbed by elevator noise. However, we were pleasantly surprised. We did not hear the elevator at all. The curtains were well lined so that they did not let in the morning sunlight. However, there was a little triangular wedge near the top where the curtains did not quite meet. I knew from previous experience that the light coming through that little triangular wedge probably would be enough to waken me early in the morning. I always travel with a clothespin or safety pin for that very reason. However, I found that, if I closed the curtains asymetrically, they closed fully. That is, I did not pull them towards each other in the middle. Rather, I pulled one of the drapes more than half way, and that did the trick. Every morning we found a complimentary copy of the Globe and Mail newspaper outside of our door. The hotel had an onsite restaurant, which we did not use. It had an indoor swimming pool and an exercise room, which we also did not use. We rarely interacted with the reception staff but, when we did, they were friendly and efficient. They checked us in and out promptly, and were quick to order a cab for us when we asked for one. The hotel is not on the waterfront. Our room faced other highrise buildings and, as such, did not have an especially scenic view. That did not bother us. As I mentioned before, we were repeat visitors to Vancouver, and we were looking for a hotel that was clean, comfortable and moderately priced. We actually got more than we were expecting.

The thermostat was hitting 30 degrees celsius (over 86 degrees fahrenheit). We could not get the heat to shut off (we turned it off but could still feel hot air flowing in lightly). We opened the window only to be welcomed with excessively loud traffic noise. After an hour, we left and as we were doing so, I ran into a maid. I asked her for her help and we went back to the room. She didn't know what was going on and said that she would send a maintenance person to check on it while we were out of the room. We came back about 1 1/2 hours later only to be greated with MORE heat. It was nuts. Someone had come in and put the system on high - only to be blowing out more heat full blast! I couldn't take it and called the front desk. A gentleman came up and he explained that the system can only be set on either heat or air conditioning and being that it was \"winter\", it was on heat. He brought in a little fan and stated that with the window open and fan on, it would quickly cool down. About 2 hours later, we went downstairs to eat and ran into this gentleman. He asked how the room was and I told him it was still insanely hot and there was no way I was going to be able to sleep with the window open (our room was right over the lobby on Howe Street). He said that if it was still bad when we went back, he would switch us. Well, an hour later, it was still really hot and stuffy so I went back downstairs and had them switch us into another room (there are 2 towers - adjoining - and this other tower has individual units rather than a central system). Great. They put us on the \"executive\" level. What was so disheartening though is that the second I opened the door to the new room, the overpowering odor of cigarette smoke came upon me. The room was much bigger and it was DEFINITELY cooler - but it absolutely reeked. By this time, it was 8:00 p.m. - I was tired - I had to get up at 4:00 a.m. the next morning anyway and I just resolved myself to knowing that this was not going to be a great stay. The AC was a little noisy, kinda old, but it worked. I had a horrible sleep because I kept waking up feeling like I couldn't breath because the room just had a stale, old, cigarette smell to it. And, yes, it was a \"non smoking\" room. I appreciated them moving me but I would not stay here again. Our meal in the hotel was very reasonable however the staff was a bit flaky. The hostess only gave us one menu and said she'd be back with another one (which took about 6 minutes - and it was NOT busy at all). The waiter didn't tell us the special (we overheard another waitress telling her customers - but this was after we had ordered), and he did not bring out dinner rolls. The other thing that irritated me is that I'm a Priority Club Member and am suppose to receive free room upgrades if they are available. Well, considering they were able to move me into an \"executive room\" because I was hot, this proved to me that this room was available to begin with and I should've been put into it in the first place. So much for being a club member. Lastly, just for anyone who cares, the 2 elevators near the lobby that access the tower with the central system, are very, very, small.

Once we got the okay from his doctor, his fondest wish was to stay at a nice hotel downtown and go swimming in a hotel pool. So, being a travel professional I knew Holiday Inn has a reputation as being kid-friendly. Vancouver is VERY expensive, particularly downtown. I was advised by the reservation clerk that this particular hotel on Howe Street had a pool and kiddie centre and the rate was around $200 a night. When we got there, the first thing that put me off was that it cost hotel guests $11.95 a day to park in the parkade, but the sign out front for other customers was $7.95! It was also nearly impossible to access our room, this place is like an intricate maze, with two elevators and stairs at the end of each hallway, so we actually had to take both elevators and backtrack somehow to get to the room. IF you are in a wheelchair or dragging a luggage cart its a major inconvenience! We were told the pool was on our floor, which is ridiculous. I had to carry my son, who was on crutches, down 3 flights of stairs to get to what I can only describe as the crappiest Holiday Inn pool I have ever seen! To some, (not me!) it may appear esthetically pleasing, its all glass enclosed, and really except for a very small deck with two chairs and a table, there is nowhere to stand let alone sit. Its two stories high sort of remeniscent of a dolphin tank at an aquarium or something, all tiled. 80% of the pool, which is small and round, is 9 feet deep. The rope partitioning the shallow end allowed for minimal frolicing in the shallow end and unless your kids are good swimmers you don't want to send them in 3 meter water with no pool side to grab onto if they get tired. The \"Kid's Centre\" is unsupervised, and consists of a little tykes play structure and some craft materials, not all that impressive either, but it would have sufficed if we could get into the room! Complaints that our key would not open the door fell on deaf ears. Even now, two weeks after our stay there, the Hotel failed to provide any kind of true customer service. The manager phoned me today because she read the negative comments on my survey card, and all she offered to do was take the cost of our dinner off the bill. Additionally she does not see the bigger issue of inaccesibility in the hotel as a problem and that is my real beef. Speaking of dinner in the Hotel restaurant, our service was poor and when we asked about the cakes in the display case we were told they were \"over a week old\" and really gross. Nice! If you are travelling to Vancouver with or without kids, stay away from this place! We ended up at the Ramada Inn at the airport in Richmond and it was superb, for a fraction of the price. The fact it is about 25 minutes from Downtown should not deter you, its definetly a far better place to stay!", "Date": "August 6, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d186795-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Hotel_Suites_Vancouver_Downtown-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$132 - $236*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1110 Howe Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Vancouver</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">British Columbia</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">V6Z1R2</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "186795", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e1/bc/e1bc191f4dd3826e8249826c7c0ad6535large.jpg"}}
