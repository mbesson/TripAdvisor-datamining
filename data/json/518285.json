Although I have stayed in many places the Francis Scott Key Family Resort is my favorite. We have three children spread out in age and there is plenty to do for everyone. The location is convenient for numerous daily adventures. My sons love the shuttle to the boardwalk and my daughter loves to take a ride to the Salisbury Zoo. We enjoy going into Berlin or maybe taking a ride after dinner to see the ponies. It's nice having the outlets right across the way too. Frontier Town is one of my daughters favorite places and my husband loves the Greene Turtle. Even if we just stay on the premises we always have a great time. The outdoor pool is great and the pirate slide area is so nice for small children. We also enjoy the indoor pool and snack area. We loved that you had food this year. Our experience has always been that the rooms are kept well and very clean. Anytime we've needed anything the front desk is always polite and helpful. We always look forward to coming back!

All the positives, the indoor pool and bar, very nice and the hot tub for myself was a bonus. The little water slide is pretty cool as it's just enough for kids to enjoy. The outdoor pool area looked fine and the pirate ship was wonderful. The diner is a great place to eat, food is great and the staff are the same. Now the min goldf course is a nice set up however the greens are torn a bit which affects the ball at times. Definitely needs to be replaced but the layout of the course is good. My room in the Carolina building second floor was good. People could have issues with the beds. I loved the bed, my wife did not and had some back issues for a day but was quickly healed. The grounds look old which is i'm sure is part of the look but at times it could look a little outdated. Overall, very ni8ce place to stay.

We have been at the FSK numerous times in the past and we understand what to expect. This time was so much different, for the first time we stayed in one of the \"NEWLY REMOLDELED FOR 2012 RANCH ROOMS\", if you call a coat of paint, and very old dirty fixtures newly remodeled, then you would be happy here. Upon arrival our room was musty, the door when closed had gaps all around it, numerous screw holes and two sided tape stuck all over, the room was just run down. Then we noticed ants crawling all over our dresser, tv and then on the nightstand. We called the front desk,within minutes someone arrived and sprayed ant killer all over the room. They moved the night stand and found an infinite number of ants under it eating candy that was laying there. They cleaned it up, and just in case left us the can of ant killer if we needed it again of which we needed it continuously. The room was also very noisy due to a construction project right outside our window that went on all weekend. The bathroom had a little pedestal sink, no counter space, no where to put anything and it was very small, I had to go outside to change my mind. The sink and shower had old worn out faucets and a couple of ants too. As for the beds, I do not know what size they are, but they sure are small and close together. Like I said we stayed here in the past and understand that it is a old property, that is out of date, and not very fancy, but this was way beyond that. We will not stay here again, no need to put up with the accommodations.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haddonfield, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAlways a Pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Maria J", "ReviewID": "UR139531989", "Content": "We usually travel here the last weeks of August for a great value.

Definitely just a motel. Average; nothing special.\u201d", "Author": "Brandi S", "ReviewID": "UR139388599", "Content": "We chose the Francis Scott Key Family Resort for our 4-day Labor Day weekend stay because of its high rating (#10) on Trip Advisor among hotels in Ocean City, MD. This was definitely not what we had expected, based on what its website boasts and how highly it was rated on Trip Advisor. We selected a family size suite in one of the \"Ranch\" buildings at the \"resort\", because our daughter is handicapped and these were the buildings that FSK described as \"accessible\". Getting in and out of the room was fine; definitely accessible for those in wheelchairs. The room was NOT what we had expected... 2 full size beds, about 2ft away from each other, and not much space in the room. There's a sleeper sofa also. We never opened it, because I can't imagine how a family could have that open and still have room to walk. There was a nice sized refrigerator in the room, which was a definite plus. The TV was old and fuzzy; the cable was not reliable. There was a DVD player built into the TV, which was a life saver considering the cable was fritzy and barely visible. The bathroom was pretty small for a handicapped accessible bathroom. While there were plenty of safety bars to grab onto, there were no floor treads in the tub and both of our kids slipped multiple times while trying to shower. The shower head was tiny and the water pressure was not so great at all. We were definitely disappointed in the size of the bathroom and the size of the room. For the rate that we paid, we had expected a \"suite\" as it was described. A loud AC unit that gave our entire family sore throats and allergies, a tiny table with two chairs, and a musty room were not our idea of a \"suite\". I'm not sure why they call this place a \"resort\". They talk about their indoor and outdoor water parks on their website, as well as their mini golf. I think people should know what these attractions are REALLY like... The pirate \"sprayground\" was AWESOME. The kids loved it. It had multiple water slides, and all sorts of water attractions like a mushroom and dumping buckets of water. There was a giant pirate ship that the kids could play on and enjoy. This is by far the best, and probably only, attraction of the resort. Everything else, I could've done without. The outdoor pool is just that: a measley pool, that didn't look too inviting. No water slides. No activities for the kids to do by the pool or in the pool. Just an in ground pool with some pool chairs. The mini golf was lousy. It was 18 holes packed into a tiny space, and it was lackluster. The area definitely needs some attention. We all found it to be very boring and mundane. We should have paid the money to go play some exciting mini golf on Coastal Highway. The indoor \"water park\" was a pool with one small water slide about the size of a swing set slide, a hot tub attached, and a few small features within the pool. We were expecting an indoor water park, with many slides. This was a disappointment, for sure. This place is far too expensive for what they offer. It needs many, many upgrades. If you still intend on staying there, don't expect they will vacuum your room. Housekeeping basically comes in, makes the bed with your dirty sheets, replaces your dirty towels with clean ones, and leaves. They didn't vacuum once, clean the toilet or sink or shower/tub, or anything else. I was really disappointed with this also. This is not the type of service we had expected. For almost $700 for 4 nights, we will never stay here again. And we will absolutely not recommend this place to anyone else. It's a waste of money. You're better off paying the same amount to stay on the boardwalk and just enjoy the beach. This is a tiny step up from a motel, and we couldn't wait to leave this grimy place.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBottom line: your kids will love it\u201d", "Author": "Dewey2cats", "ReviewID": "UR139383700", "Content": "This place isn't designed to please a those looking for luxury, updated furniture, or trendy.

They did make note of it and during one of our treks to the room with luggage there was a maid sitting next to it spraying what appeared to be water on it. Then she left never to return. The floor was never cleaned up so we avoided the area at all cost.

The pools... good / great for kids. The pirate ship themed splash zone... great for kids. Mini-golf and playground on the premises... great for kids. Beach volleyball court... nice addition. Free DVD rentals for a pre-bed kid movie in the room... nice perk. The occasional kid-themed activities and nightly movie... nice perk. The shuttle to the boardwalk, while we never used it... nice perk to have available. Good breakfasts at the on-site small diner. Quick walk to Starbucks, grocery stores nearby, all good things. Lunches at the nearby Shrimp Boat and Smokers BBQ Pit were excellent, if you like shrimp and/or BBQ. Cuts the commute to Assateague down a bit as well, where we spent all of our \"beach time\". The price seemed reasonable as well given the time of year and the perks mentioned above. All positives! The only disappointment was the room itself. Clean, I think so. Nothing notable that alarmed us. But it was definitely dated (even though it was touted as \"newly renovated\" or something along those lines when the reservation was made). The bathroom could use an overhaul and fresh paint. The paneling on the walls gave me visions of a 70s or 80s version of \"man cave\". :) There was a \"peeler\"-like utensil in the mini-kitchen that was rusty. Saw more than a handful of ants all over the room at various times, including high up the walls and on the refrigerator. And \"quiet\" wasn't exactly easy to come by at times... one night we could hear every word of prolonged parent / child arguments in adjacent rooms while also hearing the footsteps of people above us. In fairness, our neighbors probably had to deal with our voices anytime we raised them above a normal tone. The tub drained very slowly from day one. All in all, it was certainly more \"favorable\" than not... but I can't help thinking that it wouldn't get an even bigger boost in reputation if they brightened the walls, updated the carpet, painted the bathrooms and updated the tub / shower stall.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pottsville, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "grapplergrl", "ReviewID": "UR136906694", "Content": "FSK is a wonderful resort for children and adults!

Pros: Indoor pool Splash park Friendly staff (the lifegaurds there are really great) 50s diner has FREE donuts :) Kids activities Clean rooms Cons: Small beds Thin walls (you can hear everything) We stayed in an upgraded room w/ kitchenette (New York) on the first floor and me and my husband could barely sleep because of the loud stomping above us. It would have been nice for things to be quieter (or even if quiet hours would start at 10pm instead of 11pm). There was also a really loud creaking sound that would follow for 30 seconds after the people above us would run the water or flush the toilet. I think there was an issue with the pipes. On Friday, the power went out in our building for about 8 hours at night and while the front desk was friendly they didn't have many details on what occured or how long the outage would last. We have two boys aged 7 and 2 and were worried when the temperature started to rise in the room. The rooms were very clean just smaller than what we are used to. That being said It was not all bad. Since we were on vacation we didn't spend a whole lot of time in our room. What I will say is that I really appreciated the nice staff and all of the wonderful activities they have for children. My children loved all the water activities- they even had an indoor pool word search. It really saves money because we didn't need to pay to go to a waterpark this year as the kids just wanted to stay at FSK the entire time. Plus there is free fishing with rods and bait provided. Me and my husband also met some other families while playing volleyball in the pool.

It is a complete family environment with family friendly amenities and fantastic customer service. My family of 6 stayed at FSK 4/6-4/10. We were booked in the PA building which turned out to be ideal for us as it faced the quad containing the basketball court, laundry facilities, and small playground. I could attend to my infant in our room while viewing my older children (10,9, and 6) through the window. It was nice being close to the laundry room too. The laundry building was small but was clean and met our needs. I can imagine that it might not have enough washer/dryer units available during summer. Our room itself (2dbls w/pullout sofa)was just large enough not to feel like sardines while we settled in for the night. It was a clean, no frills room. The room was not updated but I did not reduce my rating based on the fact that the resort is in process of updating and without an updated room it is still a great value. We were fortunate to have beautiful weather during out time in Ocean City but it was great knowing we could use the indoor pool as a fall back. For my children, the absolute best part of our vacation was the indoor pool. They wanted to swim everyday all day. I was impressed by the size of the pool. More so, I was impressed that goggles,beach balls, life jackets, and towels were all provided on site. We did not take advantage of the free movie or on site mini golf. The outdoor pool, pirate ship, and diner were not yet open for the season. Still, we felt we got more than our money's worth at FSK.

My children love this place, I just wish that I could. We were okay with it in 2011 but thought it a little dirty. This year didn't go as well. I held off my review for a couple of weeks because I thought the hotel might contact me over the survey I filled out including all my information. That isn't happening so here goes. The rooms have paper thin walls, that is true and in several reviews I read. The problem is also that the stairs are wooden and so is the deck outside the rooms. The sound is LOUD when someone walks by. My son was sleeping in the sleep chair in front of the window and was woken up several times. We knew this problem from last year so we brought a sound machine to try to mask the noise. It didn't help. That sound of clomping on the wood just cuts through everything. The rooms are large enough, and like I said ours had a chair that folded out into a single bed. Great for kids that don't want to share a bed. The down side would be that they aren't terribly clean. Ours had indoor outdoor carpet which is a different texture. Due to that there were several places that had things smashed into the carpet. Vacuuming obviously wasn't going to get that out, but obviously no one was going to do anything else since the stuff stayed there. And speaking of vacuuming they don't vacuum the rooms daily. Our carpet was a mess on day 2 and the maid took about 10 minutes in our room (I was outside waiting to lay down as I had a headache) but she never vacuumed. She also left her cleaning supplies in our kitchen, I don't know if she used them. No one came to retrieve them and since maid service ends at 3pm and she didn't get to our room until about 2:40 we figured she was done for the day. Another problem is lighting. If you don't light the room well it doesn't hide the dirt. The lighting was especially poor in the vanity area, try putting on makeup in the semi dark. That being said we get to the bathroom. I went to use it when we got there and realized that someone had used it before me. Completely gross! Realizing that the front desk was probably going to do nothing but flush that's what I did and didn't bother them. But later I was wondering if our room had even been cleaned, if it was how did that get there? But even better was after flushing the toilet had stains in it. Come on, who wants stains in a motel toilet. Next we get to the beds which are tempurpedic and that's nice. The sheets on the other hand are a streaky beige color. I'm not saying that they aren't clean, but they definitely are not white and they are not a dyed beige. I came upon the answer to this washing my hands with hot water in the bathroom sink that drains slow. The hot water is brown. I don't know why, my husband says the pipes are corroding and that's okay and natural. Maybe I'm sensitive but I don't want my water to be brown. But on the other hand at least I knew the sheets weren't really dirty. The amenities are nice here and that's why my kids love this place. We come too early for the splash playground and outdoor pool but they look okay. The indoor pool is a kind of playground which my kids love. The lifeguards are attentive, and it's good they have lifeguards because we've been places that haven't. They have movies you can rent for free at the front and games also. The rooms have DVD players. There is free mini golf, which is great. The problem is the course is old and damaged, most holes have the 'green' missing in parts and pulling up. The wood under the holes is warped so the balls will go off in odd directions. On the other hand the 'buildings' in the course had been freshly painted. It was an odd mix. I really want to like this place because my kids do but for me it just doesn't stack up. It's priced reasonably but I don't like staying somewhere that is dirty. It's family owned and they promote that. I just wish the family would take a bit better care with it.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pine Grove, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for kids/grandkids!!!\u201d", "Author": "irishgirl2958", "ReviewID": "UR129428251", "Content": "My husband and I have taken our grandson here every year since 2005.

The staff here was very friendly and accommodating. Even though this was off season there were still plenty of things to do with the kids. In fact I traveled by myself with my 7 year old twins and I found this resort very relaxing. The indoor pool was a great addition and given the water was only 4 feet I did not have to be in the pool to keep a careful watch over them. I could easily see what they were doing no matter where I sat. The only problem I found with this pool was there was so much chlorine that my daughter and I both developed very bad headaches after sitting in there for a couple of hours. The next time I will put a limit on how long we stay in that indoor pool area. The rooms were clean but even though they were updated in 2010 because we stayed in New Jersey's rooms, they still left something to be desired. I had a problem with spiders and stink bugs in the room. The walls are on the thin side so be prepared to hear all of your neighbors noises. Other than that the room was comfortable. We also enjoyed the movies that were showed every evening at 8:00 with the complimentary movie theater popcorn. Although we brought our food with us, in walking distance across the street there were many inexpensive fast food restaurants. My kids did not want to leave and said it was their best trip ever; they too have been to many, many islands and Disney World so that tells you a lot.

We venture to OC twice a year - usually Spring Break and Summer just before school begins. During the spring we like to stay on the boardwalk because it is not crowded and we love to walk alot. But during the summer, we love the FSK for several reasons: the rooms are spacious and clean, plenty of parking, lots of activities for kids of all ages, free shuttle to the boardwalk, etc... Our teens love the shuttle service, and since they have cells phones, we let them travel as a group and they love the freedom! The pool does get crowded at times and the room has an echo, but we let the children decided if they feel comfortable staying or choosing another activity. Lots of room for bikes and skateboards, too. The guest laundry is in the same building with the pool, so I can do our laundry before we go home while the kids are swimming. The exercise room is right there, also. The restaurant in the main bldg. is cool - a 50's theme, and our son loves the cartoons at the table (dvd player looping). The proximity to the shopping center, restaurants, gas station, and other amusements is great - withing walking distance. The kids love walking to Baja Amusements and allow us to tag along with $$ - we are so lucky... Mione's has the best pizza ever! The only negative thing I can say is a few years ago we stayed in May when the car cruisers were in town and taking up the parking, etc. One or two inconsiderate cruisers revved up their extremely loud and annoying engines late at night and early in the morning, which caused me a few headaches (I really need some peace from 12AM-6AM... silly me...).

I guess we should have known it could not top our last experience. For those that haven't read my previous review, check it out. Once again the room was neat and clean, this time we opted for a full kitchen so we could do some of our own meals. Check in was a breeze and the property is clean with lots to do. Unfortunately lots of other peeps had the same plan. The hotel was packed with some loud and rowdys. The pool was over crowded and some of the kids were really rough. My son got hurt twice and the kids didn't really have any room to swim around. Last year I couldn't get them out of the pool, this week they were done after about and hour or so. We couldn't get a table to sit at and chairs were scarce as well. Clean towels were readily available and the life guards were nice and courteous. Our second day we had a nice lunch by the lake and fed the geese and turtles, the kids loved that. The pool once again was over crowded and wifi wasn't working, at least not for my kindle fire. Our last night we couldn't even find a parking space near our room and cable died in the middle of a movie we were watching. On the up side, they offered several family movie times with free popcorn but we were not able to attend any of them. We did get a free movie rental of the new Smurfs movie and each room has a DVD player. The beds are comfy with lots of pillows. Rooms are clean and smelled fine (I've read reviews that the rooms were musty but ours was fine). We played the free mini golf course and played volley ball in their sanded volley ball court. There is also a nice play area and picnic/grilling area. The lake is quiet and peaceful and there is an area for kids to ride their bikes. I guess it is good for them that it was so busy but they just don't have the pool space to accommodate a full hotel. My suggestion would be to expand the indoor pool area so there could be more pool space and more seating, maybe some more slides and toys. Our second day, they had removed the floating toys so there was nothing but the dumping water and small slide. The pool is really geared to young ones, upgrading would keep my 8 and 11 year old happier. Their favorite thing about the pool last year was the snake in the middle that they spent hours climbing on, swimming under, over, around... This time it was some fake logs and they couldn't get close to it there were so many kids and then it was gone, probably to make space for all the peeps.

It is nice to have trees and picnic areas around and not be in a concrete jungle but yet you can walk to Dumser's for ice cream, restaurants, shopping, etc. It is also near some big go -cart tracks (closed for the season now though). The one downside was that there was one loud room of people (laughing and carrying on - not being crude or anything) the first night; it wasn't very sound-proof, otherwise a very relaxing time. All of the kids had a great time and want to go back, ages 6 - 13. I'd go back too. The 50's diner looked cool but it was closed because of being \"off season\".", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThe Kids Didn't Want To Go Home!\u201d", "Author": "HopCop2006", "ReviewID": "UR122336369", "Content": "The last time I visited the Ocean City area was over 20 years ago before I had kids so when I searched the internet for family friendly accommodations and found Francis Scott Key Family Resort I was pleasantly surprised by their informative website! Any questions I still had were answered over the phone by very friendly staff. We booked a kitchenette room in the New York building since we had a family of six and found the room to be very clean. The mattress topper for the sleeper sofa was a great plus! The TemperPedic double beds were very comfortable- perfect since we have them at home too. The heater worked wonderfully- almost too well since it was unseasonably warm this week- no problem since we could adjust the temp with a press of a button! We didn't tell the kids about the pirate-themed indoor pool and BOY were they SURPRISED! It was just the right size and had just the right amount of built-in fun for our four kids ages 2 through 9! I was worried at first that our room wasn't close enough to the indoor pool but it wasn't far at all! We just brought a change of dry clothes and used the locker/changing areas before taking a short walk back to our room. Having PLENTY of clean dry towels made available to guests at the pool was a 5 star plus! During our stay we made use of the arcade, pond (tip: wild geese are not keen on being fed by kids- they just fly away!), playground, basketball court (I think you can borrow a ball from the front desk if you forget to bring your own), and mini golf course! (get putters and golfballs from the front desk- for free!) My older two kids loved being able to watch a family movie with free popcorn at night in the comfy family room next to the front desk area. We liked that room so much we even came back the next day and brought our own board game and my son made a new friend when he invited another kid to join the game! Even though the 50's themed-diner was closed for the season, there were tons of dining options nearby and of course, in downtown OC. With the kitchenette in our room we even had our own spaghetti night- luckily we brought our own very large pot- though the kitchenette was fully stocked with everything else!) A Royal Farms convenience store is just a short walk away as is the outlet mall across Route 50! I'm looking forward to returning with my family again next year....I'm even checking the kids' school calendar to see when they'll be off again so we can stay longer!

We thought about driving to Disney World or one of the indoor water park resorts a little closer to home. I stumbled upon this place searching the internet for something fun, closer and cheaper than those options. Friends and family asked where we were staying and what street the hotel was on in Ocean City, they were concerned when I told them we were staying at a motel just outside of Ocean City. When we got close my husband thought it would be funny to take a picture of a dive motel down the street to send home to our family as a prank. Once that was done we continued on to the Francis Scott Key Family Resort. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was in the Florida building on the top floor close to the indoor pool as I had requested. The room was clean and we could tell it had been remodeled recently. There were plenty of towels and pillows. We were excited to try out the TemperPedic mattresses since were had recently thought about buying one. There was even one to lay over the pull out section of the chair. The kitchen had everything we could have needed to make meals, but all we used it for was the refrigerator to hold our take out containers. The lighting was a little dark as I read in a previous review and the blinds were pretty but let a lot of light in from the light fixture outside the door. For us it was a good night light. The stairs going up to the room need to be repainted but that was the only thing we found to be in need of maintenance. Indoor Pool: This was the best part of our trip. We wanted somewhere to just hang out and spend some relaxing time together as a family and this was perfect. The pool had plenty of fun for all the boys volleyball, the slide, dumping buckets and the snake to climb on. The pool went from about 2ft to 4ft with plenty of room to play. My husband and I enjoyed the hot tub a little bit but the boys were disappointed that they couldn't go in especially since we have one at home, but they understood. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. Our boys played in the pool for several hours all three days we were there. They also had a nice clean locker room, arcade, laundry and fitness room. Outside: It was too cold to do anything outside but I was able to check it out when I went for a little jog around the property. They have an outdoor pool and a pirate ship with slides and dumping buckets etc to get wet. The miniature golf course and sand volleyball looked well maintained. There was also a pavilion with picnic tables and grills and a pond with lots of geese. The 50s style restaurant was closed for the season, but the menu looked tasty. They also have shuttles to the beach that run in season. The resort is just outside of OC right before you go across the bridge. Activities: They had movies and popcorn each afternoon and evening which we didn't make it too since one of our boys wasn't feeling well the night we were going to go, but we were able to borrow a movie from the front desk to watch in the room. There are lots of restaurants, shopping and things to do within walking distance. I could imagine that this resort might get busy and loud in the summer months with all the kids running around having tons of fun, but I would definitely recommend this resort and already have to friends.

The staff is so friendly- the lifeguards at the indoor pool are very attentive and care about their job- and all the staff are wonderful with interacting with the children whether it be at a pool, fishing pond, craft table, movie night, etc. Despite what some others are saying, the pools are a great size, the pirate ship is awesome for kids, mini golf is great, the calendar of activities for the families are awesome, the game rentals/DVD rentals are free and there is a good variety, staff, room cleanliness, etc is all fabulous. I would not change a thing about our previous stays at FSK and we plan on staying there for years to come, in our same vacation house even after our kids are grown.

Our family of four stayed in the Flordia section of the resort. Rooms were perfect for us. Had the kitchette which came in really handy since we have two small boys who are either always hungry or thirsty. Couple of notes. Pools-there are two pools and 1 pirate play area. Be mindful of the pirate area as there is no staff supervision whatsoever so be prepared for a lot of older kids horsing around and making the little ones a little uncomfortable. The other two pools were great. Indoor pool shows nightly movies which was nice plus there are so many things going on in the indoor pool (water slide, bucket drops, kiddie areas), that there is something for everyone. Outdoor pool is nice to. Food-we ate at the diner for breakfast on both days. Very reasonable priced and not bad. You can also get it to go if you want and if your staying at the resort, you get like 10% off. Shuttle service-highly recommend the shuttle. Took it to the boardwalk and it was a smooth ride. No trying to find a parking spot at the inlet or quarters for meters. Runs in a constant loop so your never waiting more than 5-10 minutes at either the resort or downtown OC. Other items-there is other stuff such as free mini-golf, free fishing pole rentals, playground, basketball, and a lot of other amenties that I'm sure I'm forgetting.

We decided kind of last minute that we needed to get away as a family just the four of us. Something we never do! So I inquired on OCMD's facebook page about where we should stay. Several people said FSK if we have small children. Our boys are 3 and 5 and FSK was perfect for them. I'll start with negatives. The reservation process online was tricky as it said there were rooms but wouldn't let me book one. Then I called and they said they had nothing then the next day I tried online again just for kicks and it went through! So I canceled a reservation with another hotel and went with FSK based on the good reviews and recommendation. The room we had in the Carolina building definitely showed it needed updating. Cracks in the sink, some minor stains on carpet. etc. In the room the TV reception was awful but when my husband looked at the wire he was able to fix it enough so the kids could watch TV and we didn't have to be bothered with maintenance people coming in and out. For two of the mornings we had very loud neighbors. I like to think I sleep pretty sound but 3 of 4 of us were woken to a woman carrying on a very loud conversation on the steps outside of our room at 7:30 am. Again I am not one to complain but was very close to it. We are on vacation to get our rest. This was NOT fsk's fault but I guess the wall's are pretty thin and some of the clientele didn't have the same respect for others that I like to think we had for them. Now on to the good. We LOVED the shuttle service it is soooo easy. You just load your beach stuff in the back and they drop you off right before the boardwalk starts. We never waited more than 10 minutes for another shuttle. Most of the drivers are very friendly and make you feel very comfortable. One we really liked and he gave us restaurant recommendations. The kids loved the sprayground and indoor pool. I loved the beds. I also liked the option of a pool bar and the outdoor pool being open til 10. I was a little disappointed that the restaurant changed hours right before we got there I really wanted to try their shakes and burgers but I wasn't willing to trade beach time for it. We had breakfast there one day and it was OK. The donuts and table TV's were a great touch. Overall this was a great trip and I truly think we will be back.

They offered mini golf, volleyball, and a great deal of activities all designed for any age. The lounge was very nice and well kept, as were the other things offered. I can see however, why some of the reviews that sometimes questioned the cleanliness came into play. There are something's that you cannot miss on as far as sleeping arrangments go. Cleanliness of the sheets is one of them. We weren't expecting the Ritz, by any means. But, after the first night there, we took the blankets off the beds that we slept on and the set of sheets that was on one of the beds were absolutely filthy. And I don't mean crumbs or anything like that, I mean stained, discolored with big stained blotches on 30-40 % of the sheet. We called and have this quickly rectified, but still, on something like that, you cannot be wrong with cleanliness of bedsheets if you are a hotel, in my opinion. Also, be warned that if you are going here, the wireless capabilities there are inconsistent at best. A good part of the time I had trouble getting on and staying on, which I get it, you're on vacation, you shouldn't be checking email anyway! But, if you go with an idea of trudging through work emails while your kids nap, be ready to be frustrated a little. The signal strength in the room we were in was less than average. Overall, however, we were very happy with the resort. The people there were very nice and accomodating. The person who cleaned our room everyday would create a new towel animal for us to find after cleaning the room, which my kids absolutely loved. The place is literally a 5 minute drive to the beach and boardwalk area, and overall was well maintained and taken care of.

We love the kitchenette for making lunches to take to the beach! Our room was clean and no bugs as other people mentioned. Each day our housekeeper greeted us politely and gave us anything we needed. Our first day we noticed the tub drained very slowly and there was standing water while shower. A call to the front desk and the problem was resolved that same night! Our children love the pools and the pirate splash zone. The shuttle is always timely and the drivers friendly and helpful as well. Love the adult drinks at the pool bar, especially the dirty banana! We love that we can spend our entire last day enjoying the amenities of the hotel even after checkout. Each year we shower in the pool locker rooms before leaving for the day. It is large and clean and makes for a more enjoyable (clean) ride home! My only real complaint would be hair at the pools. I think a better (daily) job of cleaning hair out of the pools and from around the indoor pool deck can be done. Also, even though this hotel has 'quiet hours', which begin at 11pm, I am amazed at the number of families that are so loud in the 10-11 hour. We have small children who were trying to fall asleep between 9-10 and families would come back to the resort screaming and running up and down the halls. Not the fault of the hotel though.

My only suggestions is the hotel needs signs to know where you can 'check in' and maybe some signs to tell you were the pools are located.

Our toaster broke the first morning we were there so I called the front desk and within 10 minutes we had a new toaster delivered to the room, no questions asked. I was impressed at how quick they arrived with it. All rooms are non-smoking, but they do have smoking area's outside, on the end of the buildings. For being a family resort, where there are young children, our room was very quiet. We stayed on the upper floor of the building, so maybe this helped. We are a family of 4 and the rooms are a little snug for 4 people and their luggage, but you don't spend much time in your room when on vacation. Both beds are only Full size, and there really wouldn't be room for a queen size in the room. Beds are very comfortable and are memory foam. Internet service is provided free, but is terrible. We couldn't get on the net 2 of the days. I guess they haven't had a chance to get it up to speed yet. The old big bulky TV's were changed out to nice flat screens sometime between last season and this one. Our housekeeper Marta was fabulous and always had the room tip top and clean. Even the beach sand was always cleaned up when we would arrive back to our room in the evenings. Had a special animal made from towels on our bed each day she cleaned Shower seemed a little snug. They could put the rounded shower curtain rods in, and would make a huge difference in the shower roominess.. The shower curtains kept hitting our body while showering. I am just use to shower doors at our house. Free shuttle service is provided from the resort and drops you off 12 block from the boardwalk. Only drawback to this is that they stop running at 10pm, and should really consider extending the time until 11pm. Laundry facilities are available, and are clean. We took advantage of this a couple nights while the kids were swimming. They are located in the same building, so this is very convienent Onsite Cafe Route 50 Diner is a great value for quick meals. Our kids loved the indoor pirate pool We didn't meet a staff member who wasn't friendly or smiling. It rained one night during our stay, and they had free DVD movies that you could check out and take to your room. They also had a free movies and popcorn in the main building. We didn't take advantage of, so I don't know how good they are, but they have free onsite putt putt golf, volley ball nets, pirate ship outdoor splash area for little ones, outdoor pool, fishing pond, and picnic pavillion Outdoor car vac for only 25cents and it works great on removing the beach sand. The grounds are clean. I watched a young man 2 or 3 morning going around picking up litter. Security walks and drives the grounds very often.

I've been wanting to try this \"resort\" for awhile now, but after reading some negative reviews I was hesitant to make a reservation. I showed up in person instead and asked the manager if I could see a room, and asked for the rate. The quote was higher by quite a bit than I had seen on their website just hours before arriving. When I pointed this out, I was told that there is a 10% discount online. I explained that I wanted to see the facilities before reserving since they have a negative online reputation, especially for cleanliness. If you read the other reviews here, you will see that for the negative, management will respond they handled it,but no detail. For the good reviews, she has plenty to say. Now, in my mind, this was an an opportunity for them to earn my business by saying well, please check it out, and we'll honor that price. In this economy, who would lose a customer over 10%? Well, FSK resort would!!! She gave me a key, but no offer of reducing the rate, and when we went into the room, the smell of cleaner and chemicals nearly knocked us out. This was a renovated room! We actually had to leave the door open to tolerate it. This \"resort\" is essentially a trailer park. There were ramshackle buildings with people standing around smoking in all the common areas, not only the \"designated\" ones. The indoor pool area is VERY small. The pirate slides are short,for only the youngest of children. And on top of it all, the buildings are priced higher the closer they are to these prime areas, but there is free parking at all of them, so why pay more? So, we go back and I walk in to return the key, and say that we are going to pass, and that I certainly wouldn't pay a premium to stay there because I didn't book online, when it is the same room, same day, and the reason I didn't is their bad reputation. I get a shoulder shrug and and the manager simply said \"Ok\". ***IF YOU ARE A FAMILY GOING TO O.C. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ATLANTIC HOTEL ON SOMERSET. This hotel is where we ended up staying. We walked in, no reservation, got a room that was a whole 15 steps to the boardwalk (we counted) and after telling them about FSK, they offered beat that internet rate I was denied at FSK by 20.00 to get my business!!! Not only that it was impeccably clean, with a deck overlooking the Ripleys museum. Sparkling clean pool as well. Listen, the bottom line is this - you can go to Francis Scott Key and spend more, be far from all the action, either pay to park and have to drive/take the FSK shuttle (which we saw picking up/dropping people and was so small they could only take about 8 at a time,so the waits were more an hour than 20-25 minutes) and also have a painfully small room, albeit remodeled AKA new bedspreads , OR you can stay at the Atlantic, have a clean, cheap room, and come and go as you please with their free reserved parking and simply walk out the door onto the boards.

Free internet. Even have 2 computers for you to use. 5. Free DVD's to watch. Now the Cons: 1. When you arrive they make you sign a form stating no refunds under any circumstances. They do this for a reason as you will more then likely want one. 2. My wife and daughter ( only 7) were at the playground when another tenanat pulled up beside the park, got out of his truck and began urinating beside his truck in the parking lot. This was on the side where kids were playing and in view of my wife and daughter. Reported it to staff. They confronted the man, he admitted it and they said \" we will make a note of this in his file\". WHAT. No call to the police as it is a crime, no telling the man to leave the property. no nothing. we were appaled especially as we were told they could make you leave at anytime no questions asked. but a gut pisses in front of my wife and children and he gets his hand slapped. 3. The indoor pool. Umm was gross. Found muliple piles of hair on the outside and piles of hair floating in the pool. 4. The room. Bathroom was very very small. No sink in bathroom. And we found a few ants in the room. No sense advising staff as I am sure the ants would have only got a warning. 5. Is it not strange upon check out the staff does not even ask how your stay was? I think they already know it was not good. 6. You get what you pay for as far as the quality of other tenants. Poor manners does not do just to the way other people and there children behave. We did get to witness a argument / fight at the pool as one womans kid kept dunking other kids and holding them under the water and even kicked another kid. One boy sruggled for air. Did he get asked to leave by the lifeguards NO. Summing up. I would never stay at this place again nor tell anyone to. I have submitted my review and will do my best to spread my experience to everyone I can through review sites and facebook as well as word of mouth.

We stayed for the 1st time on New Years Eve 2010--just one night-- and were drawn by the Caribbean indoor pool. The woman at check-in was friendly, and helpful in guiding us to local restaurants. Our room was in the Florida building, cozy and dated in decor but clean and well-equipped. The mattress was a new Tempure-pedic. We stayed only one night & didn't use the kitchenette, but it appeared to be well stocked with cookware, utensils and full-size fridge and small dining table/area. The indoor pool was located next to the Florida building with a short walk outside and had an arcade & vending machines. The pool was very busy but had plenty of lounge chairs and tables and the kids had a blast! The water was clean and the air was actually breathable (as opposed to some other indoor pools where the chlorine burns you eyes) and was lifeguard-staffed our entire visit. There was a hot-tub, small water slide, volleyball net and other water attractions and the pool decor was very welcoming. The only minor complaints during our visit would be: alot of light comes thru the blinds at night, the room was very warm (the heat worked too well & we just couldn't get the temp down enough to be comfortable) and it was noisy--FSK has \"quiet time\" posted in the rule book but being New Years Eve, I don't think it was enforced. We would definitely stay here again & recommend; the property appeared well-maintained, had outside pool and sprayground, a picnic pavilion, a restaurant on-site & whole bunch of other amenities we weren't able to use because of being off-season. It seems very family-friendly and there are a variety of places to eat & shop in close driving distance.

The biggest perk of course was the awesome indoor pool! The pool was clean and it was a lot of fun for our daughter, with a big waterslide, a huge snake to sit on, a kiddie pool section with a whale with a spout that spouted water...so cute. They offered plenty of beach chairs, towels, and life jackets for kids all at no extra charge. Other great no charge perks were free DVD and game rentals for your room, an outdoor pool and mini golf course and a pirate \"splash\" playground (we weren't able to use these because of the rainy weather). There is a 50's style diner that is open during high season which wasn't open when we were there. Also, during high season there are shuttles to the beach. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. A couple of drawbacks were the room: we paid extra to be assigned to a \"newly renovated\" room but upon entering it was very difficult to see what was renovated? The room was very clean but there was a rusty cord in the shower and around the tub and it just seemed a bit outdated to be renovated. The bathroom tile was cracked and the ceiling fan had no cover. The TV was an old style tube TV and was pretty small for the very few times we turned it on. Watching a widescreen movie was easier on a laptop at that point. The room also had a musty smell which might be attributed to the carpeting and people coming from the beach and pool. I can understand placing carpet for safety reasons so kids don't slip and fall but I might suggest something being placed in the room (like carbon odor neutralizers) to help mask the odor--the odor was NOT unbearable but it was noticeable. The memory foam mattresses were very comfy! One other suggestion we have for parents is to hold on to your pool bracelets for dear life! Upon check in the girl at reception gave us the bracelets for admission to the pool (no extra charge but they check that you have them so you can go in), and said it was \"no big deal if we lose them, we can just let them know and they'll replace them\". So we failed to read in the fine print that they gave us that if a bracelet was stolen or missing it would be 10 dollars to replace them. We cut our bracelets off and left them in the room and housekeeping must've thought they were trash. When we went up to reception to get a replacement we were surprised to find out we needed to pay 10$ for new bracelets. So please read the fine print! We wish that had been explained to us better.

I can deal with alot of roadblocks on vacations but bugs in my room is not one of them. We even checked around for another place but nothing had any vacancy. So my sister call FSK and spoke to one of the owners about our concerns who assured us that we would not have a problem and I'm happy to say that she was right. Our room was very clean and I didn't see one bug-- not even an ant, during our entire stay (we stayed in the remodled New Jersey building). The rooms are far from fancy but I'd read enough on tripadvisor to know that ahead of time and we were ok with that. We were there for the pools and splashpad and were not disappointed. The ages of the kids in our group were 2, 7 and 10 and they all had a GREAT time enjoying all of those things. Considering the amount of kids there, I was happy to find the pools clean and most often not overcrowded (til saturday night but that's to be expected I think) and little details like fresh towels available. The diner there was cute but we got a bad waitress- she was nice but horribly lacking in experience- our whole section was being grossly neglected and breakfast took forever to get through. There was a male waiter who seemed to be much better; I wish we'd had him. My only complaint has nothing to do with the motel itself- I just hated where it was. Unfortunately that part of OC seems to attract a partcularly redneck-y crowd. I was awake both nights around midnight-1am listening to arguing and cursing loudly and even at the pool during the day had to listen to other patrons jovially but loudly calling each other certain slurs that I'd rather not have to hear on vacation. But that seems to be the crowd, as alot of that is on the boardwalk too. In all fairness, I could have called the front desk and maybe they'd have remedied the late night situation but it wasn't really worth it to me. The beach there on the southern end is gross too- dirtier and much more crowded than farther north, where I've stayed on other occasions. But this will come as no surprise to anyone who has stayed in southern OC, I would think. We did spend our last day at Assateague which I hadn't realized is only 12 minutes from the resort, and it was wonderful. I wish we'd gone there the day before as well. As I stated my complaints were more about southern OC and not the resort but I wanted to mention it.

Pirate ship spray park was great for little kids, but my 10 year old also spent several hours their and enjoyed it.

Only real inconvenience we ran into was the slow internet connection which was almost unusable between 10 - 11 pm. We worked around that by hitting the vending machines after 10 and I loved the frozen milky ways! Laundry was very clean, convenient and VERY affordable.

I think if anything they should've offered us even a free meal at the 50's diner for the inconvenience or something but they were non apologetic.

However, if you are looking for fun on your vacation, it's not the place to go, and if you are with a group of adults, go somewhere else. My family was constantly reported as making too much noise. The problem is, they welcomed my family reunion of over 60 people to their motel, but placed us all on the second floor. We had nearly 30 children in total. They placed us over top other guests who were there with their babies and small families, and then complained to us that we were too noisy. What they neglected to acknowledge is that balcony floors are hollow, and therefore, just walking regularly sounded as if we were jumping up and down. My 2 year old, 25 pound granddaughter sounded like she weighed 150 pounds whenever she'd run around. The walls are thin so regular everyday sounds, coming from 60+ people, sounded far worse than they were. Sometimes people reported that we were making noise when we weren't even there. We had to have a conversation with the owner in which she acknowledged that perhaps there was an intolerance by the other guests for our large group. My group was not perfect - far from it. In fact, one person in our group got drunk and was taken to jail. I felt extremely embarrassed. The people in our group that were staying in the same building as the drunk were all kicked out as a result. As disappointed as I was, I had no hard feelings until the following night, I was accosted by a group of drunken FSK guests in which they accused me of hitting their car when I had come no where near their car. FSK security came and pointed out to the drunks that it was obvious no accident had occured. But the drunks insisted on calling the police on me. It was so distressing for me to be accused and accosted by a group of drunken men and women screaming at me about something that did not occur, yet the following morning, they were not kicked out of the hotel. Makes me wonder. Next year, we will gladly give our money to a place that is built to handle real people on vacation with children, who are fair to all guests, and who have enough commonsense not to place a group of 60 over top someone's head knowing the structure of the building is poor.

The staff was helpful and courteous and the cleaning staff did a terrific job every day, going above and beyond what we've normally experienced at a hotel (e.g. washing all our dirty dishes and pans).

The resort had a lot to offer. An indoor pool w/ slide, jacuzzi, and kiddie pool, outdoor pool with kiddie pool, and pirate sprayground were all big hits with our daughter. She had a blast. It was nice to have so much to do on-site. When we wanted to hit the beach or boardwalk, shuttles ran constantly and that was a big plus not to have to deal with driving and parking. On nights our daughter was exhausted we would just stay at the resort and walk to the main building for ice cream at the route 50 diner and borrow a movie from the front desk. They had puzzles and games for my daughter to play with while my husband used the internet on the computer for guest use. We stayed in a renovated room that was kept very clean. We even got some towel art from the maid service. A free crib was provided at our request. My gripes with the accomodations would be the poor water pressure and the paper thin walls....which leads me to my complaints... NOISE!!!! Oh my goodness, you can hear EVERYTHING in your room. You can hear your neighbors and all of the outside noise quite well. Quiet hours start a bit late for my taste (11 pm)...but I may be in the minority there as not everyone is travelling with a one year old. However, we had a few issues with past-quiet hour noise. The building across from hours had a large group that appeared to take up the entire top floor and they were LOUD. At midnight they were still keeping me up so I called the front desk to complain. The noise never subsided and I slept with a pillow on my head. I went to complain in person the next morning and was told it would not be a problem again. I was pleasantly surprised to not have any issues that night, however, by that point we were sleeping with my daughter's white noise machine turned all the way up and leaving the TV on all night. The next night the screaming was so loud at 2 am that they woke up my one year old. My husband called the front and was told the police were coming. By the time I got my daughter back to sleep (45 minutes later) it was silent. The next day the entire group in the other building was gone. After that the nights were quieter...though we still utilized all of our white noise methods to drown out noises such as car doors and the baby crying in the neighboring room. My other gripe also involves the other guests. We often ran into problems of unsupervised children...mostly at the outdoor pool. No one from the resort monitors the pool and the signs posted that children be accompanied by an adult go ignored. I can't tell you how many times the one foot baby pool was full of rowdy unsupervised (!!!) 6 year olds that splashed water everywhere and took my daughter's toys. I was constantly parenting other people's children and scolding them for harassing my one year old! It was unbelievable. I couldn't really enjoy my time with her because I was trying to keep some other person's child from dumping water on her head or dealing with 50 requests of \"watch me put my head under the water!\" We didn't run into this as much at the indoor pool, which you need your room key card to get into and has two life guards. I'm not sure why the outdoor pools don't have the same procedure? At least some sort of attendent to make sure children are supervised and to keep older children out of the baby pool. Although I loved the resort's amenities and found the staff to be generally courteous and helpful, I don't think we'll return. The sleepless nights and having to parent kids that aren't mine was a bit much for me.

The back part of our room had the bathroom to the left, but only a toilet and bathtub. The sink was outside the bathroom and around a little corner like a changing area that you couldnt see from the rest of the room. I can see their point in doing this so someone can use the mirror /sink while someone else is in the shower,but at the same time they should at least have a little curtain or sliding door between the bathroom and sink area so if you want to walk from the bathroom to the sink area to get dressed noone in the room can see you. It's not far from the boardwalk at all, maybe about a mile. Not far from the Walmart or grocery store either. I loved staying here and would do it again. Just keep in mind when you go the beach you will have to pay for parking since you're not staying at any of the hotels on the boardwalk.

It appeared the carpet and furniture may have been new, but nothing else in the room appeared to be remodeled. Our shower had very poor water pressure no matter the time of day and did not even have a curved curtain rod. Our first full day was July 4th and traffic on US 50 in front of the hotel was bumber to bumper all day, so we stayed at the hotel most of the day. The indoor water park was ok. It has one small slides, a baby area and a permanent volleyball net. There are varying degrees of deepness and FSK provides life guards and life preservers. It was nice to be indoors, but the pool was far from a 'water park'. My kids really enjoyed the sprayground with the pirate ship. I don't think the price was a value for the type of room we were booked into or the amenities. The Route 50 diner was nice to go to one time, as the prices were no better than going to somewhere off property. There is a Starbucks, Carabbas and two small diners within walking distance.

The room smell funky when we first checked in - I could not figure out what it was until much later. There were ants everywhere - the bathroom, the vanity, and in beds - the only place I did not \"see\" them are on the carpet, which is in some very dark color. That was so gross to find ants in our beds and when my older one saw them, it took some effort to calm her. When I complained to the front desk, they sent an exterminator over in the middle of the afternoon when our two young daughters are napping. I had to sent them away. I am not sure if there is a safer way to address this before their guests are checked out. When we got home, we found ants in our lugguage! We paid a bit more for a 2010 renovated room - I could not figure out where the renovation was - everything looks rather old, e,g, the bathroom door does not close. The food quality from their Signature restaurant is quite poor so avoid it if you can.

Just purchase food at one of the two markets near the resort to save lots of money, instead of going out to eat everyday - it becomes costly. Loved the shuttle bus to the boardwalk/beach, but FSK should supply additional buses to shorten the wait time, plus beachgoers have equipment which takes up space in the mini bus. The fitness center needs to be upgraded tremendously. Some of the equipment is rusty and some parts are broken. FSK only have one computer for the resort - should have at least 3 more.

The waitress set the burger in front of me and there was blood all over my roll, needless to say I cut it open and it look like raw bloody hamburger inside. My husband choose to have his cooked longer but I choose not to eat it at all. Waitress said they cook all hamburgers medium.....fyi...my husband and I had a rare burger. I saw nothing on the menu that said they would be cooked to medium or I would have ordered it well done. One of the shuttle buses had no air conditioning, said temporarily out of service the whole time I was there .........I was there 6 days who knows how long it had been like that before I arrived.

I was working down at the harbor, and FSK is the closest place. My room was an efficiency with two double beds, dining table, large fridge, range, coffee maker, microwave, and sink. The kitchen seemed to be stocked with all your basics, as well as pot holder, dish rag, towel, and soap (I'm surprised how many efficiencies don't provide dish soap). The room had a flat screen TV on the standard long, low dresser. The bathroom itself had the toilet and full size bath. The sink was separate, in a partially divided section of the main room. One problem I had was that the tub and sink drained very slowly. The bed was comfortable but softer than my liking - I prefer a rather firm mattress. I didn't see it listed on their web site, but free wireless internet is available in your room - you just need a log-in and password from the front desk. The room was clean, and I had no qualms about walking around barefoot. Overall, the room seemed bright and \"cheery\". The property is much more open and less hectic than over in town. Parking seemed better as well. I didn't feel like they strunk the spaces to fit more cars. There is a diner in the main building where you can get breakfast starting at 7 AM, as well as burgers, shakes, and ice cream, I think unitl 9 PM. Elsewhere, there is a Starbucks and another diner next door, Carraba's and a Sunsations within walking distance, and an Outback, a pizza place, and a Japanese steak house across the highway in the White Marlin outlet mall. Down at the harbor, less than a mile away, is Crab Alley, Captain's Galley II, Harborside, The Shark, and Sunset Grill. A short distance down 50 is Hooper's Crab House. There is also a Food Lion and CVS nearby, and a gas station/convenience store across the street. Free shuttle buses runs continuously from FSK to the boardwalk (Somerset St.) from 9 AM to 10 PM in season. I think the shuttle bus would get you to the boardwalk faster than the town bus from some locations during the peak season. If you don't mind not staying within walking distance to the beach, FSK provides a relaxing stay near good food, with convenient access to the beach.

With an attitude she explained the policy to check in. ( I dont mind the explanation or reminder but did not appreciate the belittling) After retrieving my phone to show her the confirmation email, again with an attitude she stated, \"right here in the email it says what you needed to have.\" Onto the room, it was one of the remodeled rooms but still had slight stingy odor to it. AC was not on nor refrigerator as some hotels have ready when new guests are to check in. No curtains, just blinds. The beds were very uncomfortable, and they are double. So if you are taller then 6ft they are not right for you at all. Ideal for kids of course, which is what this place is about. Putt Putt is just small \"greens.\" No obstacles, not fun, my daughter quit after six holes. The indoor pool is great. Very clean, always towels for use, warm water, fun environment. Only issues was a lifeguard that goofed off and flirted with the under age 18 girls in the hot tub (no one under 18 is allowed) Also a large group of adults that were allowed to take up much of the pool for a long time. My daughter and others were afraid to play and go down slide. The pool is pretty much set up for kids, and I felt this should not have been allowed. Maybe a seperate area/pool just for adults? Outside pool was clean, pool bar was nice. Playground nice. Shuttle bus service was perfect. Grounds are clean, could use signs on property to point you to pool, pond, buildings etc. To me its not really a family resort but a place specifically for younger children.

We were at the front desk a lot to take advantage of the free dvd's & game rentals and I'm sure my little ones where being annoying, but the staff smiled and engaged them with questions which really made the kids feel special. Third, the rooms were just as expected. Very clean and all appliances (tv w/ dvd player, heating system, hair dryer, iron, refrigerator, & lights) worked perfectly. The tempurpedic beds were super-comfortable. Fourth, the caribbean key indoor pool was AMAZING! My daughters (age 6) had a blast using the slides, playing volley ball, swimming and splashing. Mommy and daddy had fun on the slide too! At dark all the lights in the pool area were dimmed and we swam in just the glow of the pool lights. We also watched a movie while the kids played in the pool and Mommy & Daddy relaxed in the hot tub. The pool area, as well as the locker room was exceptionally clean and stocked with plenty of towels. We loved the showers in the locker room. Very family friendly. The lifegaurds were very attentive and very friendly. The only suggestion I have would be to request more floor mats to go around the pool, as the surface is very slippery. Both of my children slipped and were scraped up pretty badly. After that I made sure that they wore shoes when entering & exiting the pool area and there were no more slips. Fifth, make sure you take advantage of the playground area and putt-putt golf. These are both great activities to take up time while you're waiting for the pool to open. Lastly, you should be aware that there is ongoing construction in the lodge area, however the lobby was clean of debris. I can't say enough of the FSK family resort.

My kids (21 months and 4 1/2 year old boys) could not get enough! They were nothing but waterwings sliding down the waterslide. It is so awesome to see them coming back from a day of playing and falling asleep before dinner. What parent doesn't love that? If I could change one thing about the indoor pool, I would have liked to have seen longer hours. There really isn't much to do with kids that wake up before 8AM. The rooms? OK.. you aren't staying at a fancy hotel. You have to understand that for the location and price, you have to sacrifice something. The rooms were clean but show their age. With that being said, the beds were awesome (tempur-pedic matresses), and the kitchenettes were very well stocked. Storage could be improved a little, and lighting can be improved a LOT, but for the cost, this is still a value. The breakfast is pretty sad. Honestly, it's pathetic. Do not expect this to be more than a snack before you get to a restaraunt, or maybe a treat for your children if they eat the cereal you were smart enough to pack. They also state to NOT bring trays, and there is a person who stands there almost daring you to break this rule. For a hotel that is so kid-friendly, one would assume that they would not be so worried about an extra min-donut sneaking out. I as a father am not going to drag my whole family down to the office building for this. This was a point that I found annoying, as I am sent back to my room almost juggling donuts and mini-muffins and dropping more than I am successfuly getting into my room. Last point was the hotel staff. We took advantage of the shuttle to take you to the boardwalk. While there, I bought my 4 year old a cheap $2 toy so he had something new. Well, as always happens, he lost it on the buss. As soon as we realized this, I went to the office to put out an APB on this toy. I never expected to see it again, and tried preparing a 4 year old for the news. Well, as we were in the indoor pool, a staff member hunted us down with this toy. I would love to know how he knew that it was my son who lost this jet, but he did. Did he have to go through that trouble when a message would have more than sufficed. Overall, this was a great stay, and our second visit. This will not be our last. We enjoy it so much that every time we go, we try extending our trip to no avail. Keep the great work up, and I hope that your prices stay reasonable. ONE suggestion; how about attaching the room keys to lanyards? Coming back from the pool would be so much easier if I didn't have to fish in a bag full of wet towels for my wallet that holds the room key. is this a feasable suggestion?

He was feeling better our last night, and I asked for extended check out and explained the reason. We had two rooms, and my sister called the next morning and they allowed us an extra hour, which was wonderful. We were able to play in the morning and still have a room to go back to change in comfortably before our 6 hr drive home. Thank You.. The only recommendation I have for families with teenagers (and only one of them--) Let them bring a friend. Because things close up by 9 or 10, and we had a little one also that would be totally exhausted and ready for bed, it was difficult for her to stay occupied (though the game rentals from up front are wonderful perk by the way) It seems the teenagers kind of hang on the playground at night and that is nice also.

Room We had an end unit room in the Ohio building with a fully stocked kitchen. This allowed us to eat some meals in the room rather than in town or on the (overpriced) boardwalk. The room, although it was showing its age (beat up furniture, rusty shower head) was comfortable and clean. The cleaning woman, Anastasia, did a great job each day and my daughter was delighted with the towel animals. The Temperpedic Beds were amazing. Truly a luxury when staying in a motel. They even provided a pillow topper for the pull out sofa that my daughter used. I did have a complaint about the handle control on the shower. It was literally full of black mildew. Maintenance was to our room within a 1/2 an hour and replaced it with a new one right away. We also had a issue with the burners on the stove not working but this was also fixed for us. Pools The Pirate Spray Ground was adorable and a delight for the family. My daughter really loved seeing buckets of water getting dumped on our heads. The outdoor pool was basic. Plenty of seats, but there was some sand in the pool. I guess people didn't use the shower to rinse off before entering. There was a cash only bar owned by the restaurant. The indoor pool was great. It was one of the main reasons we chose this motel. We wanted to have a place to swim in case of bad weather. Unfortunately, our daughter was injured when a much older child playing volleyball next to the waterslide dove in front of the slide to get a ball. There was no rope or divider to keep the area clear at the bottom of the slide. We reported the incident and management seemed genuinely considered. I asked why there weren't rules posted by the slide and was told there's normally a lifeguard right at the bottom of the slide. (Apparently they were short staffed). We didn't go back to the indoor pool until the last day. There were two lifeguards but the chidlren were going down the slide in any position - headfirst, upside down etc. I asked the one lifeguard if the children should go head first or feet first and was\" told they could go however they wanted as long as it wasn't on their knees.\" I told my daughter only to go feet first but noticed the lifeguard still wasn't really controlling the children on the slide. It made me nervous and I had my daughter move to the other end of the pool. It really is a great area - very cute, but after one accident - I didn't want to take any chances. Management told me they were going to close the pool for maintenence in a couple of weeks. I hope they take a few steps to make the area safer - post rules, tell the lifeguards to be more attentive because the indoor pool really is one of the best features of the hotel. Shuttle One van was broken during our stay so we didn't use the shuttle. Driving to and from the beach was no problem since there's plenty of free parking. If you go farther north the beach is narrower (better when trying to get to the water with a young child) and less crowded. The rip tides were rough, due to the hurricane out at sea, but thankfully there are plenty of lifeguards. Daily Activities There was supposed to be bead making, games, fishing, bingo and karaoke in the BBQ pavillion. When we got there we were the only family there. The girl running it said no one did karaoke but we could color or fish. The coloring books were all used up. She said she couldn't buy any more because there were a few pages still blank. My daughter did enjoy feeding the fish and the snapping turtle. We also went back the last day to play bingo. The girl running it even allowed my daughter to call the numbers since we were the only ones there. She was a nice, friendly employee. (Sorry, I don't remember her name.) The mini golf is also available as a small diversion. Nothing fancy, but convenient. Bascially, if you are at the resort and want entertainment, the pools or splashground is the place to be. One of the reasons we chose this resort was because managment read the reviews and commented on any negative posts. I was pleased with the managers who followed up with us to make sure our daughter was OK and that we didn't have any other problems with our room.

I feel the owners could of put someone in charge of vacuming the pool each morning and maintaining the things floating around. There is no lifeguard at the pool so if you have kids like I do a watchful eye is necessary. There is also an indoor pool on the property which we only went to once, and that is all I needed. It was unruly and the lifeguards in there looked exhausted from all the chaos that ensued during the day. Given what I have said I truly liked the feel of the place it was very family friendly. The rates were awesome! I hope they keep it the way it is.There are some plans to upgrade but please don't overkill it with ammenities because it is a gem the way it is. What made this place so special for me is that it's a private resort situated off the beaten track, with a community feel that cannot be matched by any other resort in OC.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGREAT EVEN FOR YOUNG ADULTS !\u201d", "Author": "DjFacile", "ReviewID": "UR38451527", "Content": "We are a couple in our late 20's and we enjoyed our stay at FSK.

I was also impressed that management addressed reviews that were less than positive which tells me they care and strive for improvement. We just retuned from a 5 day stay August 2-8. We had a very positive experience and my young kids (ages 3 and 5) loved the Pirate Ship Splash area and indoor pool. We stayed in the New York building (full kitchen) and found the room to be clean and it met our needs. I do agree with some previous reviews that the rooms are very dark but I see that 92 rooms are slated for redecoration (new carpet and lighter color bedspreads) next year and I think that will be a huge plus. While the exterior of some of the buildings are showing their age I found the grounds to be well maintained and everything seemed quite clean and tended to in regards to landscaping. The shuttle was a nice convenience. Only one night could I hear some loud guests returning to their room and I guess it is luck of the draw who your neighbors may be but I would not hold that against the hotel they do have a zero tolerence policy for noise after 11pm and each guest initials and acknowledges this policy upon check-in. Unfortunately there are just some inconsiderate people out there at times but that is the minority. I also found the staff I encountered to be very pleasant and that includes the front desk, life guards, maid, and shuttle driver. I was sitting in the lobby using their free computer to research dinner options and the front desk was enthusiatic and pleasant to everyone checking in and checking out. I chatted with the front desk staff on dinner recommendations and borrowed games and moviews throughout my stay. I even overheard a phone conversation where someone had to postpone their trip due to surgery (not sure if that was really true or an excuse) but the front desk was quite gracious and offered a credit to stay at another time. I would defintely return with my family again and would encourage anyone who is looking for a good value and family friendly location to consider this hotel. If all the improvements mentioned by management come to fruition I think people will find it difficult to find any fault. I do have two very minor recommendations for improvement but are not in anyway a detraction from the hotel. 1)wi-fi needs to be improved as I could not access from my room and had to go to the main lodge and even then service was slow. 2) Please consider offering towels at the outdoor pool and Pirate Splash Park not just the indoor pool. If you are thinking about staying at this hotel I would go for it and give it a try. By reading all the reviews I think my expectations were reasonable and I was not at all disappointed or surprised in any way.

I was a bit reluctant to go with a motel and also one a mile from the beach. We have stayed in some pretty fancy hotels over the past few years, so I was worried about this a little bit ;) I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, the rooms are somewhat dated and yes, the walls are thin. But you know that by reading these reviews. Most importantly, it was clean. The beds were comfy and the room was clean. When we go on vacation, our intent is not to spend time in the room--we just shower and sleep there. It was nice to have a separate sink and mirror area from the shower/toilet. We always travel with a white noise machine to help drown out noise so our kids could sleep. We could hear very loud 'thumping' above us until 10:30 or 11 at night (probably a small kid like our own!) but then it stopped. THere is a quiet time which begins at 11. Housekeeping was pleasant and the kids loved the towel animals. The grounds were kept just fine. It was not an immaculate island resort (nor did I expect it to be), but it was maintained just fine. The resort has so much for families to do - games and contests each day, pirate splash zone, indoor and outdoor pool, volleyball net, kids park, mini golf......what other hotel gives you all those options? The indoor pool was so much fun for our kids. I loved that most of the pool was 1, 2 or 3 feet. The kids loved that they could 'go out so far' and still be able to stand. The pirate splash ship was also loads of fun for them. Some of the larger kids were really slamming into the base of the slides, so I would caution older kids on that. But for the youngest, it was great. I also felt the lifeguards were very attentive. The shuttle bus was very convenient. We never had to wait very long for it to arrive and the driver was always helpful with loading and unloading beach bags, strollers, etc. What a nice amenity to offer. I would definitely recommend this motel to families. The hotel also allowed us to use the grounds (pool, shuttle, locker area, etc) prior to check in and also after check out. We were able to enjoy full days on both our arrival and departure day. It was really nice to be able to shower at the pool before heading home! Oh and how could I forget?

To start the check in was quick and easy w/ no lines,the rm was clean and cool -wish I would of booked a rm. w/ a full kitchen , we had a small frig ,but made use of it. To save from eating out get a rm w/ full kitchen preferably on the Florida side since its the newest building and the indoor pool is connected to it. I know that for next yr. Next ,all the amenities were just awesome 2 pools,a spray area for the kids to run and slide was great .The pool had a bar and hot tub along w/ a baby pool also.Put put golf right next to the pool area, all kinds of activites for the kids thru out the day. Nice clean picnic pavillion area to grill out at. Fishing in the pond that the kids enjoyed - rods and bait included.Basketball and volleyball at the resort along w/ a nice sized playground area. Not to forget about the indoor pool that was only 4ft all around, which is great for the younger kids - there is also a slide here too.A drop dwn movie screen that shows movies every evening- wasnt the best only because kids are running around and playing and the movie cant be heard -but we didnt mind.There is also a fitness rm, arcade, and laundry facility located in the building w/ the indoor pool which is the Florida unit.The shuttle arrives frequently all day til 10pm, we never had to drive,and we never waited longer than 5-10min to get picked up or dropped off.We went to the beach 2 of our 4 days in OC, honestly we never really had to leave the resort.

Your experience staying at the hotel probably depends on what type of neighbors you have. Our neighbors came in late around 12:30 AM in the morning and would stay up to 4AM in the morning with the tv on. I really couldn't tell if the tv was on too loud or it was just the walls.

To say my family and i were blown away with the Francis Scott key resort would be a understatement. My family and i have been vacationing in OC MD. for 9 years now we have loved every trip, but this one will stay fresh in our memories for some time to come. Friends of ours told us about the FSK resort the same ones who told us how much better that OC MD. was better than the jersey shore , well lets just say they weren't wrong about OC MD. and they certainly weren't wrong about the FSK resort. I am A father of four at various ages , my son is 18 and i have three daughters 14, 7 and 3 as you can imagine it is hard to keep 4 kids with such a stretch in ages happy and content on vacation. Well at the FSK it wasn't ,first let me say from the minute we got on the property we were greeted with cheery courteous staff. we checked in and got our folder with everything you needed to know about the hotel a schedule of activities for the resort as well as everything that was going on all over town. WE then proceeded to our room which was a 6 person room with the kitchenette . The room was spacious and very clean the appliances were new and also very clean as well the kitchen had everything you needed to cook with . which when you have a big family is a great option that you have at the FSK to save money. they also have a wonderful picnic pavilion complete with grills that family's can use on a first come first serve basis to barbecue. Now lets get to the fun stuff the FSK offers a wide array of fun organized activities from 10am till 7pm if your looking to just stay and hang around the resort and RELAX as we did during our week long stay , quite frankly it was a battle to get my kids to go to the beach cause they were having so much fun at the resort. my 3 year old favorite things were the spray ground and the tricycle races and cant forget the snow cones my 7 year old loved the Caribbean key pool and just about any activity she could get involved in and cant forget about the snow cones. I also have to give a lot of credit to the life guards as well as the activities girls they were awesome with my kids. Now on to my teenagers they bounced around to all the pools there are so many family's at the FSK it is very easy for the teens to make friends , there is a basketball court on site a sand volleyball court as well as a very challenging mini golf course on site, and if they got board with all that they took advantage of the free dvd rental or before they spent all there money and a lot of mine the hoped on the free shuttle that runs continuously from 9am till 10pm to the board walk and beach .The shuttle was an incredible amenity i drove my truck once the whole time we were there we used the shuttle all week which saved us a ton in gas and parking fees the only time we had to drive some where was to go to the free events sponsored by the town of OC which they have schedules posted on the info boards, the movies on the beach and family Olympics are a blast. Well if you couldn't tell by all of this my family and i had a blast the time we spent at the FSK . The only mistake we made we brought to much stuff as we were used to renting condos were you have to supply all your own linens and towels . At the FSK there is daily housekeeping service the clean up the room fresh towels every day and make the beds , which reminds me very rarely are hotel beds more comfortable then the one you have at home now i have my wife pricing out posturpedic mattresses They even have towels for you at the indoor pool , the only place you need your own towels is the outdoor pools and at the beach.

And it doesn't matter how long you stand under the water rubbing yourself: It doesn't ever get NOT slippery! Also, I'm not sure who those guys were in the next room but there were a LOT of them. And they had a bunch of big trucks parked outside. They were up both mornings before the crack of dawn and were very, very noisy. Both mornings (we're talking, like 4:00 a.m.), they flung their front door open and a bunch of them kept coming outside, talking loudly and smoking right next to our door and window! The cigarette smoke was coming right into our room. And there was no getting back to sleep because they wouldn't shut up and they were banging around in the room. This isn't really a management problem except that maybe they could do a better job of not letting groups of 10 people sneak into one room. (How though?) The room was dark and old-fashioned but had incredible amenities. The kitchen cabinets were fully stocked with everything you could need to prepare a meal and entertain right there in the room! The beds were apparently Tempur-Pedics and were amazingly comfortable. The front desk people were super-nice and because we purchased a package, we got a beach bucket (& shovel) in which we found all kinds of great gift certificates for area shopping & dining.

I had called the front desk before our stay to inquire about the type and availability of cribs. I was told it wouldn't be a problem to get one and that they had Graco brand Pack 'n Play cribs. When we checked in I was told we could not have a crib in our room (a 6-person room but there were only 3 of us) because it was against fire codes. After asking to speak to a manager they eventually conceded that we could have the crib because we didn't have 6 people sleeping in the room. The staff then began looking for an available crib which seemed difficult. The eventually found a rickety metal crib (not the brand and type they had claimed to provide).

There are a couple slides and play rafts to float on. The included breakfast was surprisingly nice and they didn't mind that we were taking the meal back to our room to eat.

We stayed in the Florida building and our kitchenette room was GREAT! Much cleaner than any other hotel I have ever stayed (even the high end hotels). Fatima wasour housekeeper and was so wonderful, even made a towel elephant for my 4 year old. I loved the temperapedic mattresses and anyone who complains must not know much about a good mattress. (I sold mattress' in the past.) The online pictures don't even do this place any justice. I was more than pleased with very aspect of our stay. I do agree that the rooms are a bit dark but that was my only complaint. My girlfriend and her 3 kids came for 2 days and she agreed that next year she will be staying much longer. Our kids, my mother and my husband all agreed that this is a great family resort where we all felt very safe. And if anyong is familiar with the cost of any decent hotel in Ocean City this is a STEAL!! Eventhough it a little less than a mile from the beach the shuttle was always accessible and was much easier than driving. The pirate sprayground was PERFECT b/c I got to lay and watch my kids play without the fear of drowing or being hurt. The indoor pool is so much more than a pool and both of my kids could have stayed in it all day. Also, we had appetizers at the very nice resturant located in the resort and the food was excellent and such a classy place for the adults to go.

For the past 3 years, we've stayed here in May and October during the Ocean City Cruise Weekend. This is also our summer vacation destination where we bring our 9 year old daughter and one of her friends. The girls absolutely love the indoor pool! A few summers ago, it was so hot the entire week that we stayed (in July) that we only went out at night. Our saving grace was the indoor pool where the girls would spend the entire day! Without that, they would've had nothing to do! We've always had great service and the rooms are comfortable. The new beds are fantastic! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Only once did we have to switch a room due to smell. I believe it was in the Delaware (next to the new Pirate Ship). I think the problem is that behind that building was once a pool and there is direct access from each room. People most likely went in and out of the rooms while they were wet, thus the carpet has a mildew smell. I think this will probably continue w/ the Pirate Ship being so close. Maybe those rooms need tile instead of carpet (or at least in the entry area by the back door). The staff was very accomodating when we asked to move our room. I highly recommend FSK to all our friends and family. We will continue to make this our family vacation destination each year. I've been coming to OC since I was a kid. I want my daughter to have great OC memories like I did. But with the price of gas rising, it's hard to find an affordable place to stay these days.

We are no strangers to ocean city, as my parents live down there. We were looking for an inexpensive place with an indoor pool for my son and were pleasantly surprised with all the ammenites offered. Everyone was extremely nice and treated us respectfully. My son brought his bike and loved riding around the huge property, he would even ride up to the main building and get board games, movies, golf clubs, basketballs etc. I usually read the trip advisor reviews before booking any vacation, but for some reason I did not this time. Upon returning, i decided to read these reviews to see what others thought about the place and could not believe how many positive reviews there are. The negative reviews were all answered by the owner of the hotel which shows pride in her ownership of the facility. On Sunday, we checked out and decided to hang around Ocean City since it was a beautiful day, when finally getting ready to leave for home, my son begged for another day so they could go fishing one more time on stinky beach, we figured why not and pulled into the FSK for another night. Upon approaching the desk, the receptionist recognized us and responded \"back already\" and in a matter of seconds we were checked in again using our old paperwork which only took a few seconds. If you are looking for a great place to stay try their winter family package which gives you a $75.00 gift certificate for dinner, a $10.00 blockbuster video card and a $10.00 starbucks card.....how can you beat that deal. We are hoping to get down one more time this winter, and even giving up my parents \"free\" place this summer for a few days so my son can experience the pirate water spray area which was closed for the seaon....hey it was 80 degrees this weekend i wished they could have opened it!

It was nice to try a temperpedic mattress out because we had considered buying one, now we are glad we didn't. We weren't that impressed with them. We didn't use the shuttle because of wanting to use car seats, but I think it would be very convenient if you had older kids. The beach and boardwalk are very close and parking is not a problem at all. The outlet malls across the street are an extra bonus!

This year we decided to try out Francis Scott Key Family Resort, and I'm so glad we did! After a quick check-in, we went to our room were very happy. It was clean (of #1 importance to us), well maintained, and had great amenities. The lighting was dim, as many have mentioned, but we opened our window to let in some light. The location is great--close to shopping, restaurants, Starbucks!, and far from the noise of the beach. When we did go to the beach, we drove our car, only because we have a lot of stuff. But we did use the shuttle to go to the Boardwalk one evening for dinner and to visit the amusement park. The driver was friendly and the shuttle was clean. There is so much to do at FSK! The reason we chose to stay here is because it was Labor Day weekend and I was afraid the weather would not be as warm and I wanted an indoor pool. Well, this indoor pool was exactly what I was hoping for, not some small, uninviting, run-of-the-mill indoor pool at the chain hotels. The water was warm, our 6-year-old loved the slide, our toddler had a blast with the whale in the baby pool area, and the entire place was clean. The best part was that there was a family movie each night on the screen above the pool. Although it was a bit hard to hear, the subtitles helped out. There is also a mini-golf course next to the outdoor pool, an outdoor water play area, volleyball net, playground, and picnic area. The free breakfast was minimal--bananas, mini muffins, donuts, coffee, and juice--but hey, it's free. Since our room had a microwave and refrigerator (a nice sized one, not the college dorm type), we went to the grocery store around the corner and bought some breakfast meats to supplement the free breakfast.
