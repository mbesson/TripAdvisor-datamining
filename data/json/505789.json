{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel overrated but superb location Stayed at the Palacio Retiro for 3 nights,after booking the rooms through a discounter website.First impressions, the location,central as can be, and the locality is safe which makes walking around in the area ,even if its late, reasonably safe.If you are selecting a hotel in Madrid purely on the basis of its location bar everything else, then there isnt much competition to this one!The hotel is a conversion from a relatively ancient ,possibly a historically significant building, the numbers of rooms are small, which is a bonus to those looking for personalised service.Facilities include a spa, and a relatively poor excuse for a gym(a treadmill, an exercise cycle with a broken pedal! and a weights machine crammed into a small room).Complimentary bottles of water crammed into the adjacent refrigerator is a plus though!Again my expectations in this review are based on the supposed class of the hotel , this is pitched as a 5 star plus hotel,I believe there are only ?6 hotels in this category in Madrid.There isnt a lobby to speak of as the conversion hasnt left much space on the ground floor.In attempting to create a unique character for this hotel,it is evident that the management has pitched it as a boutique hotel,ie the furnishings/decor.Unfortunately this contrasts with the understated appearance of the character of the building itself, the contrast at times does seem garish and inappropriate.Staff seem friendly enough although ill organised eg a blocked sink in the room remained so, for the 3 days of the stay despite numerous reminders to reception!Conclusions , if one is prepared to overlook everything else and pay top whack for a centrally located hotel,then this would seem an obvious choice,although on the whole this represents relatively less value for money.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR892505162", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JohnX3"}, {"Content": "Exceptional! Stay here if you can! What a pleasure to comment publicly on this exceptional hotel! My wife and I have stayed at many special hotels throughout Europe, luxury and otherwise. This hotel is a standout among the very finest! AC Palacio del Retiro is an impeccably restored palace in central Madrid, close to the Prado and across the street from Retiro Park. The interior of the hotel is minimalist high design and a truly beautiful blending of the old and new. We had a suite overlooking the park, which could not have been more lovely or comfortable. The staff is professional, friendly and present without being overbearing or standoffish. Everyone I encountered there spoke excellent English. My only complaint is that we budgeted much too little time there (two nights) because of other travel arrangements.

Overall the Palacio del Retiro tried hard but I still preferred my earlier nights stay in the vastly cheaper Avenida de America hotel under the same AC brand. The location of this hotel cannot be faulted - it is close to major tourist attractions such as the Prado and right next to the beautiful Retiro park. The hotel itself is a converted home of some ex-aristocracy and to me this (unfortunately) shows in its rather creepy general decor reminiscent of some kind of museum. The staff also seemed to think they were back in the days of the landed gentry, often straying well-beyond mere provision of polite friendly service into the realms of servile obsequiousness.My room was at the back with no view but this also means without the traffic noise at the front so that was OK with me. It was a large (for Madrid) room with flat-screen TV (not much English-speaking content) a CD player, and trademark free minibar. The very classy bathroom was similarly generously-sized with plenty of nice touches such as slippers, bathrobe, and about a dozen different items such as face creams and mouthwash.The spa area was well-appointed with items such as sauna, steamroom, and bubblepool - although sadly with non-working showers which was a bit of a dealbreaker after getting out of the sauna. There was also a cute-looking fitness room which I suspect real gym-freaks would consider inadequate, although I was impressed with its help-yourself fridge full of cold drinks. Oddly there is no locker area and we concluded you are supposed to change in your room then take the elevator in your bathrobe.I ate one dinner, two breakfasts, and several buffet snacks in the restaurant but as a vegetarian (practically against the law in Spain) I had no hope or expectation of getting decent food. My meat-eating companions said the quality was good however.A lot of money had obviously been spent on the furnishing of this hotel so it seems ungrateful not to like it. There was just too much inattention to detail though - the revolting smell of cigarettes hung strongly over the entire place, except for the lower floors where it was beaten back by the even stronger smell from the drains. Also for such an expensive establishment the trivial cost of improvements like non-slamming doors would not even be on the radar, instead of which I was repeatedly woken by endless bang bang bang. If I had been paying the room rate (seems to be well over 300 Euros +tax) out of my own money I would frankly have felt cheated.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR384350278", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ultrak3wl"}, {"Content": "Fantastic location I have family in Madrid, so when I chose this hotel I was familar with it's excellent central location; opposite the Retiro park, four minutes walk to the Prado museum, and five minutes to Calle Serrano, one of Madrid's best shopping streets, perfect!! It's also five minutes walk to Gran Via, and ten to Sol. We only took cabs when we were in a hurry, otherwise we walked everywhere. The hotel itself was fantastic, we loved the interior design; a fusion of modern and old, retaining the original palace's charm, whilst infusing some 21st century hipness. The staff were great. The room comfortable and peaceful. But room service was terribly overpriced, we got charged 6 Euros for a small jug of milk (for our tea- we are British after all!) and 8 euros for a small white bread salmon sandwich, which was appalling. We decided not to bother with the restaurant and headed out for breakfast ( 30 euros in the hotel) at one of the fantastic patisseries on Serrano, where I became obsessed with their coffee and croissants.

Overall, we liked the hotel. The hotel was VERY quiet while we were there. We never saw another guest (although it was August, which is a slow month). It is located across the street from a beautiful park and it is near the museums, but you need to take a cab into town where the action and the restaurants are. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My husband LOVED the modern style mixed with the ornate more traditional architecture, but I found the decour kind of creapy! The rooms are small and painted a dark grey which made them feel even smaller. There was little space to unpack (as we found to be the case in the 2 other hotels in madrid as well). The rooms have nice plasma tvs but have only about 2 English channels (which was also the case in the other hotels we stayed at in Spain). The bathroom was very roomy and modern with a huge shower and heated towel rack. However, our shower and one of the 2 sinks were clogged.

The super-high ceilings add to the sense of space while in terms of actual square footage, our regular suite (325 euros) was modest at best. I was left to wonder if there is any material difference between the junior suite and the suite other than the price tag (junior suite is 277 eruos). However, all the junior suites were taken so we decided to spring for the regular suite. While we would have preferred a room on a higher floor, none (in our room type) was available so we settled for a suite facing the Retiro on the first floor. The layout of the suite was similar to what we've found in junior suites at most other hotels--that is to say, there is not a separate sitting room. It is one room that contains a large bed (or 2 generously sized twins), a sofa, coffee table, flat-screen tvs, cd player, a desk and (depending on the room) a dining table with chairs. There was also a spacious bathroom with a separate bath tub/shower and two sinks. Some rooms also come with a dressing room/walk-in closet.Our suite was outfitted with modern furniture and the color scheme was decidedly dark and masculine (greys, mahogany, black) which may, to some eye, clash with the belles epoch architecture of the building. For eg, the high ceiling which I noted earlier, was decorated with ornate, wedding-cake moldings of the period. What made our stay most comfortable was the bedding, the power shower, and the climate control system. The bed was perfect: not too hard to induce aches in the morning, and not too soft and the high-thread count sheets felt like cream against the skin. The air conditioner worked superbly with fine adjustments to suit your temperature preference.My main complaint is the traffic noise. If you decide to take a room facing the park (and thus, the very heavily trafficked Alfonso Xll) on a low floor, be prepared for the constant noise and occasional vibrations. The double windows help some, but in this regard I must say that the Hotel Preciado was far superior with their highly sound-proofed windows.About the restaurant: we had room service on two nights--the first night was fantastic and the second night was much less so. Different kitchen staff on different nights? Possibly. I just thought I'd note the inconsistency, especially with the seafood risotto, which on the second night came with lifeless, rubbery shrimp.Finally, the hotel staff is really wonderful.

We also enjoyed the turkish bath and jacuzzi area. I would however recomment that the hotel fix the noise problem created by room doors that seem to slam shut on each opening. I found my sleep interrupted more often than i liked by the doors of other rooms slamming shut. I would also recommend that the hotel offer an al la carte breakfast, as a fixed price of EURO 27 per person is not something most travellers are prepared to spend for breakfast, at least not every day of their vacation. An a la carte breakfast might also generate greater patronage to the dining facilities of the hotel which I observed to be quite empty.
