I would pay more with no hesitation. I felt guilty for paying that amount after our arrival, for the price was well below half the price of the normal rates that time of the year. The hotel seemed well occupied with many guests. LOCATION My only concern prior to our arrival, was the location, its on the less crowded side of 5th (north), located in the \u201cLittle Italy\u201d district of Playa. Given the June heat, we did opt for a taxi for walking more than 10 minutes away during the day to depart for day trips via the bus station or colectivo area, but at night we had no problems with the vicinity, walking to near 2nd street and near the bus station. The taxi\u2019s ranged a little more than one dollar US for most of the areas around 5th Ave, so very cheap! We travel to the Playa area very frequently and have never rented a car, and don\u2019t suggest it, everything is in walking distance and public transportation is very cheap and very clean. HOTEL GROUNDS / SERVICES It\u2019s a small, quaint, yet very nice hotel with rooms available facing 5th or their courtyard. The hotel is adjacent to a very affordable restaurant, selling excellent Mexican food and offers 2 x1 drinks. The noise of the restaurant was never in issue. In fact, we had a room facing the street and I slept soundly with no earplugs. (In areas around 5th it\u2019s hard to find a quiet area). The lobby was very cute with artistically decorated d\u00e9cor, paying special attention to detail. The pool was cute and served it\u2019s purpose when we dipped in after walking back to the hotel in the June heat. It is rather small, but clean and refreshing. The hotel offers a simple breakfast of toast, jam, juice and coffee, but we didn\u2019t take advantage of this so therefore, I cannot comment on it. On the 2nd floor there is a beautiful veranda offering nice, pleasant breezes, a very small selection of books mostly in Spanish with seating and tables and purified jugs of water. The hotel also offers tour services and can help you arrange any day trips / excursions. The lobby has many resources for traveling- brochures, business cards, trip / travel books. The hotel has a partnership with Mamitas beach club offering a discounted rate for guests. It was a couple blocks away, very close. There is an Internet caf\u00e9 less than a block south that we utilized frequently at a very cheap rate. The hotel offers beach towel service, yet we didn\u2019t use, so unable to comment. The hotel is staffed 24 hrs with someone available at the front desk. When arriving late at night, the man always appeared very tired and sleepy, almost as if he had snoozed, but that didn\u2019t bother us, safety was never an issue. The hotel asks that you hand in the keys when leaving and you ask for it when you return which was so convenient; you never have to worry about a hotel key! STAFF The staff was always extremely helpful and kind. I had a sore stomach and a kind worker gave me alka seltzer and encouraged me to take it and sure enough it worked! The maids did an excellent job cleaning the rooms daily and adorned the beds with the infamous towel art found in the Caribbean! When asked, the staff offered Speedy Gonzalos laundry service that picked up our laundry via bike and dropped it off the next day at an unbelievably cheap rate. ROOM DETAILS Our room was a deluxe plus, offering a balcony with 2 chairs facing 5th Avenue. The room came equipped with cable television (some channels in English), a dresser, roomy closet to store plenty of luggage, a king sized bed, 2 end tables and a private bathroom with wall attached blow dryers. The bathroom came equipped with many essentials not avaialble in some budget hotels, such as plentiful towels, soaps, conditioning shampoos and bath gels. The room came equipped with a mini fridge which was used frequently, given the heat we\u2019d fill up water and have ice cold water to drink at all times! There was also a ceiling fan that was quiet and easy to use. The air conditioning worked wonderfully and I turned it down and off many times since it got chilly in the room! RECOMMENDATIONS Obviously, hands down I highly recommend this hotel and I look forward to staying here in the future. I\u2019ve read people paying $120 for rooms here around the Christmas (high season for Mexican travelers), and I\u2019m not sure I would pay that amount to stay here, its not a luxury hotel. Hotel Banana is a boutique, budget hotel with a positive vibe that offers that original \u201cPlaya-esque\u201d feel. ANY QUESTIONS? Any questions regarding Playa, the Yucatan or this hotel, I would be more than happy to help. My husband and I travel to this area 2-3 times a year.

I surfed all around, finding prices from $30/night up to $200/night. Proximity to the beach was not important for us but we needed to be near Fifth Ave (the main drag for pedestrians). I booked Hotel Fiesta Banana online with some Cancun reservation system. Full payment was charged at time of booking. We paid $45/night which we found to be a great deal on a small family style hotel with friendly service. I sent them an email inquiring about parking as we had rented a car (from Europcar - an okay experience). They promptly answered that the hotel was in a quiet neighborhood with free parking. We never had trouble finding parking (for our car the size of a hamster) right at the entrance to the hotel. We arrived after dark and had trouble finding the place as the streets are very dark and not well marked. After doing a few circles we found the place, right on the NW corner of 5th ave/32 street, and we had probably passed it a few times as the trees and greenery somewhat obscure the entrance. The gal at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. I showed her my reservation confirmation and filled out a very brief check in form. She found us a 'bellman\" who carried our heavy and bountiful luggage up three flights to a charming room. As others have described, the hotel is built around a tiny courtyard which contains a hot tub sized pool. Nice wrought iron railing, tiled floors and Mexican style furniture. Spotlessly clean (we found none of the aforementioned ants) and always someone at work cleaning the floors or furniture. Nice airconditioner - you use a key that is on the same ring as your room key to turn it on. Ceiling fan. On the second floor is a very nice living area with couches and chairs. We enjoyed our lunch there one day. That's where the always full water dispenser is located as well. So welcome! Free wireless internet and we had no problem with service whether in our room, out on the balcony or in the living area. Simply decorated rooms with crisp whitewashed walls and nice bed linens. Skimpy towels and they only gave us 2. No washcloths. I suppose I could have asked for more just never thought to. Our room was very quiet, on the third floor, I think #306 or #307. No street noise and the balcony over the tiny courtyard. The housekeepers didn't seem to speak any English but the front desk person always did. We never got in any later than 11pm but there was always someone at the desk. We left $1-2USD a day for the housekeeper. The standard fun towel creations left on the beds. Safe neighborhood even at night. Right at the N entrance to 5th ave pedestrian mall. Shopping close at hand. I bought a lovely painted lavabo (bathroom sink) for $39USD at the store in the next block from the hotel. Checkout was a breeze. We said, \"We're checking out\" and they said, \"Thank you, bye!\" after helping again with the bags. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel. I believe you can choose a bed and breakfast option for extra $. We did not do this but ate breakfast one morning at the restuarant. Simple fare for a decent price. Open air and a nice corner location to watch the action. This was very good lodging for the price.

We loved this hotel! We picked it based on its close proximity to the better north part of the beach in Playa. We were very pleased with our room #207 when we arrived. It was clean, roomy and had a mini fridge (which did make some racket at night\u2026not the hotel\u2019s fault, just needed some TLC I guess). We were very impressed with the available storage\u2014a large closet with shelves and a dresser. We were able to fit all four of our empty suitcases into the closet, and all our stuff had a home on the shelves and dresser. The fridge was a great amenity as we purchased some food items from the nearby Walmart, Mega and small convenience stores for other breakfast/lunch options. We found our north west room was very quiet which was perfect with kids in tow. However we did notice there seemed to be more noise on the south and east part of the hotel... Just a heads up for those who want a quieter room! In regards to ants\u2026.yes there were lots of ants! I discovered those one day as I finished a bowl of fruit loops and saw an ant at the bottom of my bowl\u2026 I inspected the box and bag of cereal and saw it was swarming with the tiny ants!!!! I guess I can now say I\u2019ve eaten ants! Needless to say they were pretty small since I didn\u2019t even notice them as I was eating my cereal! Strangely enough we didn\u2019t have any problems with the ants getting into our food on top of the fridge, even when it was partially opened. Not sure why! But all food that was left on the dresser or around the fridge seemed to attract the ants instantly. They were VERY tiny though and the only place we really noticed them was in one spot, right by the light switch and top of the dresser\u2026and of course wherever crumbs of food/open boxes of food were left! We had to chuckle when we saw the small pool! It certainly just a bit bigger then a bathtub!!! But the kids LOVED it! They played in it nearly everyday. We were very thankful for itJ Not sure if adults would find it much of a benefit though. We found the maid was very helpful, friendly and prompt. She would leave towel creations everyday, which really impressed the kids! One of my favorite parts of this hotel was that staff seemed to be present at all times. The housekeeping staff would hang out in the lounge area between rooms being cleaned. It made us feel that there were always trusted individuals available to help which was great. We tipped the maid 20 pesos each day. The complimentary breakfasts were served down in the restaurant. They start serving at about 7:45am until 11am. They provided a basket of toast with jam/butter, an orange juice and your choice of coffee (capaccino\u2019s were yummy!). Tips were expected so it wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cfree\u201d, but was adequate. We just left 10 pesos each morning. The hotel requires a deposit for safety deposit box (located in each room\u2019s closet) and also for beach towels. We didn\u2019t get any hassels getting the money back. Also, in regards to room key being held at front desk\u2026we never heard that was required and never did it! The location was great in regards to close proximity to the north part of the beach. It was a short 5 minute walk down to Mamita\u2019s beach club. It cost us 60 pesos to get four loungers and a palapa. Mamita\u2019s is a pretty crowded, noisy beachclub\u2026..but it is also on a fabulous part of the beach and has a great restaurant with fairly inexpensive food items. The kids also really enjoyed the pool at Mamitas. It was a small pool so more geared towards children. Just a few minutes walk from Mamitas is a fabulous place to snorkel at Zubul Bar Reef, just before Cocoa Bay Resort. We had a great time there one morning. Also, the beach just past Cocoa Bay Resort is beautiful and quiet. The location was a bit of a hassle in regards to getting down to the ADO bus station area with the kids in tow. We wouldn\u2019t have minded walking all the time if it weren\u2019t for the kids (a good way to keep the weight under control with all the fabulous food!!!). However it was a bit tough on the kids so we opted to take a lot of taxis. We had read at playainfo.com that there were zones for the taxis and it would be about 12 pesos to get from our hotel to centro\u2026 However, it appeared that it was no longer the norm\u202635-40 pesos seemed to be what they normally quoted us. We inquired of people on the playainfo site and locals/regular PDC visitors insisted that 15-20 pesos would be adequate, so we decided to stick with that price. We would walk up the block to 10th and flag down taxis, say \u201c20 pesos, ADO bus station?\u201d etc. and most drivers accepted that. We were able to get some taxis for 15 pesos as well. In regards to transportation we highly recommend using the \u201ccollectivo\u201d passenger vans that are located at 2nd and 15th. They are very inexpensive, quick and direct. It costs 20 pesos/person to get to Akumal area, 30 pesos/person to Tulum, 40 pesos/person to Cancun. You just flag down any passing collective on your way back to Playa. They seem to come at least every 10-15 minutes, if not sooner. They are very handy and a great way to get around! We visited a lot of places while in Playa. We went to Puerto Adventuras for the dolphin experience (booking it through the hotel). Akumal bay is the perfect place to snorkel and see lots of sea turtles, large fish etc\u2026.and should be a \u201cmust see\u201d on everyone\u2019s list if you like to snorkel\u2026plus its all free! Ask the collectivo to take you to Akumal playa, walk about 5 minutes to the entrance to Akumal bay and the turtles are swimming right by the boats, in the sea grass!!! No need pay for a tour! To the left, along the shoreline, is lots of coral and large fish. We also went to Isla Mujeres and a turtle farm there. A day trip to Tulum, to the El Paraiso beach club, is another must-see! Amazing beach there! We love how Playa is a great home base and you can branch out to see so many amazing things in the surrounding area! We loved eating out at some of the restaurants on 30th/30th as well. El Tacorocito was my favorite. El Fogon is also right across the street. Tacos al Pastor are amazing! And these restaurants are really very inexpensive and serve delicious food. We visited Alux cave restaurant this year and were absolutely blown away by this restaurant! It is really something everyone should check out at least once! Beautiful and extremely unique! We really enjoyed our time at Hotel Fiesta Bananas and would certainly consider it for future trips.

The second floor open air terrace is pretty and there is a water cooler there to fill up your bottle as much as you need. The room was clean every day (great housekeepers) and the bathroom was fine. We had a nice terrace looking over the pool and the air conditioning worked great.

It is a family run hotel, the brothers taking turns in the office. Ask Roberto and he will give you some restaurant tips off of the tourist strip that are excellent. There were four of us in two separate rooms. One on the 2ND floor and ours on the 3RD floor. Both rooms were kept spotless each day. There was also a \"special towel\" arrangement each day also. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially Oscar the afternoon desk clerk. He was great. The restaurant of the hotel does a great breakfast so no need to wander for your morning coffee fix. They also have \"happy hour\" all day long, 2X1 drinks, every day all day. My wife and sister had to have their Mojito fix every day there. The best thing about the Fiesta Banana is its location.

The hotel was very easy to find (we were driving from the airport), and since the first moment the crew were very polite, and also funny. Even we arrived pretty early still they give us our room. It had plenty of room for two people, because c'mon... we use the room for sleeping(LOL), not to hanging out, who needs more space? :P Anyway, the room was cleaned every day, and we got the famous swans, butterflies, etc, made with the towels, it was a very nice detail. We give a deposit for beach towels and it was refund at the end of the stay. Its located at the north end of the 5th, wich i found it great because is not noisy, even tho there's a small lounge in the front corner, it wasnt noisy, believe me, i slept perfecly every single night and i have a light sleep. The continental breakfast included its perfectly fine, coffee (my boyfriend asked expresso and i asked a capuccino, everysingle day), with toast, butter and strawberry jelly, was fine, and i realize that actually i dont need more for breakfast. The Mamita's Beach discount coupons, were right at the counter, and it give's a 50% discount, but c'mon ppl, the rent of the chairs is for $30 pesos each, that's 3usd or 2eur... DO U REALLY COMPLAIN about not finding the coupons???? Anyway, we got them everyday, everytime we left the key. The room had air conditioned wich it had to be turned off at nights, cause its so damn cold, with the ceiling fan its ok... at day the AC is a MUST. We didnt use the little pool, indeed is pretty small, more like a jacuzzi, but i guess its a good option if is raining, we got a day of rain, but we drive ourselfs to a mall, to the movies, so no pool needed Anyway, we for sure are staying there again if we come back to Playa.

The only things we didn't like about the hotel were the piece of chewed up gum we found in the shower (yuck!) and the paper thin walls. We could hear the maids cleaning every day, and at night we heard the LOUD club next door. Luckily, I had ear plugs! Other than the gum the room was always very clean. The location of the hotel was great - right at the north end of Quinta, and only two blocks from the beach. We also loved the general look of the building. The pool, though quite small, was really nice because it was mostly shaded so it was cooler than the ocean and I could still enjoy swimming when I was sunburned. We were disappointed because we never saw the Mamitas beach club discount coupons that were advertised.

The towels were folded on the bed to be shaped like two swans and there were flower petals surrounding it! Very pretty. It definitely gave the room a special feel.

I understood the reason for deposit in case we lost our key or towels. Breakfast was also included in our price, but it was just a basic continental breakfast. The staff was very helpful and friendly during our stay and answered our questions. We booked a few tours at good prices and we had a fantastic time. The location was at the end of 5th Ave, and I liked the location because it was a little quieter, but a short walk to the many restaurants and shops. We easily walked everwhere. It was only a few minutes walk to the beach -no time at all!- and through the hotel we had discounted access to nice beach clubs with umbrellas and lounge chairs. If you follow 5th Ave, it is only about a 20 minute walk to the ferry that goes to Cozumel, as well.

It is rated as a great place for young people to stay so we figured we'd fit right in, as our group was in our mid to late 20's. our experiences weren't bad - it is a clean hotel and we had no real problems while staying there. but i was disapponted when the hotel felt more like a hostel. they ask you to return your keys each time you leave the hotel. i'm sure this aleviates many problems over lost keys on a night out in playa, however, i didn't like not being able to keep our room keys with us at all times. they require a monetary deposit to use the safe deposit box in your room which was irritating because we were already paying for the room. the safe deposit box is an amenity that should be included with the room. the shower drain was very slow to drain and left us with a shower full of gross sudsy water, that was still there the next morning. and we didn't experience the warm friendliness from the people who work there that has been talked about in many reviews. i've found hotels in the area that are cheaper with more to offer. playa is definitely a huge party central so if you want a place near the main strip to crash in after a really long night out drinking, fiesta banana is convenient and simple and the price is good for the location. however, it might not be the best place for you if you want something a little more cozy, relaxing and intimate while in playa. Also, if you use expedia to book the room, they mention that the lock box and hair dryers (actually only one at the reception desk for the whole hotel) are amenities for all the rooms. i wish they had mentioned that this wasn't the case. AND BE AWARE that expedia does not actually charge you for the room, they only put a hold on it to make sure your card is valid. you actually will have to pay when you get there. that caused us a huge headache trying to figure out if we were paying twice for our stay.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Banana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d446839-Reviews-Hotel_Banana-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$46 - $122*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5a.
