The hotel staff was VERY pleasant and accommodating and I enjoyed my interactions with them. The historic building is beautiful, the decorations tasteful, the room was roomy and enjoyable. One of the best features was the free breakfast buffet that had on it anything that you could possibly want (meat, eggs, cereal, fruit, bread, etc.) The staff who worked the breakfast were very kind and very thorough. The negatives? Location. I know that others claim that this is a good area, and maybe it is, but I found the area to be sketchy and did not feel comfortable walking down to the Inner Harbor because of the nearby neighborhoods. This, of course, is not the hotel's fault and there is plenty of parking garages and public transportation to accommodate for this anyhow. Another negative- we got stuck in the elevator not one, but two times. Both times the issue was fixed and we were out of the elevator within 15-20 minutes, but still. Scary. Lastly, we found a package of condoms behind the nightstand in our room. I know this is small, but it made me wonder how clean the room actually is. Thank God the condoms were in foil, not used. Regardless, I want to reiterate how kind the staff was, and how beautiful the building was. I would recommend this place to friends- for the price, you cannot go wrong.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "cakebaker31", "ReviewID": "UR127840849", "Content": "My 2 daughters and I spent 5 days in Baltimore for spring break. We were looking for a hotel that was central to Inner Harbor, museums, shopping, and Washington DC. I booked 5 nights thru booking.com for approx $350 total. We checked in on Sunday, staff was very friendly. We entered the room that we were given, it was very small, dark and had a view of a brick wall. We immediately called the front desk and received a new room, which was much larger, brighter and had a much better view. A hot breakfast was included, each morning. The hot, home cooked breakfast was very good and featured slightly different offerings, each morning. There was also yogurt, breakfast pastries, cold cereal, variety of juices, etc. The heat/air is a bit antiquated and therefore controlled from a central source. The parking area is located beneath the hotel and is secure and well lit, but very small, awkward and the parking spaces are very, very tight. The hotel is definitely in need of a refresh, but overall was clean and definitely a good value. Pros...price, hot breakfast, convenient location. Cons.....aesthetics, parking, heating/air conditioning. Tips - get to breakfast early, tends to get a bit chaotic, later in the morning. Also if you opt to park beneath the building ($15 per day), plan to arrive back to the garage by at least 8:00,so that you can have your choice of spaces, Lastly we walked one block over to catch the Charm City Circulator (free), which transported us to Penn Station so that we could catch the train to DC and then we used the Circulator the following day to go to the Inner Harbor.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brunswick, Maine", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice in Baltimore\u201d", "Author": "Intrepid8", "ReviewID": "UR127735760", "Content": "On our return from a golf excursion to South Carolina, we stopped in Baltimore to attend an Orioles/Yankees game at Camden Yards.

The beds were comfortable. Parking added $15 (overnight with in and out privileges) but it was a secure indoor lot, and parking in Baltimore can cost $5 an hour. They let us park in the lot even though we arrived before check-in time. We walked to the Inner Harbor, about 8 blocks. There were a number of homeless people along the route, so we stayed on main streets. There were also a lot of drunks of all sorts on the street, but it was St. Patrick's Day, so it may be a more relaxing walk on another evening. This is not the most convenient hotel if you want to spend the night wandering the Inner Harbor area. The main purpose of our stay was to attend a lecture at the Walters Art Museum, and the Mount Vernon is just around the corner, so it was perfect for our needs. It is also very close to the Peabody Conservatory's concert halls. We ate a nice dinner at Turkish restaurant near the hotel called the Cazbah. In the morning the hotel served a complimentary breakfast that was truly a full meal, with choice of eggs, potatoes, bacon, even grits which I like on occasion. There was yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, and a decent dark roast coffee. There was decaf tea, which is my wife's drink of choice. The variety and size of the breakfast makes the Mt. Vernon a very good deal for families with children. There is a old grand piano in the lobby and some young girls proved that they had studied music, by playing a bit. The hotel isn't luxurious by any means, but it has character. It offers good value, and we would stay there again. I somehow left my camera at the front desk when I checked in, and when we arrived at the room, the phone was ringing to let me know.

I sponsored a trip for an international non-profit organization which provides outreach young girls. 16 young girls and adults were taken to Baltimore this past weekend. I purchased 5 rooms at a great price for 2 nights. Unfortunately, after experiencing a severe allergy attack from all the pollen outside, I was looking forward to seeking refuge in an air-conditioned room. Well, that wasn't happening since I realized that the a/c was not functioning in the hotel. Yes, this was a major problem for me, the adult with severe hot flashes, and the children who had breathing issues. The terribly arrogant night manager just shrugged his shoulders. He said 'we ran out of fans and this was unexpected.' Then, informed me of the future plans of converting the system which doesn't go on until April and how old the building was, etc. How is this unexpected when you gave a bunch of fans to other people who only purchased one room. He was not about to do a thing to help us to prevent having to send me to the er or any of the other children I was responsible for to the hospital because the heat in the rooms was rising. Since he, did and said all he was going to say, he looked past me and ask if he could help the next person. If I could have afforded it, I would have tried to have booked another hotel, but that was impossible to do with all the kids at 10pm. It would have been nice to be told about this prior to checking in. Luckily, the Friday night security guard became someone who was the most helpful to me. So, the only resolution was for me to find a store open at 11pm and purchase fans. So, the guard, and only her, told me that there was a 24 hour Walmart near by and how to get there. She was the only one trying to resolve the immediate issue. I purchased f box fans for $125.51 with money designated for the activities on our trip. We survived the night. And, had to drop one of our activities from the itinerary. Not something you want to do with kids looking forward to going places. The next day, I had the displeasure of speaking to the unhelpful day manager. I thought that I could be reimbursed for the fans, especially since they have, and periodically need fans, and have, and use fans for when the weather is 'unexpected.' Or some other compensation. Foolish me. I was told that the night manager should have made other accommodations for us. And, that no money could be refunded because I prepaid for the rooms. So, sorry so sad, next attitude is unacceptable. Oh yeah, after I checked out and left the rooms, I told him that I didn't want to be charged for the bottle that was never there in one of the rooms. I was told that the $2 bottles of water would not be charged to me because it was so hot in the rooms. Didn't open any bottles. Gee, thanks for nothing. I was hoping to post a positive review, because the hotel is priced right, nicely kept, great complimentary breakfast, reasonable parking options, great places in walking distance and the location was perfect. I was hoping to recommend this hotel to others, including our group's national and international sponsors visiting this area. Is this how Marshall Hotels & Resorts, management company runs business. I thought they want more business not discourage future business from people who would purchase more than just one room and for more than one night. But, I have been finding myself starting off with the bad, then some good, then the bad again. It's terrible that things couldn't have been worked out. I felt bad for the other guy who complained about his room being a sweltering 100 degrees. But, at least they asked him if they could make other arrangements for him.

It comes with the territory. We encountered a few, but not near the hotel. The hotel room was more than adequate for the king size bed and the bathroom was spacious.

The breakfast which was included in the price was pretty good... a few mistakes (potatoes were undercooked one day, omelette was botched) but overall not bad at all. All in all the hotel seemed very clean but just two little annoyances I have to mention. A blue M&M remained on the floor of our room the entire 2-day stay. I left it there just to see if housekeeping would pick it up but I guess they didn't see it. The dark color kind of blended in with the carpet. Also, a Q-tip remained on the floor of the hallway near the elevator at the 3rd floor for the entire 2 days we were there. Housekeeping staff had to have noticed it. I was surprised no one bothered to pick it up. This was our first visit to Baltimore and we did enjoy it. We found a cute Irish bar around the corner from the hotel on Charles St. - O'Shea's I think, which was fun.

Case in point, during my 1st night my room was very warm (I prefer to sleep in the cold) and after going to the front desk to complain, they informed me that because it was a historic property the Heating/AC was centrally controlled. To accommodate my discomfort, they immediately provided me with a large floor fan and when that wasn't enough they gave me an entirely different room that was much cooler. They even offered to help transfer my luggage at 1am. My new room stayed perfectly cool the rest of my stay and they also let me continue to use my floor fan. Additionally, when I wanted extra towels there was no delay from housekeeping and they sent more than I would need during my entire stay (which made me very happy!). I'm not sure if it was because of my LivingSocial deal of if it comes standard with any room rental, but each morning there was a free breakfast included in their cafe. This wasn't just a continental breakfast but a full buffet of scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, pancakes, waffles, bacon, cereals, muffins and danishes, fresh fruits, and a build your own omelette station.

I woke up in the middle of the night thinking I was suffocating it was so ungodly hot in there. The windows don't open so there was no relief. The next night we requested a box fan that helped, but we still slept with no covers. If you do stay here - get late night pizza from Brother's...delicious!!

It was priced right and was AAA rated. When I made the reservation, the staff was very friendly. That was the last of the quality service. The hotel is about 7 blocks from the Harbor, in an ok section of town, near a hospital. The lobby was dark and rather uninviting. The room was small and basic, the bathroom, even smaller. We requested a king bed. The room was cold when we arrived and we adjusted the thermostat on the wall marked \"AC/HEAT\". I set it at 72 degrees figuring that would be a relatively decent temperature. In the bathroom there were two towels, one hand towel and two washcloths. There was a small single cup hot pot to make instant coffee. Not a coffee maker as advertised. The bed had two pillows that went flat when you laid your head on them and was hard as a rock. The sheets and blankets were 1980's less than \"Ho-Jo\" quality and there were no extra blankets or pillows. We asked at the desk for an extra set of towels and pillows. They were delivered while we were out. We decided to make the best of our trip and forged on. The temperature in our room never got warmer. As a matter of fact, it got colder and having no additional blankets to throw on did not help. We set the temperature gauge to 90 degrees with no luck. When attempting to take a shower the next morning we discovered that you could turn the water on and turn the water off. That is it. You could not turn the knob in either direction to change the temperature. When we called the front desk on a phone that crackled and had static we were told by the front desk, \"Sorry, maintenance will not be in for another 2 hours.\" It was 6:30 in the morning. We asked what else they could do for us as we needed to take showers and get our day started. Once we prompted them, we were offered to move to another room on the first floor. (Let me remind you the hotel is situated near a hospital, we heard sirens going at all hours of the night from the 5th floor.) My boyfriend went down to the front desk to speak to a manager. When he arrived at the front desk, he was greeted by a woman on the phone holding a personal call. He and the woman behind him waited patiently until she was able to take a break and ask them what they wanted. He asked to speak to a manager and was given a so-called housekeeping manager that chucked her arms and asked him \"...what he wanted her to do about it. Maintenance would not be in for two hours.\" He returned to the room, remembering we had a mini buck tool with us; he attempted to fix the shower himself so we could promptly check out. He jimmied the shower enough to get clean; meanwhile a housekeeper was sent to our room. We informed him that we \"fixed\" the shower ourselves, and that we were checking out. He was nice enough to inform us that the air conditioning was still on the building and showed us how to jiggle the temperature gauge to get a warmer temperature in our room. I will note, this gentleman was very nice to me and was just a messenger sent to an unfortunate situation. He also informed me that the woman who supposedly was the housekeeping manager, was NOT so. He did make a phone call to find out when a real manager would be on duty. When we checked out, we asked for a manager, and were given the accounting manager. When she questioned the front desk receptionist about the incident earlier, the woman replied that she was on the phone with maintenance. When my boyfriend contradicted her, she rolled her eyes and sighed at us. The accounting manager adjusted our bill and informed us we would not be charged for the additional night. She was polite and apologetic. She also explained to us at that time that the maintenance department was at a mandatory meeting at another facility. No one had given us this response to this point. We were simply told maintenance would not be in for two hours. An explanation would have been helpful and understood. Upon arriving home, I checked my card statement and found we were actually charged for a half a night (the agreed amount for the first night) AND we were charged for the second night. I contacted the hotel to clear up the matter. I spoke to the exact same woman I spoke to when we checked out. I informed her that we did NOT stay the second night and I wanted the charges removed from my charge card. She put me on hold, when she returned she said \"The card has been credited, thank you, good bye\" and almost hung up on me. When I asked her to confirm that again, that the charge was being credited back to my account she said \"Yes, the card has been credited, thank you, good bye.\" at which point, she hung up on me. We have stayed in some interesting establishments before. We have made the best of them, but this is by far the worst experience either of us has ever had. And they are supposedly a AAA rated hotel.

I was a bit afraid of booking a room here after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor, but I refuse to pay Inner Harbor prices -- I like a view, but I don't NEED a view -- and I was VERY pleasantly surprised that it was much nicer than I thought it would be. From the moment we entered the lobby to check in until the moment we left, EVERY staff member was friendly, helpful, and quick to answer our questions and attend to our needs. We asked for more pillows, and they were brought to us within 10 minutes. We left for dinner, and when we got back to the parking garage, someone had taken up two spaces, and the rest of the spots were taken -- I waited in the car while my fiancee went to the lobby to see what we could do -- the clerk had the non-parker move their car, and we had our space. We had leftovers from dinner, but no flatware -- it was brought within 10 minutes. The breakfast staff was very friendly as well. The room wasn't huge, but it was CLEAN, as was the bathroom. I don't know if bedbugs have made it to Baltimore yet, but if they have, they're not checked in at the Mount Vernon. We had a decent view of the city from our window. My only kinda-sorta complaint about the room is that the coffee pot is a single-serving pot, but since they give you a free full breakfast, I had plenty of coffee when we went down to eat, and took a large cup back up to our room. I'm sure that had I asked, they would have been more than happy to bring more coffee pods up to the room, but it wasn't needed. The breakfast was pretty good -- scrambled eggs with cheese, home fries, potato casserole (basically home fries with bacon, ham, and cheddar), french toast, and bacon. They also had turkey bacon for those who don't dig on swine. They also had muffins, bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, and yogurt. The coffee wasn't bad for hotel coffee -- as I said, I drank a TON of it. They also had a very good juice selection -- not just your standard orange and apple -- they also had cranberry and grape juices. To those that gave bad reviews, I have a few pointers for you: 1. You are in the CITY. There are going to be panhandlers, homeless people, and weirdos near your hotel no matter where you stay. This is true for ANY large city, not just Baltimore. 2. Rudeness begets rudeness. If you have a problem, but are polite to the staff while explaining your problem, chances are that the staff will be polite to you and help you in any way they can. However, if you are rude, obnoxious, demanding, and unreasonable, don't expect anyone to bend over backward to appease you. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar, honey, so be sweet. 3. If you're picky about pillows, bring your own, or ask for more. I'm picky about pillows, so usually bring my own when I travel, but since we were only staying one night, I didn't this time. I asked for more, and they were promptly delivered. 4. Why would you complain about a free breakfast? I'll take the Mount Vernon's breakfast in a SECOND over the typical Continental that most hotels offer -- I'm not interested in cereal or mini-muffins if there's REAL food available. 5. The parking garage is small and the spaces aren't huge, yes. However, if you have any sense, you will have already read the other reviews and know this. We brought our smaller car for just that reason (and also because we didn't know how much street parking we'd need to do while wandering around Baltimore, so the smaller the car, the better.) 6.

I check out tomorrow and I could not be happier to be leaving. I feel like I got ripped off royally. I will be spending more $$ to stay elsewhere when I have to come back Short version: The good: Location Room size The \"eh\": Price ( I paid just under $100 per night) Bed comfort The Ugly: Parking Homeless people congregating and following you Clueless Guest Reps Did I say parking? Dirty Old (Not the quaint charming vintage \"old\" but the beat down only doing the basics old) The manager \"Ben\" is pretty useless. Details: I am not from Baltimore. I am from a small town in Florida. Normally, this would not be a problem but apparently the folks at Mount Vernon Hotel have ZERO idea that people from other places visit this city. Directions are always the same, \"10 minutes THAT way\" or \"two blocks down\". Down?? Down where? What way? Half these streets are one way, you have to turn 17 times to get a mile worth of progress to your destination. A name a street SOMETHING USEFUL?! Nope, you're on your own. Thank god we stumbled upon a traffic officer who took pity and explained to us about the free orange and purple buses. NOT ONE REP mentioned this free bus thing that is literally just down on the corner. I thought maybe it was just the reps I had talked to. Maybe I was just unlucky or something, but tonight after arriving at the hotel (10:30pm) and finding NO parking despite the fact that they have my 15$ Ben, the manager, says \"sorry I guess someone took two spots\" and directs us to parking by pointing and saying \"2 blocks that way\". Real helpful Mr. Manager, I appreciate that. The hotel is old. They call it historic and vintage and all sorts of nice things. It WOULD be those things if they bothered to clean anything worth a darn. They clean the stuff you can see at first glance. Everything else is left to grow fuzzy and gross. The ice machine is raggedy and grimy looking. The ice seems clean I suppose but I looked it over pretty hard before using it and still didn't feel comfortable with it. I ended up using it like cooler ice and just dropped my drink bottle in it. I'm not generally nit picky but with the sludge on the toilet seat, the trash I had to trip over to get on the elevator, and the fuzzy brown junk in the tub I wasn't really taking any chances. I ended up having to take a picture of the trash and show the counter to get it picked up. Parties and stuff happen, it's a hotel, what is so difficult about giving guests a place to put their trash?! The ice room is already a dump, one good sized trash can is hardly going to ruin the ambiance. Location, location, location. This is a good one for the sights and local flavor of Baltimore. However, there are many others that are just as convenient, cleaner and are not directly across the street from a women's center. Homeless people like to congregate there. Homeless people are all over the city, it's a big city, it is unavoidable. However if you are going to drop $100+ a night you should get a heads up that it's possible packs of them will be in your face when you leave the hotel via the front door. They don't \"harass\" but they do hover around you and will ask for food, money or whatever. The homeless are people and deserve respect and a measure of understanding, but there is a large amount of mentally ill homeless and frankly I don't feel safe walking through 4-5 homeless men at 8pm on a street I barely know in an unfamiliar city.This would not be an issue if you could actually park at the hotel. The tiny little underground parking is like a real live game of traffic. I had no trouble parking, but I can actually parallel park, and back into a spot. Many other people are apparently unable to do this. So, even though you paid 15$ and they tell you that you will have a spot its more of a YMMV sort of thing. They make this better by saying \"We don't charge you until you check out\". Wow, but you do place a hold on my card for the cash, and you do tell me I have a spot...alrighty then. I can completely see how this is my fault, thank you for allowing me to park three blocks away and walk back to the rat hole that is my current abode. They know which guest is parked wonky and can ask them to come park UNwonky, but why exert effort or care. It's only a guest after all, and it would interrupt the little social circle they have happening behind the front desk. You get a free breakfast every morning for every guest. It was hit and miss. Day one eggs were good, bacon was burnt. Day two Eggs were burnt bacon appeared ok, but then we both ended up puking bacon chunks for the remainder of the morning. Tomorrow I am just going to go hungry till I grab something from the terminal food providers. So tomorrow, I check out at 5am and walk the 5 blocks to my car. I am sure every step away from this dump will be a pleasant one. The real shame is, I wanted to love this place. I am tired of the same old hotel chain cookie cutter boredom. I bought inot the hype and truly thought this would add a level of excitement and novelty to my trip here. Oh how horribly wrong I was.

What more could you ask for? Renovated rooms, AC was fine (although a bit too cold), the hallways had no AC but I didn't mind (saves the environment and energy). The main lobby had a nice mini grand piano (out of tune) with very friendly and inviting staff. I had a very good stay here and even the walk to the convention center is not that far. Otherwise you can hop onto the free shuttle bus or take public transit ($1.60/ride). My friends and I were extremely impressed with the clean and spacious rooms and the amazing service.

Although the hotel has very friendly front desk staff, is well-located, has parking available (for a fee), has free hot breakfast, and has clean rooms with all of the basics, I would not stay here again because of three problems with the physical plant itself that make it an undesireable place to stay. First, the hotel building does not have modern HVAC. This means only one form of climate control can be turned on at a time for the whole building, as the front desk staff explained to me when I called from my room which was 80 degrees and had all the drapes wide open letting in all the heat from the sun when I entered it. Although we visited in November, the temperatures were in the 60s and 70s, which is not at all unusual for this region of the country. Instead of having the heat on for the whole property, it would have been much better to have it off at least during the day so that the temperature would have been closer to bearable. I was not informed of this climate control situation when I made the reservation (through Hotwire, to whom I have also written about the issue) or when I checked in at the front desk. Unfortunately because I was not informed, I entered the very hot room (est. upper 80s at least) and immediately turned on the A/C, not having any way to know that this would cause the fan to just pump more hot air into the room, because the A/C was disabled completely. There was no signage on the thermostat/climate control knobs in the room to inform me of this fact. The response of the front desk was apologetic, and they did send up a fan, but the fan was very weak and in no way sufficient to cool the room. The temperature made it uncomfortable to even just sit and try and relax in. It turned the room into a sauna: if you showered (with bathroom door closed) and then came out of the shower you would just end up sweating immediately. In fact, the room was so uncomfortable that we ended up propping the door open while we were in it and awake, just to let some of the air from the corridor in. The room discomfort resulted in us altering some plans and leaving Baltimore before we had planned to leave. Second problem: The room we had faced the street and there is no soundproofing to speak of so it was very difficult to sleep from the street noise plus the heat. This noise problem did not really become apparent until all of the Friday night/early Saturday morning street noise commotion with sirens etc. started, when everyone in the room was quiet and in bed trying to sleep - which of course is not the time you want to get up, get dressed, and find out if there is possibly another room available away from the street. I take melatonin as a sleep aid, which works very well for me, but the noise was an impediment to sleep that melatonin could not overcome. Third: The parking deck, which costs $15 per night and is under the hotel so it must be accessed by going around a couple of blocks because of the one way streets, is very cramped with spaces that are very tight and awkwardly position and thus very difficult to navigate and park in. Also, on exiting the deck, there is some concrete lump or something that scrapes the underside of your car badly on the way out. I have to go get my car looked at now, and I am very concerned that damage was done. I drive a Nissan Altima, which is probably average clearance from the ground and I would not expect to encounter such a problem with a parking structure. As I said, the hotel is well-located, has friendly front desk staff, and clean rooms with all the basic furnishings and fixtures you would expect for the hotel class. The staff was helpful, even printing out my concert ticket confirmation sheet that I mistakenly left at home, and calling a cab for me when I needed one. However, the bottom line is this: it is hard to predict the weather, and I want to be in control of the room temperature when I travel so that I am able to enjoy the room and shower and sleep in comfort. The street noise and parking issues are also factors with decrease the desireability of the room, but lack of climate control is the biggest negative.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice historic hotel in heart of Mt Vernon District\u201d", "Author": "Visitor58350", "ReviewID": "UR85656849", "Content": "Friendly hotel staff, good breakfast in lobby cafe, great location in Mt Vernon District of downtown Baltimore.

My first impression was positive. Although small, the lobby has the atmosphere of an intimate, European boutique hotel with a nice seating area to the left and tables and chairs that spill out from the cafeteria on the right. When we arrived, at about 7:00 p.m., there was one clerk behind the counter helping a customer and a woman in line ahead of me. Another woman stood off to the side, looking as though she was waiting for someone, and when I walked up she asked me if I was checking in. When I said yes, she said, \"Then let me help get everyone registered.\" Turns out she was the manager, and although she was ready to leave for the day, she returned to the counter to expedite our registration. That is the kind of customer service you rarely see these days, and I was very impressed. Charm City, indeed. Registration was speedy (I had a reservation) and I was further impressed with the parking facilities, which had an elevator that led right up to the lobby as well as to the hotel floors. The front desk staff provided a card to place on your dashboard, which also included clear and explicit directions to the garage. It is attached to the hotel, but because of all the one-way streets in Baltimore, it takes a couple of turns to access it. It is small -- which I actually liked, since it meant less walking and quicker departures -- but I can see that, from what another reviewer said who was not able to secure a spot, its size could be problematic. I didn't price any other parking facilities, but I thought that $15 a day was very reasonable for a city hotel. Service continued to be efficient: at registration, the clerk made a call to housekeeping to bring extra towels and a rollaway to our room; by the time I had parked the car and made my way upstairs (no more than 10-15 minutes, tops), the addtional towels were in the bathroom and my son was happily ensconced on the extra bed. Towels were good sized and nice and fluffy, too -- not the thin, skimpy things you sometimes find at hotels. Our room was also to our satisfaction. The decor was very updated and had a high end feel: very nice desk and chair, TV armoire, 2 upholstered chairs with small side table, brass lamps. Not the Four Seasons, of course, but definitely at least equal to most good quality hotel chains. We all agreed, however, that the desk area definitely needed more lighting. Room was not huge, but even with 5 adults and the rollaway we never felt cramped. Bathroom was very clean with a marble vanity that gave it a touch of elegance. My only complaint is that I found the beds too hard, and the rollaway too thin and soft, but I am very picky about my mattress; it is a problem I have at many hotels. The central location of the hotel was also great. It was a short ride to Lexington Market in one direction (we could even have walked it, but had later destinations that required a car, so we drove the few blocks) and to Antiques Row in the other. My husband and sons caught the Light Rail a few blocks over to catch a game at Camden Yards, which worked beautifully. The hotel is virtually across the street from the Walters Art Museum, and Harborplace is also just down the road. I was really surprised by some of the other reviewers' comments that the area is not safe. I did not have that impression at all. Although it is certainly not in an exclusive neighborhood by any means, it seemed fine to me; pretty much what I would expect to find in a large downtown area. We thought the breakfast was also good. Each guest is given a ticket for one hot meal per day of stay, served to you in cafeteria style. Each day of our stay it included ordinary but well-cooked scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage, as well as some really excellent potatoes. One day it also included french toast, and the other pancakes, which we found to be just OK. Next time I would probably skip those and just ask for more potoates -- yum! Also available -- and not limited by a ticket -- were bagels, english muffins, toast, cold cereal, and packages of instant oatmeal and grits. Peanut butter, assorted jellies, and cream cheese were provided and, contrary to the experience of one reviewer, so were cups of yogurt and canned and frest fruit. I was also very pleased by the choice of juice that was offered -- orange, grape, cranberry, apple and (my favorite!) grapefruit. We did not eat in the cafeteria for any other meals (except that my son purchased a beer one night, which was nice to have available), but the prices I saw seemed very reasonable. All in all, a happy stay and a place I would definitely visit again. The young man from the American Visionary Art Museum (our first stop in Baltimore and a really cool place) who gave us directions said his parents stay there every time they come to see him.

We chose the Mount Vernon Hotel for it's affordability and reasonable proximity to Baltimore's Inn Harbor and other attractions. Not being familiar with the area, and also wanted to do more relaxing than site seeing, we chose two excursions; The National Aquarium and a visit to Edgar Allan Poe's grave at the Westminster. We were told by the concierge that the Aquarium was with in walking distance -- this walk was the equivalent of a marathon. Walking in the blazing heat uphill is not what I would consider \"reasonable\" as they were unable to give us specific directions. We also inquired at the front desk as to the location of EA Poe's grave. The gentleman on duty was unsure but offered to do a google search and print walking directions, stating that it would take no more than 6 minutes. Our 6 minute walk turned into nearly 90 minutes and we ended up at a police station no where near the cemetery. This directional failure then forced us to spend $40 on a cab ride to back track the entire route. In addition to a blatant lack of information, the hotel was not equipped with basic essentials such as glasses (not plastic cups), or real utensils (again, not plastic). We inquired as to where such items could be purchased and the suggestions were slim. Despite the aforementioned issues, the staff was very friendly and quite adept at uncorking wine bottles. Staff aside, since the heat was near volcanic temperatures during our stay, the garbage at the hotel was beginning to noticeably fester, leaving a pungent odor in the loby and elevators. The facility itself, however, was clean. The rooms were also clean and very well maintained. There is no room service in this hotel, parking is $15 per day and the \"restaurant\" is more of miniature cafeteria. I would not recommend eating here despite the offer of a free breakfast.

We've made at least 15 visits in the last four years so have plenty of hotels to compare. Because our visit fell on the same weekend as the Preakness, we knew things were going to fill up fast. Seeing the positive reviews here, I decided to book Mount Vernon Hotel because of location, price and because it included Wi-Fi and breakfast. Most of that turned out to be true. The hotel is very beautiful, the rooms clean and the staff exceedingly helpful. But due to their being completely booked, we had some issues. This hotel used to be a YMCA and the rooms are not uniform, so I should have thought to ask for a room with a window--I've never thought of not having one and how claustrophobic it would feel. So, Night #1 in the first room: low ceiling, no window, no closet (not even a coat hook for our dress clothes) no working WiFi, broken coffee pot and a telephone that kept inexplicably buzzing (as if the phone was off the hook) until we pulled its plug. The lamps, etc. were sort of second-hand shop. We also paid for the hotel parking lot that night, but pulled our car into the garage to find that they have about 15 spaces for the entire hotel, and they were all taken. We had to pay for another lot across the street. The desk clerk took the charge off the room. (We aren't complainers, we just didn't want to pay for parking that didn't exist.) In the morning, I asked if we could be moved to another room if one became available because my husband was really claustrophobic. Since it was now Sunday night, they did have enough checkouts and we could move. They had us call later in the day and had new room keys for us when we returned to the hotel that night. Night #2 was a completely different situation. The new room had a closet, very nice furnishings, a window (!) and the WiFi signal was strong. The coffee pot even worked! The breakfast was great both mornings, with an actual cafeteria with hot food including french toast, eggs, bacon/sausage and hash browns. Staff was very very nice at every interaction. There is so much to do within walking distance that I would like to stay there again when we have more free time. So, make sure you ask for a room with a window!

There was a long line at check in which finally another staff memeber helped with . I asked if we had the king loft and he informed me we did and when went to room it had 2 Queens. Went back out to lobby and had to wait in long line again. No problem with changing room but no apology. Now for the biggest disappointment. The \" loft\" is nothing like the picture on the internet. There was 1 small love seat and a television. We were hoping for ample room for 7 people ( as the internet pictures show) We were late for dinner so did not notify management. We were also told we could park across the street for 4$ a day or in their garage for 14$. When we came back to hotel around 11:30 the garage across the st. was closed and the hotel garage had no spaces. It is very small and difficult to manuever your car. We had to drive back around a few blocks and pull over to go in and inform management. Carl was very pleasant and said that he was leaving and let us have his spot. It took us more than 1/2 hr to finally park the car. It was very cold in our room and just to inform you the heat control is up in the loft which we did not realize until morning. The register by the bed blew cold air which we turned off. I had read good reviews about the breakfast buffet but they must have been short staffed that Sun. Runs from 7-10am. At 9 they were out of bacon and potatoes, \"would take 15 min,\" took 1/2 hr for potatoes. No milk for cereal, people were using coffee creamer. No bread or toast for 1/2 hr and then staff put out 5 bagels. There were probably 30 people present at this time. Very poor Overall very disappointed with experience. We only see our friends one weekend a yr. They come from Wisconsin and our son's apt is too small for all of us to visit in. We spent almost $200.00 to stay there and it definitely was not worth the price. I guess for the 100.00 it would have been sufficient for a regular room but the breakfast would still have been an issue. We come to Baltimore frequently and will not stay there again.

While he waited in the car I went and checked in. You can park at the entrance temporarily (you'll need to in order to check in and then get a pass to the parking garage) but he stayed there just in case there was an issue. The hotel is four blocks from the First Mariner Arena, and not in a very good looking neighborhood (my husband was approached by someone wanting a ride). The hotel lobby is very clean and the receptionist was prompt and polite. She gave coupons for breakfast and a paper on how to get to the parking garage. You have to go around the block to get to the parking garage, and then since it is closed, you need to \"honk horn once for entry\". In our case it was more like five times, with perhaps 1 minute intervals between honks (the receptionist can hear the honking and presses a button to open the garage). The parking garage is a very very small, very very compact, with not a lot of spaces. I have a Subaru Forester and I do not want to ever go back there with a car that size. A compact car would be \"ok\" in this garage, as its a very very tight squeeze. I found a good parking spot (which wasn't very good when it came time to leave). The only thing good about the garage is it is enclosed and somewhat secure. Our room was very clean, though no refrigerator or microwave. They had extra pillows in the drawers. My only con against the rooms is that there are a few channels, and the TV Power button was broken (the power button on the remote worked fine). The hotel has a very good buffet. The food was excellent and the area was clean. For lunch I had beef and a roll. The beef was very tender and made my mouth water. For dinner I had the chicken and noodles, and that too was very good. Checking out was a breeze, however leaving the parking garage was a pain that I would rather not go through again. With the tight fit of the Forester, I had no more than an inch to spare on each side pulling out of a very tight parking spot. I enlisted the help of my husband and a very helpful employee to get out of my parking spot. I had another tight spot I had to maneuver around (we didn't leave the hotel to sight see like we wanted to mainly because of the parking garage, and the area did not look too \"safe\" to walk around in) and then I got to the garage door. It automatically opens so no wait for the receptionist to hear our honking. Overall, I LOVE the hotel. I absolutely hate the parking garage, so if you either have a compact car, have someone else driving, or take a cab, you should be ok. As I said, the area itself doesn't look too safe, so I wouldn't recommend it for the solo traveler. I would rate this five stars if they had more channels, a fridge, and a better parking garage.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boone, NC", "Title": "\u201cdirty and awful\u201d", "Author": "johgoodrich", "ReviewID": "UR23071207", "Content": "Smoke free room?

Vernon Hotel for one night the day after Christmas. I'd selected it for it's proximity to the Walters Art Museum, which is one block over from it. I called directly to place my reservation and asked for a smoke free room. I was pleased to be told the entire facility is smoke free. The directions to get there from rte 83 were simple. On arrival, I was given simple instructions to drive around the block to the parking garage in the basement. The parking garage area is unstaffed, and therefore a safety concern to a woman traveling alone. It is well lit, reasonably clean, and odor free. On check in, the assistant manager working the desk was friendly and personable, I was given a keycard and voucher for breakfast in the cafeteria and a tourist map of Baltimore. I went up to my assigned room and found it to be quite cold in the room. The heating controls were prominently located and simple to operate and when turned on let out a strong blast of hot air. The room lights were quite dim (60 watt bulbs in dark shades). Even with all four room lightsources on I would not have been comfortable reading in that inadequate light. My mother, who has poorer vision than I do and who fortunately was not with me, would have found the dim lighting an unacceptable handicap. While messing with the lights I determined why the room was so cold with the heat blower off. It's an old building with marble slab windowsills -- formal and elegant and cold as ice to touch. I don't envy them their heating bills trying to overcome a building full of such heatsink windowsills. I left the room to go see the Washington Monument (about two blocks away) and as I exited, I automaticly reached back to be sure the door had locked. It had not locked, and I spent the next 5 minutes trying to get it to lock without success. I went down to speak with the assistant manager at the check in desk. He was horrified, and immediately swiched my room to another on the same floor. While he and I were speaking, I observed some college age young men enter with a case of beer and get on the elevator. I commented that it looked like there would be a party tonite. The assistant manager who had just told me he was moving me to 305 noted my comment and handed me a keycard for 318, saying 305 would be too close to the party. I never heard any party noise at all. 318 was just as dimly lit and just as cold on entry as my original room, but 318's heat blower was also quite strong and the room reached a comfortable temperature quickly. All carpeting appeared brand new both in rooms and in halls. Bedding, bathroom and elevator were all clean. The shower controls required experimentation to master, but there was lots of hot water with excellent water pressure and showerheads that adjusted to power stream if wanted. The choice of TV channels were minimal (about 20) and the weather channel was via sattelite and therefore did not have local weather which was annoying.

We booked the hotel apprehensively after reading some of the reviews here on trip advisor: ceilings falling down, only three legs on beds and so on, we figured it may be an adventure!! Arrived to be greeted by really lovely helpful staff who checked us in quickly and gave us good tips on where to get lunch and how to get to the harbour etc. Very friendly. Got a slow lift up to our hotel room which was (as others have mentioned) on an otherwise rather quiet floor. Opened the room door and were greeted to a fab room, much bigger than (maybe 3 times the size!!) our room in NYC. TV in a huge wooden lush unit, floor lamps, nice new carpet (we've experienced some awful sticky carpet... eww), clean immaculate comfy beds, lovely clean bathroom, we couldnt fault the actual room or the air con etc. We went out for dinner that night to the harbour and came back late to the hotel.

Although it is about a 12-15 minute walk to the harbor and convention center, the hotel was by far the best value I could find in the area. It is an older building, but that gives it a lot of charm and interest. It is beautifully decorated in the main entrance and there is a great contenental breakfast in the morning (waffles, cereal, bagels, yogurt, fresh fruit, etc.) in a separate dining room with lots of decorations and flurishes. My room was complete with a great King size bed, beautiful solid wood furniture, decent size TV, new carpet, and a newly renovated, clean, and nicely adorned bathroom. My wife loved the lighting and mirror in the bathroom and said she would stay again just for the bathroom, if nothing else. The room had the usual freebies of shampoo, conditioner, etc. and had a hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. There was free wireless internet too. We stayed in the first week of June and it was scorching hot outside, but our room was comfortable and the air-conditioning was perfect. Cleanliness is very important to me in a hotel, and the Mount Vernon was one of the cleaner hotels I have stayed at in a while. The staff at the desk was helpful and always in good cheer. Probably my biggest complaint was that there was only one elevator working at the time I was there, which made things slow at times. Often I took the stairs to the 6th floor, rather than wait. However, in fairness, there was a construction crew fixing the elevator the day I checked out, so this might not be a permanent problem. There is parking available in a garage below the hotel and there is a small fee for that. The hotel is not too far from some nice little shops and restaurants in the area and a cab ride to the harbor is less than $5. Overall, if you like the charm of early 20th century architecture and are not looking for the usual Holiday Inn generic hotel, this place can make for a pleasant and memorable stay. We would definitely stay there again if we go back to the Baltimore Harbor area.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel - clean, attractive room, & good value\u201d", "Author": "buddmar", "ReviewID": "UR17268902", "Content": "I like staying in the Mount Vernon district of Baltimore, \"midtown\" about 8 or 9 blocks from the Inner Harbor.

We had some sewage backup when we arrived and asked for a change of room. They refused that request and instead sent up a third-rate maintenence man. He roto-rootered the prblem out, but it left the room smelling very bad. Later that evening the same problem re-surfaced. Again we complained and asked for a change of rooms and again they refused.
