We wanted a Hotel with a bathroom in the room, and some assurance of relatively sturdy walls (mostly in consideration of the neighbors; I am a world class snorer), without paying the same rate as for the Ritz.. We were pleasantly surprised when received a very generous bedroom with an attached drawing room overlooking the street; the bathroom was well appointed; and the queen sized bed was very firm. The location is great: It is a short walk downhill to the museums on the Paseo El Prado. Puerto Del Sol and the Plaza Mayor are also close by. There is a business center nearby on Plaza Canalejas if you need to check email or print boarding passes, or else the Starbucks has free internet (with purchase). The windows have security blinds, and the double doors between bedroom and drawing room could be closed to add reasonable protection against street noise. It was very quiet on a regular weekday night. However, the party atmosphere that developed in the Centro neighborhood on a warm Friday in April was both friendly and massive. We joined in and toured the neighborhoods, but returned to the hotel relatively early (after midnight), since we had a flight the next day. We do not hold the hotel responsible for the full throated men's chorus who was chucking empty bottles into metal bins at about 4:00 AM in the street. We recommend the hotel's standard continental breakfast. It is a positive pleasure to be able to pour a warm-up on your coffee. You might be able to find a lower priced meal at a nearby cafe, but you are more likely to spend twice as much on Madrid's equivalent of bacon, eggs, and hash browns, and your server wouldn't think of giving you seconds on your coffee.

We were looking for 3 night s,at the last minute, on a busy Easter holiday week, in the center of Madrid. We tried a few favourite hotels (as well as trying to book train tickets to get to Madrid) and everything was fully booked. I found this hotel through Bookings.com for around 70 euro, a nice bargain! Thank goodness for the reviews of Trip Advisor that I can rely on to find out if we would be paying for heaven or hell. The room we were given - for around 70 euro a night - was generous in size with a nice big bed. It was all very clean, though at that time of day, when we arrived, there was a smell which seemed to be coming up from the plumbing. (It's an old hotel in an old part of town and this was understandable, especially since the odor it wasn't permanent.)Our room had to have been built in the 70's ,which I found perfectly fine; nostalgically reminding me of the first time I ever came to Madrid. Breakfast is very, very basic, but if you need something more exciting, there are plenty of great tapas bars and restaurants in that area. We found the staff - most being from South America, and NOT Spanish - neither friendly nor disagreeable. They were a bit 'dry' in character and reception. They seemed to have been hired more on keeping things organized, in order, and tranquilo in such a 'live' neighborhood than on personality and warmness. They were wary and cautious at night because the hotel is in the heart of Madrid in a 'zona de copas' which is an area with lots of clubs and bars, thus being a magnet for a lot of party animals who can often spontaneously start a 'street party'. Thus the staff is also 'guarding' this small hotel to make sure the party stays in the street. It also means that unless you ask for a room away from the street you'd be better off sleeping late when things start to get quiet. (Though you should be cautious in any big city nowadays, the area of the hotel isn't rough, just lively!) Being in the center meant that so many interesting things were accesible on foot.

Hotel is very close (100m) to Santa Anna square which is a great spot to eat outside. The old roomsare more basic in decor.

The area around the hotel is filled with restaurants and tourists. Many stores were within a couple of blocks. A good choice, but it might be quieter and less expensive to use Madrid's excellent subway system and stay a bit outside the most central area.

As in all the buildings in Madrid, the bathrooms are pretty old, but well kept and the water pressure is pretty good. The biggest drawback is the fact that they have no air conditioners.
