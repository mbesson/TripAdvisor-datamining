I love its location (close to great cafes, supermarkets and Kings Cross station). The rooms are small, but functional and well appointed. But I have noticed a considerable decline in the level of service and attention to detail over the past few months. For example, the rooms (supposed to be cleaned daily) are sporadically serviced... bins not emptied, vacuuming not done, toiletries not replaced. On my last stay, it took three days for the microwave in the room to be repaired. I had bought food to cook in the microwave and ended up having to throw it out as well as buy dinner out. I've found the staff to be fairly unhelpful when I raise issues of concern.

The tidy flip-top Brabantia stainless bins have been replaced with super-sized large plastic ones you can't hide anywhere, and the crockery, cutlery and glassware is mis-match of leftovers more fitting in a college sharehouse. The exclusive balcony I paid extra for was frequented by late night revellers who left empty beer bottles and full ashtrays as a calling card. I moved the outdoor table and the leg fell off, seriously. I was informed rooms aren't serviced on public holidays. Well, people travel on public holidays and generally want a clean towel.

I was in Sydney for a mix of business and pleasure. I was pretty excited about this hotel as the location is superb, the concept is modern, and it has a gorgeous view from the roof top terrace. Also, the staff seem young and friendly. Upon my arrival I was offered to borrow a car from a friend to use during my visit in Sydney. I asked the girl in the reception if the room came with complimentary parking. She wasn't sure and asked the manager who said I was lucky as there was just one space left and handed me the access card for the parking area. I was thrilled and considered it my lucky day. I continued checking in and got my room. I was pretty disappointed with getting a room in the ground floor but brushed it of and focused on enjoying the vibrant location and atmosphere. The room itself was clean and neat. It was a bit of a disappointment that they do not offer complimentary wifi (this is 2012 step up your game). Also, they were not very flexible with late check for some reason. My main complaint is in regards to my check out. As I was about to check out the girl hands me a bill for the parking of $80 (for two nights)!! I was completely stunned as I was under the impression that parking was complimentary, and I asked them specifically when I arrived. The girl got confused and confused and called the manager who happened to be the same guy who handed me the card the day I arrived. Well he suddenly wasn't as friendly any more. Matter of fact he was rude and obnoxious and basically called me a liar in front of his staff and other guests in the reception, claiming that if he was the one giving me the access card he would OBVIOUSLY have informed me about the price. I tried to explain to him that if I had known the cost I would have taken the access card as I could have managed just fine without borrowing the car. However, I stopped arguing with him as he was just making me too uncomfortable and honestly just wanted to get out of there. He charged $40 and I corrected him and said I was there for two night and paid him the $80. Now why would I correct him and paid the full amount if I was such a liar? Pretty humiliating experience. I don't know if they get a lot of dodgy guests trying to scam them but I certainly do not appreciate being spoken to like that, I am certainly not a dishonest person, and I do not like paying for services I did not agree on.

All I can say is, to get there u get off at Kings Cross and the hotel is accessed by an alley which lies between two entrances to Kings Cross Station. But it's a handy location with bars close by and and perhaps a few strip clubs and adult shops will be to your liking. There is plenty of food to be had in the area too and a very good fresh fruit and meat market diagonally across the alley/street from thhe hotel. The hotel itself was very clean and well presented. We stayed in room 234 on the second floor. Our original room was in the basement which was very nice except for the fact the bathroom sink was almost directly on top of the toilet giving anyone over 5 feet in height and 15 stone in weight a bit of a challenge when using the facilities. Staff were very helpful in moving us when this little problem was brought to their attention. Room 234 was at front of hotel but we didn't hear too much of the screaming and cheering out on the street with the window closed. Air con was great, fridge and small kitchenette very handy, lovely comfortable bed. Only problem in the room is the floor of the en-suite gets a bit slippy after a shower with care to be taken not to be doing summersaults. We sat out on the roof garden one of the evenings and had a pleasant view of Sydney whilst tucking into a take-away.

Accommodation in Sydney is expensive, but for me this really did not represent value for money. Average nightly rate (we stayed 4 nights) was around \u00c2\u00a3170 for a distinctly average room. Here's what you need to know: the rooms are small, the bathroom is TINY with a miniscule sink that my husband struggled to use for shaving. The kitchenette counter area is ok, but don't expect to be able to cook comfortably. We just about managed a cooked breakfast. The standard of cleaning is poor: dusty surfaces, a stain on the quilt (which incidentally is not covered by a quilt cover, but by a strange arrangement of folded sheets), and basin not cleaned in the daily servicing. Oh and a dead cockroach in one of the drawers, though they are apparently very common in Sydney and at least it was dead! We mentioned this on departure and were asked why we hadn't complained before. Fair point - but as the reception is not open 24 hours, this had some practical difficulties for us and it wasn't so severe that we wanted to plan our schedule around lodging a complaint. We were assured that the manager would be notified and would follow up with us, but this hasn't happened and we checked out about 10 days ago. To me, this felt like an \u00c2\u00a380 per night property, not one with a \u00c2\u00a3170+ price tag. Redeeming features are proximity to the Botanical Gardens and Opera House, and easy access to a station. For the location, it is actually surprisingly quiet as it is down a side street. That is provided the air con doesn't start a strange knocking/ticking sound as it did on our second night, which we eventually solved by removing the key card from the electric slot by the door.

I booked through the hotel's website but after having stayed there I think that it was not good value for money, particularly considering that there was no breakfast or WiFi included in the rate. As far as I can tell, the location is all that this property has going for it. You're bang in the middle of the red light district, but still tucked away a bit. The King's Cross subway station is a brief stroll away and there is a taxi stand located very close by as well. I checked in at 10:30 PM and I chalked up their lack of enthusiasm to the late hour.

This is because I was on a tight schedule and knew that I wasn't going to spend a lot of time at the hotel (for example I checked in at 10:30 PM and was back out by 10:45 PM. So I am giving the management the benefit of the doubt. The room was fair enough, for a basement affair. It was quite spacious and there were a lot of mirrors too. The 'upgraded' room included a miniscule outdoor patio that was completely unusable unless you were a compulsive smoker. There was a couch in one nook next to a kitchenette, and a TV suspended along one wall. The carpet felt a bit dirty. But the worst part by far was the bathroom. Another reviewer initially mistook the bathroom for the closet, and that is exactly right. It looked like an ad-hoc affair that was coming apart at the seams. The Thumbelina sink was nigh on impossible to use and the shower curtain did nothing to keep the water from spraying everywhere. Thankfully, the shower door was slightly raised, otherwise I'm sure the room would have been flooded. Worse yet, the bathroom did not seem clean. There were stains everywhere and it really did look like bits and pieces were about to come apart, particularly from the ceiling and the corners. There was barely room to turn around in there, and I'm a slight-built Asian guy - I can't imagine how a bulkier person would have fared in there.

We chose Quest to be near to a New Year's Eve party so we could walk home without worrying about the lack of taxis. If it weren't for this location benefit we would have moved out and not suffered the troubled 3 night stay. We should point out that at New Year's peak season all room prices are increased ridiculously and the hotel was full. That meant we were paying US$450 for a moderate sized room in a small hotel with few facilities (no pool, room service, no free wifi). We were initially in a petite suite but swapped rooms with a single friend travelling with us as a petite suite was absurdly small for 2 people and luggage. Most disappointing was management's handling of issues. It was high summer and 30C++ outside and our room had a malfunctioning aircon unit - which staff would not admit. Despite paying US$450 we had to 'sleep' sweating with just a small electric fan on high speed for 2 nights. Staff's initial response was that it was my fault for turning the aircon temp too low (at 17C) so they restarted the aircon claiming that would fix it. The room was like a sauna at this point. We reported it not working again later that day and were told a technician had checked it and reported it was fine. We struggled on with the fan. We were standing in the much cooler hallway and overheard guests in a nearby room with the door open also complaining about the lack of aircon so we know we weren't alone. It was obvious the aircon unit required a re-gas to fix the problem. If management had just admitted the problem, apologised for the discomfort and offered us some recompense starting with a room discount, free breakfast and wifi, we would have been more understanding. Technical issues on a public holiday do happen and can be resolved if you work with guests. Blaming them and hiding the problem to avoid any financial impact has the opposite effect.

We found the hotel difficult to find as the address is not recognised on GPS but we phoned the reception and they gave us directions to the hotel. Check in was great, they upgraded our room to a deluxe, on the bottom floor with a 'balcony'. While the balcony didn't get used (there was only views of the building next door) it was a nice option. The room itself was massive, nicely decked out, the staff are fantastic and extremely helpful. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night and after reading other reviews thought there might be issues with noise/seedy characters around the hotel. Did not have this problem at all, and because the hotel is one street back from Darlinghurst Road, it was in a quiet little area. The only fault I could find about the entire stay was the size of the bathroom and where it was located. The bathroom is right next to the head of the bed and is tiny. I can deal with a small bathroom but this was by far the smallest I have ever had to use. It was also annoying having the toilet right next to the bedhead - inconvenient waking up the person next to you because you had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Loved it, but not sure I would come back because of the size of the bathroom.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "gold coast, queensland", "Title": "\u201cA little disappointed\u201d", "Author": "jabbablue", "ReviewID": "UR83550188", "Content": "We booked this hotel through a last minute deal website.

We were in a small but relatively pleasant \"superior\" room on the 4th floor for the first two nights. The air conditioner dripped water onto the carpet both nights (the staff attempted to fix it after we reported it the first morning after arrival). The bathroom was tiny and the shower leaked water over the floor. The hot water was spotty. After returning from a day's sightseeing on the second day we were informed by the front desk staff, without apology, that there had been an insect problem in the room next door and they had to fumigate our room. This probably explained the bites my wife had received overnight. The staff had entered our room, packed up our belongings, and moved them to a new room (number 122 on the first floor). When we noted that we would have to go up to retrieve the contents of the safe, we were told the staff had opened the safe and gave us two envelopes with the money, passports and other items we had left in the safe. What good is an in-room safe if the staff can open it? The second room was even smaller than the first, with a miniscule TV (don't believe their website indicating that each room has a 23 inch TV), no room for a bedside lamp on one side, and at most 15 cm between the bed and the wall. The windows looked out onto another apartment building so there was no privacy with the blinds up. When I asked what was the difference between a standard and superior room (for which we paid a higher rate) I was told at the front desk that superior rooms had two-burner cooktops. The website shows a picture of a superior room with a small table and two chairs. This was not what we received in return for the superior rate. This is the first time in decades of travel that we have experienced a hotel management that has actually downgraded our room as compensation for a problem caused by the hotel itself. If we had not prepaid the room we would have checked out immediately and gone to one of the hotels in the central business district (which incidentally are competitively priced compared to the Quest Potts Point). Also keep in mind the location. While we were there the Sydney media carried stories about increased police presence on King's Cross in anticipation of possible heightened gang activity.

For a really great breakfast go Uliveto on Bayswater ( 2 blocks away ) http://www.eatability.com.au/au/sydney/uliveto-cafe/map.htm great all day breakfast. As well, for a nice drink at night The Piano Bar was great. The amount of people at night in Kings Cross at first is a little intimidating but I quickly got used to it The Rooms I love the look of these rooms After living in boutique hotels why would I go back? The other type of standard hotel would bore me to tears. What puzzles me is the decor of the breakfast room when you first arrive. It does not suit the hotel at all and if it were as funky as the rooms it would probably be used way more often. The Staff Amazing.

We waited over half an hour and had to call her back - to find that she had not done it. With a hotel this quiet this is not really acceptable.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from the USA, and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get used to espresso and latte. I got to taking a cup up to the roof-top deck in the morning.

The hotel location made it really easy to catch a cab or walk downtown (about 20 minutes). Be sure to check out the great reef deck, which offers an awesome view of downtown! The only thing I would caution on is to ask for extra towels because the curtain does not do a great job to keeping water from the shower off of the bathroom floor.

My brother lives in Potts point and this is the hotel he setup for us. We got an Executive Twin Suite because it had 2 queen beds. The location is excellent. Other reviewers have commented about the location being dodgy because it's adjacent to a red light disctrict. We did not find this to be true for us, as whenever we exited the hotel, we headed left/left, which took us immediately to a trendy neighbourhood with neat inexpensive restaurants and backpacker hostels. The staff was very friendly. Secure card key access is required after hours. Our room I was really pleased to see that one of the Queen beds was in an alcove with a large floor to ceiling retractable curtain, so my daughter could close this off and it seemed like she had her own small room. The Good - Great staff (especially Rebecca) - Mini kitchen (microwave, fridge, dishes, sink) - 2 full bathrooms with stand-up showers - 2 Flat screen TVs (one per bed) - Clock radio with iPod dock - Wired internet (seemed fast) & moderately priced - Seemed very sound-proof - Beds very comfortable - Ventilation very good - Very clean and seems well cared for - Water temperature and pressure excellent - Room was very clean, modern and well decorated To Improve: - The shower needs a better seperator so that water doesn't splash on the bathroom floor Conclusion: It was hard to find anything I didn't like about the Storrier (now Quest). The whole vibe of this place feels right. TIP: If you lik to walk or jog, just minutes from the Storrier is a large flight of stairs (on one of the streets), which take you right down to the water front. We found this to be a great early morning jog or walk. If you want to do a nice \"out and back\" jog, you can easily get right to the Sydney Opera house and back, mostly on walking paths and it's 8KM.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cTerrific value; great ambience and facilities\u201d", "Author": "Phoenix2Sydney", "ReviewID": "UR23621355", "Content": "Firstly, the management of this hotel has been taken over by Quest Apartments (www.questpottspoint.com.au). So far as I can tell, however, nothing has been changed in the excellent decor, and customer service. I agree that the rooms are quite small, but the really clever use of space, colour, and mirrors totally compensates. For a hotel that was refurbished about 2 years ago, it is still in 'as new' condition and a great deal better than many 4 or even 5 star properties. The addition of comprehensive cooking facilities just adds to the appeal, though with so many of Sydney's best restaurants just around the corner, one hardly needs to bother. But the offering of vacuum packed ground coffee to feed the coffee press in the room was extremely welcome on waking up. If you want to enjoy a takeaway, there is a great rooftop terrace with a magnificent view of the city. Comments about noise will depend on which room you get. The more expensive ones with picture windows do look out on the street and could be noisy at weekends. Mine was a superior studio facing a side alley - and therefore a wall some 10 feet away, but the compensation was total silence at night. The bed is very comfortable, the bathroom quite sharp and practical, and the presence of limited cable to supplement the free TV channels is a plus as is the availability of broadband. The comments about the safety of the area will depend on what you find challenging. Yes, Kings Cross is the primary nightlife area, so there may be rowdy people, and there are sex shops, but to suggest it is basically unsafe is entirely incorrect. It is so busy and well-policed that you are more likely to be robbed in the Sydney city centre which tends to die after working hours. Also it must be said that if you turn the other way down Macleay Street, you will be in an area which has become very gentrified over the past few years and offers some of Sydneys best cafes, restaurants, and shopping. If it is entertainment you want, then the other direction leads to the best nightclubs. Great value at A$145 per night (approx US$100).

We booked directly with the hotel for a \"petite studio\" for 140 AUS/ 98 US per night, and were very happy with our decision. We took the Skybus from the airport, which was great because it dropped us right in front of the hotel, but the place is really close to the King's Cross subway station but a little tricky to find, especially if you are jetlagged! The room was tiny but well appointed and pristine. Although it was so small, it felt luxurious anyway because they really got it right with the details. The bed was comfy and the bathroom very clean. There's a minibar plus a microwave and plates, glassses, and cutlery, and a small table, so if you want, you can dine in. I was pleasantly surprised with the kitchen stuff and the other amenities, which included Molton Brown bath products. There's also a large Storrier print (duh) on the wall and a matching wine bottle. The staff was friendly and helpful too ( especially one desk clerk who printed off directions for us). Points off for the shower (there's no door or separator, just a curtain so things get messy) and the bathroom is really really small. It can get pretty noisy at night and in the early morning, but it was charming to hear birds (as well as trucks) at 8 AM. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the roofdeck because it was booked for a private function one night and it was rainy the next night. They have a restaurant, The Red Belly, but we ended up eating at a great casual Japanese restaurant across the street from King's Cross station. The location has its pros and cons - it's a young, cool neighborhood with loads of bars and restaurants and really lively on Saturday night (the hotel is right by a dance club). It's about 20 minutes' walking distance from the harbor, if you don't get lost, and right by the subway, which takes you everywhere. Problem is, the subway isn't as frequent as other big cities, so it can take up to 45 minutes to an hour to get to the Rocks or the Circular Quay if you are unlucky. We didn't mind it so much, but if you're keen in being close to \"the sights,\" the Storrier may not be for you. We were extremely satisfied with it, though - they used every inch of space wisely and include everything you need in the room.

The bad: To get to the hotel you have to walk either along an alley or a past a dodgy street area. It may be called Potts Point, but the other side of the street is Kings Cross.

Not being from Sydney, we didn't realise Potts Point (or Kings Cross) is as bad as it really is. The hotel is smack in the middle of the red light district and, although we like some urban grunge, the drug activity is scary and right in your face. We didn't feel safe walking around after dark. The second major complaint we had was the shower. It's hard to believe a hotel could have such a poor hot water system. In the end, I only used the hot tap for showering and the temperature alternated between hot and freezing cold. My partner didn't have any luck either. There were a few other disappointments worth mentioning. 1) There was a black pillow on our bed which was filthy dirty. I put it aside so it could be changed with the other linen but the next day it appeared again on our bed- just as dirty. 2) Our room was on the ground floor and quite noisy. We got woken up, not just by outside noise, but noise from the lobby and corridor (like people vacuuming outside our door early in the morning). All of that said, our stay was okay and not terrible.

I had read so many good reviews about the hotel that I was really looking forward to my visit. I actually liked the location as it is close to many other hotels and restaurants and the Potts Point area is lovely and Kings Cross very interesting. My biggest problem was that the website indicated the rooms 'come with high speed internet access'. I discovered that the rooms have access available but the cost was $10/hour, $20 for 4 hours or $30/day. I did complain to the front desk and they said that they were aware that the website said this but that the internet was provided by an outside server and they had no control over the cost. The cost was added to my bill through the hotel, so I wondered about this. I wrote an email to the hotel while I was there reiterating my objection and did not receive a response. This really coloured my impression of the hotel. I didn't mind so much that the room was very tiny as it was in the back of the hotel and pretty quiet, or that 2 lightbulbs were burned out, or even that the sink was leaking all over the floor, as these issues were addressed immediately.

Most hotels do seem to include this free of charge, and I wouldn't have objected if the website did not suggest that it was free.

In saying that it was surprisingly quiet - and we had a front room - and so very handy that night when we found ourselves surrounded by some of Sydney's best restaurants and Bars on nearby Victoria Street. 'Jimmy Liks' is probably offering some of the best Asian/Fusion food in the country - but thats another story for another time.
