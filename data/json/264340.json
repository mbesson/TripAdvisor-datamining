Food was amazing everywhere. Warm fresh French pastries and coffee, who could want for more!! Concierge recommended a breakfast spot which did not disappoint - Cartet just a few minutes walking from the hotel, wonderful, might be considered a bit pricey for some, about $40 for two, but well worth it, service and food were fantastic, great atmosphere and also has a bit of a market at the front, so you can take some delicious snacks with you on the way out! Next time I am in Montreal I will definitely return to the Gault. Location was excellent, only a short walk to Notre Dame Basilique, shopping on St. Catharines Street and loads of restaurants. If I had to say one thing that could make this hotel any better it would just be that the lobby is not very \"loungey\", it's lovely but the bar area is connected to the reception so it's a bit odd.

In most hotel they're either too small, don't look clean etc... But there, I was looking forward every night for that relaxing moment especially as you can dim the light in the bathroom: there is no better way to unwind from a day of sight-seeing! The shower (separated from the tub) was also very nice with good water pressure. The pictures I took were on the night I arrived. I was so thrilled by my bedroom that I couldn't wait the next day (and the daylight) to take some pictures.

The hotel is housed in a former YMCA in an historic building at the edge of Old Montreal. The hotel has been completely gutted and turned into a very contemporary boutique hotel. The location is superb as it is at the corner of two very quiet streets and away from the major foot traffic of the old city yet close enough to walk to restaurants, the subway and other attractions. If the hotel was busy, we would never have known as we rarely saw other guests. We stayed in a Junior Suite on the 2nd floor and it was a very large room with a stone/exposed brick wall, two sets of operational French doors, a king bed, a large free-standing acrylic soaker tub as well as a separate glassed shower with an adjustable Grohe rainhead and a separate WC as well as a very ample supply of Molten Brown products, an abundance of very good, thick, fluffy towels and a magnifying make-up mirror. The bed was extremely comfortable with very good linens, as others have noted. However, the floors are polished concrete and while they provide a funky, industrial vibe, they don't look clean and are not very comfortable as a living space surface. Terry slippers and robes are provided and with those floors you'll want to wear the slippers as the floors look and feel dirty. There are small area rugs (maybe 3 x 5) on each side of the bed, but these were quite filthy and badly in need of cleaning. The drapes are blackout drapes but they are falling off their tracks and you have to manoeuver them a certain way to get them to stay closed. There is very ample closet and drawer space, a safe, minibar, iPhone/iPod docking station and 42\" flat screen TV. The hotel has a tiny lobby area dedicated to being a restaurant for breakfast as well as a bar area in the lobby but we never saw anyone at the bar. A few minor things were missing: - hotel book with hotel and local information - TV guide - a bedside clock - magazines related to Montreal But the most notable about The Gault is the staff. We have stayed at the best hotels all over the world and the staff were simply wonderful. They could not do enough. Upon arrival we were offered a beverage and chose an ice tea and an espresso. No charge. When we came back from our daily excursions, the staff eagerly wanted to hear about where we went and what we did. One day after four and a half hours of walking in extreme heat and humidity, icy bottles of water were proffered without asking. No charge. The concierge asked what restos we'd picked and provided tips and suggestions. I cannot say enough about the warmth, friendliness and service orientation of every staff member we met.

It it is, by far, a hotel that I found to be charming, cozy, sophisticated and sexy, all at the same time. I was booked to stay at a large chain hotel the morning I departed for Montreal. But, after a quick call to the front desk of the Gault, I learned that I could stay at the Gault, with two hot breakfasts included in the nightly rate, for less than what I would have paid at the generic chain hotel. Though the rack rates at the hotel are not inexpensive, the pre-paid rates are considerably discounted. I got a very generously sized, well appointed room, with a king size bed and standalone shower for a very reasonable nightly rate. Because I booked the morning before I departed for Montreal, I was comfortable pre paying (the pre-paid bookings can not be cancelled). And for $10 more, my companion and I we able to each have a hot breakfast of eggs cooked to specification, toast, bacon, coffee, orange juice (freshly squeezed, no less) and a choice of fresh fruit, or cereal, or yogurt. It really was a lovely breakfast, served in the the dining area off the lobby, next to tall windows overlooking the streets of old Montreal. The service was excellent and the breakfast was a a great value for $10 for two people. The room itself was large, modern in style, very clean and well appointed. I had a Loft Deluxe. It had polished concrete floors, very high ceilings, gorgeous tall bright windows that opened to Juliet balconies, an area rug under the bed, and ipod/ipad dock, flat screen TV with DVD and cable television, lounge chairs and a coffee table, a comfy kind size bed behind which was a gauzy curtain separating the bathroom from the bedroom. Modern in style, the bathroom sink and closet area were open to the room (in the area behind the gauzy curtain), while a water closet and shower are located behind doors. And there was ample closet space. Towels and bathrobes are plush. All in all, it was a lovely room. I could have spent way more than just three days there. The lobby features modern, but comfortable furnishings and high ceilings. It has a very fresh and airy feel to it, in an understanted luxury kind of way. The lobby isn't much of a scene like you might find at other hotels, which is a good thing in my opinion. It was nice to come in from a day of sightseeing, or dinner, or shopping to the serene calm of the lobby, where you could unwind with a drink in the lobby. The staff would go so far as to inquire about your dinner/day/tour, etc, and gently invite you to enjoy a cocktail at the bar (or even have them sent to your room). The staff at the hotel are very professioinal, attentive, service-minded, charming, friendly and helpful. Restaurant and bar recommendations were excellent. I needed to store my luggage for the day after I checked out on Sunday, and they were more than helpful...even when I had to go back to retreive a few things I needed for my day in Montreal. On my return, the bags were promptly loaded to a taxi for my trip to the train station. The location of the hotel is fantastic, in Old Montreal. Cobblestone streets, elaborately ornate buildings, charming streets radiate every direction from the hotel. The hotel is a short walk to the Old Port, a short walk to the more bustling areas of Old Montreal, a short walk to shops and bars and restaurants (ask about Boris Brasserie, around the corner and it's c-h-a-r-m-i-n-g open-air courtyard dining area). The Metro is nearby. Cabs are plentiful down the street on McGill Street. Notre Dame Cathedral is a five minute walk away. And you're a 10-15 minute cab ride to the train station, bus station, shopping on Sherbrooke and St Catherine streets, the gay village, the Museum of Fine Art and retaurants on a street whose name escapes me at the moment, among other attractions. Additional note: the hotel is gay friendly. I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to go back.

The people in Hotel Gault could not have been nicer. The concierge, the reception staff, the valet, the other gentlemen who showed us our room and took our bags; all were exceptionally nice. They carried our bags, they made reservations, they did everything we can ask for. And they did it happily, and graciously. The hotel also had a lot of nice amenities. Amazingly hot water in the shower, very clean room, free stereo in the room, free wifi, and complimentary ipad to use in the hotel. When we checked in, they gave us glasses of water and soda, and free bottles of water in the room. The bed was also extremely comfortable. All very nice features! On the other hand, the place was pretty expensive: $240 a night after taxes. And possibly because we bought the room through Jetsetter, we got probably the least desirable room in the hotel. First floor above reception, right across from the elevator. It's an open layout so there was no separation for the bathroom (the toilet had a small door to get some privacy). The walls were fairly thin, the floors were bare concrete, and the walls were unadorned. There was only one window, and it was quite thin (though tall). The odd thing was, the curtains didn't cover the whole window. When I called reception to ask them how to close them, they brought us a pair of binder clips. Again, they couldn't have been nicer, but for a 4 or 5 star hotel to bring you binder clips? Very odd/disappointing. One other odd thing: the cable system was just like a box that you and I would have in our homes. This sounds nice, but 3/4 of the channels on the guide are blocked, so if you want to watch anything before bed or in the morning, it's a guessing game to know if what you see on the guide is available. A channel list would have been helpful. Overall, the place is very \"fancy\" but felt extremely cold to me. Almost like a hip prison.

Both bathroom and bedroom furniture were extremely clean. Some days the floor could have been swept and cleaned - but that didn't detract from the overall splendour of the hotel, which was refurbished on the site of the first North American YMCA. The only thing missing from my point of view was a small sofa, as there was one easy chair in the room and to relax the only other option was to sit on the bed. The staff couldn't have been more attentive to our needs. We needed some adjustments to the air conditioning and we also booked a car through the hotel and Alejandro, Andre and Bettina more than helped us out.

Now just to set this straight, I am from NYC, so noise doesn't bother me like it would bother people visiting from smaller Suburban towns, but going from what it was (to me at least) to what it feels like it is becoming, is quite a different experience. Needless to say, the staff are always very helpful, friendly, and up for a chat at the bar on an evening, and it seems genuine, not as if they are just paid to sit and smile. All in all, I will likely continue to stay here on my annual visit,(though I have actually looked into others now) but I thought it should be noted to the owners or management that it is not as amazing as it used to be.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cWe are coming back to this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "wong_christine7", "ReviewID": "UR114432849", "Content": "We did a lot of research on where to stay in Montreal and we could have stayed at a less expensive hotel chain.

I can imagine this might be a problem in the real heat of the summer. I gather this is a fault with the system they have and they can't do anything about it. To stop it blowing on me all night they had to tape up half the vent in the ceiling. I have never heard of air con that can't be switched off before. The air con problem extended to the gym (which is tiny and airless in the basement). The temperature in there was over 22 degrees and cannot be set any lower (I gather) than this which I have to say seems a bit bonkers when the room is hot before you have started a work out you melt after about 10 minutes. I ordered room service one night and got a panini which was extremely expensive and the size a child would eat. I would simply recommend you eat out rather than do room service.

Now the one negative that put a damper on my stay. It seems on each floor they have a room that faces the parking lot in the back. And we just happened to get that room. We assume that it was because we used JetSetter and received a great rate for the weekend. This puts a negative on both JetSetter and Hotel Gault. And another reason to back up this theory is that when the hotel help took us to our room, they tried to show explain to us where everything in the room was, like the closet and hangers and restroom, but they werent familiar with the room and took time trying to figure things out and even said... wow i wonder why they made this room this way...

Everyone we encountered was friendly, enthusiastic, and happy to help. If you need anything at the Hotel Gault, Stephan is your man. He was able to get us a reservation at Au Pied de Cochon on relatively short notice, and the next day was able to get us a table at a great bar to watch the Canadiens-Bruins playoff game on even shorter notice. Also when we arrived at the hotel, he pointed out a parking spot available on the the street where we could leave our car for the weekend, which saved us from having to valet the car and pay for parking. That was huge. We did the Easter Brunch package and the buffet brunch was terrific as well. Great selection of pastries and a homemade jam that they should bottle and sell. They also had eggs, ham, baked beans, and crepes, the ham in particular was amazing. The staff (Dominic and another fellow, didn't get his name) was happy to make several cappucinos for my wife which she was raving about. Again, outstanding service from everyone. Didn't get any room service while we were there or try out the free popcorn and DVD rentals that Hotel Gault offers, however we did share an elevator with a very happy little girl who had a cartoon DVD and giant bowl of popcorn.

We greatly enjoyed the spacious shower, heated floors, and roomy drawers for storing our clothing. Even then bathrobes that were tucked away in a closet smelled divine. **My only recommendation for the room would be the addition of a tea kettle or coffee pot, as I really enjoy a late-night tea/cocoa/decaf break. :) I would also suggest that the temperature in the basement gym be reduced, as my partner and I were a bit overheated whilst working out.** I must say that the most exceptional aspect of our stay at the hotel was the amazingly friendly and accommodating staff. Our first encounter upon arriving was with Andre, the bubbly and energetic concierge. He not only parked our car and helped us with our many bags (namely, rucksacks!), but also recommended a fabulous restaurant right off the bat, and made us a reservation immediately (at L'Orignal). He was also incredibly helpful in terms of our sightseeing destinations, including the Musee des Beaux Arts and the Chateau Dufresne (he highly recommended this after I expressed an interest, and it was well worth the visit!). Honestly, each and every staff member at the Hotel Gault was more than warm, generous, and thoughtful. I have never experienced such friendly, genuine hotel employees.

Second, the rooms (and the hotel itself) are immaculate, modern chic with soaring windows, warm concrete floors, luxurious white bed linens (with a splash of colour), flat screen TVs and a funky, functional bathroom (my favorite is the room with the stand-alone bathtub!).

However, if you prefer a bathtub, say so, because certain rooms only have showers. In some basic rooms, only a curtain separates the bathroom from the sleeping quarters: it's a nice touch, but some people will probably miss the privacy. Breakfast at the Gault used to be buffet-style, with both variety and quality. It also used to be included in the price of the room. Lately, however, it's been replaced by a rather traditional, \u00c3\u00a0 la carte breakfast that costs around 20 dollars per person (in addition to the room itself).

What it lacks in subtle luxurious touches, it more than makes up for in being everything a hotel should be - extremely clean, firm and comfortable bed, spacious room, superb staff, excellent location and decent food. I am staying at the Hotel Gault for 4 days on my own on a personal visit. The most excellent Andre, Jonathan and their colleagues made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in past midnight straight from a 20 hr trip around the world. Walking into the large king bed room on the strains of clear classical music from the radio/CD player was the perfect recipe for relaxation. The rooms are almost spartan and certainly reminds one of hotels in Basel or Zurich, but with 100 times more space. There are only 30 rooms in the hotel, on 5 floors, so it is quiet, on a quiet street. Walls of golden pine provide a warm counterpoint to painted concrete floors and a \"statement wall\" of stone behind the bed. The bathroom is a key area that could be improved - most of the lighting throughout is provided by warm incandescent bulbs (softening the almost harsh decor) but lighting in the shower cubicle is institutional flourescent. Under sink storage for hand/face towels, hairdryer and other amenities is via a mobile trolley, which makes it awkward to access items. Lighting above the mirror is a tad too dim for proper make-up application and there could have been two sinks for the amount of space available. More cupboard space for hanging jackets would have been useful, as would a local telephone directory (although the knowledgeable and helpful staff make a local directory redundant). Excellent dining suggestions were provided by the front desk staff, fitting my requirements completely (busy but not noisy, suitable for a single diner with a book, very good food that uses local ingredients or provided local flavour, reasonably priced). All the usual guest demands were met promptly and impeccably, including carrying a large & untidy carload of belongings to my room, valet parking, advice on locating various businesses & places of interest, and even the request for a doctor on Good Friday.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stratford, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in Montreal.\u201d", "Author": "Rundles", "ReviewID": "UR58066735", "Content": "This is the place to stay in Old Montr\u00c3\u00a9al.

Attention to details matter most at Hotel Gault, especially, when one notices a lot of the in room furnishings were custom made for this propertly. Really, one must love modern design and architecture to get the most out of a stay at Hotel Gault, as the reconstruction of this historic space into something that is truly modern is nothing short of magical: when it comes to a small hotel, one cannot find a better example of architectural reconstruction in Canada, if not, North America, than Hotel Gault.

It is about 5 minutes from a metro line. There are plenty of restaurants around it as it is just on the edge of the old town. We hadn't realised that breakfast was included in the price we paid so that was a nice surprise.

Our room was one of their bigger rooms and the $200 inc tax. deal was fair value. Another reviewer thought the hotel was looking tired...well we thought it was more than acceptable. Maybe the odd mark on a carpet, but even whilst we were there they were touching up and cleaning all the time. Our room was QUIET and we slept for over 12 hours. It is modern in a wonderfully simple way, no clutter, no heavy wood and has good lighting with a sound system. Are only two comments that could improve the stay are 1) If you have a CD player in the room put a CD in there for clients to use, 2) Why charge $5.00 for a DVD disc hire? Minor points but we felt they should be mentioned. Breakfast is a simple affair, but the breads were fresh, fruit sliced and not out of a tin and the tea hot.

We thought of staying at Hotel Nelligan, and took a look around whilst we were there. The staff seemed very attentive (would match the Gault in this respect) and happily showed us their hotel. But with 106 rooms it seemed too big to us. The style of the hotel is intimate but when full, the central open atrium would allow noise to spread to many rooms. The standard of room design was high, but we felt the simplicity of the Gault was more impressive. If you like the more traditional dark wood look of a room then pick the Nelligan.

Both rooms were minimalist in design but that only lended to the vast spaciousness of them. It was like having a big loft size apartment in the city.

And of course, the loudest part of it always seemed to occur at 7 in the morning. Not exactly what one wants to deal with on a vacation!

In fact, besides the Four Seasons Maui, it might have been the best hotel I ever stayed at. PROs: - The interior design of Hotel Gault is world class. The chairs, the beds, the tables, the showers - it is all very practical, but also very beautiful. - The loft style rooms are simply gorgeous, with high ceilings and beds that make you want to spend all day in bed. Extremely comfortable. - No room is the same, so you'll get a bit of a different experience every time you're at the hotel - The front desk's employees and the concierges are extremely knowledgeable and very friendly - Internet and breakfast is FREE - The location is in a quiet street in Old Town Montreal. Simply perfect. CONs: - This is hard....the only thing I can think of is that it takes from 7.30am to 7.30pm to get clothes dry-cleaned, unless you want to pay $35 extra.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The lobby/front desk/bar/lounge/restaurant is essentially one large high ceiling room with funky decor and generally attentive service. They were a little short-staffed on check-in, but once they turned attention to us, we felt well cared for and our car was whisked quickly away. The rooms are incredibly hip and comfortable, but probably not to everyone's taste. Notwithstanding the stripped-down decor, a large modern art print or photo or two on the walls would be a nice touch. The open-style bathroom was just fine, although the lighting was a little counter-intuitive, and lacking a few little details (e.g. there was no where to hang your towel or robe within easy reach of the shower). If you are inclined to unpack your suitcase, you may find the hanging space a little limited and the drawers more fun that functional. But aside from these quibbles, it was a fine room.

Breakfast is quite lovely, with some unusual elements (not the standard continental) and, at least on weekends, available quite late into the morning. When I asked for a tray to take breakfast to my room, it took a minute to find one, but they happily obliged. The front desk was helpful with confirming our dinner reservations, providing taxis or directions, etc. When we arrived back one evening after a glutonous meal at Le Pied au Couchon, desperately in need of a degustif, we were able to sign for drinks at the bar and walk with them up to our room (unheard of in Ontario!).

The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is in the lobby and comprises about 12 tables at one side (more formal) and 6 round casual tables with multicoloured chairs close to the bar. All the furniture is contemporary; the lobby seat looks like an open baseball glove. The back of the lobby is arranged with artsy fartsy magazines, and side wall with DVDs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall terrific. We watched Kurosawa (again), staying up until 3 am. I wanted a room with a stone or brick wall because I get nervous around modern Toronto-style architecture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthus reserving the Terra room.

I refused this room and asked for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a downgrade please\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, much to the shock of the staff. No joy. Instead we ended up in a suite that was truly magnificent with corner window and Juliette balcony, clad in wooden shutters. A sitting area with large screen TV faced a rectangular sofa (no cushions and very uncomfortable in the long term for watching movies), this zone spanned by a stunning multicoloured carpet. There were 6 speakers, one of which worked. Apparently, they all work only with the DVD and it took someone 15-20 minutes to turn it on for us. After he removed his test DVD we could not get ours to work. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something about spending time with hi-tech when you travel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annoying learning new systems. Then there is a dining table and small kitchenette separating the eating from sleeping areas. The miele hot plate accommodates 2 pans, 1 is supplied. The cooking accoutrements ranked a 1:10, but we were not there to cook so no problem. There was a sort of coffee machine that looked like a combination ice-cream maker meets playdoh squishing machine. No coffee was supplied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberate madame\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, nor mugs, nor sugar.

Will it appear on my credit card in the future? Instead room service was needed for coffee and you were on your own in an electrical outage. The best coffee on the planet was then served in a piping hot thermos enough for 2 1/2 cups (read: an immediate call for a 2nd thermos was essential if my husband wanted to quench his thirst). The bed is king size and has what appears to be a down quilt and pillows. The bedding was terrific, the bed was not as comfortable. The bathroom had a beautiful large oval tub for two, with large shower and Grohe spray. We have those at home and no we would not get them again (think WaterPic). Too bad no hot tub. Square sink on rectangular surface. Molton Brown bottles. The concrete floor was not cold, but my hooves turned slightly black. Nooks and crannies hid clothing, ironing board etc. It was a great space\u00e2\u20ac\u201duber trendy and bordering on a high-tech lawyers office (not my kind of home from home). The receptionist Brian said that this was one of their best rooms. But watch out guys, the rooms are beginning to look shabby. The glass table in the living room had chips along the edges, the second table attached to it was at a slight misaligned angle (watch those wine glasses!), the door over the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was warped and detaching, broken vases were hidden in kitchen drawers, and that cute magazine holder in the pathway of everyone moving into the lounge area has been dinged so many times the vertical edges look like they have teeth. The room we moved up from was also shabby\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtears in the bed platform textile, black rubberized streaks on the light grey concrete floor. And that room was an office that happened to have a bed in it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can I plug your computer in for you madame?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I feel guilty for pointing these detractions out, having been upgraded, but maybe someone will pay attention to detail and make your stay even more special than was ours.

Make yourself seated in the lobby. We took the Blissful Deluxe package\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe each had 45 mins of massage in our room by a zen artist, a DVD later, a cocktail not of our choice\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvodka, lychee and cranberry, and a glass of wine instead of champagne. Strawberries dipped in chocolate. The system was a little strange\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where were the coupons \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we ran out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or whether we had the chocolates with the cocktail \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, with the champagne\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or if we used the TV to order the DVD \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, they are in the lobby for pick up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We asked for an extension of stay past the noon check out and were happily granted it (we stayed less than half an hour longer). Our car was brought around. The total bill was around 450$ for one night, plus we left $50 in tips (valet parking, the masseuse, room service). I never know what to do here, but that seemed fair at the time. So, the rooms were 7-8:10, service 10:10, parking 10:10, brunch 10:10, coffee 11:10. Perhaps I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a little hard to serve at times, I notice small things like someone else taking a table cleared and set for us (I am currently walking-challenged courtesy of an ice-wipe out near Schwartz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 smoked meat, and the other tables were the farthest possible from the buffet), so dealing with me 11:10. I also noticed that this was a friendly hotel for gays, so 10:10 for that too. My tip is to come on a special weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen the fireworks are on, a festival is in town\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike the jazz fest, or Fete des lumieres when most all the galleries are open 24 hours.

The tub was wonderful, but the room itself had concrete floors with only a small rug on either side of the bed, and the floors were very very marked up and appeared dirty and the rugs were stained, so that was a little disappointing when checking in, but we got over it.

Our recent two-night stay at Hotel Gault was absolutely perfect: minimalist chic but with warmth and outstanding creature comfort! We loved the blend of the old and ornate architectural exterior with the more stark and loft design of the interior. The public spaces had both a rarefied and inviting openness about it with clever combinations of warm blond wood and tin ceiling and concrete walls, with wonderful displays of modernist art and whimsical but perfectly comfortable furniture. Our Extraessentiel room with its high ceiling was huge, and the bathroom with its separate tile & glass shower and its separate tub was also spacious --approaching the size of an entire hotel room in some cities! The bed and bed and bath linen were all plush and of excellent quality. The decor was minimalist and stylish, with use of warm colors. Service was exceedingly nice and attentive. The bountiful breakfast service with an abundant variety started at 6:30, with coffee and espresso made to order. The location in Old Montreal was charming with small restaurants and coffee shops nearby while being a little away from the heavier tourist traffic; it took us about 20 minutes on foot to get to Centre Ville for our work-related meeting, which made for a nice and enjoyable way for us to see the street and sidewalk culture of both sides of Montreal.

Since the hotel is quite popular and was booked full, we had to stay in an Extrassential room for two nights and a Extential room on our final night. And let me just say: both room types were amazing. The extrassential is a spacious corner suite with three large windows offering somewhat of a panoramic view to the outside. We had one slight problem, however, on our first night here: we noticed there was hair belonging to perhaps a previous guest on our bedsheets. Yuck! My girlfriend hated this, I didn't mind as much. But when we called the front desk, they quickly addressed the problem and had two housekeepers assigned to change our bed sheets right away. After this issue, the rest of our stay was smooth sailing! The Extential room was also very nice, a bit smaller. Yet, it actually felt a lot more warm and homey to us compared to the first room we had. Both rooms were great, but the smaller room just felt more comfortable. The drawback to this room type, though, is that you'll have no privacy when getting ready in the bathroom. The thing I will miss the most - by far - will be the courtesy continental breakfast they serve every morning. I love to eat and I eat well. I can say that the breakfast spread they offer is too good to be true. It was the best breakfast experience I have ever had! Everything is served fresh and is prepared with a sense of artistic detail. I just loved waking up each morning, knowing that the greatest breakfast in the Americas was waiting for me down in the hotel lobby!

Lugging your bags up the stairs to the reception desk is not a pleasant way to start your stay. However, the concierge Pierre was great! My brother needed to find an an eye glass store and he pointed in the right direction and also each time you arrive at the Gault they always personally escort you to your room and explain how everything works, very nice touch as always. Our rate included a 3 course table d'hote dinner at the Gault Restaurant. The food was outstanding, the service was a joke! Management needs to teach our young lass Cindy some really service basics. We waited 15mins to even get a menu, another 10mins before she came and we had to ask for water, ask for bread, I mean really, come on, the basics here! I had to really just laugh at how truly awful she was. When three more couples came down for a drink at the bar, me and brother were being entertained as she was run off of her feet service a total of 8 guests including us.

Two blocks at most from subway entrance, which connects to underground world in Montreal. Very convenient (especially when it rained the way it did when we were there). On a quiet street, but right next to busy places like St. Paul Street with all the bars and stuff. So room and street noise was a non-issue. Room only one phone. Very surprised. And not cordless. No coffeemaker in room. I really don't like that. Otherwise, everything was great. Agreed with previous poster that bare floors seemed strange. But it wasn't bad. And the bathroom floor was heated.

We have a full-sized SUV so it had to be parked a block away in a larger garage. Parking was $25CAD/nt.

We were then escorted to our room to find that our bags awaited us in the room. The Room We booked a corner room. The corner rooms are very spacious with the heated concrete bathroom floors, huge shower with Grohe fixtures and minimalist furniture. The queen-sized bed was comfortable and the rooms contain an ironing board, iron, hairdryer, workstation, flat screen TV with DVD player (movies available in the lobby) and a compact audio system. Dining The dinner was incredible. A very small and modern menu that reflects the ambience of the hotel. The dining space is small and quiet and the tables overlook gaslit Rue St. Helene. Breakfast is also excellent. There's a cold buffet offering with fresh fruit, baked goods and juices. There are also choices from the kitchen such as omelets with bacon and hash browns. Location The hotel is a bit far from the downtown core. It's walkable (for us) but it's a mostly uphill trek to get to St. Catherines' St. Your only a block from the Metro and therefore a block to the underground pedestrian passageways, so once you get a handle of the maps of the underground you can save yourself time and effort navigating the city.

I read ALL of the reviews and from doing so it's easy to expect some kind of heaven on earth here. But a modern 30 room hotel in the centre of a city like Montreal is unlikely to be THAT good, it just isn't possible. Having said that, I've still given it 5 stars because it's not far off as good as it could be and the things that are not perfect don't knock it down to 4 stars. We are fairly fussy. We stayed at various small inns on our 16 night trip (all with several 5 star reviews on Tripadvisor) and one very expensive hotel at Mont Tremblant. The Gault is a very good place to stay in Montreal. The location is good, Andre is a very personable and helpful guide. We said what we wanted and he booked us 3 excellent meals - Chez L'Epicier (very good food in imaginative dishes in the old town), The Globe (a 'scene' restaurant with a ridiculously noisy DJ, waitresses who look like models and very good food) and the best - O Chalet a new restaurant with a funny 70s camping theme which could have been tacky but actually was rather stylish and the food absolutely superb. Once place we found on our own was for excellent brunch - Le Cartet, 106 Mc Gill. Our room was mid-range, it's admittedly very modern here (minor criticism) but it did have excellent ameneties - a lovely bed, wired free internet access (wifi doesnt work too well through concrete walls), excellent shower, funky storage. Breakfast is a very good buffet but the chairs and tables are not the most practical (minor criticism). The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The location is fine. I've got to say we were rather disappointed with Montreal, perhaps it's over-hyped. The best things we found were various interesting structures - the Geodesic Dome on the island, right out of science fiction; the sports stadium (you can't miss it if you go up to Mont Royal, just look for the spaceship); a building around the corner from the hotel made of coloured glass; the industrial buildings and ships down at the docks.

The staff is genuinely friendly and caring--probably the nicest staff I have ever encountered. They all know your name and treat you like family. They are very gay-friendly and welcoming to all. The loby at first glance seems spare and minimalist, but gradually shows its true warmth and comfort. The breakfast is excellent--they will make you anything you desire (\"free\" with room). Nice little bar for a cappucino or a preprandial libation (and they serve Voss water--my favorite). Spend the extra $$ for one of the \"essential top five\" rooms--private, quiet, and your own balcony. While I missed the soaking tub that is in some of the other rooms, the balcony and views made up for it. The room was very NY loft-like but very \"homey.\" The bed was great and the linens superb. Great mini-sound system and lots of storage space. Loved the heated bathroom floor (which can set by you). Superior sound control--NO city or neighbor noise. I stayed in 520 and never wanted to leave! Great location, close to old Montreal and great restaurants. Go have a drink and the elegant room in the St. James and either of the two bars of the W (both short distance walking). Remember...wine is VERY VERY expensive (2-10 times the price in the states). I carried a few bottles with me from the US because of this--but splurge for a glass of Champagne in the St James bar--beautiful and elegant (don't miss the deal at \"happy hour\" drinks and appetizer pairings for $20 CA!) Another thing not to miss is pizza on Youville St at Pizzaiolle (sp?). A bit of a walk but worth it is Restaurant Cavali--authentic and heavenly Italian fare.

It's on a little street two minutes from Place D'Armes and two minutes from a metro station, so both quiet and convenient. The staff were professional and relaxed at the same time, and happily did everything we asked of them: gave us great suggestions for places to eat (like Holder, a very good resto-pub around the corner on McGill), pointed out interesting things to see in the city, let us use their computer to print out our boarding passes, let us sprawl in their lobby even after we'd checked out...all without any of the pretention or aloofness that you get from many high-end hotels.

The last time I went I remember that I called down to ask if they could recommend any places that delivered food. They gave me some phone numbers. I asked about one of the restaurants and they didn't have a menu so they went down the street to go get one! Also, I had to mail some letters and didn't have stamps but offered to buy some stamps. Again, they didn't have any stamps there but offered to mail them for free. The room I stayed in was great. Once I stayed in a \"Studio\" and another I stayed in the \"etcetera\" and the other the \"Terra\". All were great. The breakfast buffet in the morning was really great. They were always very friendly about directions, parking and the service was head and shoulders better than most places. One night I had a date with a girl I met and I went to buy a bottle of champagne. Someone that came in for the turndown service noticed it and immediately offered to bring a bucket with ice and even brought champagne flutes up. I ended up leaving an expensive Prada belt in the room when I left and I expected it to be long gone. I called and they said that the cleaning lady found it. They immediately Fed-ex'ed it to my office the next day. I can't recommend this hotel enough.

Special kudos to the front desk for remembering our names every time we came in the door. Be careful what rooms you get. We were in the best rooms in the hotel, but some are small on the bottom floors. Splurge for the fourth or fifth floor rooms. The modern decor is way cool and very welcoming; very modern, but incredibly comfortable. The only nit I would pick is the ridiculous chairs for the dining area. They nearly killed three people while I was there so watch out for tripping. The rate includes breakfast and all the various coffee drinks you can consume. Remember to order off the menu for breakfast. If you like your eggs 'American' standard, ask for your omelette well done, otherwise they are a bit wet (keep in mind a breakfast like this would set you back at least $25 CAD elsewhere.) Use your tub if you get one, it's way cool after a busy day of shopping. Go shopping on Ste Catherine street, especially in the higher end shops. There are some real treasures.

We were 2 couples (40's) looking to let loose and eat, drink and sightsee our way around the city! We loved our \"loft\" style King room with high ceilings, beautiful fabrics and tasteful furnishings - very chic!! Our very large bathroom included a tub big enough for two, a separate water closet and a glass enclosed shower. The radiant heated floor was a nice touch for the chilly mornings. Housekeeping was wonderful and we never had ANY issues. Bathroom amenities were perfect, towels were fluffy and a robe was provided - nothing was lacking. The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Old Montreal. Notre Dame is right down the street and we were able to find numerous bars, restaurants and bistros right in the area - far too many choices for a weekend. We particularly enjoyed Boris Bistro for dinner (around the corner on McGill) and the Cobalt Bar and the Nelligan Hotel for cocktails (on St. Paul). However, if you want to venture further, concierge is more than willing to offer up suggestions and ideas. They will even print various restaurant menus off the internet for you. The small bar at the Gault is perfect for a cocktail at the beginning or end of your night (we did both!). There is also a nice fireplace separating the reception/bar area and a comfortable reading room in the back. The Gault has tons of DVD's for rent and lots of books/magazines to peruse if you're hanging out on the couches. As mentioned in the other reviews...the breakfast was awesome! A beautiful buffet selection is offered daily along with a made to order choices. The food and service was top notch all the way. It's a nice touch that the entire breakfast is included in the room rate. If you eat too much at breakfast, there is a small health club in the basement with a good treadmill, an elliptical and some free weights - just enough to sneak in a quick 30 minute workout. The metro station is very close to the Gault and a good way to move around the city. We used the Metro 1/2 the time and then relied on short taxi rides in the evening - never more than $10/15 to get us from point A to point B.

We stayed in a Studio, one of the largest options. Very clean, extremely modern. We are not modern furniture people but felt it would be fun for a change. If you are really into this type of look, this place would be fantastic for you. Lots of new stuff but also valuable stuff from the 40's-50's and 60's. The bed is incredibly comfortable. We loved our bathroom (which for us included a tub) Our studio had a mini fridge, wet bar and microwave. The living area was seperated from the bedroom by a custom built wood piece which did not reach the ceiling, but was really more of a divider. The TV/DVD was located on that, on a swivel that could face either room area. If you want something supremely cushy and comfy, this is not your place. OUr studio was wonderful but not the most Cozy thing we have stayed in. Having said that, it was fun to 'try something different on' since we are huge antique people. The lobby is terrific. Neat bar and surrounding area. Breakfasts were very good, and we found that we ordered the hot breakfast items every morning. Service very gracious there, expecially if you remember that although it is 'free', the server deserves a tip. Things were replenished regularly.

Also, take the hotel's address and number with you if you are taking cabs. Not all of the drivers have discovered the Gault yet. We LOVED Andre. He has genuine passion for the hotel and the area.
