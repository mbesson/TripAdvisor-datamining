How they can call this a hotel is a joke . I stayed with my partner for one night on 29th April ( the Royal wedding) i paid \u00c2\u00a374 and stayed in room 2008. One good comment i will make is the location , Belgrave Road is a very short walk from the coach and train station ,it has lots of hotels , But my friendly advice is stay clear of the Carlton. I should have gone with first instinct when the reception staff was not friendly. The room ...very small , bed very hard with one pillow per person that had seen better days . Linen was clean on first inspection , well one sheet and one blanket . What i thought was the cupboard turned out to be the shower / toilet . Small and cramped is not the word , a cross between a caravan toilet , aeroplane toilet and a kids wardrobe . I think the wardrobe would have been the cleaner option. I am surprised the fixtures worked, i think it was the limescale and dirt holding them together, shower runs hot and cold and floods the bathroom . Television picture was snowy , after you have cleaned the dust off the screen .The room was dirty , dusty with stains and burns on the carpet . The chair at the dressing table was similar to a childs highchair after they had finished dinner . Avoid the hotel telephone in the room at all costs , unless you have a bottle of bleach handy , combination of dirt and grease ( see photos) Breakfast ......08.00 - 09.00 . I felt sorry for the lady who serves breakfast , she was clearly unhappy or having a bad day , She puts the value bread in the toaster for you , whether you want it or not , Then presents you with caramelished toast , That while your eating stale cereal , so time you have finished the toast is cold , hard and caramelised . Dont forget to enjoy the view from the window and the decor ( bags of plaster ) and peeling plaster on walls . Check out ... Before we checked out we thought we would remove the bottom sheet from the bed ************Do not do this *********** The mattres is the horror or horrors, Stained with blood , soaked in urine and a manner of body fluids .

The windows were old and single glazed so we had the pleasure of drunken revellers and traffic all night long. Being pregnant at present my only concern was a comfy bed and a nice bathroom. Unfortunately the Carlton had neither. The bed was rock hard, with frayed pillowcases and not at all inviting after a day walking the streets. The bathroom was a glorified cupboard. It was in effect a tiny wetroom with a showerhead almost over the toilet. We hoped that the breakfast wouldn't be as bad as expected but it was worse. The breakfast room is only open from 8am to 9am and has around 6 tables to seat 4 people. It was crammed into a small room in the basement.

I can put up with a bit of dirt and cramped quarters if it's central and cheap, and who spends that much time in their room anyway? Please read all these reviews and believe what is said about the negative aspects of this place because it is true, and more. Our room was on the top floor (room 220) and not only were the sheets stained and the mattress mildewed all down the side, but the carpets were filthy and frayed, there was long black hair in the bathroom, the toilet was leaking from the base and had \"sunk\" into a pool of vile-smelling liquid on the plastic floor. Sitting on it was precarious and an exercise in not getting one's feet wet from the leakage. When having a shower in the tiny 3x4 bathroom with a stained, smelly plastic shower curtain (impossible not to touch and have it stick to you when showering in that tiny space), water would run all over the floor, creating an overpowering urine stench from the obviously crusty stucco-like plastic floor and the pool of water/urine around the base of the toilet which would wash all over the bathroom floor when the shower was on. My daughter and I had to go out and buy flipflops just to make the bathroom experience tolerable. We requested another room (also because my elderly father was joining us mid-way through our stay and could not climb the 8 flights of stairs easily) and were treated fairly rudely by the night clerk. (Although the young woman on the desk during the day was quite polite and helpful.) When we did change rooms (to room 209) it was somewhat better, having high ceilings, a balcony and a clean(er) bathroom floor. It still had the basic cleanliness problems including other people's bandaids, razors and used tissue under the beds and cigarette butts and beer bottles on the balcony. We also had an over-anxious maid banging on our door at 10 am one day when we were trying to sleep in, insisting she clean the room. Don't bother with the breakfast - instant coffee, wonderbread toast and tang. Croissants, yogourt and tea were OK though. Spend a bit more and stay at the comfort inn next door (it's lovely but twice as much) or the easyhotel.com or the belgrave inn on the same block which are cheaper - there are lots of hotels in this area that are a bit more expensive but infinitely nicer.

TINY room with no walking space and no room for our luggage, peeling wallpaper, rock-hard beds, dirty ugly green carpet, tiny RV-style bathroom, cheap sheets and bedspread. Even with the window shut you couldn't sleep with all the street noise below. I'd heard how bad London hotels could be but I couldn't have imagined it being this bad and it is in a very seedy part of London. To think we paid close to $170 to stay in this pit!

The room had broken windows, no ventilation except the open window. The bathroom was nothing more than an Recreation Vehicle insert. No room to move much less take a decent shower. I suspect these were put in to elimate the door the hall bathroom. The bed was in very poor shape as was the pillows. It was so lumpy no one could sleep. The included breakfast was burnt toast, orange juice, a pot of boiling water to fix either instant tea or coffee, cereal and yogurt with a selection of jams & jellies. Not very appealing and everyone in the breakfast room was as surprised as we were. The only redeeming qualities - the bedsheets were clean and the bedspread and curtains matched!! Where were the rooms in the pictures???", "Date": "August 28, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Carlton Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d192163-Reviews-Carlton_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$98 - $370*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">90 Belgrave Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Victoria</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 2BJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "192163", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e9/fd/e9fd90f159ea092d02c9ec20745202c11large.jpg"}}
