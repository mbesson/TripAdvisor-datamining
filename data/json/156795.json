We had a second floor room with a beautiful view of the water and beach. The rooms are very nice, modern, bright, clean, hot shower in a beautiful tiled bathroom, open kitchen/dining area, 2 queen beds, closet, dresser, cushioned couch, desk. We had lots of room, and really enjoyed our stay. The outside sitting area was very nice as well. The pool and kiddie pool were very nice, and cleaned daily. Snorkeling and swimming right out front was very good. We ate at the restaurant once....prices are a bit high, but food was good and a good variety to choose from. There is also a small hut by the hotel where they do massages. My husband had an excellent massage at a very reasonable price. There is a small grocery store at the end of the road going to Paamul where we purchased some items for our kitchen - it is an easy walk to get there. There is also a small outdoor taco tent/stand across the highway that serves excellent tacos. Don't let the looks of it fool you....it is worth a trip across the highway. Paamul is a very nice little town. Fun to walk around and see all of the RV/palapa homes that people have created to be their own.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cWe would definately go back!\u201d", "Author": "jma1445", "ReviewID": "UR15085021", "Content": "My husband and I read about Paa Mul in our Lonely Planet guide book and decided to go check it out. Cabanas Paamul suffered a lot of damage after hurricanes Emily and Wilma. As a result, the owners built a new upscale hotel that has about 10 or so rooms. They do still have a few cabanas, but the lady at the front desk suggested we get a room in the hotel instead. We were very impressed with the quality of the new hotel. It is very nice and the best part is that this hotel actually has really comfortable beds! The rooms are all right on the ocean and have sliding glass doors which open onto a small patio right in front of the water. It's really gorgeous. The price is somewhat high - $100 a night . But, you might be able to bargain with them if you book a longer stay and contact the hotel directly. Also, the restaurant had very good food and they have a really nice pool. You can book a snorkle trip there too for about $25 for 3 hours. The seas were rough when we were there, so we didn't get to go. Note that the beach here is more rocky with many shells and broken coral because it is situated on a bay that is surrounded by a reef. So, it doesn't have the white powder sand that you might find in Tulum or Playa del Carmen. For this reason, I don't think there will be as much development in Paa Mul. So, I would definately go back there. The only catch is that you really need to rent a car if you want to stay there because it is so out of the way and there isn't much to do besides enjoy the view.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cCould turn into tourist trap\u201d", "Author": "Arjii", "ReviewID": "UR7391180", "Content": "This review concerns the hotel in most part, not cabanas. Anyways we also got problem with direction, so please, read this. This new hotel is built between the cabanas and the sea, directly on the beach. You\u2019ll find there a restaurant, a pretty beach, a diving center and a snorking \u201carea\u201d. $120 / night, breakfast isn\u2019t included. What we liked Great view of Caribbean sea, front rooms are on the beach, sea is 10m ahead. Spacious and recent room, well furnished. Fridge & microwave What we hated No credit card accepted, be warned!!! Cleanliness barely acceptable: bath-tub is squalid at some place, washbasin full of fur. Pillows smelled like they hadn\u2019t been washed. Very noisy. You can hear AC - or whatever we don\u2019t really know what it was \u2013 activate twice for long minutes every quarters. Far from everything if you haven\u2019t got a car. It becomes really complicated as you are dependant from the restaurant. You have to walk 500meters to reach the road and once there to take a taxi / colectivo and get to Port adventura to find a cash point. No TV. Restaurant Price are a bit too expensive for what they are: it will cost you an average 70 pesos for a breakfast (drinks aren\u2019t included for all breakfast but continental one, which is ridiculous) and about 170 pesos for a dish and drink. Service is veeery slow and the minimum is done (tables are barely cleaned). Sometimes, the restaurant becomes a changing room for the diving center. I had a breakfast between (--), breasts and armpits. People put their shoes directly on tables... disgusting, especially when considering what I just said above. PLEASE READ THIS \u2013 OUR EXPERIENCE We knew that something wrong would happen there. At first we tried to get them on phone the day before we get there as we wanted to know if credit cards were accepted. It ended each time on answering machine. We finally decide to go without any more cash. First mistake, we discovered once on the spot that no credit cards were accepted. A woman was already complaining about this at the office. Reception guy seemed unconcerned with it; he said it was ok to pay on paypal as we did weeks before as a booking account. Once in the room, we were at first really impressed, the view is just great! As we were inspecting the room and packing out our stuff, we discovered our first roommate, a beautiful 1 inch cockroach, I hate those. Unfortunately they were a family, we got one each day... Then we saw the cleanliness of the room: could be really better. We then went trough the terrace to the beach. I noticed that the door was closing unperfectly. Kind of a locker was fixed any old how. Once outside, we saw that a large amount of paint and an arm of each armchair was missing. After having dinner, I decided to relax and have a shower. God what an idea...water was cold... The next morning we were awakened by a glorious leak of water at 6 am. Doorway and bathroom were underwater. Enough. We decided to complain, at least for the mess to be cleaned. It was about 9 am and we were told that someone from maintenance staff would come immediately. He came at 3pm and did the less he could. We started to get really disappointed but at least our stay there was only 3 days long. The greatest moment was about to come on our last day, after breakfast we decided to pay last part of our trip in Paypal. Well, I don\u2019t speak Spanish, my wife do, so I can\u2019t tell you exactly what has been said but believe me, it was quite a row. They first said it was not ok to pay on Paypal, truly we were liars. Then the owner came in. Once she realized what was going on, she started to shout at us, saying that we were thieves. Our bags would be kept by them at office while we get something to pay. Unbelievable, we were stunned. When the guy who told us that paypal payment was ok stepped in, she starts yelling at him, warned him that he would pay from his wage if we didn\u2019t pay. Finally she asked a poor man to drive us to Port adventura to the only cash point of the area. That\u2019s how it ended. Sorry for being so long with my story and lousy English, but believe me it happened to other and it\u2019s a duty for me to warn people. It has been confirmed by friendly staff member as we were leaving. So please be careful, owners of this hotel are greedy people who get profit from this great place. You are a trapped wallet once there. Thanks for reading, don\u2019t forget to look at pictures.
