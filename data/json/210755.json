But the real bonus is that this Hotel is within easy walking distance of Three main line stations and several underground stations. You will find travel expensive in central London so that is a huge saving and also enables you to see more. There is a good cinema within walking distance at the Brunswick centre.

On arrival we were charged on our credit card, for the 2 nights and allocated a room on the first floor. First we could not fit our regulation airline luggage and ourselves in the lift so I sent my wife via that and walked up to find a room that was the smallest double room I have ever seen. It looked tired and on a closer inspection, it smelt and had marked and dirty paintwork. The bed was jammed against two walls so the person on the inside would have to clamber over the other to get out (not good for the older traveller who needs the loo in the night). We told the Desk clerk that this room was unsatisfactory and he offerred us another on the third floor. Whilst slightly larger, it also smelt and had cracked and stained paint and wallpaper, the windowsill was exploding with dry rot and the catches were broken off the windows. The bathroom was indescrobable, a ten year old would have trouble fitting in the shower stall. Again we told the clerk that it was unsatisfactory but he could offer no solution so we told him we were leaving immediately - he would only offer a refund of the second nights charge, when I protested he told me it was hotel policy to charge one night cancellation fee!!! we did not cancel we marched out in high dudgeon-- I have subsequently demanded a refund to no avail - one email from them even said we stayed and used the facilities which shows how out of touch they are.

After he had booked and I myself looked at the reviews of this hotel, i had an instant feeling that we had made a mistake and we were not proven wrong To this day we are now extra cautious as we do not want to make this kind of mistake again! The hotel is on a side street and is extremely small from the outside, so is the reception, there is no particular lobby and we were put in a what I would describe as a box room on the first floor, had hardly any room to walk around, the head of the bed was against one wall and the foot of our bed was touching the window curtains and joined to the window sill, so you can imagine how small the room is, My partner and I had to give way to each other if either of us needed to step from the desk and chair area to the bathroom which is also extremely small with the shower, sink and toilet so close to each other, The door to the bathroom is thin can hear everything! The shower has a plastic curtain but the water is not contained in and leaks out onto the floor of the bathroom and down a drain, cannot walk around the bathroom without getting feet wet. Toletries provided were of cheap quality. The service is average, the one person front desk staff did not seem particularly bothered and was quite offish, told us that there were no other bigger rooms for that night but could offer to switch the next day if there were, When i requested for fresh towels in the morning I was told I can get them myself downstairs. The most positive note was the breakfast which was included in the price but was average, quite a nice cosy setting but the menu is limited in choice and service seemed very slow. What was intended to be a 3 night stay was cut short to one night only and we had to find another hotel, which there are an abundance of in London and for much better price and quality so personally I would only suggest that you stay here ONLY if desperate or feel is absolute necessary being close to Kings Cross station, Euston or anything else there nearby.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cMore B&B!\u201d", "Author": "Brutu", "ReviewID": "UR6624032", "Content": "I concur with the previous review, this hotel, or more realistically - B&B - is ideal for small persons/couples wishing to stay in London. Overall I and my wife had an excellent experiance the four nights we stayed there, costs were excelent for the twin ensuit room - approx GBP45 per night - this was a special Xmas price from an internet site. Staff were very helpful and even lent me a laptop to access the internet from my rm on the second floor. Mac owners beware, the wireless network is incompatable. On the whole, I'd highly recommend this hotel if singles were priced below GBP50 and doubles below GBP60. Breakfast is a bonus, although bacon and eggs a bit on the small side. Location is ideal, two rail stations and three tube stations all within easy walking distance. Close to the British Museum, British Library and major universities. Also good access for shopping, sightseeing and the theatre. I will utilise this hotel again if the price is right. One major bug, the rooms are indeed small and bathroom unit is a must see if you get my meaning. As such, if a small person make the best of it, if a giant, avoid.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cOK for small people.\u201d", "Author": "J-CDup", "ReviewID": "UR6561984", "Content": "Definitely the smallest hotel rooms I have ever seen.
