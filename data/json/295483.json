We needed to be near the airport and the Cinar is 5 minutes away (only 8 TL), yet a world away! I generally am so disappointed with Airport Hotels. as I'm sure you are also. This was really the best decision we could make. Our room was perfect and comfy as it overlooked the sparkling Marmara Sea with bustling ship traffic in the distance. The outdoor pool was right beneath our lanai/terrace and added to ambiance and romance. The room had apparently just been redone in the most delightful colors, woods and fabrics. The bath had all the fine touches one could wish for. Everything was clean and immaculate. We travel more than 50 nights a year, every year. This place is a winner. Every thing was excellent and it far exceeded our expectations. Sometimes, when you book on line -- sight unseen -- you're never really sure what the outcome may be. But this experience was fabulous! The front counter staff was professional and efficient. The door staff attentive and ever so quick and helpful. The morning breakfast crew excellent and more than perfect! (as was the deliciously varied hot 'n' cold buffet day-starter)! Housekeeping kept everything neat and tidy and friendly. Indoor pool and spa person was kind and understanding. We should have dined in the Cinar restaurant as the \"Highly Touted\" nearby seafood restaurant down the street was a TOTAL disappointment. 50 Turkish Lira for a \"seafood-less\" seafood salad and 6 little fried squid rings. They offered Shrimp at 140.00 TL per kilo, and their fish averaged over 70.00 TL per kilo. Always check the menu first before going into any restaurant! Their indoor spa pool was heated and idyllic. We strolled the neighboorhood and enjoyed the park with several local families picknic-ing and mini-zoo. There was a problem, however! We only stayed one evening, as we would have LOVED to have stayed many, many more!!!! For sure, next time next time. The highlight of my birthday was being able to spend it at the hotel Cinar in delightful Turkey! We will always have such fond memories of the hotel Cinar.

I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in North America, and i don't find this hotel a 5 star hotel. I would say its a good 3 star hotel. The price is not that different from the Renaissance Polat. First off the rooms are decent enough. The 70's wallpaper has been painted over in a taupe color, however they are generally nice enough. Rooms are rather dusty, and while doing my pilates, I can see that the vacuum the maids use should be replaced. I have had to get my own towels a couple of times, as well as soap and toilet paper. Garbage, like empty plastic bottles will not be picked up, but left there. The hotel softens its water, so thats nice for hair washing. The pool is salt water, which I personally find a bit gross. Also my skin can not tolerate salt water. I found front desk service generally okay. I think there are far too many parking attendants and if your room is at the front you risk hearing them all night long. I purposely brought grocery items in many times, no one said anything, which is good, as being in a different country one would like to tend to their dietary needs at times, in a way that restaurants can not often provide. Breakfast is horrible. Each and every morning I have had to request coffee several times before I actually see any. That is annoying, VERY annoying. My husband usually orders eggs, sunny side up. They are a little too runny, and he usually only receives 4 bacon bit sized squares of Turkish Ham on his eggs. Internet has been working while I was here. On another note, I travel with my companion dog. This has proved to be a problem in Istanbul. There are many vets, but pets are not viewed as the pampered loved companions that many owners now see their pets as. No hotel we stayed with in the area would except my dog. While I can understand that to some extent I would think that a hotel wanting to be perceived as a modern hotel in 2008 should provide some area for pets. If not allowed in the room, perhaps for an extra amount an indoor/outdoor kennel can be provided at a small extra cost. As well as bedding for the pet. Likewise, smoking and nonsmoking rooms should be provided, this is 2008. As an nonsmoker / ex-smoker I dislike the faint scent of smoke on the mattress. The hotel might want to consider for guests staying longer than a week, that a kettle and complimentary tea and coffee be provided in the rooms.

Pool is closed at 6.00pm so for people like me who start work at 7.00am and return at 6.30pm there may as well not be a pool. Room service was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well cooked and served quickly. I was booked in this hotel from the 17th to the 23rd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when I decided to cancel and leave the hotel on the 19th at 11.00am they charged me for the night of the 20th and then threatened to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charge me a percentage of the amount due up to the 23rd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - I asked for an explanation of what they were talking about, for example what is the percentage and they responded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was normal practice in Turkey to charge such cancellation fees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but when I pressed them further they seemed to be unable to explain what they were talking about. The final bill didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include any other shocks so I should be thankful for that.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cinar Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295483-Reviews-Cinar_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$158 - $240*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Fener Mevkii</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Yesilkoy</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34149</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "295483", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/52/4f/524fd05679ce34065031a1ff20615f091large.jpg"}}
