The deck clerk was rude when we checked in - I stood beside the only person checking in and the clerk snapped at me to \"get in line\" like there were dozens of people waiting.

It was nice to open the connecting door and share all the space. Getting the shuttle from the airport was easy, and they offered shuttle service to the cruise port as well. The rooms were clean, had great comfortable beds, and the usual refrigerator and microwave. We also had small outdoor balconies. You can see from the photo that it is an older property, but it has been nicely renovated. We checked across the hall and saw that some king size rooms had a nice view of the marina that was across from us. Other reviews have commented on the elevator, and I agree it is small, but we managed just fine and often used the stairs. I noticed that there were accessible rooms handily located on the ground floor. The breakfast was cereal, make-you-own waffles, pastries, yogurt, toast, that sort of thing. Denny's is a short walk away if you want bacon and eggs. The breakfast room was well maintained. Here I saw families, older couples, and a few businesspeople. There was an outdoor pool area with lounge chairs but it was a little bit too cool outside to try, but it looked appealing and would be popular in warmer weather, I imagine. The neighborhood, which I think is called Point Loma, has small restaurants, stores, and the marina all just outside. There is a huge shopping complex a short cab ride away. I thought we might be isolated from all the sights, but since we've been to San Diego before it didn't bother us. Having a rental car would make getting around easy and there is free parking at the hotel, but we didn't feel the need to get one.

Staff (especially co-manager, Juyita) was courteous, helpful and accommodating. Rooms are large enough, but oversized furniture and interior design don't maximize spatial quality. Room 202 had nice alcove adjacent bathroom, but not much of a view. Wet area (including dressing alcove) nicely outfitted (granite flat surfaces, including vanity). Fridge and microwave in room with adequate access to restaurants and grocery. The hallways are the most notable detraction - need updating, and hall lights at night shine through under door. Neither of these should otherwise deter guests. Rooms are clean and housekeeping staff is attentive to cleanliness. Breakfast is adequate - nothing spectacular - and self-serve hot waffles available. I did take the opportunity to pass on (via private forum) a few business \"tweaks\" to management, primarily guest room space utilisation and healthy menu offerings for breakfast.

However, it also gets extra points for a few amenities you often don't find in hotels with price tags twice this high. I stayed here twice - on both ends of a scuba diving liveaboard trip out to see some great white sharks, long story - and my review applies to both rooms. As I've mentioned in other reviews, certain things usually score extra credit points from me: good ventilation and water pressure, a comfy bed, a quiet room, and access to snacks and soft drinks. This place scored high on all those counts, honestly. Air conditioning worked great, the rooms were comfortable, the bathrooms had recently been remodeled and were quite spacious. One room was just average size, but one was huge! This place actually is something of a flophouse for several companies that run trips out to see the sharks, and some outfits that do sportfishing, so you may want to call ahead to double check room availability. I screwed up my travel plans, then called at 8 AM to book a room for an extra night and it turned out to have been a great thing...I heard later the place filled up shortly thereafter. A couple of real extra credit points to this hotel: There was a fridge and a microwave in each room; the drink and snack machines were amply stocked, not broken, and conveniently located in the lobby - and, oh joy! A change machine! Best of all, this hotel was silent as the grave. I stayed up super late one night and was not awakened early the next morning by loud talking, slamming doors, any of that nonsense. Also, there's plenty of parking, and the hotel is located very near some really wonderful restaurants (we liked the Fish Grotto and, aw heck, another one the name of which escapes me right now...but seriously, there are several outstanding joints within easy walking distance. There's also a Denny's a block away and I had no trouble ordering a pizza late one night.) The neighborhood was just fine, not frightening, and you're within sight of the incredibly beautiful harbor. You're also right on top of the airport, and yet somehow not within the flight path...I didn't hear much jet noise. The Internet worked great!! This one gets REAL points from me...I've stayed in \"luxury\" hotels where the wireless signal was terrible, or they charged $30 per night or something absurd. At the Ramada, I got a strong, clear signal, no trouble logging on, and no need for a \"bridge\" for rent from the front desk or similar foolishness. I'd stay here again in a hot second.

There were even fireworks across the harbor the first night (a Padres game, I think) so that made it all the more worthwhile.

I did not try Captain's Quarters, the onsite cocktail lounge and deck, but it seemed to be moderately busy during my stay.

The staff/owner appears to live onsite, and all the personnel I had occasion to interact with were polite and helpful. A shuttle to the airport was available with 24 hours notice.

The local restaurants and fast food are convenient and most are a good value. Loved Santana's for quick and large portioned Baja-Mex, always had something to set aside and reheat later in the in-room microwave! Pizza Nova was fun and poured some really potent cocktails.
