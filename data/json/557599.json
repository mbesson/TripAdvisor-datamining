{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good location value for money I stayed here in September while attending a conference at Funabori, two stations along the Toei Shinjuku line from this hotel.The hotel is conveniently located 1 minutes walk from Mizue subway station. There are many shops and food outlets nearby, and a coffee shop in the same building as the hotel.The staff were helpful and the accommodation was good value, although the semi-double room was very small for two people.The room had airconditioning and a tea kettle for boiling water and the compact bathroom had a shower over the tub and a Japanese multi controlled jet toilet.Travel from Narita airport was cheap and easy. A 780 yen Keisei Railway ticket to Keisei Yawata, then a short walk to Motoyawata station (S21)on the Toei Shinjuku line and a 170 yen ticket for the two stations to Mizue (S19)", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR238241340", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ochlophobic"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066445-d557599-r20945303-Mizue_Dai_Ichi_Hotel-Edogawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "557599", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
