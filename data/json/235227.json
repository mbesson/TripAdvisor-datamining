After reading the reivews we were a bit skeptical; however, in our opinion, the property and room were just fine. The location was great; close to a variety of retaurants, shopping and the interstate. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room was just like an apartment. I've heard that the property is going through a renovation where some rooms are updated with new decor. I had requested to be in an updated room when making the reservation, but was told at check-in that the owners had first grabs at those rooms. We are not owners, so we were not in an updated room. However, the room was clean and worked out fine. The photos on the website do give a good idea of the room you'll get. Typically, my family vacations in a \"regular hotel room\" with two beds as we never plan to spend much time in our room. This time we wanted to chill out more and that required more space. We got it! It was nice to have a full kitchen, washer and dryer, jacuzzi, two bathrooms and a screened porch. We were on the first floor close to the pool and it was fine, not as noisy as I had expected and especially during Spring Break. The pools and property were nice and clean. Also, we had access to parts of the other properties, The Villas, and we visited the ice cream parlor and Bar Grille to watch the Final Four ;). The Villas is larger property and had LOTS of guests, much busier than the Towers. The only con we would had was the sofabed. It was not comfortable. Again, we enjoyed our stay and plan to return to the Towers in the future!", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chichester, West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cFirst Time, didn't know what to expect but BRILLANT!\u201d", "Author": "Lastminuteone", "ReviewID": "UR127232326", "Content": "We were very kindly offered to use this accomodation by a UK owner, so apart from the photos we had viewed on line we didn't know what to expect - We weren't disappointed (and I only usually stay at 5* accomodation); the accomodation was exceptionally clean and tidy, spacious although perhaps the decor was overall a little outdated, that however, wasn't any problem at all. Couldn't fault the staff, who were always attentive, offering exceptional service (we just didn't have Jason experiences at all - see other review). Service was always prompt, polite (although I will agree there was 1 member of the Guest Services Team, an older lady, who was appeared a little clueless, but she got there in the end bless her - we just make sure we always spoke to Miguael during his shift as he was brillant). Couldn't fault any of the services or accommodation! Would definately stay there again. Miguael (hope thats how you spell it), was simply the best, he went out of his way to help us if we needed any assistance, he'd been employed by Westgate for many years and his experience showed. Power to you Miguael! We went mid season (1st to 17th March 2012), so the complex we stayed in was very quiet, the bonus being we had the pool to ourseleves most of the holiday. Check out the fab hot tub!! Best one I've been in. It got a bit busier the second week of our holiday, we're told due to Canadian Spring Break. We didn't really use the facilities on offer at the main part of the resort, but took a stroll over there (bit of a walk in hot weather - but us brits like to walk). Took the 'swan' out on the lake but the amercians do like you to sign your life away first don't they, couldn't believe the huge disclaimer we had to sign before we even stepped near the lake! Never got round to trying the Spa. We only realised at the end of the holiday that the reservation staff had booked us into the wrong Resort location (we should have been at Westgate Lakes), but not knowing the area or Resort locations in detail we weren't to know (booking by phone from the UK). I'd been told to ask for 'the tower' overlooking the lake so we could view Disney Fireworks at night. This was mistaken for Westgate Towers, rather than the towers at Westgate Lakes! We only found out by accident as we shared a taxi back from one of the Parks and the people were staying at Westgate Lakes. Seeing the huge Lake and the view it offered everything clicked into place about watching fireworks over the lake at night from our balcony. Never mind, both were great locations though, so it wasn't a problem, only in that we could see just the tip of the fireworks over the neon signs! It just means if we go back again we know what location to ask for. Shuttle buses allowed us to get back and forth to the Parks (only 15 mins from Epcot & then picked up the Disney buses to get from park to park - they run every 20mins to the different Disney locations). There were only two shuttles from Westgate each way to Disney, one at 9am & one at 12 noon, returning at 6.15pm and 9.30pm. (don't forget to book your seat in advance - as we planned what we were doing each day roughly this wasn't an issue). It meant however, you were either out all day or half a day, so little flexibility - either have an early breakfast or skip breakfast if you wanted a swim or to sleep in a little! It also meant a bit of a run if you stayed to watch the fireworks at Epcot as they finished about 9.20 and the bus left at 9.30pm (and the bus was always prompt so you couldn't be late). Perhaps a slighlty later bus, say 9.45pm would have least meant you could have strolled back to catch the bus rather than the marathon sprint (but it was fun!)! A car for at least some of the holiday would have been appropriate (prices hiked up due to sping break, and as there were 6 of us car hire was expensive), but we managed to get around and do everything we planned using the shuttles to both Disney and Universal (only 1 bus each way to Universal, 9.45am, with return at 8.30pm.) When shopping we used the Universal bus and then a taxi to get to both Millenia and Premium Outlets (watch out for the Taxi's, some of them are unroad-worthy, go for Yellow Mears ones, so take a phone so you can ring for one if you need more than 5 seats!). Again, a car would have been preferable for shopping just so you had flexibility in timing - you could shop at least a day in each and still go back for more!!!. The local supermarkets were expensive, only serving the tourists I suppose, but we ate out all the time (on holiday, who wants to cook!). Can definately recommend the Sizzler restaurant next door to the resort, all you can eat ($4.99 for breakfast and from $10.99 for evening meal - great value, and the foods not bad either, but it gets busy so be prepared to que a little!). We never quite got housekeeping schedule (for clean towels/cleaning the room), but we just asked the staff who were in the corridor and they always obliged, even though there was a bit of a language barrier. We could of called Guest Services to arrange, but never found any problem getting from the staff who were manning the housekeeping cart. Oh, and just one more thing - being Brits we loved our tea and there was no kettle, never thought to ask for one either as we just used a saucepan to boil water, but a kettle would have been easier in hindsight. Make sure you take your own Tea Bags for your morning cuppa, bought some over there from the local supermarket - expensive and not a patch on Typhoo or Tetley! All in all I can't fault Westgate Towers, clean, comfortable, spacious accomodation, with friendly, helpful and efficient service, real value for money!!", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwesome 1 Bedroom\u201d", "Author": "martin18042", "ReviewID": "UR126563420", "Content": "Great price and location.

This was our first trade for a Westgate property, and I will not do it again. Unfortunately, they put us in an older villa, but our resort is a Premier resort. Clearly, the trade was far from equal, as our resort is really nice. We have always been put in a nice, newer villa when trading, but they chose not to give us adequate accomodations. We were okay for the first evening, but then realized that our patio was indeed 12 inches (no patio). No ability to sit outside & enjoy the nice weather. I just thought all their villas had this option. Would have asked them to move us, but we were already fully unpacked with a busy day ahead. I later discovered that there were newly renovated villas on property that were clearly not being used. We were there during a slower week. The kitchen was old with a microwave that could not cook evenly (so old it had no carousel), the dryer stopped working in the middle of our laundry, and the power, lights, & A/C went out for no apparent reason one afternoon. We went for their timeshare presentation to see what they had to offer & the representative was surprised to see that we were not put in a nicer villa. This made me even more angry. This would NOT have happened at a Marriott property! Then, they tried to get us to sign a form saying we could not trade in the Orlando area for the next 5 years...really? That was the biggest untruth ever & was very disappointed that they would scam people into believing that just to but a timeshare from them & secure a guaranteed place to stay. We have done timeshare for many years & this experience was disappointingly an all-time low. The only good thing I could say was that the staff at the Towers was always very friendly & accomodating. Overall, they only treat their owners well apparently. If this was your way of making us want to become owners, it was an epic fail. I came home feeling tired, because it was hard to sleep.

You have supermarket on the resort and just outside of resort, but I would suggest you make a trip to Wal-Mart, because prices are outrageous. Resort itself was peaceful for 7 days we stayed there, no disturbances from neighbors of any sort. You also have washer and dryer in the condo, yep that's awesome. Even later check-out is available upon request. All balconies have nets, so you can enjoy breakfast or dinner on the balcony, and you don't have to worry about the annoying flying friends invading your food. There is also Pizza Hut on the resort, so if you don't feel like cooking, just order up. Also, one bad issue about the resort is that they charge you $5 per hour to access the internet. We opted out for the library, but it was not close. Also, they have some discounts on Universal tickets, but you could find better deals on Ebay.

We checked in late in the evening and the people at the front desk were nice and checked us in rather quickly. We were offered and we accepted assistance with getting our things up to the room. Our 1-bedroom accommodations were very nice. The carpet had just been cleaned (indicated by a sign on the floor that the carpets had just been cleaned and all of the ceiling fans were on and the A/C was blowing like crazy to dry them). The pull out sofa bed could have been more comfortable, but then again what sofa sleeper is comforatable?!?! The room itself was spotless, practically sterile! The FULL-kitchen was well equipped and everything was in perfect order. The silverware, bowls, dishes & pots & pans looked brand new! Jacuzzi tub in the Master bedroom was great. The floors were clean & shiny. Our 2nd floor room had a nice view of the jacuzzi & heated pool. The only reason I would recommend NOT requesting a pool view is that the pool area is open until 11pm and you can hear all of the converstion & action that goes on, even with the sliding doors closed. When we requested more bath towels & toilet paper, housekeeping was at my door within 5 minutes! Since we checked in late, we went to the Welcome Center the next morning to pick our 2 complimentary 1-day adult tickets for Disney. They gave us a voucher to pick up the tickets at any Disney Theme Park...pretty simple. We went to Westgate Towers on a package deal, so we were obligated to attend a 90-minute sales pitch on buying into Westgate time-shares. We were scheduled for a 10:30am start, and they pretty much started on time. You get your own personal tour guide who escorts you to a continental buffet breakfast. The salesman then goes into his pitch which ends with a tour of the property via golf cart and a sit down with a manager. The entire ordeal lasted a total of 2 1/2 hours from beginning to end (they all do), not 90-minutes. In the end, we declined to buying a time-share and that was the end of it. Our salesman was obviously disappointed, but he didn't go on, he left it at that. Didn't feel any high sales pressure, they did their thing and I simply said not interested! Since we started at 10:30am, we didn't leave the sales pitch until 1:00pm. If you plan on doing this, schedule the 7:30am start time, so you have most of the day left to go do your own thing. Westgate Towers is literally 1 mile away from Osceola Pwky, which leads you to Disney World. You are just about 1 mile from the entrance to Animal Kingdom. Very conveniently located if you plan on driving yourself to Disney World. There is a grocery store within walking distance, so you can get almost anything you need when you get there, instead of hauling everything from home! There are a number of places to eat within walking distance as well. For the price, this package was a steal. We were very happy (lucky?) with our room as it was VERY,VERY clean and very spacious for 2 adults and a child. We only spent the very early mornings & late nights in the room to sleep as we were at the parks & out and around all day. That is why we were looking for space & cleanliness.

We live in Florida and have done all the parks in the past so I figured what the heck, it'll give us something to do for an hour and a half. Besides, it may be something I'd like to invest in. We checked in at 10 pm with no problems, however, Pablo, the gentelman that checked us in was lacking in personality: not very talkative. The employees at guest relations were nice and informative. Before arriving I figuered that since we were going through a sales presentation that we would be getting a room with at least decent view. Not so, we got the parking lot. The room was nice, spacious and besides the dirty rugs, small leak under the kitchen sink and broken vertical blinds, the price at $29 per day was fabulous for the room we had. I did some homework on WestGate before we arrived on Trip Advisor and 2 other sites where reviews are posted. The news was not good. I printed over 100 reviews of the timeshare property, with a minimum of 95% negative reviews from people who own or toured with WestGate. Our sales person was informative and attentive. Young, however somewhat expierienced in keeping the attention of his potential buyers. He asked alot of questions when he thought he was looseing you. Since I was able to do my homework on WestGate before we arrived, I had documented evidence to contradict almost everything that was in the sales pitch and I brought it with me and even showed it to him. Persistent he was, even with what I showed him from numerous complaints of people that own at WestGate. Truthfully, he did not present us with a hardcore presentation and was rather nice. However he was a salseman and was there to make money so he did not give up. Finally after 2 1/2 hours, I called it quits (2 or 3 times before he finally got the message). DO YOUR HOMEWORK, CHECK THE INTERNET. IF YOU PLAN TO BUY A TIMESHARE CHECK WITH STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD LAWYER BEFORE YOU BUY. ALWAYS READ YOUR CONTRACT. My advice - invest in a residential or commercial property where you have full control, 52 weeks a year. If you have nothing else to do with your money, then timeshare is for you, but buy it outright and don't fall into the 18% interest rate.

It used to be a Motel that went bankrupt and then they took it over and made it into a resort. They state there are lots of ammenities here but there is really only one. (Swimming Pools) 3 and on top of that only one of them is heated. There are no vending machines in the North tower either you have to walk all the way to the other side of the resort to even get a soda. Yes they have more ammenities if you don't care to walk a mile to Westgate Villas. It is not a place to take your kids. PERIOD I will state that the rooms were nice and the furnishings looked good at first sight but they are all old and broken down. Including the mattress. Their other resorts are alot nicer and have the true ammenities that are stated.

Our tour was to be at 7:30 AM with a breakfast promised. We arrived along with about 100 others and stood in line for 40 minutes before getting to the registration desk. After going into the Lobby to wait yet again, we were called to our tour and sales pitch. Plan for 2 hours + of your time. Needless to say, we and most of those around us were truely angry at this treatment. We had fullfilled our part of the bargain, we came, we were prepared for the sales people. NO breakfast yet after an hour and the salespitch had not begun. Do not take this treatment lightly, speak up. We protested this treatment strongly with the management and we were signed off and went on our way. Take advantage of this reduced hotel rate and tour offer only if you are desperate, really plan to buy no matter how you are treated, or have lots of vacation time and like standing for 40 minutes.

This avoids headaches associated with busier weeks, such as check-in woes, dirty rooms, misplaced reservations and lottering kids. (One midweek day in early December only 17 families registered; a Saturday in the summer can have 500 check-ins.) It's a good deal when you get condo through online sources that don't require a \"property tour.\" I've paid $50 for a 1-bedroom and $95 for a 2-bedroom, including tax. Condos are spacious with semi-luxury appointments. The Villas are fine but the Towers are newer and nicer. There is no daily housekeeping and no garbage pickup ... deal with it. We wash our own sheets/towels midweek. DON'T book a vacation that requires a \"property tour,\" it will spoil your vacation. NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE, pay for your theme park tickets. Don't buy an overpriced timeshare, you will be unhappy. Online shoppers can rent for a week for less than an owner's annual maintenance fee. Don't believe anything sales people say: One tried to make appontment to answer a questionaire at 8:30 am b ysaying \"the parks are crowded then\"; the questionaire apparently is a hustle to make a sales pitch. Just politely decline. If you are weak, don't answer the phone. Don't rent on summer weekends or on spring break. Clerk tells me they have up to 500 families coming in on a summer Saturday.

I dont feel that people see the hotel for itself because of the sales pitches the management burden you with. I think they should let the hotel sell itself.
