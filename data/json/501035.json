It is clean, quiet, economical, and close to Silver Dollar City. There are lots of trees, a playground, a hot tub, and a pool. The grounds are quite charming. Each unit has a grill and picnic table. The rooms are dated, but adequate. The kitchens would save a family a lot of money during a long stay.Now for the negative. I must say the bathrooms leave a lot to be desired. Just updating the shower heads would make a huge difference. The one in our unit was terrible, and if you're tall, forget about washing your hair. We had no hot water when we woke up on Saturday morning, so a shower was out of the question. However, they did make it right by us and were very gracious about it. We arrived late on Friday night (8 pm or so), and an envelope with the key inside was taped to the door of the office, with our name and room number on it. To me, this could have been a safety issue. Also, there was no phone in our room to be able to contact the office about our water issue. Just so you know, there is no ice machine, you have to buy ice from the office, and they are only there from 9-5. (There is a phone near the office that you can use to call the staff if you need them.) The bed wasn't comfortable, but we know not to expect great beds unless you pay more for a room. I don't mean to nitpick, just want to be as detailed as possible. While we will probably not return, if you are looking for a clean and very economical place to stay on Indian Point, and you go in knowing that you get what you pay for, then this is a good place to stay to be close to SDC. Clean room, friendly staff, just not the place for us.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolivar, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing week\u201d", "Author": "fabshack", "ReviewID": "UR133024973", "Content": "if you're looking for luxury, this is not the place for you.

This resort is nearby, and is on the favorable side of the highway to avoid traffic congestion to and from SDC. One of our boys has many food allergies, so most of his food has to be prepared while on the road, which is a logistics hassle. The kitchen in the two bedroom room was great, which made food preparation much easier than a typical room with only a microwave and a dorm-size refridgerator. The full-size refridgerator was a definate plus. A few days after arriving home from this trip, we recieved a package from David at Golden Arrow. He found one of our boys' t-shirts and sounvenier penny by the pool and mailed them to us. That is great customer service, and is appreciated. The pool is large, very well maintained and has a slide that kids love. The hot tub is located in it's own gazebo. There are two different play areas for kids, one near the pool with swings, and merry-go-round. Another area with a swing is behind the rooms. Other than the mattresses being harder than we are used to, we enjoyed our stay at the Golden Arrow and will definately return.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cA Definite Keeper...Will Tell Friends and Family...Will Certainly Return\u201d", "Author": "dinglebat", "ReviewID": "UR116826028", "Content": "Wanted to get away from the hassle of work and spend time with the family before the youngest heads off to college. Great location, easy to get to everything we needed, to include groceries. For the 3 of us, the \"C\" unit was perfect...it was clean and had enough cookware for us to do what we needed. Was it brand new...absolutely not. But for a safe, clean place to lay your head and cook your meals while enjoying the Branson attractions with your family, especially with the economy acting the way it is, there is probably no better place to stay than Golden Arrow. Yes, there was one group that arrived and decided to see just how late into the night they could be loud, but you can certainly find that anywhere. The key is that Dave runs the place much like my parents did their resort in Wisconsin years ago...with customer service and personal attention in mind. He was so quick to fix an issue with the deadbolt on our door that is would make a person's head spin.

We spent most of our time out on the lake or at the pool when we were back at the cabin we were mostly on that porch. It poured rain our first night there but we were all dry and comfortable on the porch! We didn't go to SilverDollar City but it is REALLY close(like 2 miles), Branson was about a 10 minute drive and Branson West is 5 minutes (we grocery shopped there). The owners were really nice too, which always makes a trip more pleasant. This place isn't on the lake directly but the marina is 1/2 mile down the road and there is a public access area next to the marina too. We thought that would be a bummer but we really didn't miss it as much as we thought we would. All in all, I would stay here again. P.S.
