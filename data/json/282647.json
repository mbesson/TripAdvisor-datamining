I'm American but very familiar with Europe. I'm also bilingual, but unfortunately don't speak German. There are no labels on the phone in the room. People have called me, but I can't access the message. When I asked the clerk at the desk how to use the phone, her answer was, \"I don't know.\" She was also unsure about the cost of calls to cell phones versus those to land lines. I have work to do here in the morning, and don't get out until the afternoon. There is no \"occupied\" sign to put on the door, so each day, a cleaning lady enters unannounced, often seeing me in my underwear and sometimes nude. She gasps and leaves. The hotel advertised as having internet in each room. They do, but it's $18 each 24 hours, by way of a T-Mobile Hotspot. You don't find that out until you get here. When I filled out the booking form, it said, \"check here if you want a nonsmoking room.\" I'm a smoker, so I didn't check it. When I arrived, I was informed that I'd been assigned a nonsmoking room and that there were no smoking rooms available. There is no free information for tourists at the desk. They charge for everything, even a tacky booklet called \"Best of Germany\" cost 2 euros. There seem to be no maps available. Other than that, it's clean and quiet, though somewhat kitsch. I'm wondering about the star system for German hotels. This one has 4 stars, but I'd be willing to bet they're not Michelin.

The linnens and towels were clean but had holes, there was no minibar nor a \"please don't disturb/make the room\" sign in the rooms at all. The night curtains had no double linings so that the room didn't get dark at night. The only 4-star standard was the bathroom: modern, plenty of storage space, plenty of towels, shower lotion dispenser refilled daily, make-up mirror, hair dryer. Another positive thing was the large size and bed in the single-room I stayed in. In addition to that, the location in a quite side street of Ku-Damm close to the Ka-De-We department store.
