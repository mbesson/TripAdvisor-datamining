What you get for 4 star there is not the same standard your going to get in Europe. This hotel was very clean. Our room was cleaned everyday. The linens and bathroom were always very clean. The room and bathroom was a little small if you are going to compare it to what you get in the US. at the same star rating. It was fine for two of us. The breakfast was excellent everyday. Fresh eggs, several kinds of breads and sweets rolls. Juice coffee, toast, ceral, cheese and ham. It was a little crowded a few mornings if we got there between 9-10 but we always found a table. By the way, as one person said there is only one english speaking channel on the TV which is CNN. But it's not the US so don't expect TV channels in a language other then their own. I was glad to have that.We would have no problem staying there again.", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR951055582", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SSC57"}, {"Content": "Totally disliked everything about this hotel! My partner and I visited Florence between 23rd to the 29th of August 2008 and was booked into the Diplomat Hotel. The only thing that was good about this hotel was the location - it was just next to the main train station in Florence, the Santa Maria Novella station.I regretted not reading through the reviews of this hotel before choosing to stay at this hotel. Some of the problems that we encountered during our whole stay are as below :1. Reception was very unfriendly2. The bathroom of the room we stayed in (112) was of open plan and wasn't practical at all. Everytime we took a shower, the  entire floor of the bathroom was very slippery.3. We got a call around 9pm on the third night from reception. I answered the phone and all she said was she was waiting for us. And when I asked what it was for, she said that there were problems with the bathroom and that we had to change rooms. All this at 9pm at night, with no one giving us prior notice. Though we may have not been in during the day, the management should have left us a note about it. The  reception also said that if we chose to continue staying in the room, we could, as long as we didn't use the bathroom. Now  tell me, how could anyone cope without using the bathroom? That was really ridiculous and upset us.4. During breakfast one day, we were allocated a table. We got  our juices to the table and continued to the breakfast bar to get some cereal. Upon our return, there was another couple sat at our table and we both looked at the manager. He then moved us to another table without even apologizing.5. On our departure, I asked the reception where we could get a shuttle bus to the airport and he replied very rudely, not giving proper instructions. We finally found our way and bought tickets from the bus station. I then asked the guy at the counter where we should wait and boy was he extremely rude! I asked him politely again and he just pointed with a look of disinterest on his face.Our problems didn't end there. Whilst we were waiting for the busto the airport together with a Spanish couple, the bus finally arrived, but only took 1 passenger on-board and just left us, all looking confused and in total frustration!The four of us finally did manage to make our way to the airport, but boy, what an experience! If I ever did go back to Florence, I would never book myself into this hotel again.", "Date": "Sep 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR762589924", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sheradelia"}, {"Content": "Convenient but other only OK This hotel is perfect for visiting the highlights and is very near the train..

Hotel very bad at responding, took me 2 months of repeated emails, phone calls to get detailed conformation of my booking.On arrival told they were fully booked but had a room in their City Residence, just along the very busy main road. Refused the room until I had seen it. Nicely refurbished hotel but offered us a suite with a bed settee, not the twin bedded room ordered. Refused demanded another room, shown a smaller one with twin beds, refused as it was too small. Offered another room at the Hotel Diplomat, escorted back to hotel, walked for miles through corridors eventually shown a sub standard room, refused this so was taken down a shorter way via a lift that took us straight out to the Hotel Ambasciatori. Total disbelief that they could try a deceitful trick like that on a disabled person, or anyone else come to that. Eventually, after an hour arguing agreed to have the second room.

This would have been fine, had they advertised this and not given the impression that there was free parking available. We were also sold a 'superior twin/double with City View and Room upgrade. American Breakfast'. We were told that there were no city view rooms available and when I complained about this, I was told by the receptionist that 'I was making a fuss over nothing!' As for the American Breakfast....you can hardly call it this. The breakfast selection was more like a continental breakfast of the usual staples of cereal and ham and processed cheese. If you do get there 15 minutes before breakfast is closing there is hardly any food left. The breakfast room is also little to be desired. For a start, it is a shared room with the two adjoining the Hotels that the chain own. So you eat breakfast with about 100 other people in a room that has no air conditioning.

It may be due to their renovations, because the web-site shows a small glass partition.If you are American, you will not enjoy their breakfast. They had a buffet dish of little hot dogs, a lot of desserts, but no fresh fruit, no eggs, no bacon, and just knd of weird biscuits. They do have the best little cafe next door where yu can buy fresh bakery goods and get an inexpensive bottle of wine or beer or any kind of snack without paying the mini bar prices. - and the people at the cafe are really sweet.

I picked up a container of what I thought was peach yogurt, but the cashier handed me a straw. It turned out to be the very best peach juice I ever tasted - I guess I never had peach juice, and I have not yet been able to find it in the U.S.The hotel is average at best, but if you need to save money, it is fine, but you will have some problems with the staff. There is no concierge service, and when we requested more toilet paper, it took 4 hours to get it.It is not the U.S., but you can deal if the price is right.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR586821440", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BillieAnn"}, {"Content": "great hotel This place is a great deal.

No idea what it's like at night because we retired to the hotel by 8 pm each night.The room looks like it was updated in the last five years. Some dings on the walls from suitcases, but a clean room. The bathroom is very modern. Not enough towels, two bath towels for two people and a couple hand towels. Beds are pretty rock hard, but plenty and comfortable pillows.

The room was of a good standard, it looked pretty new or newly renovated. We had a balcony as well with nice views of the surrounding Tuscan hills. Breakfast was an excellent buffet with a wide variety of choices and the staff were all quite friendly and helpful.However, it seems that there isn't much sound proofing in the hotel. Our room faced the road side and so each morning, we were rudely woken up by the noise of street cleaners, followed shortly after by traffic. There are outdoor shutters on the windows but that didn't help much even when closed. There also seemed to be a problem with their water supply during busy hours, e.g around 8am. We had to forgo showers one morning due to the complete lack of water, which madeit a bit uncomfortable given the heat of the summer.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR110504521", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "very handy very handy for eveything - bus/train from pisa only 200yds away- room small but adequate and very clean -bedding changed every day.
