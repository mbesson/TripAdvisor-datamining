{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very satisfied with this hotel This hotel is conveniently located near the metro but we also enjoyed walking on the Gran Via down to the Prado and Sol areas. I agree that the hotel needs to soundproof their rooms more because I could hear clearly when guests close and open their doors. The air unit only gave out warm air, which was a bit annoying but not a major hassle. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels. The staff members were very cordial and helpful. We had to check out very early and the concierge made sure that we had a taxi (which costs about 30 Euros to the airport).

The real problems were: 1) Soundproofing- I don't know how they built this place, but, I swear, I have never been in a place where you hear a breath on the room beside. I was washing my teeth and I jumped: oh my god, someone entered into my room!! - of course, this was not the case, but I have travelled a bit and I have never seen such a place. 2) Heating: last week of December and I slept 4 nights with the window open!!! and there was nothing else I could do!! - again, i don't come from the north pole,I mean, it was not normal..Good points: - very good location close to the metro in a nice area and staff kind - I am afraid not enough to make me go back", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR135700701", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bridgerobe"}, {"Content": "Mixed feelings... Although the majority of the staff we encountered was helpful, some were not as willing to go beyond their call of duty.

The room was small and cozy but we found hairs on our bed sheets which made us question the cleanliness of the place. The hallways had a funny smell too. The bathroom although small was clean so no major complaints there. The walls are paper thin so be sure to bring ear muffs.

The staff was courteous at check in and check out. The hotel is not flashy but not a drag to stay in either.

It has a more business like feel to it, which generally means its clean and well kept, which was true. Not for those that like 'character'. Only odd downside was that one side of hotel had no direct lift access from reception (you had to climb 15 stairs with suitcase before a lift??). Very Odd. Also roadside was down 5 steps (not great place for handicapped people).Location was great. 25 mins walk to Puerto del Sol is no problem for me. But it means its in a nice neighbourhood, very quiet, but with local bars and restaurants (and Starbucks/Steakhouse for those days when you want home!).Its very easy to get from here to anywhere, especially the sights like Prado. And metro right around the corner.Amenities in hotel aren't top for this price (hence only 4 stars). There is no late night bar (11pm) and its very small and smoky. Not sure there is a separate breakfast place either (personally never do hotel breakfasts). There are plenty of very close local late bars so not a major issue, but at this price/level this should be included in my opinion. Room service food good, but strange menu (many main meals, few 'hotel' type snacks.Service at front desk good. One guy was not particularly helpful, but all the others were very nice. Booking restaurants for us no problem.

On the whole i found the hotel to be less than average. I travelled to Madrid with my wife and baby daughter (10mths) during July. This happened to coincide with one of the hottest weekends with temperatures being well over the 40C range around midday. However the hotel does not have an ice machine. In order to get Ice you had to pop down to the Bar or restaurant and ask for ice which was generally provided in a plastic carrier bag! This wouldnt have been too much of an issue had it not been for the fact that although the rooms had air conditioning, it was clearly not strong enough to cool the whole room. My daughter struggled to sleep in the heat and had a number of restless nights. We even noticed that the air con was turned off during some hours (though usually when most guest were out sight seeing).Other problems we experienced were: - The hotel is undergoung some renovations and so building work could be heard early in the mornings (around 8am) - We could only receive 9 of the 16 tv channels. The staff claimed that they only offered 9 channels when clearly the in room literature stated 16 channels. - The room had a weird smell to it when you first entered. We did ask to move rooms but there werent any available. - The bathrooms must have had very thin walls as you could hear what the people in the neighbouring rooms were up to (it was not pleaant!)It wasnt all bad though. Positives included: - Good location. Within walking distance to some of the key sites. A Burger King, Pizza Hut and Subway within walking distance if your stomach cannot handle the local delicacies. - Only a few hundred yards to the nearest underground subway/metro - Staff were very friendly and helpful.In summary, its a hotel that has a lot going for it, but sadly let us down in too many ways and we wont be staying there if we ever return to Madrid.", "Date": "Jul 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR504140072", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Its ok!
