Reallly worth it. (Though I miss their cook to order eggs, I understand as prices are going up for everything.) It's so great to be so close to the pier, have pleasant and speedy service, wonderful accomodations (nice ammenities-comfortable bed with ample pillows, an aroma therapy sleep kit, that nice rounded shower rod that keeps your curtain clinging the tub and not you, nice little soaps and lotions to use so you don't have to unpack yours if you don't want.) and so far we always got a room with a view of the harbor lights at night and then a view of our cruise ship the next morning. Another benefit of the location, is that there's a Rite Aid a few blocks up if you need to pick up something you forgot before setting sail (I believe that is Gaffey St). Also, several fast food places if you want to eat there or bring it back to the comfort of your room at night.

The pros: beds are comfortable, and the soap/shampoo/conditioner/lotion amenity package is good-smelling, and seems to be of superior quality. The hotel is perhaps half a mile to the cruise terminal (in fact, we could see the ship from our room), and starting at 10:30, and running every half hour from then on, there is a complimentary shuttle to the terminal. There are eating options within a few blocks of the hotel, as well as a restaurant on-site. We were able to get online in the lobby for free. The cons: we booked non-smoking rooms, but as there are also smoking rooms in this hotel, the air circulation system makes it so there is a perceptible smell of cigarettes in both our room, and our friends' room. (I was torn whether to give this review a \"3\" rating, instead of \"4\" based on this factor). Not exactly like being in the presence of someone actively smoking, but still.... .

I generally book my clients at the Doubletree in this area, (I specialize in Disney Cruises) and was looking forward to staying here to see if I would be willing to recommend this property also. I was pleased with my stay. As an agent you try to look at things from all kinds of perspectives, and I also talk to many other guests as I am out and about looking at the property. I also visit with as many staff members as I can. The good - As far as a park & cruise hotel, this property has a perfect location. It is extremely close to the pier. Depending on your room location, you can watch the ships sail in and out (neat!) Our room was perfectly clean. The beds were comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly, as was the bell staff, and the valet staff. The complimentary glasses of wine were a nice touch. We arrived early, and our room was ready. Everything went very smooth. The mediocre- We found it slightly inconvenient that to get to our car we had to have the valet bring it every time. We were a bit spazzy in that we needed to put more things in the car/overnight bag, and get other things out as we prepared to sail out the next day. This meant we had to have them get the car (and tipped them) 3 times. It would have been great if the lot had been easily accessible to us just so we could get in and out of our trunk without involving valet, but overall, not a big deal, just a statement really, and had we thought things through better, this wouldn't have been an issue. The less than great - the pool water was absolutely freezing (mind you, it was November). I noticed a middle age couple in the lobby that looked a bit frazzled and I started up a conversation with them. They were frustrated with the front desk staff because they were wanting a shuttle ride to somewhere nearby, and were told no. They countered that the website said they provided shuttle rides within a few mile radius, but the customers said the front desk staff had told them that was wrong, and that they should have been looking at the local website rather than the national one. At that point they were showing me on their phone what the Crowne Plaza website said, and the gentlemen from the concierge was agreeing that they were right, and as I left, I felt secure he was going to take care of the guest. The buffet the next morning was our least favorite thing about the stay. Although we had 4 guests, we received 2 vouchers for the buffet. We arrived about 5 minutes after they opened. There were only a handful of things out on the buffet, most of the hot items were cold (odd, I know), almost like they were warming them up from the day before?? By the time we paid our bill, they were still putting things out for the buffet, so we didn't get to have the majority of the things that were offered due to how late they were at getting them out. Our gentleman waiter was really, really out of it. He commented about being out too late the night before, and I am very nearly certain he was quite hung over. He only came by our tale 2 additional times, and spent most of his time giggling with a female employee off to the side. All in all, our breakfast was a bust, but that was my biggest complaint about the property, and it really has nothing to do with the room. I thought the price was moderate to high, but comparable to the other prices in the area for a stay and cruise rate. I would recommend this property to my clients.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vallejo, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Package Price for Park 'n' Sail\u201d", "Author": "Grokker", "ReviewID": "UR120509208", "Content": "The Crowne Plaza is a perfectly adequate hotel.

We stayed on the executive level. They had hors d' oeuvres at night and continental breakfast in the morning. Both were shoddy. The lounge ladies were interesting. One was complaining and the other was loud and obnoxious. The evening snacks were sad and the morning breakfast breads were sad. dry, and pathetic. One had to ask for butter.

Our room was was fine, clean, but there were few of the gadgets you\u2019d find elsewhere inside your room. Normally when we travel we use Super 8, and always get a large fridge, for instance, and a coffee machine \u2026 not here \u2026 and you pay for the use of the Internet, and then it was somewhat dodgy and kept dropping out, which was a pain since I lug my laptop along only because I actually have to do some work on it, not just for fun. We were there in October \u2013 and it was cool out (we come from Arizona) \u2013 but the lobby was cooled down to freezing (well, almost). Fortunately the AC could be turned off in the room. The view from the room was sensational, right across the harbor, cruise and container terminals \u2013 we had the good luck to see one of those massive floating-town cruise ships berthed and got to watch it sail. The location of the hotel is great, just a block or two from the shore and close to the cruise terminals, if that I your destination. And it was a less than ten minute\u2019s walk to the local version of the fisherman\u2019s wharf where you can find a whole row of restaurants/shops offering fresh seafood \u2013 actually, some of it can be bought alive (lobster). There\u2019s also a \u2018village\u2019 with touristy shops. The restaurant in the hotel was good, too. Staff was exceedingly friendly and accommodating and helpful, also in view of our pre-marathon special requirements. We were also told that we could register at a counter in the lobby for free transportation to the start of the marathon, and you could choose different times to get there \u2013 and back, which sounded like great service. That proved a bit tricky. First, there was nobody there, then the next guy didn\u2019t have the registration lists and told us to come back later. We did that and that guy in turn took a note \u2013 lists still absent, and that was the late after noon before the marathon. I think it was the fourth time or so of my going back before I was actually reasonably sure we were registered for transport. On the morning of the marathon \u2013 yes, it was VERY early \u2013 special small breakfast had been set out for the marathon runners. That was nice and much appreciated. And the vans to take us there were there as promised, and left almost on time. What was a real shambles was that our driver had absolutely no clue \u2013 as we found out \u2013 where he was taking us apart from the general vicinity. He was just told to follow the van ahead of him \u2013 which he promptly lost of course at a red light. After some useless driving around and getting stuck in a line while heading up the ramp of a multilevel parking lot (I thought that wasn\u2019t the smartest) move, one of the other runners in the van finally told him to just stop, since she recognized from an earlier year that we were very close, and we just walked the rest of the way. That was not what you need before a marathon, knowing there will be endless crowds and you really want to get to the starting line in time. We were also booked for the return trip, but since we now couldn\u2019t be sure where exactly the pick-up point was \u2013 same as the proper drop-out, but we\u2019d never seen that \u2013 we opted to take a taxi back. In conclusion, as a hotel, I can recommend the place.

We drove down from the Bay Area the night before, and just needed a convenient place to stay for one night. Check In and Front Desk: Check in was handled promptly and extremely courteously. Its possible that I've never met a friendlier front desk clerk. We had booked a room with 1 king bed, not thinking that we'd need two, since it was us and our kids. When we realized this in our first room, I called down to the desk, and within 10 minutes, a hotel employee arrived with a key to our new room, with two double beds. There was a nominal price increase for the room, which didn't bother me a bit. Lobby: The lobby was a little dated looking, other than that, fairly unremarkable. Room: The room was clean. It was a fairly small room, however. If you are taking a cruise, many rooms will have views of the ships. Be sure to ask and they might be able to get a good room for you. It was really fun for the kids (and me) to watch the Disney Wonder docking a few hours before we boarded. Other rooms will have a view of the ship as it approaches. Restaurant: After reading several negative reviews of the restaurant, we swore we wouldn't eat there. However, by the time we got to San Pedro, we were tired and hungry, and couldn't find a place to park near some of the higher rated restaurants. We didn't feel like hunting around anymore, and it was also fairly cold and windy out, so we ruled out parking at the hotel and walking. So, we made the decision to eat in the hotel. The restaurant was fine. I might have been disappointed if I had actually gone out of my way to seek that restaurant out, but considering we could just ride down in the elevator, eat and ride back up to our room, it served its purpose just fine. The food was a little overpriced, and fairly plain, but the service really shined. Our server was really friendly, and when my daughter complained about having parmesan cheese on her spaghetti (before we had a chance to tell her to just deal with it) he insisted on taking it back and bringing a fresh one. Honestly, the great service made up for the average food. We also had breakfast on the morning we left. It was a fairly expensive breakfast buffet, but the food was all good. The omelette server was really friendly. It inspired another guest to remark \"best omelette I've had all week!\" I certainly was in agreement. Location: The location is the primary reason we chose the hotel. It was about 5 minutes or less to the World Cruise Center, where the Disney Cruise departed from. The hotel does run a shuttle to the cruise center, but we had our car, and had planned on parking at the Cruise Center itself. The hotel is located on one of the main streets in San Pedro near some shops and restaurants. It was really quiet, but there were some slightly odd people walking around the neighborhood, which was another reason we decided to just stay in for dinner. Parking: The hotel offers complimentary self parking, which we used. The underground lot is really old and involves some touchy navigation if you drive a mega SUV like me. Actually, there were barely any spaces left when we arrived. They do offer valet parking as well. I had considered a \"stay and park\" package, but calculated it would cost around $30 less to just park at the World Cruise Center. I didn't anticipate eating breakfast at the hotel, and I think the package included breakfast. So, when we got breakfast, I think we ended up even with the stay and park package. On the other hand, if you do that, you'd need a shuttle back to the hotel, which would just increase the time and number of steps before you are back on the road. Its something to consider, however. Overall, I we had a perfectly good stay at the Crowne Plaza Los Angeles Harbor. The service really stood out, and for me showed how that can make up for other areas where a hotel might be lacking slightly.

The front desk person as well as the bartender could both take lessons in customer service - and how to look as tho' they are happy to see the guests. The 10 floor Priority Club conceirge, Jennifer, was very knowledable of things to do and places to go. She directed us to the 'Red Car' that travels between the bridge and a little beyond the 'ports of call village'. We attended Christmas caroling at a park by the bridge and strolled up and down 6th an d7th Streets. There was a Farmer's Market type of event going on - so it was great fun to wander thru there before settling at Porky's BBQ. This isn't a fancy place - but the food is great and there is a monstrous amount of it. We stayed between the Green Onion and Porky's for our meals for the entire 4 days we were there. The room was very nicely appointed and it has the deepest bathtub I have ever seen. I could actually soak up to my ears in it comfortably. A real nice perk. The previously mentioned mask, scent, and earplugs were also supplied. I was disappointed that our non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor smelled terribly of cigarette smoke which seemed to get stronger the longer we stayed. Since neither of us are allergic and it was otherwise a really nice room with a great view of the Port - we opted to stay in it. The fitness room had quite a selection of equipment for use but neither of the bikes had functioning electronics and the treadmill was a bit tempermental.

The front desk staff was professional and responded quickly and appropriately; it really was a pleasant stay. The negatives aren't enough to detract from the whole. We did find the room to be a little on the shabby side; we were on the sixth floor, looking out over the harbor. The windows were filthy -- I mean, really filthy. I understand it's hard to keep windows clean, but this was kind of beyond that. The room itself was comfortable, with a large seating area, comfy bed, but there were spots on the carpet in places and things (e.g. furniture) were starting to show age. Which is fine. What's not fine was the large spider web going from the lamp to the ceiling -- I told the front desk about it and they were mortified, so appropriate action was taken. I was also glad their \"wake up kit\" came with ear plugs 'cause it was the loudest room a/c I've ever heard. We did have the buffet breakfast, which was nothing special and not great food, but ok for a quick bite to get you going. The pool area is really in need of a rehab - very bland and boring and nothing at all special. But clean, so it's ok. There's no shade at all, though. And while they advertise a business center and have signs pointing to it, we could never find it --- and we looked and asked. Very strange. What really got us was the parking . . . it's underground, underneath the hotel and we felt very comfortable and safe leaving the car there for a week.

Taking everything into account, as a one night pre cruise hotel, the Crowne Plaza is a good choice and when we cruise from LA in the future we will stay here again but on room only just in case the breakfast choice hasn't improved!", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delray Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent pre-cruise hotel with free cruise shuttle\u201d", "Author": "TrvlGrl12", "ReviewID": "UR23364597", "Content": "We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in San Pedro for one night pre-cruise. The Crowne Plaza is about a 20-25 minute ride from the Long Beach airport, but the hotel doesn\u2019t offer an airport shuttle. However, we had reserved space on-line in advance for the four of us with Prime Time Shuttle service for $42 total. The shuttle was ready and waiting when we arrived! The Crowne Plaza itself is a very popular pre-cruise hotel. Though we arrived to the hotel at 11 a.m., and check-in was not until 3 p.m., our two rooms were ready for us. The concierge was the highlight of our stay, welcoming us warmly upon arrival and promptly giving me his business card and offering up his area recommendations (which I did use). After unpacking and quickly settling in, the concierge arranged a driver for us who would first take us to In-N-Out Burger, wait while we nibbled, take us to the Queen Mary back in Long Beach, then pick us up at the end of the day and drive us back to the Crowne Plaza in San Pedro. He promptly offered a driver who would do all of this for $65 total. What a bargain! With tip, we ended up paying $80 (or $20 per person) for this service. The Queen Mary tour is something I highly recommend for anyone interested in ghost stories or the paranormal. While the ship itself really has not been well-maintained, i.e. stained carpets, mildew smell in certain areas, paint chipped from walls, scrapes and marks on walls, and a basic look of a once-beautiful ship just kept for tours, it does offer a fun and engaging look at the ghosts and legends that make up her history. We opted for the \u201cHaunted Encounters Passport\u201d which entitled us to the self-guided tour (beware that if you are not good with directions, your feet will become weary from losing your way in the bowels of the ship), the \u201cGhosts and Legends\u201d tour and the \u201cHaunted Encounters\u201d tour for a cost of $27.95 per person. The fee was well worth the tours of areas not open to the public for general browsing, as we were exposed to a doorway where a crew member had been crushed and has been known to still visit the space, the boiler room where a young girl\u2019s spirit visits on occasion, and various cabins where passengers had died \u2013 and have \u201ccome back to life\u201d \u2013 over the course of Queen Mary\u2019s life on the seas. Dedicate 3-4 hours to ensure you have time to join in the guided tours as they do fill up fast! Once back to the Crowne Plaza, we asked the concierge for a good recommendation for dinner. He made no hesitation in recommending Raffaello\u2019s Ristorante in San Pedro. The valet drove us in a complimentary hotel van to dinner, where we were promptly seated simply by mentioning the name of our concierge (though we had no reservations and the place was packed!). The Italian food was very, very good with the mozzarella sticks being the table favorite! They really weren\u2019t \u201csticks\u201d per se \u2013 they were really more like flattened pieces of cheese that had been lightly breaded and baked, and swimming in a very good marinara sauce. None of us finished our huge meals, probably because the chef sent us a couple of appetizers \u201con the house\u201d. After the meal, we ventured back to the Crowne Plaza, only a 4 block walk. The morning of disembarkation, we leisurely made our way to the lobby where we caught the Crowne Plaza\u2019s free cruise shuttle just before noon (the shuttle actually begins at 10:30 a.m.) and arrived to the port by 12:05 p.m. As easy as pie.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeville, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice pre-cruise hotel!\u201d", "Author": "gargoyle999", "ReviewID": "UR22840115", "Content": "Stayed here on Thanksgiving and the day after prior to a Princess cruise.

The food offered was more tailored to those that are familiar with Middle Eastern dishes. Beef bacon at their breakfast buffet instead of the pork bacon we are used to, was not a very tasty substitute, in our opinion. The restaurant does make a good hamburger, so if you are there for lunch this is recommended. Gnats flying all around the dining room, however, helped ruin our dining experience regardless of the restaurant's food quality.

I won the hotel with a $65 bid on Priceline, which seems to be a standard winning price at this property. I called a week ahead of time to see about requesting a room with two beds as I was traveling with my mother, and was told by the reservations person at the hotel that I had a king room and that if I didn't like it, I'd have to take it up with Priceline. I\"m used to being denied this type of request befroe check-in, but the usual response is that a note will be made on the reservation in case a desired room was available. Not so here, and I felt it was handled a little poorly, but figured I might have better luck upon check-in. We caught an early, direct flight out of Indianapolis to LAX, and with the time change, we actually arrived at 8:30 AM. I had arranged a SuperShuttle to take us to the hotel ($17/pp), and we were dropped off around 10 AM. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and not only gave use a room with two beds, but also let us check in 5 hours early. I appreciated this, and we headed up to our room on the fifth floor. As per usual with a Priceline room, it was located at the end of the hall, but for the savings and the quietness that provides ... who cares? The room itself was very clean, though missing a few things (some of the sleep ammenities promised, a second coffee mug, etc), but we got these from a housekeeper we saw around. I was disappointed though that the wireless internet service was down and that the TV was getting horrible reception. The internet eventually started working ($10/day) and I figured out that I could get a good TV signal if I twisted the cord in back until it came through clearly. We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and it was fine, though the food was nothing great and the service was pretty slow. The pool is a small outside one, along with a hot tub, and the exercise room consists of a treadmill, an elliptical, a few recumbent bikes, and various weight machines. I was slightly perturbed by the fact that there were no cleaning supplies in they gym as they had obviously run out a while ago and simply had not been replaced. We decided to get out of the room and walk around San Pedro. It was a Sunday afternoon and was very quiet. You can tell there is some neighborhood rejuvenation going on because of all of the places being ripped up and turned into apartments and condos. Within a few blocks of the hotel in each direction it seemed like a nice area, and then after that, buildings started deteriorating. There was a grocery/liquor store east of the hotel a block or two, but it looked a little scary to me. There are also a lot of shops and restaurants the opposite direction along the harbor. Later in the day, we headed towards the harbor and ate at a Mexican restaurant called The Green Onion. Prices were decent and the food was very good, though my mom later thought that the food didn't agree with her. The next morning we went to the Pacific Cafe, across the street from the hotel (exiting through the restaurant door). This was a nice little place that was seemingly run by a single lady, and I was able to get a ham/cheese omelet with two slices of sourdough toast for $3.95. The food was quite decent and the price could not be beat ... I'd definitely recommend this place over a chain like Starbucks (which is just down the block on the same side of the street as the hotel). The Crowne Plaza offered a free shuttle to the port starting at 10:30. We went down at about 10:45, climbed aboard, and were the only ones taken over to the ship. This shuttle picks up from the port, and it will also take people to a local mall and supposedly other places within a 5-mile radius. I asked about being taken to an In-N-Out Burger and was told \"maybe later\" that really seemed to be a \"no\" even though it was 3 miles away.

We seriously looked at the Vagabond up the hill from this place but it had mixed reviews and it only seemed to have one-way transport, and it looked less comfortable and in a so-so location. Vagabond was going to be $130 for one night and parking. Crowne Plaza was $189 for room, 2 drinks, full breakfast, indoor parking, and both way shuttle. The people were the friendliest we have seen at a hotel in a long time. They will either valet your car or you can self park in the garage. The shuttle driver, desk clerk and luggage handlers were all super friendly, considering they do a lot of schlepping of luggage with this many cruisers. I think the majority of their business is cruise related. They are ina better neighborhood in San Pedro, which seems to be getting a makeover. The room was very comfy, and they included a little bottle of lavendar room spray, sleep mask and a cd of soothing music. Nothing fancy but a real nice touch. Decor is new and modern with some nice maritime photos. Clean and fresh linens. We ordered room service at 10pm when we got in and it came real fast and was very good. With 2 kids we have gotten to be real experts on room service, and this was on par with the best we have had before. Breakfast was a full buffet with hot and cold food. You get two adult tickets with the $189 \"park and sail\" package. Apparently the 10th floor is a \"concierge\" floor that has a complimentary snacks and and meals, which is more common on higher-end chains than this one.

They met us in baggage claim and took us straight to the bellman at the hotel. Great service! Initially, we requested a non-smoking king room. When I called the day of check in to confirm, they had me down for a smoking double. I again requested non-smoking king. When we checked in, I asked again. They said they had non-smoking but no kings. Then the clerk offered a handicapped non-smoking king which we were happy to take. Check in was very quick and easy. We used Priceline for our room. The desk clerk wasn't super friendly, but was quick, efficient and friendly enough. We checked in at the bell desk and they recommeded some places to eat nearby and provided a map for us. We ended up at the Green Onion, a Mexican restaurant almost right next door. The food and service were great. It was casual and reasonably priced. Perfect for weary travelers! The decor was a little different - almost like a Bennigan's. They had a bar. Our hotel room had a big chair and a desk. We didn't have a great view. The room was very clean, but a little worn. The shower was a little dark with decent water pressure. The bed was very comfortable. The room temperature was good. They even provided a clip to place on the curtains to keep them closed and keep the room dark. My only complaint about the hotel would be the thin walls. There was a very loud, rude family next door to us making ton of noise at 6am. We could hear almost every word they were saying (more like shouting). But you can't really fault the hotel for the behavior of obnoxious people. We didn't call and complain because we were ready to get up anyway. The next morning we went for a walk up 6th street I think - headed away from the port. We walked for a few blocks. At one of the main intersections, caddy corner to a thift store, we found the funky little San Pedro Deli and Cafe. What a great place to eat breakfast. The menu was varied. The service and the food were awesome. It was a great way to start our vacation. Plus it was a great value for the money. They give you a ton of food. I had 4 slices of french toast, 2 eggs and bacon for $4.99. My husband had an omelette, fried potatoes and buscuits and gravy for $7.59. It was much cheaper that eating at the hotel, and it was nice to experience some local flavor. We also passed several other lunch/dinner restaurants as well as a local coffee shop and a Starbucks. We saw a sign for a liquor store, but it looked like it was closed down. We also saw a wine shop, but it wasn't open yet. I did not see a drug store near the hotel but we didn't ask about one either. The hotel had a gift shop, bar, restaurant, pool and hot tub that we did not use. When we checked in, we asked about the port shuttle and they gave us a paper with the information. They provide service to LA port in San Pedro and to Long Beach for Carnival Cruises. Check out was a breeze - we did express check out over the phone. We carried our own luggage down and were on the first shuttle at 10:30. There were only three of us on the shuttle. The ride was only 5-10 minutes tops. They also provide return shuttle service to the hotel, but we didn't use that service. All in all, it was a great place to stay before our cruise.

We were told to wait in the bar and enjoy a complimentary cocktail. When we walked into the bar, we were greeted by a surly bartended who informed us that the bar was closed. (The bar is supposed to be open until 1am according to the in-room materials.) When we told him that we'd been sent there to wait for our room, he agreed to give us a drink. We ordered 2 martinis, and were again rudely told that we could only have beer and wine. So, we had some wine...served with a big frown. After waiting more than 45 minutes, we inquired about our rooms. The manager seemed totally overwhelmed, but he finally managed to find rooms for us...and one room was even a suite to our surprise.

We were to stay at the hotel from a Thurs night until Mon morning the following week when we were to get on a cruise to get married. On our second day at the hotel, we left the room to go get lunch. As we walked out of the room, the housekeeper was cleaning the room next to ours, so we put our sign on the door to clean our room. We shut the door and I smiled at the housekeeper as we left. When we returned back to our room 3 1/2 hours later, the housekeeper had cleaned the room. However, all of our luggage had been gone through....there were things on the floor from our suitcases that weren't out of the suitcase before we left. Our laptop was stolen and so was a folder that contained all of our documents needed to get married and get on the cruise...to include our birth certificates of mine and my husbands and my 5-yr old daughters. We immediately contacted the manger and filed a report with the hotel and the LA Police Dept. It has now been a week and a half and we still have not been able to track down who took our stuff. The security that works at the hotel has not looked at the security tapes and they refuse to give me the name of the housekeeper who cleaned our room. To make matters worse, the manager of the hotel gave us a bucket of 6 beers and a free dinner at their restaraunt since it was \"the least we can do\". Come to find out, the housekeeper didn't speak English and had just started at the hotel. So, a case of stolen identity? I think so. Horrible customer service at this hotel. They don't take in account the huge impact this will have on our lives with us not knowing whether or not someone is using our names and worse, our social security numbers for their own personal gain.
