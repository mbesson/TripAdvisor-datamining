Going up and down the elevator is worse than the NY subway with pushy Chinese who talk at full volume when using their cell phones and shove you out of their way to go out of the elevator. Make sure to verify the costs before you go there. If you do not mind walking 2 blocks to get a coke or a bottle of water. Taxis were abundant and were very courteous and helpful. Its location was what sold us on the hotel, pretty close to an Mtr station and all of the HK attractions. Everything else was a definite turn off.

We got the 27th floor, 2 twin rooms, each sized enough for 2 adults. Room service was excellent. We were there in early February, temperature ranged from 14degrees to 16degrees. All the basic needs are provided except that the mini fridge doesn't seem to be working although the power is switched on. We bought milk, it didn't last two days even though we hadn't opened it. Our Haagen Dasz ice cream melted overnight. Front desk lady wasn't at her best attitude (she raised her voice & shouted at us) when we enquired twice for our room which was due at 1400hrs instead we had to wait another 45 mins and were impatient when other tourists got their rooms every few minutes after 1400hrs. We arrived at 0900hrs as we took a night flight & we understand the check-in hours is not due till then, but we couldn't even sit at the waiting area with drinks & few packets of snacks. We were told off a few times & the terrible thing is that we weren't making any noises, disturbing others or even littering, not to mention my friends couldn't even close their eyes for a short rest. There wasn't any free shuttle bus as per written in the website inclusive with the schedule. Instead we took mini bus 88F to & fro throughout our stay. Early that morning when we arrived, we made calls to the hotel to enquire about this but the phone was passed around, then finally one short info which is 'take exit A and bus 88F' & got hung up. The hotel has got a shipping port view, which is really wonderful, especially at night. The view was excellent & it is entirely a new experience. The website included beautiful pictures of the sky garden, but when we got up there, it was empty. No water, no chess set, nothing. We did not consume anything from the hotel as we are Muslims. We bought food from the nearest mall & whatever else from home. A must have for free & easy travelers: a) Airport Express bundle card b) Octopus card (Refundable) (Absolutely must have) c) Map of this hotel location & of course HK itself.

Rates are less than half of the immediate airport hotels. * Largest rooms I've seen in Hong Kong, at least compared to the ones in Kowloon and TST. I stayed in a Superior room, at least 25 m2. * Free wi-fi, and the connection was pretty good. * Good open views. It's facing the Tsing Yi bridge and a container port, ok it's not the views from the Intercontinental or the Westin, but you'll pay at least HK$2500 for these views. * A short 5 min. taxi ride from/to the Maritime Square mall (where the Tsing Yi station is located), a large center with everything, including access to everywhere in Hong Kong. The so-so: * I suspect this and the sister hotel (Rambler Garden next door) are used by Chinese tour groups. Frankly though, very few hotels in HK these days aren't(!). If you happen to be checking in/out when they are there, be patient. The staff though is polite and helpful. * Nothing in the immediate vicinity. The Maritime Square mall is only about 1 km to the north, but walking to/from is difficult and not recommended. After all, the taxi fare is about US$3. * There is loading/unloading at the container port going on 24/7! The windows seem to block out most of the noise, but if you are a light sleeper, bring your ear plugs. My rate came with no breakfast. Now the location: 15 min. from the airport. Depending where in downtown you are going, it can take anywhere from 20-40 min. If you're going to Central, it's an easy and cheap MTR ride on the Tung Chung line.

The hotel manager was awesome, she was quite busy tending to a promotional photoshoot but noticed we were waiting for the free shuttle bus to Tsing Yi station.

We booked a superior room but the staff upgraded us to a Deluxe room with no extra charges. The room is clean, nice, with complete amenities, the view from the windows is superb too. The hotel provides free daily shuttle to the MTR station, which is connected to the Tsing Yi shopping mall. There is a mini mart and a Seven-Eleven underground, where we buy our cup noodle for supper every night ---> 'la mien' cup noodle is delicious! If you wanna get mineral water, get them from the mini mart, selling at HKD7 for 2 big bottles, while you get it for HKD10 for only 1 bottle from any other places.

The staff is friendly and helpful enough, there are shops a couple of restaurants and a 7Eleven in the ground floor. THE BAD But not everything is rose colour... There is NO INTERNET IN THE ROOMS!!! If you go for bussines and you need to be connected this is the wrong place to go... skip it, stay away!! The lack of internet in the hotel is the worst part of it, Honestly that's something that if I knew before Ill totally find something else... but they have WIFI in the lobby, the bad part is that you need to sit in front of the reception where there is not even a table for placing your laptop nor a jack to connect it. They have a side lobby (with fancy chairs, tables and jacks) but seriously is a joke... it has a red band with a note saying is only for long term guests, we stayed there for 6 nights and we didn't qualify for the side lobby... So as soon as we sat there, a friendly worker came and said we must leave cause is only for long term guests... Note that the side lobby was completely empty during all our stay. Something else, if you ant to use the facilities you need to pay much more. One example is the over claimed 200mt pool... They say they have it but you need to pay extra for it every day (either in the morning or the afternoon) is not included at all. The same for the clubhouse and the other gardens and things around, also you have to share those facilities with other hotels and the apartments next to it. And besides those things are always empty or closed. There is no restaurant in the hotel, nor a small shop on it. If you want something you need to go to the 7Eleven, that is a good option but you still need to round all the block and get a bit lost to reach it. Overall, the place is good for a reasonable price.

The down side ws that when we went to use the pool we were expected to pay $HK20 per day - that is not mentioned in the advertising. Something else that is not mentioned on their website is that the hotel overlooks one of the busiest container ports in Hong Kong and that the restaurant is in the hotel next door. We were kept awake the first few nights with the noise from the container port but we soon got used to it. What we did not get used to was the rudeness of the restaurant staffe - especially the maitre de and after a few days we decided to eat elsewhere - the service was poor, the staff rude - I do not think that having to wait 45 minutes for a menu is very good - and then another 45 minutes waiting to place our order before deciding to go eat elsewhere! The prices were very expensive also. The good thing was that there is an underground shopping mall just along the road and we ate breakfast in the Coral fast food restaurant, which was much cheaper, better cooked and the staff were friendly!!! The other drawback to this hotel is the distance from the main Hong Kong attracions - it is out in the New Territories and as my wife was by this time frail we had to rely on taxis to go anywhere, but that is a minor concern. The one thing I will say is that if you are brought up to respect people then do not expect it in Hong Kong where they seem to have no manners at all.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cI think this hotel it wasn't too bad\u201d", "Author": "travel_da", "ReviewID": "UR51519615", "Content": "Hi everyone, I was staying in Rambler Oasis Hotel from end of nov to mid of dec. the price was pretty cheap compare to other hotel in hk.

I was living in 29 floors, wasn't too noisy at all. I agree with others, this hotel is full of mainland people. if you're taking the elevator from 8am-10am or 8pm-10pm its take you forever to get in. serious for this price I think you cannot found another hotel. overall it wasn't that bad.

(HK$ 900.00 plus 10% services charge per room per night(room only). This hotel is not close to MTR (subway) station, need to take a 5 minute mini-bus. This hotel is mainly cater to mainland Chinese tourists to Hong Kong. Room price is very competitive. And room reservation can be made directly to the hotel at good rates. There are quite a few less desirable points: 1. Location: you need to take the MTR to either Kwai Fong or Tsing Yi station and take the green mini bus #88G or #88F to the hotel. These mini bus are basically for commuters and typical tourists with typical luggage (say 26\u201d like I was carrying) will be very difficult. You need to take the taxi from the Kwai Fong MTR station to the hotel. We toke 3 taxis for 10 people, and was charged 45, 55, and 75 for the same exact identical trip \u2013 that said about Hong Kong Taxi drivers rip off (constant loud claim of never making enough). Shuttle from the airport is available at $110 a trip. But the actual distances is not far. Lugging heavy luggage in the MTR station steps are not much fun. 2. Small room, but comparable in typical Hong Kong hotel standard. Like living in campus. No electrical outlet in bathroom. 2 T-shape sockets left in the 6 slot power strip in closet. 3. In the hotel info sheet, there is no food available. But, at the other side of other hotel building, in this small Tsing Yi island, there is a restaurant, and entire shopping mall, with fast food court and Parkson super market. 4. Hardly any surface for luggage in the room. No drawers, of course. One bottle of water, even, we stay for quite a few days. 5. Only 2 light switches in the room. One for bathroom. One for bedroom. Any truing on the light will certainly wake up every one in the room. Bathroom frosted glass partitions awake sleepers in the bedroom. 6. Good and strong Air conditioning. But hard to control reasonable comfort to sleep. 7. Large 300m swimming pool. But the water is cool and too much Chlorine, burn my eyes.

At first I had my apprehensions regarding the location but it worked well for us. Just a short travel time after our flight in (good thing I printed the map provided at the hotel's site so it was easy for the cab drivers to know where we wanted to go) & we need not rush back for our flight out. We didn't mind taking the cab whenever we got out of the hotel because there were four of us traveling, so a HK$20 cab fare (HK$5 each) to Tsing Yi station was not a big deal. The staff at this hotel (Rambler Oasis) were very nice, helpful, & accommodating. The rooms were nice & kept clean everyday, although just a heads up on the size of the rooms, they were more of an Asian standards rather than American. I love the way they put a dispenser of shampoo, conditioner, & body wash all in one, at least I wouldn't waste time squeezing these things out of tiny bottles. I wouldn't have to limit myself using it! I read a lot about not being able to sleep at all because of the noise outside, but honestly speaking I didn't hear a thing. If there \"were\" some noise, it seemed they were very distant & didn't bother us at all. I liked the fact that at the end of a tiring day, we were coming back at a peaceful neighborhood, distant from all the \"chaos\" of HK. Also I love the pool! I thought it was free for anyone staying at the hotel but I learned that the pool was like a clubhouse also for the residents around the hotel so we had to pay HK$20 each which was ok. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a 7/11, a supermarket, & a Cafe de Coral (a restaurant which was cheap, delicious, fast with huge servings) nearby (below Rambler Plaza) among other things. Overall we had a pleasant stay & we enjoyed every minute of it. I would definitely come back & stay at this hotel the next time I'm in Hong Kong.

First impression - this is simple student hostel...I have changed my first room due to it was simply dusty and smell sigarets. Second one was cleaner. Both rooms was very small - around 12 sq m.

You'll spend for taxi a lot - so think in advance... May be to stay in HGK will be cheaper?:) And the last but actually very important - they have no restaurant. And no any closer than 20 minutes walk. My recomendation - for backpackers who know how to use a bus and metro. Also for groups of people - not for individuals. too boring place... Why I was quite satisfied? I have paid for this 45USD only... So it was quite close to my estimations^) Good luck!
