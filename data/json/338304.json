Nice complimentary toiletries. we chose not to pay 25 euros for breakfast, opting instead for a good meal nearby for five euros. The hotel has many good restaurants and bars nearby. We particularly liked Santa Ana plaza. Checkout was noon which was helpful and you can pay for additional hours. Bags can be left free of charge at reception too.

The rooms can be wildly different, although all stylishly decorated and fitted with nice bathrooms, some of which are shower rooms only. Some of the rooms can be a bit small and oddly shaped so it is worth checking out alternatives if you are not happy, the advantage is that there is quite a variety of rooms and the hotel really does have character, it is not a block of homogenised rooms. We had adjoining rooms on our last stay so our 9 year old daughter could be next door to us, both rooms were on the inside part of the hotel and quite dark but this can be an advantage in the extreme heat of Madrid. There is a small gym on the 8th floor which is worth a visit to look at the views. Some rooms on the higher floors have small balconies but we have not stayed in one so cannot comment on whether it is worth asking for one of these or whether they cost extra. The location is in a nice area directly opposite the Prado, not absolutely central but not much of a walk from the main Plazas and the walk is very nice. The public areas are very nice with a good breakfast served in a pleasant room in the basement. The hotel bar/restaurant serves good, modern tapas and is used by many locals as well as hotel residents. For the price, this is much better than the usual corporate style hotels and we will definitely stay again.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helena, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "pbruns22", "ReviewID": "UR139534776", "Content": "We visited Madrid in June 2012, and we were there for 3 days on business. Our room had an espresso machine with a full supply of individual servings - we loved it so much we bought one when we returned home. I contacted the hotel 6 months later to get the exact brand of machine (christmas surprise for my husband) and they promptly sent me all of the information. Our room had an amazing view of the Plaza, large windows that opened to the street. In the morning we watched the crowds from the window seat and listened to the street musicians playing accordians below. You could see the glorious Ministry building lit up at night. The location was a walking distance for my husband to work, and the art museums are within a block of the hotel. We only stayed for 3 days, but we are headed back in 3 weeks to stay 7 nights. I can only hope we are so lucky to have another wonderful experience. Is it quiet - maybe not - but who cares? It is the bustle of a city completely alive and amazingly beautiful. We slept with the windows open. The staff was also very nice, even when my hair straightener knocked out the power in the room, we didn't know how to turn on the lights, and they didn't make fun of my failed attempts to speak Spanish.

It\u2019s right across from the Prado Museum, next to the Westin, and across from the Ritz. When you walk out the front door of the hotel to the right to walk to the Prado, you pass some kiosks in the park and little stores along the street where you can buy souvenirs, if you want. If you walk to the left when you exit the hotel, there is a Starbucks right on the corner. There are also a taxi stand and bus stops just to the left of the hotel, as you exit. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum is also to the left and across the street. The hotel is right across from the Neptune fountain; and we paid a little extra to guarantee a nice view of the fountains\u2014it was worth it. Of course, there was some traffic at the circle, but the double paned windows kept out the noise, and there was much less traffic here than on the Gran Via. -- We arrived at the NH Paseo del Prado from the airport by cab (about 40 euros with tip from Terminal 4) and got right in to our room (about noon). We had 2 twin beds (as requested) in a smallish room (as usual in a big city). There was a desk, chair, mini bar/fridge, flat screen TV, lamps on both sides of the bed, small window seat so it was easy to look out at the beautiful view, lots of hangers with regular hooks, and a coffee maker. This was the only room we encountered on this vacation with a coffee maker. It saved us a lot of time and money, since we bought pastries at a bakery on San Jeronimo (south of Calle de Cedaceros) in the afternoon and had breakfast easily and enjoyably in the room. Breakfast was available at the hotel for 19 euros (if you booked it in advance) or 25 euros (without advanced reservations). We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. There were heavy terry cloth bathrobes to wear and slippers to keep. The bathroom had a great shower (no tub), lighted make-up mirror, tissues, hair dryer, and toiletries. -- The Prado Museum is open every evening and is free from 6:00 PM-8:00 PM. We noticed that at 5:45 there was a long line to get in, but if you went later, about 6:30 or 7:15, there was no line. You have to get a ticket from the ticket window before you can enter the museum, even when all you need is a free ticket. It was good just staying for a little while and enjoying a few painting. Also, in the morning, we got to the museum about 10:45 AM and found no line at the ticket window. We needed all day plus two evening short visits to see the museum since we like to see everything. There is a nice cafeteria for lunch in the museum. If you are 65 or over, the reduced price for the Prado is 6 euros (vs 12), so bring passport or other ID if you qualify. -- Walked up San Jeronimo (out the door to the left, then second street to the left) toward Puerta del Sol to find lots of little restaurants off that street. Restaurant employees stand at corners giving out menu offers for the restaurants. We went to La Caserola, Calle Echegaray, 3, twice. A three course meal (appetizer, main course, dessert) including bread and wine/beer was 9 euros. This seemed to be the price at a lot of the restaurants we saw. For appetizer we had gazpacho or paella mixta. For main course we had trout, sole, chicken, or lamb. For dessert we had flan. There were other choices, too. All really good. Quiet. Good service. A simple restaurant. -- Went to Royal Palace one day. It is quite a hike from the hotel, through Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor, but an interesting walk. When we arrived about 10:30, there was quite a line to get in, with everyone standing in the sun. But there was no line if you entered the door to the left of the line and paid the extra 6 euros (for a total of 16 euros) to see the special exhibit of books from the Royal Library in addition to the Royal Palace. So that is what we did. It was soooo worth it. We walked right in to the Royal Palace and also got to see a wonderful exhibit of books, something I\u2019d never thought about viewing, in a beautiful setting. -- The hotel is very near Atoche train station. About 3,10 euros plus tip in a cab. -- The front desk was always helpful with maps and suggestions. There was free wifi in the public areas. -- I would definitely stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to my friends and family.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cImpressive location, average hotel\u201d", "Author": "Walker14", "ReviewID": "UR135487673", "Content": "2 nights at this hotel and you can get inspired by the museums, monuments, restaurants, and even demonstrations by Spaniards due to the austerity government measurements.

Just walk 5 min in Paseo del Prado and you get to the hotel in Plaza Plaza de C\u00e1novas del Castillo (or Neptune Plaza). But despite being close to this places, it's not in the middle of Gran Via with all the shops. Nevertheless, you can easily walk to Gran Via, Puerta Del Sol and Plaza Mayor, I had no problem with that. The room was comfortable but small. Bathorooms are clean, good size, but kind of dark with all that green marble on the walls and floor. Very nice beds. I asked for a quiet room and I got one facing the internal part of the building, so I can't say much about the noise in the street. I didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but I sthink I should have because there was nothing good in the near the hotel... the only complain I have is that they offered free wifi only in the lobby...if you want internet in the room, you have to pay for it. Be aware of the pickpockets in the nearest Starbucks...My friend had his iphone stollen in the very first day of our trip. Two good tips for Madrid: we took the hop-in hop-off bus for 20 Euros. It's ok, but I had seen everything on foot the day before. Nevertheless, you can use the same ticket to get the last bus of the day and see Madrid at night. This was very nice!

I didn't do any research which is atypical but hadn't really planned on staying here. I shared a cab with other American tourists (31.5 euro) from the airport and went with them to Westin Palace to see if a room would be available. Only room available was for 300 euro ($430) but they recommended NH Paseo Del Prado which is about 100 years away. For us Americans, the easiest comparison is to a Kimpton hotel in the US, NH is a small botique chain, nicely appointed and stylish. Like many European hotels a tiny elevator (two) and only free WiFi in the lobby, which in this case was OK. I stayed on the 7th floor (704) away from the main street which is quiet but you can still hear sirens if police or fire trucks, but I suppose you would hear those anywhere. Price was 92 euro ($121). The room had two single beds, a desk, nice wooden closets with a safe inside. It's a bigger room because I saw some of the other rooms when the maids were cleaning. The bathroom is good sized with an all marble floor to ceiling tiles and nice fixtures. Free coffee in the morning in the lobby from a Nespresso machine which is nice because I have one at home. The hotel is walking distance (across the traffic circle) from many of the main museums and has access to probably at least 30-40 tapas bars within 400 yards. I think I sampled at least four in the afternoon. Service is excellent, everyone at the desk speaks English well. There is a gym but I didn't check it out. Also has an attached tapas bar but it seems pricier than the more authentic hole in the wall tapas bars in the area.

The room had a large framed mirror leaning on the wall as a design accent. The mirror had a hairline crack or two near the bottom. I called Isabelle at the front desk to let her know that there was a crack in the mirror, but the room would be fine and would she please note that the mirror was cracked. She agreed. I later asked for a clock. She told me that they were in the minibar. It took her awhile to understand that I wanted a clock, not a coke. The hotel does not provide clocks in the room! But they do have cokes. So, when I check out , there it is - a 300 euro charge for the mirror (as handed to me by Isabelle). I told her that we spoke about the mirror and she said that she told the manager and he had her charge me. The manager, nor anyone else at the hotel had brought up the mirror over my stay. I asked to speak with a manager and there was no manager on duty. At 11:30 AM ! THE GOOD: Location. The bathrooms. THE BAD: No clocks. The Front Desk Staff.

We (family of 4) spent 3 days and nights in Madrid in early August (temperatures were very hot) and one of them was at the Gran Canarias, although we originally booked the entire stay at the hotel. Let me start with the positives first before I am accused of bashing the hotel. You can't beat the location. It is very close to the sites and in a safe area surrounded by good restaurants. The rooms are good size and the bath rooms are fairly large. In addition, we had a good rate which included breakfast which was pretty good. Now the negatives. We are a family of 4, with 2 teenagers, so we booked two rooms. - Bathroom Shower: The shower has some type of wood meshing on the floor which looks good, however, there is a musty smell coming from it. It almost smells like a gymnasium shower. - Uncomfortably Hot Hotel: We checked in with no problems and were given 2 adjacent rooms. Both rooms were extremely hot, about 26C, but we knew that to be the case since the AC is not activated until the room key is inserted into the switch slot. Well, we turned the AC on full blast and waited about an hour and the temperature did not budge. We called reception and they sent the maintenance man to make sure we were operating the temp control correctly. He was a nice enough man but he did not speak English. Fortunately, my wife is fluent in Spanish. He told us that we were operating the AC temp control correctly but we had to turn off the lights and close the bathroom door to allow the room to cool down. We were suspect of the advice, but we did that in both rooms, and 2 hours later the temp had increase to about 27C. I went down to reception and complained. They switched my wife and I to another room. My kids did not want to switch rooms so they just sweated it out. It turns out that our new room was just as hot (27C) after 2 hours of full AC. At this point, we were wondering whether or not the hotel had a larger problem since 3 rooms had AC problems and the hallways and lobby were very warm. We approached reception again and they told us that the maintenance man had left and we would just have to deal with it. Reception also made it clear that no other guests had complained and made it seem like we were the problem. So we stayed in the room that night and it was an awful night with room temperatures exceeding 26C. It wasn't until 2 or 3A, when outside temperatures cooled a bit, that we opened the window and we were finally able to get some sleep because room temp dropped to 22C. The next morning, we did a little test and closed the window to see what would happen to the room temperature, and yes, it did increase by 1.5C. So, here we go with reception, again. The maintenance guy showed up around 10A and worked on the problem while we were at the Prado. When we came back reception had told us that they could not fix the problem and that we had to change rooms again. We told then that we would change rooms, but the rooms would be at a new hotel. They said they were sorry and proceeded to check us out the hotel. I thought that they would somehow try to incentivize us to stay, but they didn't. Anyhow, to end this rambling story, we went around the corner to a nicer hotel, but paid an additional 5 euros/nt (and breakfast not included). It was well worth it since the rooms had functioning AC. Maybe this hotel had an overall problem with the AC, or maybe having 3 rooms that had AC problems, was purely coincidental. Either way, it was our experience and I would not recommend this hotel, especially in the summer. If you can get a comparable rate at the hotel around the corner, I would definitely consider it.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague - Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and value for money\u201d", "Author": "tulipano64", "ReviewID": "UR8231968", "Content": "We just came back from a long week end in Madrid and stayed in this hotel.

We actually watched the line for both museums from our room to judge when they were shorter. The rooms have great showers and the bathrooms are green marble (lots of green marble). We had two beds and they were great. The rooms have Bang & Olufsen TVs and phones. The area around the hotel is loaded with places to eat dinner and go \"tapas hopping\". We could have spent our entire 8 days within a four-block radius of the hotel. It is also an easy walk to the train station and we took day trips to Toledo and El Escorial from the train station.

With that said here a few quirks (particularly for American travelers): -To work the lights you must put your key card in a slot by the door.

No further apology was given-and the manager wasn't available to speak to. My sympathy goes to the poor reception staff who have to lie to customers. On a positive, its a nice hotel in a brilliant location.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cVery small double room!\u201d", "Author": "chufa", "ReviewID": "UR6540909", "Content": "We didn't stay in this hotel but went there to have a look of their rooms and facilities.

The room we were given initially was a little on the dark side and without much of a view. When I asked the desk clerk for a room with a view on the plaza, we got it immediately and without any problem. This room (402) was much lighter than the interior room and it was not noisy at all. Amazing if you saw how busy the plaza was.. Having seen the two types of rooms, my impression is that the rooms are all of the same high standard. Most of the other reviewers have already described the rooms, so I refer you to them. Suffice it to add that we did have internet acces... The room was very clean and of a very high standard. We could have done with a little bit more lighting, but that is probably a question of taste. The breakfast (included in our deal with hotelclub) was excellent. There is an enormous variety and if you order somtething special, they will bring it to you as well. You realize even more the excellency of the location of this hotel when it is pouring with rain, as it did for most of our stay! Having the Thyssen Bornemisza opposite of the hotel and the Prado not much further down the road is an incredible bonus when Madrid is almost flooding... (which probably happens rarely, but we have experienced it first hand)", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, good value, great location\u201d", "Author": "adanacsim", "ReviewID": "UR5966055", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. It is located in a safe and fashionable part of Madrid (next to the Westin Palace and across the street from the Ritz), perfect for museum-goers. The rooms were variable in size but in general large by European standards, clean, modern and well-appointed. Because we asked for a quiet room, we were shown to one facing an interior shaft. It was very large and certainly quiet. However, we opted for a room (616) overlooking the plaza. it was also large but much brighter. Despite a warning by the desk clerk that it would be noisy, we found it to be well insulated from traffic noise by the double-paned windows. The hotel was very clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was more than adequate (we had a walk-in shower rather than a bath, but that served out purposes). Only two quibbles: (1) there is no concierge and although the desk clerks were very pleasant, they didn't always have information at hand that tourists often seek; and (2) although the rooms were advertised to have Internet access, it was only available in the lounge and bar areas (where the wi-fi system worked very well and where there were plenty of outlets for the computers). All in all, an excellent value and an impressive hotel. We recommend it highly.", "Date": "October 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga", "Title": "\u201cgreat location and hotel\u201d", "Author": "quito", "ReviewID": "UR5959192", "Content": "This hotel is well situated in a safe,classy part of the city across from the Prado right at Neptune Circle.
