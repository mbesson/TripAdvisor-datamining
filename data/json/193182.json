This is the place, and I would come back again and again. I hate being forced to eat Rice Krispies and that silly salami and cheeses all these places have. Give me eggs, bacon, suasage, etc. As for the roooms ... they are what they are, small, etc. But I go to London to tour, not sit in a hotel room. This place is within easy walking distance from Paddington Station, which is 15 minutes from Heahtrow by train. There are many restaurants all over the place, including a fabulous Italian joint ... Taormina at 19 Craven Terrace. Hyde Park two blocks away, two tube stations within five minutes. No, you don't honeymoon here, and I have peace and quiet because I go at the end of March, not during the tourist season. If you want luxury, pay for it. If you want value because you want to spend your money on trains, exhibits, food, etc. this is a good bargain.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNo 5 star but totally acceptable\u201d", "Author": "chisistas", "ReviewID": "UR13431907", "Content": "We stayed here several years back, but reading the reviews I just wanted to state our experience. The hotel was small, but clean. Our room had two single beds and a desk, with not much room for anything else-but as we were there to see London and not the hotel room, that was okay. The breakfast was decent and service was good, bathroom clean, and location great (we were able to walk to everything \"touristy\" including the Palace, Piccidilly, shopping, even the eye, portobello-but we're walkers). There's also a great restaurant right across the street-greek if I can recall. All in all-if you're looking for an inexpensive and centrally located hotel you're not going to spend a lot of time in-this is fantastic.

The hotel has some ok reviews from other travelers, was affordable and in a great area... BUT... please do not be tempted by these things to stay here. The reception area was small as I expected, but clean, so my first impression was ok. We checked in and were able to check in early, so I thought we had made a good choice... but then we went up to the room... It was extremely small and reminded me of a hospital room for some reason. We went to take a nap and noticed that we were missing one half of our window curtains. We went downstairs to ask them what could be done about this and they sent up the \"housekeepers\" in their stilleto boots who then climbed on one of our beds to replace one half of the curtain with another half that didnt match the first half. Basically, in the basement is a hostel and even the hotel guests are treated just like hostel guests. The customer service was minimal and borderline rude, getting extra towels was like pulling teeth, the shower hardly worked and when it did would be scalding hot or freezing cold, but no where in between. So, dont say you havent been warned - i know this hotel is a good deal, but you might as well stay at a hostel for less money...", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "Isabel_2", "ReviewID": "UR4159375", "Content": "Before this trip I had stayed at 3 other London budget hotels and didn't like any of them, so I know how hard it is to find a good value in London - But Craven Gardens is one.

The hotel's location is fabulous, just a block from Kensington Gardens, two minute walk to a bus stop, 5 minutes to two tube stations and to lots of cheap eats on Queensway. The building and lobby are clean and nicely decorated, there's a lift. The breakfast (included in the price) was great - eggs, toast, bacon, juice, coffee. The room itself was small (but no smaller than any other room I've stayed in in London). There was just a double bed and essentially no other furniture (or room for any).

Now to be fair, this location is superbly close to Hyde Park and two very convenient tube stations (Queensway and Bayswater.) The shower was wonderful. And for 50 pence you can logon to a computer very conveniently located in the lounge area for 15 minutes. It's great for e-mailing home if you have a web account.

The bathroom had obviously been recently re-modeled and the room itself was basically clean (the bedspreads could've gotten a bit closer to the washing machine). I would recommend this hotel if you're only going to stay 2 to 3 days. We were there for 6 days.... and would have prefered someplace nicer. It's definitely BUDGET. And with the dollar at such a low value these days... that's a strong plus. If you're looking for Okay.. and just a place to crash at the end of the day - this might be the place.
