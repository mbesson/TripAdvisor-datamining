Having read the reviews and done our homework, we knew that Hotel Regno was going to be a good basic, traditional Rome hotel without any frills, very centrally located. So our expectations about the hotel were realistic from the outset and consequently my review is based on how much (little) we paid for our accommodation. Previous comments about how well this hotel is located and very convenient for walking to most of the major sites were correct, as were the comments about the street noise late at night if your rooms overlook the main or side streets. But, hey ho, at the price of the rooms, which in fact turned out to be small doubles and not singles, who is complaining about street noise. Also, we two ladies feel quite safe walking around the local streets and piazzas at night because of the buzz all around. But we did hold on tight to our handbags, just in case\u2026... and we needed our comfortable shoes because of all the old cobblestones in the centro storico Breakfast was a more than adequate, basic Italian continental breakfast, although you could pay a few euros extra for boiled or scambled eggs. Their black Americano coffee was the best hotel coffee I have ever tasted. And it was nice that they supplied you each with a pot each from which you could get about 3 cups. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean and neat and quite characterful. I only had a very small shower in my small bathroom. My friend\u2019s room was larger and her bathroom had a bath and overhead shower. The maids made up the rooms daily whilst we were at breakfast which was very efficient. There was plenty of wardrobe space and hangers. We were very fortunate to have wonderful weather for the 5 days we were there and so this made walking to the sites, even to St Peter\u2019s at about 35 minutes away, very enjoyable. A stop on the way back in the beautiful Piazza Navona for a beer, yes is expensive, but you get a little bowl of crisps and a few mini sandwiches included. It is lovely just to sit back and people watch. We booked transfers with Rome Cabs to/from the airport before we left home over the internet. We did not have to leave credit card details or pay a deposit in advance. At 50 euros per transfer, you pay about 10 euros extra than for a basic white fiat taxi cab from the airport to the hotel. But you get helpful details emailed to you like a youtube link which shows where to meet your Rome Cab driver at the airport, what to do if your flight is delayed and a big comfy, air conditioned limousine Mercedes, a lovely way to start and finish your Roman holiday. There was one thing at Hotel Regno that slightly marred our stay. After breakfast on our last day, I left in my room a 10 euro note tip for the maid and a wrapped gift that I was taking with me, whilst I went downstairs to pay the mini bar and tax bills and to leave my case. I returned to my room less than 10 minutes later to find the money and gift missing, but almost immediately a strange man, who I had never seen before, knocked at the door and thrust the gift back at me, but not the 10 euros. I was somewhat taken aback. I know I should have complained at reception but I let it go. It was unsettling as this man (who was not the guy who helps take the luggage to rooms or any others whom I had seen working there during my stay) must have been watching out for me to leave my room. He must have had an entry card and made a grab for anything left out for the maids before they did the room. He obvious was not expecting me to return to my room, even though at the time my elderly friend was still in hers next to mine. So make sure you lock up your cases and do not leave anything lying around in your room that could be pinched whilst you are out of it at any time. I wonder if he makes a habit of this?", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!\u201d", "Author": "Jane S", "ReviewID": "UR127443038", "Content": "The location is great!

Pretty average breakfast as well. Would not like to have the room that opens directly into the breakfast room either. Hotel has a bar but no barman so it's not open, shame.

To the right of the amazing building in front of you, up and around is the Capitoline Museum..highly recommend..be sure to find the underground view of the forum..spectacular and if you can find the elevator to the restaurant, the terrace offers a fantastic skyline view of Rome. Directly across from the Regno the pedestrian walkway with vendors is a short walk to the Trevi. To your right and across the street is a tourist info booth. You can purchase bus tickets there or at any newspaper stand. They can provide bus info and bus stops are on both sides. Turn left out of the Regno to the first pedestrian walk through on your left and if you follow the signs you will come to a the spectacular panthenon and the Tazza d'Oro coffee shop and piazzas full of candlelit, tented restaurants. The Vatican is a longer walk but you can google a walking map to see interesting sites along the way including the Spanish steps. We were told that long lineups are early in the day as the cruise ship tours and other group tours are in the morning. The Regno offered free morning continental breakfasts with great coffee and internet is 5E for an hour. Wifi is free but you have to get their code each day and sit by the front desk. We were expecting a very small room but we had plenty of room and a lovely marble and spacious bathroom, maybe because we had emailed ahead for two double beds. If you book the Eurorail several days in advance you can get a great deal and the station is easy to get around. We went to Florence for day to see the statue of David and there is beautiful architecture, bridges and leather coats and shoes, scarfs and other things are readily available at all the street lined vendor booths. For us four hours would have been sufficient in Florence and we found from 9 in the morning until 9 at night long. We would highly recommend the cooking class Andrea Consoli, Executive Chef, Cooking Classes in Rome, www.cookingclassesinrome.com. It was a great end to our trip and as much as the March rain was not a deterrent for us, it was a rainy day. Andrea was funny and interesting and his dishes were emailed to us after as they were practical, delicious and easy to make.

Thanks to Trip Advisor, we learned that if we stayed at the Hotel Regno, we could have a chance of having a comfortable, convenient, and not unaffordable trip to Roma. The actual experience proved our hopes as well. Regno's service was accomodating and available. They were able to point us in the right direction and made thoughtful and rewarding recommendations on restaurants, transport, and attractions. (I am especially grateful they pointed us to the Roma Pass, which made the city affordable, helped us escape all lines, and got us on public transport.) The rooms, converted from apartments and still decorated with sleek mahogany wood and a delightful pied a terre, were large enough that we didn't feel like sardines, The bathroom was large enough too. The location is right on Via del Corso, on a major tourist artery, but we were able to turn this to our advantage. We walked to the Trevi fountain ( a favorite of the kids', so we kept returning), as well as Piazza Navona, the National Museum, the Coliseum, Forum, the Jewish Quarter, etc. We took the Metro to the Vatican and had to take a cab to Trastavere. They booked us the cab and we didn't get fleeced on the price. The only eh-eh at Regno is the breakfast. Sufficient, but not on par with the class of the hotel. The room is a big worn, the food selection limited and bland, and it took a while to get coffee -- if at all. But we were adequately pumped to start the day, and indulge in culinary treasures almost anywhere else in the city. For the day we needed to get online, we were able to purchase it at Regno; printing was an additional charge, unfortunately, but that's not out of line.

My friend booked the stay in Rome through Kirker Holidays and, after the booking was made, I did have some reservations after reading some comments on Trip Advisor - some were very good and other very poor. However Kirker are normally very good so I did look on the positive side. The location of the hotel is excellent, there are dozens of good restaurants nearby and it was nice to join the crowds at either the Trevi Fountain or the Pantheon before turning in for the night. We found the hotel reception staff upon arrival (Rosa and Gabrielle) both friendly and helpful. We had booked a room with a bath but the room offered only had a shower. Fortunately the hotel were able to offer us the choice of two further rooms, both with baths. The rooms were a good size with ample storage etc. Our room overlooked the Via del Corso which is a busy road but fortunately the windows were double glazed and eliminated most of the traffic noise (apart from police sirens). We were able to keep these closed at night since the room was air conditioned. Although the standard of decoration was a little tired the level of cleanliness was very good with clean towels daily and bed linen changed every other day. As in other Trip Advisor comments the breakfast situation could be much improved. The number of tables was inadequate for the number of guests so if you arrived later that 8.00am you would search for a table (especially for more than two). The coffee was dreadful and they only seemed to provide enough fresh fruit for the first few diners. After the first day we found a really good deli down the Via delle Muratte (opposite the hotel and near the Trevi Fountain) where we brought our own bananas and took them into breakfast. However I have no complaints about the cold buffet, the cereals or croissants. If you wanted something hot it did cost extra, my wife did have a runny boiled egg one morning for 1.70 euro!! Although there was a number for room service this was never answered. After visiting reception we did manage to get a pot of tea sent to the room after about 40 minutes.

As is often cited in the reviews on this hotel, the location is very, very good- you are in the middle of many of the tourist stops, including the Trevi, Pantheon, Forum, etc. Located on the Via Del Corso, which is one of the main shopping streets in Rome. The front desk was courteous and efficient, providing us with a very useful map of Rome. No language problems. Our room, which was located on the first floor (which to us in the U.S. would be considered the second floor), was spacious, and had air conditioning, though it wouldn't make the room \"cold\" as far as U.S. standards are concerned. However, it was the only hotel that we stayed at in Italy that had it at all. One of the reasons it had a.c. was that there was no terrace or balcony of any sort (though our travel agent had requested one for us months in advance)- when we asked to change rooms, we were told there were no terrace rooms available. Our window looked out onto an air shaft- definitely our worst view in Italy. We were also told, when we asked, that there was no sort of outdoor space available for our use at all- i.e. no communal terrace, garden area etc., which I was disappointed in, as their website lead me to believe there would be some sort of outdoor area to hang out in. Also, the breakfast room/bar was on the same floor as our room, and played very loud U.S. music starting at about 6:30 a.m., which could be clearly heard in our room- luckily we had a noise machine with us to drown out the sound. Otherwise, the room was decent- larger than average, with a couch, nice t.v., a bed typical of what we found throughout Italy, and a wardrobe w/ electronic safe (which the bellhop told us to be sure to use not less than 5 times). Bathroom was larger than average and clean, though it showed sign of water damage on the ceiling and some peeling paint. Breakfast was also standard- with good cappucino, rolls and brioches, cold meats, and juice. Overall, aside from the great location, I would agree with the two star ranking, and upon my return to Rome, will most likely look for another place to stay that allowed for some sort of outdoor respite.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farnborough", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "PicklesFarnborough", "ReviewID": "UR20391372", "Content": "Hotel Regno is the perfect location to explore Rome, 5 minutes from the Trevi ,10 minutes from the Spanish steps and all other locations such as the Pantheon , Forum, Piazza Navona and the Old Town, which should not be missed, are all within easy walking .

We like to come back to the hotel of an evening and sit down and relax with a coffee to end the day off, but we just had to go to bed as there was nowhere else to sit. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, one of them even came out to translate instructions to a taxi driver we were having problems making ourselves understood to.

Before deciding which hotel to stay I searched the member's opinions more 3-4 times. Finally after reading a member's review about staying twice in the hotel, I decided to stay at the Regno. I would like to share our experience with you. We got a room for 3. When we checked in the receptionist told me that we have separate toilet and bathroom, and that we have a balcony. When the bell-boy opened the door, we saw a short corridor and in the end the room itself. The corridor has 2 doors opposite each other \u2013 one for the bathroom and the other for the toilet. While the toilet was roomy the bathroom was tiny. There was no pegs to hang the cloths, the 2 shelves are opposite the sink, and very high. As I am the tallest of the 3 of us, I was the only one who could use the shelves, and even than only be standing on my toes. The closet is near the entry door, there is one shelf, and one rod to hang and put one cloth. Here too the rod and the shelf are so high that I was the only one who used the closet, and to reach the shelf I had to stand on my toes. Apart from the closet there are only 2 small drawers, and the other 2 had to leave all their cloths and other things in the suitcase. Very uncomfortable when you stay few days in one hotel. On the first day I asked for one more chair. They did not give us one, when I reminded reception about it on the second day, it did not help. On the third day the receptionist told me that they don't have any spare chairs in the hotel and that we have to seat on the bad. When I said that we would like to seat on the balcony he said: \"your problem\". On the second day we discovered that something is wrong with the air-condition, and that it makes a lot of noise. I called reception but they did not send a technician. On the next day when we went out I reminded reception about the problem with it, and the receptionist (this time a woman) said that she will look into it. When we came back it was not fixed. I call again and she sent the bell-boy. He tried to do his best, but he could not fix it. When I asked him to tell reception to send a technician he said: better you ask them, whey won't heed me saying it. So I called them. But next day, again after reminding them about it in the morning, they did not do anything. Only on the fourth day after I got really angry with them they sent the technician who did his best, and at least he eliminated the noise. To sum it up \u2013 the location is unbeatable; the breakfast was very good; the receptionists are rude and uncooperative, especially the blond woman; the hotel amenities not the ones you find in a good 3 stars hotel. I don't think that we ever stay again in this hotel.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOkay but not the best\u201d", "Author": "chocdeb", "ReviewID": "UR6016611", "Content": "Several people recommended this hotel to us, but when we arrived we were disappointed.

The hotel is very clean and the staff were great - polite, friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fine too, and we didn't have to queue for it on any of the 4 mornings we were there. Also, the bathroom seemed quite modern and had a power shower, and there were no problems with the hot water. Also, the rooms were not at all cold as other users have reported, they were just fine. We had a posh widescreen LCD TV too (ok, I'm easily impressed), and there's internet access for those that want it. Beware those travellers that are over 6 feet tall - you may find that your feet are hanging off the edge of the bed! Our double room was actually 2 single beds pushed together, and they were shorter than the British beds that I'm used to! Not a major problem though. The hotel is on a main street so there's no shortage of shops and places to eat and drink nearby, although it can also be a little noisy. On the other hand, our room was facing directly onto the main road (room 230, 3rd floor), but the noise certainly didn't keep us awake at night. Couldn't really fault the hotel, as long as you shop around for a good price - we used Cybertravelnetwork and got 4 nights for the price of 3, and at a pretty decent price.", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "likearollingstone", "ReviewID": "UR4518848", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Regno last August and found it to be a pleasant hotel.

The hotel is friendly, especially the bell-boy Daniel, who was almost over the top with service. The rooms were not large but well serviced. There are no facilities for coffee or tea making, common in Italy, and don't expect an iron. Officially banned in Italian hotels. The breakfast area is quaint, and I suggest eating early, as some days there was a queue to get a table. The coffee at breakfast is wonderful, a fresh cappucino on demand. The position of the hotel is fantastic. 5 minutes to the Trevi, and 5 minutes the other way to the Spanish Steps. I put in some laundry on a Friday night and by Monday it had not returned. It seems that they cannot get it done over the weekends, and it was only when I enquired was this info passed onto me. The staff were overall helpfull and friendly.

Had a minor issue with our room upon check in. After checking in early, we were advised that a room was available, but found that this was a double room, rather than a twin (which we had requested). They happily showed us another room, which had a double bed and a fold out bed. We stated that this would not be acceptable for a 4 night stay and they showed us a tiny twin room. We asked for the double in the second room to be separated, which they did. This probably means we ended up with what would be classed as a triple room. The room itself, on the thrid floor, was very comfortable and clean.The beds were brilliant and we had plenty of space to store luggage and hang washing. The bathroom looked recently renovated, with a shower, toilet and bidet. We had no problems with hot water, although found the water could not be kept on full pressure (which was excellent) for an entire shower as the alcove would flood. I agree with a previous review in that the linen, includeing towels was exceptional. Breakfast was provided and was always more than enoughy to carry us through to dinner. A selection of pastries, cold meat, cheese, yoghurt, cakes and toast was offered, along with a small selection of average tasting fruit. The breakfast room oozed ambience, with a glass ceiling, which was very convenient to check weather conditions, especially in winter! The staff were helpful and some were very friendly, with others always courteous. They were more than willing to help with directions and supplied us with a great map of Rome upon check in. Storage of luggage was also not a problem. The position of the hotel was fantastic. We walked everywhere, apart from the Vatican (although it probably could be done). There was also a great little restaurant down the alley leading to the Pantheon, which served fantastic food at very reasonable prices. There were bus stops 5 minutes down the road and tobacconists for bus tickets the same distance away. The only real negative was the busker that would plant himself opposite the hotel every night and sing the same song on a loop for hours. He was always finished by the time we anted to sleep, but was there enough that we knew the chorus of his song word for word and were seriously considering what we could throw out the window! ;) We found this hotel to be charming, comfortable, pretty much as we expected and deserving of a 3 1/2 star rating.

Good sound protection from the outside. The hotel was very busy in August and the breakfast room was a little crammed. My only poor comment would be to say that the staff were a little slow at clearing the breakfast tables (of departed guests) and several mornings we cleared our own table to be able to eat.

We saw reviews about the rooms being small, but we were assigned a room that was almost a junior suite, with a balcony(ask for room 134). Room is well equipped, has an honor bar/refrig. Even though on top of busy street, room is well soundproofed. We went in late Feb, and got a rate of $660USD(all taxes, etc, plus breakfast) for 5 nights which was less than what it would have cost to go to Los Angeles. Right out the front of the hotel, are 2 bus stops(both directions) that will take you almost anywhere in Rome, or where you can make a connection. Coming into Termini from Fiumicino, take the 175 bus to the Minghetti stop on del Corso- hotel across the street. Cant get any easier.
