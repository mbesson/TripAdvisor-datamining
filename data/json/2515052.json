The lobby, restaurant and bar are evocative of the mid to late 18th century, the period of the great, if sometime infamous French kings, Louis XV and XVI, when the building housing the hotel was built. So it has a sense of place and history that is sometimes missing in many five star hotels in the 21st century \u2013 that is to be applauded. But is this enough to compensate for the very high prices for a room at one the city\u2019s most expensive hotels? I would have said yes if they got all the other stuff right. Yes, the service was impeccable. But it\u2019s the things at the margin that matter when your paying more than \u20ac600 a night. Like a bathroom that is clearly looking forlorn, with the taps not working brilliantly, the shower looking a bit out of date and not as good as hotels a quarter of the price. Carpets in the hallways were often tatty, needing replacements, some pipes in the courtyard were rusty\u2026and the room service breakfast looked pretty fatigued. I wouldn\u2019t be complaining if I was paying half the price, but again you want this to be special, very special and it wasn\u2019t. I hear the hotel has recently been taken over by a Saudi prince.

The visit was absolutely magical, and memorable. This is a hotel that knows what it's doing. It's also one of the truly elegant hotels in Paris, but unlike some of its competition (such as the elegant hotel nearby whose name is more well-recognized), the Crillon has maintained a sense of hushed elegance, of old-money ease and charm that's more true elegance than gold-leaf glamour. True, it's pricey, but it's worth every euro. Not the least of which because you walk out the door and Place de la Concorde is at your feet. The G.M. Luc Delafosse and his staff made my visit extraordinary. I can't say enough of how nice it was to be recognized -- the staff knew me from day 1 -- my first experience was three nights, then I went back for another night.. Based on a great long weekend stay, I went back to the Crillon following our ski trip to the Alps. A special message for the concierge team, who really set us up for two wonderful dinners at low-key restaurants (I wanted low-key places those nights, and our tables were in the best spots of both restaurants, and these are popular places with locals). Another special message goes out to the reservations team, who were so on-hand and wonderful when setting me up for the stay on the way back through Paris. And a very special message for Mr. Delafosse for being so friendly, and accessible. Impressive all around. Upon returning to the hotel for that last night in Paris, I was immediately greeted by name: I felt at home. As they say in the Crillon, it's your home in Paris, and I really felt that was true (albeit an extraordinarily elegant, well-positioned home filled with history - but your home nonetheless!). If you're willing to splurge for a luxurious stay, definitely check out this magical spot.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monaco-Ville, Monaco", "Title": "\u201cGreat but not quite up to last visit\u201d", "Author": "SirGeorge61", "ReviewID": "UR126373974", "Content": "Second stay here within a year but under different circumstances so am revisiting. I stayed this time with my wife and our daughter. We booked a De Luxe room as that was all that was possible with the extra bed but we were upgraded on arrival to an Executive. It was a big room with a large sitting area and lots of space for the extra bed. It also had a small dressing area and a large bathroom. I was on the first floor as last time by request on the side giving onto the side road and the room had very high ceilings. My daughter was given some very nice Crillon toys which made her stay very special. This was really well done and a huge plus for the hotel. Since my last visit they had finished the exterior works. The interior is as always, very elegant and immaculate. The room was perfectly clean and prepared. beds were very comfortable indeed, even my daughters camp bed. Room service was efficient and courteous and errors of which there were a few were corrected without fuss. We were never disturbed at night. The position if it suits you, is unbeatable. A few issues: The doormen are next to useless. they watch you walk through the narrow revolving doors with suitcases without ever offering to help. Even when you engage them they just smile and simply stand in a small group chatting amongst themselves. This didn't bother me on my last trip when I was travelling very light but you don't stand by and watch a woman with a suitcase without offering to help. This is in total contrast to a hotel like Claridges in London where you are besieged by doormen as you get out of the taxi who immediately remove anything that they think they can help with. They don't want to see their guests struggling as they enter the hotel. This is not to say that the doormen at the Crillon are impolite but they could do a lot better. We arrived at about 4pm and our room was not ready. We had to wait about half an hour and were given tea while we waited. Considering I was told very strictly to be out by 12.00 when we left, I found this a surprise and it was inconvenient as we wanted to change and do some shopping before dinner. Last time I stayed, I was given a huge bowl of fresh fruit each day. This seems to have stopped which is a shame as it makes the room look better and was delicious. Maybe times are getting tough even at this end of the market. A huge black mark - on the last morning when I had a meeting I found that I had no water coming out of the hot tap. I had run the bath but it was cold. After a while water arrived but it was still cold and yellow in colour. I had no option but to have a cold bath. They came to fix it but it was too late. I was told that all the other rooms had no problem so I suppose it was an airlock. Later on I had a message to say that they were cutting the water supply at lunch time but we had checked out by then. On check out I mentioned it and I received only a sympathetic shrug. I offered the fact that I had just had a beer from the mini bar but even given the opportunity to give me the beer as a concession to my discomfort, he went to great pains to reprint the bill with the beer added. Maybe I'm being fussy but in my mind hot water in a hotel room is next to a bed in importance. It didn't make my hectic morning any easier. Anyway we had a good stay apart from the above and I still recommend the Hotel de Crillon as a wonderful place to stay in Paris at the top end.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chur", "Title": "\u201cFrom perfect to lousy\u201d", "Author": "Betschart-CH", "ReviewID": "UR126318081", "Content": "The quality varies very much.

Reserved throught grandluxuaryhotels.com and received a guarenteed room upgrade. (Executive Room) Check-in was so very nice with one-on-one service while seated in the lounge. The young woman who assisted us was friendly, yet professional. (I HATE the \"I'm your new best friend\" approach that is invading the American service industry) Our room was large with a seating area (sofa, cocktail/coffee table & 2 chairs), large desk & chair and a king bed. The bed was ever so comfortable, but the sofa and chairs were like sitting on rocks. They were so uncomfortable, I would sit at the desk at night to read before bed. I would think a 5 star hotel would provide better. The bathroom almost made up for the poor seating (almost, but not entirely!) It had a double sink vanity with excellent lighting, a deep soaking tub with separate shower. A heated towel rack would have been a nice addition. Maid service exceeded excellence We received an abundance of large, fluffy white towels twice a day. We were provided with enough shampoo and hand lotion to open our own shop. I cannot say enough good things about these ladies. Breakfast was a delight each morning. It was so good to have eggs for breakfast after 15 days of pastry! On our first morning, our daughter asked our waiter what was the French word for spoon. Each succeeding morning, he would point to the spoon, fork and knife and wait for her to respond with the correct word in French. She would be rewarded with a bright smile and wink if correct or rolling of the eyes if incorrect. It was a fun way to start the day. Would I stay here again? No. But I would eat breakfast there!", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "matt b", "ReviewID": "UR120423072", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel de Crillon for three nights and loved it.

The one thing that we have forgotten to put into the past reviews is that you MUST order the American breakfast in your room at least 1 morning. It is the perfect way to start a full day in the city.

We were also given some amenities as buffet breakfast + late check-out until 4pm + an afternoon tea for 2 + complimentary departing transfer to the airport. The hotel car (Mercedes) is also available to take you to nearby areas since early morning until 9:30pm (free of charge). On our arrival we were greeted by the doorman and escorted to the front desk where Kaori made our check-in kindly and all in smiles. After that she escorted us to our Suite and showed us everything inside. The Concierge guys were all great and helped me with promptness everytime I needed, they even got me a place to dinner at Le Jules Vernes (Eiffel Tower fine restaurant on 2nd level) on the same day I asked for (this is very difficult as this restaurant requires many days previous reservation). The hotel is in a perfect location on Place de la Concorde, right in the heart of Paris and close to everything. And if you like walking as we do you can go to the sightseeing places as the Tuileries, Louvre Museum, Notre Dame, Triumph Arc (on Champs-Elyse\u00e9) and even the Eiffel Tower (2,5 km from the hotel), just appreciating this wonderful city. But if you are not a walker like me you should take the subway to the Eiffel Tower. You are also close to the shopping hot spots like Champs-Elyse\u00e9, Saint-Honor\u00e9 Street and Place Vend\u00f4me where you will find the finest brands. The hotel has 2 main restaurants, L'Ob\u00e9 and Les Ambassadeurs (the most beautiful) where we had our breakfast every morning. Breakfast has many food options including hot and cold buffet, all very tasteful. Hotel also offer The Bar where you can have some drinks and a Winter Garden (depending on weather conditions) where we had our afternoon tea, very nice too!! There is a fitness center on 6th floor with some apparels and water (take the elevator until 5th and walk up the stairs to 6th). You must use your room key to access the FC which is open 24h.

I have stayed at a few of the other Parisian palace hotels, including the Georges V and the Meurice. Both are also excellent, but I think what really sets the Crillon apart is that the service, while just as professional and outstanding as those other hotels, is so friendly and personable. Paris has a reputation for snooty and haughty service, but you will not find any of that at the Crillon, which has more the feel of a terrifically pampering luxury home.

Beware!\u201d", "Author": "ashley041", "ReviewID": "UR115463496", "Content": "My husband and I took our teenage daughter to Paris this last June. We had a wonderful time exploring the capitol cities in Europe until we reached Paris. We arrived at the Hotel de Crillon and immediately noticed it was under construction - the entire facade of the building was covered with scaffolding. The formally charming patio is now covered with astro turf -can you believe it? Once the epitome of Parisian style and grace, it now presents as a stop for tour buses. The hotel should be closed during this extensive renovation!!! Let's hope they hire someone with some aesthetic sensibility and taste, not leave it to the person who laid down astro turf. We checked in and they had upgraded our room. What a joke!!! When we saw it, we thought they were kidding. The room was small and tight with low ceilings and was not well appointed. Throughout Europe, we had been upgraded and had wonderful accommodations........ but not here. We had stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon and our 10th anniversary and now our 20th. We asked to be upgraded to the suite we had last time (which was available) but they refused and told us it would cost $5,000 for this room per night. We viewed the suite and it had not changed in the last 10 years - it was tired and run down and smelled of cigar smoke. We tried to see if we could get a better deal because $5,000 per night was a crazy price for it. The hotel refused to budge at all and only offered us a bottle of champagne if we took the room at their very, very inflated price. Our past experience at the Crillon had been completely different - the staff was much more accommodating and willing to upgrade. We found the current staff pompous, stingy and rude. Their concierge was insufferably rude - he went out of his way to insult me and give me bad advice. We ended up staying in this horrible little room overlooking a very noisy side street as we couldn't change hotels. Oh, did I mention that the shower had black mold in it and leaked. Also, the construction noise and truck deliveries started at the crack of dawn and went on all day- we didn't sleep a wink. We tried so very hard to move hotels but it was the Paris Air Show that week and all the other comparable hotels were booked. We learned that the Crillon had been sold since we had last stayed there and the management company had changed as well. All this ruined our trip to our favorite city in the world. I would never, ever stay at this hotel again. BEWARE OF THIS HOTEL, ITS HORRIBLE SEVICE, AND INCREDIBLY HIGH PRICES AND NOT TO MENTION ALL THE CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!!! The ownership and management should be replaced with people qualified to own and operate a property of this stature.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWe love our stay at the Crillon.\u201d", "Author": "Moonlight", "ReviewID": "UR115423049", "Content": "A last minute decision to change hotel after arriving in Paris with my two teenage daughters on the weekend before the Bastille Day, as Paris is at full capacity.

The Crillon is designed in magnificent classic French style with walls of marble and mirrors in the dining areas, beautiful chandeliers and bouquets of roses throughout the property, and comfortable chairs and tables for relaxing or small gatherings. It is centrally located facing the Concorde, and walking distance to all the major museums and attractions. Only a 5 minute walk to my favorite deli, \"Fauchon\" (next to the Madeleine). Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite that opens up to a large balcony with a table and chairs that over look the street. Although the building's front entrance was under some renovation, we did not hear any noises from the construction at all. The staff were friendly and attentive to our every need. We had breakfast in the Les Ambassadeurs each morning, had tea in the afternoon, and one night had a few local friends over to the Bar Crillon for a bottle of wine. Everything we had in this hotel was excellent, the food, the wine selection, the accommodation, and down to the daily replenishment of our fruit tray and the flower in our room. We felt like royalty, living in a beautiful castle with all the modern amenity. The concierge was friendly and helpful, definitely use their services for booking restaurants or just for directions or suggestions.

A bit of arrogance in all the concierge and other services. Be prepared to things that I considered normal some years ago and that are now become to be lesser acceptable. For example we ask to book a restaurant being outside of the hotel and asked to send us SMS message with the name and address due to bad line. Concierge told he cannot do that. After I insisted he said he would try and of course never did it. We had to call him repeatedly and finally he gave us restaurant close to pereferique and really empty on busy Saturday eve. Was it his intention? Rooms of Crillon are generally well kept but need un update. What I really like in Crillon is their bar. This is very well run and efficient evening experience. In general I still like Crillon and it is still on my favorites lists.

The bed, however, was not comfortable--seemed past its prime.....had two depressions where people had slept. The love seat in the room was stiff, shallow and also not very comfortable. We were not shown the thermostat controls and consequently was too cold the first night.

To make matters worse, our room was at the end of the hall near where Pacco Rabanne was setting up for their Fashion Week showroom....at 2am! We heard every worker walking up and down the hallway with their noisy carts and chit chat. My husband got up the first night to see what was going on and asked people to be more quiet. When he called down to the front desk, no one was around. When he tried to speak to the manager the next morning, the manager apologized but made no attempt to rectify the situation.

Upon our request to be checked into a room as soon as possible, we were given a room almost immediately The room was on the first floor overlooking the winter garden and while it was clean and very French in design, it looked a bit worn and dated. It was howevr a very large room. The room was chilly, so we turned on the heating to full blast and went out for a spot of shopping. When we came back to the hotel some 4 hours later, the room was still cold. We called the front desk and a technician arrived promptly to check on the heating. We were told it was fine, although the warm air coming out of the vent was weak. We called the front desk again when it was still cold after giving the heater another half hour to warm up, and we were offered a change of room. Rhea came within 5 minutes of my phone call to escort us to another room on the second floor which was warm and toasty, and even offered us hot tea to warm up. It was a lovely stay, the hotel room was very quiet until about 10 am in the morning when renovation works would start, the bed was most comfortable, and most of all, the heater in our new room works!! I'm most happy with the service received at this hotel, all our concerns were addressed almost immediately, staff were friendly and helpful, the concierge is a fountain of information on everything Parisian and I would make Hotel de Crillon my default hotel of choice whenever I'm in Paris from now on!", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAnother amazing stay at one of the best hotels in the world\u201d", "Author": "KirkPA", "ReviewID": "UR88543018", "Content": "This is our 7th trip to Paris and our second stay at the hotel de Crillon.

Please remember, if you are not looking for a historically significant, classic palace and are not willing ot pay for it, do not stay at the Crillon. This is the hotel that creates the service level that the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton could only hope to meet. Fot that level of service, there is definitely a cost. One great positive is that it is much smaller than The Ritz, the George V and the Plaza Athinee - and much more private than the Meurice.

We were somewhat disappointed. On arrival by taxi from CDG, our luggage was taken from the car (by my husband and the taxi driver) and left sitting in the street while while the uniformed staff decided what to do with it and who should carry the blessed stuff inside. One might believe this was an entirely new scenario for them, or perhaps our battered, well worn cases weren't up to their marque. We had arrived at the hotel early in the morning around 7.30 am) so didn't expect an immediate check-in. Registration was handled very pleasantly and I assume at some stage someone deigned to bring our luggage in off the street since it did make it to our room later. We were told that our upgrade (as promised by Amex concierge booking) was available (but in retrospect, I don't care to think about what a less luxurious room would have been like.) The rate we paid was only about EUR 60 less than the rack rate posted in the room. We returned to the hotel late morning but the room was still not ready so we went out for a slightly weary lunch. Returning after 3pm we were shown to Room 10, on the first floor of the hotel overlooking the courtyard. A reasonably spacious room but not a suite by any standard. There was a gentle hubbub from the courtyard which, I would imagine, could become irritating in the busier summer months if you want a really quiet room. With the curtains open and a light on (winter mornings?) you are most very visible to the other guests in rooms overlooking the courtyard. Time for a nap in a faultlessly comfortable bed with good quality and clean linens. My impression in September was that with all windows closed, the room would be very stuffy (the air conditioning was below standard, but as we live in the Middle East, it often seems that way in Europe). That evening we tried to book for the Sunday champagne brunch in the hotel restaurant but were told it was full. Do the hotel keep some tables back for guests, releasing them only on the morning of the brunch to non-residents if not booked by then (as happens in our local 5 stars), or were we just unlucky? Given the price and 'reputation' this hotel enjoys, the bathroom was disappointing. The over-bath shower had a poorly fitting screen which meant the bathroom flooded every time one showered, resulting in either a floor strewn with sodden towels or a slippery marble floor. Furthermore, as a result of this constant water damage, the wood around the surround of the bathroom door was black with mould and the tiles in the adjacent lavatory had cracked - neither pleasing to the eye nor hygenic. There was no bidet in the bathroom which, given the overall condition, could be considered a blessing. The towels could be larger - bath sheets, anyone? As usual, the lighting and set up was dreadful for putting on make-up and there was no dressing table in the bedroom, so that was a bit hit and miss (why do hotels that must spend a fortune on interior design fail in these most basic areas? I need to put my face on in either head-on natural light or in a mirror with lights at the side - overhead lights give funny shadows. Is it really so difficult to organise this, chaps?) Overall, as others have said, this is eye-wateringly expensive but lacks the attention to detail one might expect for the price. Nice breakfast, flaky service, terrible coffee (as usual in hotels). Great bed. Great (complimentary) afternoon tea with lots of tea, savouries and good quality pastry/cakey pig stuff. Bar is low key, expensive as expected, restaurant we can't comment on as they didn't have space for us.

However, when I tried to get her something to eat there, things became more difficult. I had asked the lady who showed us to our room which restaurant would be best to try with a child and she said that L'Obe was the best as it was less formal and that their (other) flagship restaurant would be too rich for a child. I therefore took my daughter to L'Obe and was surprised that they had no children's menu. The only menu that was available was too sophisticated for an English 8 year old. When I asked if the chef would be able to provide a pizza or some plain pasta with tomato sauce while I had the published menu, the response was \"absolutely not\". I was amazed at this reaction. When I asked the concierge which restaurant I should try, he advised me to have room service or go outside the hotel. This is not acceptable as you don't go to Paris to eat in your hotel room! The good parts of the hotel were undoubtedly the position which meant we could walk everywhere and the lovely bathroom and comfortable beds which we both enjoyed.

They treat all guests the same, whether said guests are dripping Louis Vuitton luggage or luggage of a lesser brand! The rooms are sumptuous and very pleasant, and when we stayed (I explained via email that the trip was for our 25th wedding anniversary celebration) the hotel went the extra mile, and place a lovely bottle of Tattinger bubbly in the room, a lovely fruit bowl, and chocs. They even upgraded us to a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

The rooms were adequate but nothing like the size of rooms at George V nor were the showers/bathrooms anything like the same scale. Rate included a buffet breakfast which was excellent although they did try and stick us for the breakfast on the bill at checkout so stay alert out there people. Business centre wanted to charge us for use of the computers. S'cuse me? 1,000 quid a night (two adjoining rooms) and you want me to pay to print off my boarding passes? You what? Fortunately the concierge saw sense and printed 'em off gratis. No spa but the fitness room proved a big hit with the kids who had the place to themselves while they tried out the static bikes and treadmills and suchlike with their irreverent lunacy. Probably would have annoyed more serious fitness fanatics if there had been anybody else there. Bar INSANELY expensive for a drink. 22 Euros for a G&T. I could buy a bottle and a straw for that kind of cash. Complimentary nibbles very pedestrian - peanuts and crisps. At that kind of price for a drink you expect foie gras and caviar canapes. Well I do. Had lunch off lobby area. Good, but, again, insanely expensive. On the upside the hotel is very well positioned. Right on Place de la Concorde with Metro station entrance no more than 20 yards from the front door. Views of famous sights all around the second you set foot outside. Walking distance to most of the main tourist sites. Would I stay there again? Hmmm. Hard to be sure. It's a great location, the staff are helpful, the rooms are okay but not huge, the common areas sumptuous but then you'd expect that to be the case for that kind of money.

The location is spectacular, on the Place de la Concorde, walking distance from the Louvre, across the street from the Jeu de Paume, Palais Royale, Petit Palais, at the foot of the Chamls Eleysees etc. If you love great Parisian architecture, I can't imagine a better location. Check-in was efficient and after completing the formalities I was escorted up to my Deluxe King room on the first floor (two levels up in the elevator from the ground floor). The room was decorated in classic grand old French style, with heavy drapes and was medium sized with a coffee table and two chairs and a desk as well as a large flat screen tv. I was slightly surprised to see that the bathroom was exceptionally new, very nice and spacious with both tub and seperate shower, lavatory and bidet, all in nice marble with mirrors and a double sink and excellent toiletries provided. Wireless internet was included with the room, but breakfast was an additional $40 for continental. The room service menu offered a good range of choices at silly prices ($48 for a Grey Goose and tonic!!! $38 for a pizza, although this looks like bargain relative to the $50 plain pizza at the Ritz Paris room service menu.) Service throughout my stay was excellent, the concierge was helpful in choosing and booking me an alternative restaurant when my first choice was unavailable. I used the gym on the fifth floor, which was spotlessly clean, completely empty (Paris doesn't have much of an exercise culture) and with a good selection of machines. Check out was the only service snafu, it took close to ten minutes as there was only one person on the desk and five rooms wanting to check out. All in all I would highly recommend the hotel and view it as a superior choice in all respects than the other great grande dame - The Ritz, whose rooms, service and attitude to guests is in all respects inferior to that of the Crillon. The Ritz also charges even higher prices and has the balls to charge $30 per day for internet on top of $1000 per night for the room.

For four nights in Paris we stayed at Hotel Saint Paul, and we had planned to treat ourselves to a very special hotel for one night. It was the \"dream\" hotel for my wife. Lets start off with the good, the location, wow, wow, for a tourist in Paris the view just outside the door of this hotel does not get any better. We had a standard room but was very large (especially for Paris) and the bathroom was also very impressive. Great furnishings as well, very classic. We ordered room service, and that was very good,(pricey yes), but the service was like a 5 star restaraunt being brought into our hotel room. No kid awkwardly delivering something but instead two very professional men. Breakfast was also really good, great quality and fantastic setting and atmosphere. Now for the disappointing; we arrived early and couldn't properly check in, but we left our luggage and came back just after 3 to check in. Taken to our hotel room, very impressed but our luggage wasn't there and neither was the complimentary bottle of champagne as part of our package. Called reception a couple of times and our luggage finally got there, at least an hour later, same with the champagne. Both should have been in our room when we arrived or at least within a few minutes of our arrival. Not a major issue but with this class and cost of hotel, service needs to be flawless. Additional disappointment on our checkout, as we were leaving the hotel to get into the taxi, porter put the case in the taxi and broke the handle. Accidents happen but did not appreciate a lack of apology from the porter and even a laugh.

Approximately a week before our stay, the hotel staff sent us an e-mail asking us about our preferences so that they can best accommodate our needs. Everything that I wrote in the form was met (and more). Then, came the volcano...We had to reschedule our reservation with the hotel a couple of times (at least 3 times) and they were very understanding (unlike a number of other hotels and Easyjet...). Finally, we arrived at the hotel (almost a week and a half behind the scheduled date) and we were greeted by a warm and welcoming receptionist. The check-in process was very quick. She must have realized that we were exhausted, so I think she made the process quicker than normal (how attentive!). She then led us to our room and showed us around to make sure that it was acceptable. And acceptable it was! It was one of the most beautiful rooms that we have ever stayed in (if not the most), and we were very pleasantly surprised to see how large and elegant the room was (I was blown away by the marbled floor bathroom!). On the coffee table, there was another pleasant surprise waiting for us: a hot pot of water (with an assortment of tea). How did they know when we were going to check in? We left the hotel for a few hours, and upon our return from dinner, we were again surprised by the thoughtfulness of the hotel staff. There was a bottle of champagne and fruit on the table, with rose petals decorating the bed and the bath tub. Upon entering the room, we both looked at each other and were confused. We thought that we entered someone else's room. What a night it was. Furthermore, the hotel staff are very well trained. When we requested items, the staff that answered the phone replied \"immediately sir\" and they brought them up immediately. When I asked the receptionist about where I can buy a nice set of tea cups, the concierge called within 2 minutes listing places that we can try. I realize now that I didn't give much information about the room or the hotel location, but I was just simply amazed by the hotel staff and their service. The hotel is located in the heart of Paris (at the Place de la Concorde), next to a street (St. Honore) that houses all of the name brand stores that you can think of. The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated, with modern amenities, and an open terrace. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a once in a lifetime experience.

Our room was small, but had a walk-in closet/dressing area and a bathroom with full bath and separate shower. Despite the size, it was comfortable and very pleasant. Housekeeping is immaculate and skillfully unobtrusive, providing cleaning and turndown automatically when guests are away and- in a nice touch- calling to politely ask guests still in their rooms if and when they'd like to be served. That said, this luxury hotel clearly caters to a certain clientele. My polite request for a room with any kind of view was ignored; my room, while lovely, was small and looked out over an interior courtyard. It was hard not to feel that my request had been intentionally ignored. Staff descends upon you during check-in and check-out; those who prefer to carry their own bags the additional few feet from reception to the room or the street rather than shell out euros to bellhops for unwanted service may feel self-conscious. There is an unquestionable snootiness to the place that may also make those not accustomed to this type of hotel somewhat uncomfortable, and guests should expect anything to be a la carte and pricey. This is not the type of hotel that offers free coffee in the room; it can be ordered from room service for 4x what you'd pay anywhere else. Don't even think about touching the phones; even a toll-free call results in a 1-2 euro charge. Finally, although free (and wonderfully fast) wifi in the rooms is a very nice touch, the business center inexplicably charges by the minute for use of a computer; there is a staff member there 24 hours a day seemingly for the sole purpose of selling access to the computers. Suggestion to hotel: lose the staffer and use the saved salary to replace what is essentially an ultra-expensive internet cafe with a true business center with free computer access for guests. Again, however, the hotel is beautiful, the housekeeping service is wonderful, and the location is perfect. In short, I'd recommend this hotel without reservation to those accustomed to a certain level of luxury and service. That said, I have stayed in a number of 5-star hotels that make every guest feel like a 5-star guest regardless of what they paid for the room or what services they use; this is not one of them.

I was naive, however, in thinking that Crillon might appreciate this six-night PREPAID booking from a new customer. We arrived on Monday at 12:30 in the afternoon and were asked to wait an hour while they prepared the room, which was understandable. What was unforgivable however, was the room that they then gave us. An agglomeration of 4 small rooms, with the toilet in a closet at one end, [hand sink didn't drain], a 7' x 10' sitting room overcrowded with two tables, two chairs, a small sofa and an old, ugly floor lamp, a bedroom barely larger than the king size bed with less than 2' circulation space between the foot of the bed and the wall, an adequate dressing room, and then a bathroom [located 25 feet from the toilet] with a bathtub [didn't drain] with the shower in it, but no shower stall, no heated floor, no bidet - rather a given - in a French hotel. It took us 24 hours of wrangling with Xavier [mentioned in other reviews] to extricate ourselves from this horrow show.

Unlike many other hotels, our instruction to the hotel to never attempt to use the door to our girls room was followed meticulously. A little thing, but as a parent something I find very reassuring. My parents in law are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary later this year, which I had mentioned briefly to the reservation team. On the first night the hotel filled their room with flowers, and spread rose petals on their bed in the shape of a heart. They were enchanted. Our rooms were on the courtyard, which was very quiet. In summer I imagine they could get noisy from the use of the space below as a seating area, but on chilly spring evenings they were fine. The hotel's greatest achievement is the frindliness and service level of the staff. At no point did I feel that the staff were trying to sell us anything, they genuinely had our best interests at heart. For example, on leaving I asked for them to arrange a car for six to the station. They offered to call a 6-berth taxi or to arrange a private chauffeur. They told me the price of both, and stated the taxi would be absolutely fine for such a short journey. Given the \u20ac150 price difference, this was a not inconsiderable saving. I would recommend this hotel to anyone - business or pleasure. The price was very reasonable for such luxury, style and service. And significantly less than the rather dreary and ubiquitous upmarket chains like the FS (which I find a bit like butlins for the rich in money and poor in imagination mob).", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious retreat in perfect location\u201d", "Author": "Sensayuma", "ReviewID": "UR24657681", "Content": "Perfect location for the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay and the Champs Elysees right on the Place de la Concorde.

We were very pleased that they accommodated us right away and showed us to our room. We had a complimentary bottle of champaigne and a fruit bowl. The rooms were magnificent and comfortable at the same time. The staff was very friendly. The concierge set us up for dinner and a show at the Moulin Rouge and provided a small but welcome credit on the price. Every aspect of our visit was exceptional from the rooms to the service. I can understand how some people may feel uncomfortable in such an upscale hotel if they are on vacation and wanting to be casual, but we were in shorts and jeans for our 4 days and never felt unappreciated by the staff, in fact we kidded with the doormen and others when they saw us in shorts during 65 degree days! In addition to making reservations for us, the concierge was helpful in planning day trips around the area, marking routes on maps for us each day. He even noted some good wine stores nearby, as we enjoyed having wine in the room each night before venturing off to dinner. Saved some money that way. Rooms service brought up wine glasses and ice at no additional charge (just a tip) each evening. We plan to go back to Paris in a few years and will likely stay at another hotel, just for variety and to visit a new section of the city.

I had two young kids and had to get connecting rooms. The hotels does not allow 2 kids with the parents in the regular room.

We thought staying in a top-flight hotel would cheer us up, and we hoped that the concierge would help us work out our flight arrangements. We were disappointed in many aspects of our stay. Although the suite was nicely decorated and the staff were generally friendly, we found the concierge to be quite rude and unhelpful. It was the type of rudeness that you always hear associated with visiting Paris, but we thought it was ironic that the only place we experienced it was in a five-star hotel. That was our biggest disappointment, since we were specifically hoping for some assistance from the concierge. In addition, there were constant little problems that we didn't expect in a hotel of this caliber. The internet service available in the rooms utilized the TV, and it was complicated to use. In addition, the screen size seemed off, so you were always trying to scroll around in an awkward way to see the necessary part of the web page. It was expensive, too. I didn't sleep very well, because there was a lot of hallway noise that carried into the rooms, and because the beds were overly firm/hard (in my opinion). There were no chains on the inside of the doors, and the locks unlocked when you turned the handle -- as a result, my two-year old could open them from the inside, which meant he tried to do that about every 5 minutes (!) When we talked to the staff about it, they were unable to offer any suggestions of how to address the problem. When room service delivered food to our two-room suite, they never came to the room we requested, so they would ring the bell on the other side and often wake our 2-year old son up when he was still sleeping in the morning or during his afternoon nap. On another occasion, my husband needed to have a pair of pants cleaned, and asked them to be returned the following morning. When there was still no sign of the pants by the following afternoon, we called to track them down. They were delivered to our room ultimately, but we were still charged for the rush cleaning service on our hotel bill. To be fair, after we pointed out the error, they did remove the rush charge. On our last day, the cleaning staff accidentally threw out some fruit we had bought for our son for the plane trip the next day. I called the front desk and they offered to replace it, but didn't follow through. I had to call and ask a second time that night before they replaced it. Lastly, when I asked the concierge to point out the closest entrance to the Louvre on my map, he did so, but failed to inform me that the museum is closed on Tuesdays. I figured that out myself after making the 20-minute trek over there. Although many of these are small things, it seemed to be one long list of problems, especially since we were only there 2 nights.
