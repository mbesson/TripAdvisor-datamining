This is definitely a good choice for business travellers and for those visiting HK on holidays as well. It not only offers very good value for money because of the competitve rates and great location (right next to Wan Chain MTR station and with plenty of shops and restaurants around - and still so quiet inside !!!), the quality of the staff is impressive. They are flexible, customer-minded and always able and eager to solve your porblems effectively and with a smile in their face.

Also includes a washer/dryer which was not expected. Perfect executive type apartments for both short and especially for long term stays.

We have had a few different hotel experiences in Hong Kong and this was an easy to stay place in a good location. Regardless of how good the hotel, I get sick of not being able to do the things I would at home and a serviced apartment gives you the best of both worlds. The apartment is very small but well laid out with a separate kitchen, bathroom, sitting room and bedroom. Some of the extras like a medicine cabinet in the bathroom made life a lot easier in a small space. You can do your own cooking and washing, watch one of two televisions or go out into busy Wan Chai and check out the vibrant night life and restaurants. The property seems fairly new and everything was clean and in good shape - fittings were quite stylish. There were a few minor hitches that were annoying and hard to fix; the WiFi in the room was down constantly and the helpful staff installed a router in our room to boost the signal, but it took several tries with the staff to get it up and running. I struggled to have a decent shower when I was there (this is a pet peeve of mine) and I was either freezing or burning myself as the waster temperature went up and down. The air con has two fans, one in the main area and the bedroom, but it's pointed directly down at the bed and could only be switched on for minutes at a time or you would freeze - frustrating in hot weather to get the temp right and made for warm, sticky nights. Free breakfast was provided in the downstairs reception each week day, although I did not partake. There was always someone at reception and they were friendly and responsive with requests. We were on the 3rd floor and I would suggest asking for a room on a higher floor, as the traffic noise can be significant. There is a bus stop and tram line stop literally at the front door and the MTR (train stop) a few minutes walk away. Overall a good and recommended experience I'd you're staying on Hong Kong Island.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muntinlupa, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cTop notch service apartment in Wanchai, highly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "miketri722", "ReviewID": "UR115781986", "Content": "A warm welcome from the two front office staff awaited us upon arrival by taxi from the Hong Kong Station. After the customary forms being filled up and my credit card collected for the HK$900 security deposit, we were ushered by the staff to Unit 14-D, the larger of the 4 apartments on this level. (There are 4 apartments per level, and I believe the A & D apartments are larger than the B & C). The added touch of a complimentary hamper containing, crackers, cookies, chocolate bars, a bottle of wine, and a refrigerator full of soft drinks and beer made the welcome all the more impressive) We were shown around the apartment which contained everything you will need for your stay. Aside from the usual features, the apartment had an ironing board, umbrella, flash light, universal adaptor. In the kitchen, was a washing machine, microwave/convection oven, refrigerator, coffee maker and the necessary cooking utensils and cutlery. The apartment, being on an even-numbered floor is scheduled for cleaning on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and since our stay was a brief one (Wednesday to Saturday), we only saw the cleaning lady on Thursday, the day after our arrival. However, she did a less than thorough job of cleaning, as I saw dirt and hair on the dining room floor after her routine cleaning. A minor drawback is the slow drain in the shower. The bathroom design did not lend to a pleasant shower experience, though. You have to angle the rain shower head in order to minimize the water splashing into the bathroom floor. The major draw for me staying at Frasers was the service by all staff I encountered during my brief stay. They were always ready with a smile and a greeting whenever we walked in or out the lobby. On our last day as we awaited our check-out in the apartment, the alarm on our floor went off and I immediately called the Front Office to inform them and I was informed that they are investigating the cause of the alarm. We then decided to check out immediately and proceed to the airport. When we got off the elevator at the lobby, it was teeming with people who heeded the proper procedures in responding to such emergency situations. As the staff were busy attending to the concern, this did not prevent the staff from accompanying us with our luggage to the nearest taxi stand to catch a taxi to the Airport Express Train Station. Complimentary breakfast at the lobby was an added bonus that added to the pleasant stay we had. By the way, wi-fi was complimentary too in the apartment. We've been hooked on service apartments since we first tried them in Europe in 2008, and have decided that this will be our choice of accommodations whenever we can afford it. Our stay here was courtesy of my having submitted the winning bid at an online auction by Business Traveller-Asia Magazine last December. Having said all the positive things about my stay, let me relate an incident which could have ruined our stay altogether that I experienced 2 days prior to our arrival. I emailed them inquiring about which mode of transport is recommended to the apartments from the airport. A reply was promptly received, which was followed by another email informing me with regret that I could not be accommodated (despite a confirmation email I received back in May), because our stay was only for 3 nights!!! Apparently, the staff I was communicating with forgot that I was not subject to the 1 month minimum stay requirement of the property since I held a certificate by Business Traveller-Asia). While the complimentary hamper I talked about earlier was received with appreciation, I wonder if that was an effort to appease me since I emailed the concerned staff a strong message stating that if they insisted that they could not accommodate me for my 3-night's stay that the least they should do is to give me other accommodations at a similar property since I held a valid confirmation voucher for my stay. Having said all that, however, I would not hesitate to recommend Frasers to anyone needing a service apartment in Hong Kong for the facilities, service and perfect location in Wanchai, accessible to all modes of transportation.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australian", "Title": "\u201cNoisy and a little odd, there's much better in Hong Kong for the same price.\u201d", "Author": "disport", "ReviewID": "UR74233740", "Content": "I had a month at Fraser Suites this year. While working in Hong Kong. Firstly the good: The rooms are much larger than they look on the website. The reservations manger is very lovely. Bose IPOD doc is great. The kitchen is well equipped. Both a Marks & Spencer plus a Welcome mart nearby. Washer/dryer in kitchen (see below) lots of wardrobe space so you can up pack Trams are out the front as well as the MTR Good Gym Not so good. They have a policy of keeping your deposit for 30 days after you check out so if you stay a month you don't get your deposit back for 60 days and your credit card's refunded. Beware the FX rate can move a lot in 60 days. It also meant my company credit card was over it's limit. Big construction site nearby (just underway no sleeping in on Saturday). Pool is open weird hours. Very basic cable TV channels Taxi's cant pick up or drop off at the hotel. On arrival you have to drag your bags for 3 blocks. It also makes checking out interesting. Washer/dryer - the people above me put on their washing machine every night. I had to buy ear plugs because of the noise. The floors are floating floor boards, so you hear every step the people above make in shoes. McDonalds in the basement - a bit too handy. There's 4 rooms per floor, A,B,C & D. I had an A. C & D seem like the best. If your in an \"a\" room you have an office block a few metres away looking straight into your room and the \"B\" room looks straight in as well (building is \"t\" shaped.\") If you get a B or C which are smaller you have a little more privacy as the football field is across the road. If you like to have the curtains open at all make sure you don't get an \"A\" room. Compared to other serviced apartments in Hong Kong, many with harbour views, the Fraser Suits just don't represent good value for money. They're a little claustrophobic, even by Hong Kong Standards.
