{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't believe the negatives I can't believe the negative reviews here.I have stayed here many times over the past few years often for long periods and have always had a good time.The staff are very attentive and helpful. You should remember these are serviced apartments, not a hotel so don't expect hotel like arrangements. The apartments are all of a good size and a much better option than a hotel for a stay of more than a few days. But don't expect daily cleaning and changes to linen (they do it twice a week I think). However, if you have any ad-hoc requirements the staff are always there and very happy to help.Could not reccommend more highly", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR465100919", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "rjm456"}, {"Content": "fairly comfortable, spacious but can do with better service  i booked my wife, 2 daughters and myself into this property with a certain level of expectations having read previous reviews and our experience was plain at best. the place can be better kept and they need to have in place more english 'guide or instructions'. breakfast was in a rather cramp area and residents were tripping over each other and fb was edible. master bedroom was reasonably spacious at the expense of the other bedroom; sitting room was very BIG by local standards and kitchen is okay. noisy outside as it is next to a flyover but the corridor and heavy certain blocked out most of the sound. reception is too small even for the staff comfort. 7-11 near door is most convenient and a few eateries around especially a 24-hour sushi bar (affordable  rather tasty but selection limited). roppongi hills is a 5-7 minute walk away and you will pass the metro on your way there but have to pass by some touts and bouncers for the infamous bars in this area.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR653388833", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "khteo"}, {"Content": "if you space in central tokyo stay here Our second stay here and have got say that if you don't want to stay in a cupboard pretending to be a room, but not pay an absolute fortune this is a fantastic option for central Tokyo.This time we had a one bedroom apartment booked via a citibank visa offer. The bedroom is kind of long and narrow but has a great bed and plenty of storage.Personally I just like having proper living room, balcony, with a decent kitchette for the same price as a very averagely sized hotel room.Its not particularly plush but what you do get is space. A number of reviews have made mention of the noise - we felt the apartment was extremely well soundproofed especially the front facing bedroom - when one does consider the shear noise of the roads when you are stood outside the apartment.Admittedly we are used to city living in S'pore, but again you do have to expect some noise if you choose to stay in the centre of one of the busiest/most crowded cities on Earth.Service wise this place is great and the staff are really friendly and helpful. Putting luggage that has been in storage in your room before you check-in (we went to Takayama in the middle of our stay for a few days) beats any 5 star hotel I've ever stayed in.They also have an OK gym for a basic workout.For the price and location this place is really hard to beat.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR648752071", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "trixiebear"}, {"Content": "Not so hot I have to admit that the Somerset Roppongi looks nothing like the photos that you'll find online. The rooms are of fair size  have a kitchen. However, outside the hotel you can practically reach out and touch the major highway overpass that is passing right by the front windows of the hotel. And down below that is another loud surface road (Roppongi Dori). One other problem is that approximately 1 block uphill from the hotel are a ton of bars and strip clubs - people offering services and strip shows gets on the nerves after a while. The bars did not bother us. :) Once you tell them to stay away, things are fine. The staff at the hotel were VERY friendly and went out of their way to help but we also wanted to try another hotel halfway through the week (because of the noise, not the service) and we would have been charged for the entire week, so we stuck it out. The hotel rates seem pretty good - especially if you need a kitchen. If you simply want a room the major hotels seem not too much more expensive and are probably better on the noise issue.", "Date": "Mar 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR268741929", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BuddyB9999"}, {"Content": "Supreme Somerset Service We stayed at the Somerset Roppongi twice while we were in Tokyo in Aug-Sept, and were wowed. The biggest thing must be the fact that I had left behind a gold ring in our room and only realised this when it was far too late. I thought that it was likely lost for good, but had decided that I would email the hotel when I got back. The marvellous thing was when I logged on our email the hotel had already sent us an email telling us that they had found the ring!!! So we made arrangements for the ring to be returned to us and it's on it's way. I am beyond pleased!There were also a couple of other things that made us feel at home in a new country and a new city. We stayed a few nights at the hotel before popping over to other parts of japan for a couple of days, and then returned to Tokyo. When we got to the hotel, we asked for the luggage that we had left behind and were told, Oh, it's already in your room. It was just such a relief not having to lug our own luggage back to the room. Icing the cake, we got the same room that we had before, completing the homecoming feeling.Just one more thing about the service: we asked them to make a restaurant reservation for us for my birthday, and I received a little token and note congratulating me on my birthday. all in all, we had a wonderful time there. overall, the staff were helpful and unfailingly courteous from the duty manager, to the front office staff and even the housekeeping staff.As for the hotel itself, our room was fine and we had great view of the tokyo tower which looks lovely lit in the evening. somerset's quite well-located, being near a tube station and is a five minute walk from the heart of roppongi action, ten minutes to the glitzy roppongi hills and tokyo midtown. our taxi driver had some difficulty finding it when we got off the airport bus at ana intercontinental. it would have been easier if the hotel had a map of its location on its web site, the way it does on its card.Still, this was a minor glitch compared to everything else that we experienced.", "Date": "Sep 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR678934921", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "youarehere"}, {"Content": "Much better than I expected My family and I stayed there 4 nights (minimum stay was 6 nights in this apartment but fortunately it was promotion period that only required a minimum stay of 3 nights) during our stay in Tokyo on May 2007. It was a 2 bedroom apartment with spacious living room. The staff there were really very helpful and polite. Tokyo is famous for small hotel rooms but this apartment gave me a feeling at home. Though it was next to a flyover, I don't really feel much noise if the door was closed. As the room was equipped with kitchen, we cooked our dinner one night though there was plenty of choice of restaurants around this apartment.

The company had booked and payed for this place, but unfortunately I have only memory of this place as very loud and noisy at night with somewhat rude and cold staff members. This place is situated right next to a 4 lane highway that are stacked 4 fold (I don't know the exact name to call, but the car ways that are stacked at Roppongo Dori)., and you will find heavy motor bikers make noise throughout the night. Especially Friday and Saturday nights. I had inquired about this noise to the staff after the first night but they replied with only cold stares. It was a very bad first impression on Japan. ( My husband nonetheless slept without noticing much noise, so if you are not sensitive you may be all right)And for heating at night as it was in Dcember, the airconditioners also never worked properly, never giving out warm air. The one in the living room and in the bed room all togehter didn't work properly. I didn't dare to ask about this anymore after the cold look when I inquired about the noise. Once again my husband wasn't much cold, and it was much more with me who is more sensitive. I don't know how much the rate is since the company payed for this, but even if somebody else pays for me, I will bever return to that place again. We were very happy to find a place in Minatoku and to move out from that place.", "Date": "May 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR834518086", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "minmins"}, {"Content": "2 thumbs up!
