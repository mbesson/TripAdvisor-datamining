The breakfasts were lovely (and included), and the staff there was very nice. The only slight draw back for me was the location - it was very quiet (a plus) and it close to the Bastille metro (also good), and the area is well-regarded (near the opera house and Bastille monumnet). But because this is an area that draws more political activities, it tends to be a bit littered with trash, graffiti, etc. - it is sort of reminded me of the \"Berkeley\" of Paris - up scale but a a little rough around the edges. As a female traveling alone, this made it feel just a bit less safe - though I didn't have any specific threatening situations. But it's not quite the same as staying on a quaint Parisian street. All that said, I would definitely recommend the hotel - it was very nice.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice design hotel, average service\u201d", "Author": "IL0veNature", "ReviewID": "UR125658891", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel twice for business.

Staying there so often and for so long allowed me to experience almost every room and to meet everyone from the staff. STAFF The staff is absolutely friendly and speaks excellent English (except for an older lady, Chantelle - but she is nice, too). They knew me pretty well, always arranged my favourite room (407 or 408), made sure my toiletries (and any luggage I left behind for the weekend) are brought up to my room before my arrival. ROOMS The most basic rooms (I stayed in these most time, these are the ones with the aubergine, magenta, dark grey color scheme) are very small, but have everything a business traveler should wish for. Clean bathroom, bathrobes, huge towels. The bathroom was always spotless - and this is a must (and something that unfortunately cannot be taken for granted in Paris). The duvet was nice and warm, the bed really comfortable. In every once in a while I got an upgrade (the beige, bamboo green and paded pink color schemed rooms) which are somewhat larger than the basic rooms. These were very nice and comfortable, too. BREAKFAST The buffet breakfast is to die for - baguette, croissant, pain au chocolate - you name it, a decent variety of cheeses (try the goat cheese, the chevre), smoked salmon, ham, eggs and sausages (warm food), very posh youghurt in many flavours, fruits (oranges, grapefruits), fruit salad, and freshly pressed orange juice / grapefruit, too. The coffe (Caffee Richard) is excellent, too. INTERNET / ROOM LOCATION There is a wireless internet available for free - the reception is significantly better on the street side of the building. However, the drawback of the streetside is that the grabage truck / laundry trucks seems to show up at usually late at night. When the laundry truck is there, and there is a car behind (or maybe more waiting) they usually horn to express their disapproval of the unwanted wait. So if you are looking for a quiet stay, opt for the courtyard rooms - the higher the better so you will see a beautiful sunrise over the Paris rooftops and lot of chimneys. FITNESS I tried it once but the equipment (1 threadmill, 1 step machine) seemed to be horribly outdated. Definitely not worth bringing the gym stuff. However, several colleagues of mine (avid runners) made nice long runs along the nearby Viaduc des Arts (which is a Promenade plant\u00e9e on the top).", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "M H", "ReviewID": "UR119298296", "Content": "As a global traveler, this is one of the very worst hotels that I have ever stayed in.

Great service as well - very very friendly and personable. Price is very reasonable for what you get. I stayed in the purple urban room on the fourth floor, facing the inner courtyard. For some hotels only the upgraded rooms are nice but I thought this basic room was quite decent. The only reason not to give it a 5 star, on the balance of things, is the location. The hotel is a good 5 to 10 minutes walk from the Bastille metro (which becomes painful when your feet is hurting from walking all day), and there seem to be just not a lot going on around there. The closest super market is 10 minutes walk the other direction from the metro (closer to Gare de Lyon). There's not a lot of good bakeries / restaurants close by. And then, it's in Bastille which is kind of far from the center of action. May be everything feels just far because it's freezing cold in December...

When we came back from a restaurant at 1am and wanted a drink, the concierge opened the bar just for us. There are 3 types of rooms (Urban, which we stayed in, Ecolo - where the decoration has softer colour patterns, and Privilege - which is a larger Ecolo room).

The choice at breakfast was amazing, I did write down everything that was on offer but I had a whole page of notes, suffice it to say that there were cereals, fruit juice, breads, cheese, cold meat, cooked items, smoked salmon, scrambled egg, fresh and dried fruit, and fabulous coffee!! I know I will have missed something out, there was such a choice. Perhaps here I should deal with the criticisms of the hotel that I have seen on Tripadvisor so far. The walk from Gare de Lyon was a few minutes, not a problem at all and, as I'm sixty one this year, I reserve the right to be critical of that comment! Someone also said that the beds were small, well I'm a mere five feet ten and my partner is six feet five and the bed was big enough for us, as was the bedroom. I think there was also a criticism made about the hotel being too far away from everything but it was a short walk to the footbridge across the marina and then you are in the 4th!

For those who think Paris begins and ends in St Germain, think again--Le Marais, Oberkampf, Republique, Bastille--this is where truly trendy Paris lies. Our one, major complaint about this hotel was housekeeping. On Sunday morning, jetlagged and looking forward to the one morning of the week to get a bit of sleep, we were promptly awakened at 7:30 am by the cleaners, seemingly dropping every item of furniture in the room above us, then proceeding to go room-by-room very loudly moving everything around, vacuuming, etc loud enough to ensure we didn't get a shot at sleeping in. During the week this would not be an issue but on a Sunday morning seemed a bit excessive--and good hotels train their cleaners to do their jobs without sounding like a herd of elephants. Of course at 11:30 the noise stopped as they then no doubt broke for coffee/lunch/siesta, while we were groggy and grumpy and not about to fall back asleep. So if the hotel trained their cleaning staff better, I would be inclined to stay here again.

I therefore basically didn't plan the journey or have any say in the choice of hotel, room etc. The Hotel is very poorly located to the main tourist attractions in central Paris, lying about 750 metres South of the Bastille Square. This does mean it is in fairly quiet location but our trip also coincided with one of the very regular transport strikes in Paris so we had to wait nearly 90 minutes at Gare du Nord railway station for a taxi to the hotel which at about 4km is too far to walk. The buses were also impossible with baggage and completely collapsed, probably also due to the transport strike. Despite all these obstacles, I had a great time in Paris and I arrived at the hotel Marceaux de Bastille looking forward to a weekend break. The hotel is extremely new. I would guess no more than 12 months old. The reception area, which also doubles as a breakfast room is lined with modern art which is changed every 4 to 6 months and appears bright and attractive. The only seating in this area are low \"bedroom\" type chairs around small low circular tables. This area is also part of the breakfast room seating so if you coincide with a lot of guests on the same schedule, for example on a weekend you will amost inevitably be sat very low with your knees in front of you trying to eat breakfast. For young fit types this may be very cool but for your average chubby American tourist to Paris, this will be impossible to perform. To be fair, there are some \"normal\" height tables and also a large \"stool height\" table for 6 persons. The overall choice at breakfast is excellent (the croissants are to die for) and there is also a cheese trolley which is of a very high standard. The breakfast room opens onto a small glazed courtyard so it is a very pleasant room. I imagine that in good weather this becomes an open area which must be very nice indeed. However this area is the only PUBLIC area in the hotel. So no sofas, no lounge, no bar to sit in for a drink with friends. All this despite the very extensive ground floor floor space. It seems a bit nuts that you can only walk into reception and go to your room. The white minimalistic lobby is not softened at night with ambient lighting so although I guess you could order a drink you would not want to sit around in reception with friends. Onto the rooms, alas all is not well. Beautifully decorated, slim plasma tvs, safe, these rooms \"tick all the boxes\" except one SPACE. Our room was 107 however there was a fire exit plan to scale on the back of the door so on paper at least none of them are very big on the first floor at least. Putting it bluntly when in your room and not in bed, on the toilet or in the bath there is no space to do anything except stand. A space of around 40cm separates the bed from all the walls and furniture so, despite the pale and trendy decor there is NO ROOM to do anything except sleep. The hotel management were also very \"french\" when we raised these issues, NON I could not change room to a double bedroom, all were taken (this despite a 3 night stay), NON it was impossible to get the room tv to recieve the channels that were not in French (all non French channels were blacked out), they could of course leave a message for Mr Technician but this was not their fault etc etc. On our last day we ordered a taxi for 10am and this waited for ages in reception (which we assumed was normal given the strikes) only for one of us to walk outside to find that the taxi had arrived 10 minutes ago and was sat outside with the meter running (to the tune of 15 euros) which OUI I had to pay for. They did send two glasses of champagne up to the room on arrival which was a very nice touch. My partner used the fitness room which was also very limited in size and facilities consisting of one bike, one step machine and one bench. Period. Overall impressions STAY AWAY this hotel has nothing (except the croissants) to recommend it or make it unique or woth the visit. It's poorly located, not particularly well run and unfortunately the space and layout of the rooms make it a very bad value for money hotel. Our stay with breakfast was 600 euros for 3 nights so hardly a bargain either. If you a travelling to Paris and hear about a strike my recommendation would simply be to cancel and travel some other time. The city has far too few taxis and is too extensive to make walking a serious option over several days. From my trip, I would recommend chosing a hotel on the Rive Gauche, in the St Germain area where we eat, shopped and played for nearly the entire time. Given its distance from everything and the lack of restaurants in the same street (the nearest one is about 200 m away), its surprising that the management have not tried to increase food and beverage sales inside the hotel.

It did not disappoint at all. Here are some key points: \u2022 Very short walk to the Bastille metro station which connects to pretty much everything you'd probably like to visit within 1 connection if not directly. This exact area does not have a great deal of activity (which was actually really nice) but you are a short walk away from a lot. We never felt unsafe walking to our hotel at any hour of the day. \u2022 Interior decoration/design is very up to date/modern and what you'd expect with a boutique-style hotel. Our view wasn't much but rooftops, but we had a picturesque sunrise just about every morning. \u2022 This isn't the cheapest hotel, nor is it the most expensive. The lengthy research I did on hotels really led me to believe this was the one of the best values for the money. \u2022 Rooms are indeed very small (even smaller than I expected), although I read most all hotels are in Paris. We managed to work with the space given and the positives outweighed this negative. Bed/pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom seemed very new and functional. We had free internet wi-fi as well. \u2022 Service was great. Staff did speak enough english to help us out when needed and we very friendly. Chocolates were left every night on our bed. We regretfully did not use the dining area downstairs but it did seems nice. Other general notes about Paris: Check out the restaurant Tarmac which is right up the street from this hotel. This was the one of the best meals food-wise I had in Paris. As you'll probably read elsewhere, beware of pickpocketers. We saw a lady get her purse stolen at the Louvre. Stay away from the gypsies that ask if you speak english or the ones who act like they found you're ring on the ground (this was very creative though). These people tend to hang out at the touristy spots, the Eiffel Tower, bridges, etc. Weren't big fans of Versailles. Our expectations may have been too high. The place is indeed gourgeous, massive and amazing. The directional signage, the ticketing process, and the massive crowds really ruined this day trip. If I were to go again, I would just stick to the outdoor gardens (which were amazing) and not do the inside tours unless you are dying to see the hall of mirrors. If you are looking to save money here and there, be sure to shop the supermarkets. We bought some cheese and wine (which was great and very affordable), stopped and bought a baguette, and had a great afternoon snack. The lady at front desk of the hotel was very helpful and had the bottle of wine opened for us as well as giving us 2 wine glasses. Another day we stopped and bought orange juice and some chocolate pastries and sat on a bench in a garden for breakfast. You will spend a lot of money on meals on the trip so a few money-savers along the way can still be fun. Bring great walking shoes (but stylish of course) and a good pocket map. We did a lot of walking on this trip and saw so many cool things becuase of it. It is easy to get turned around in this city, but having the maps obviouslly helped out immensely.

Having done some careful research on the Internet, the hotel's web site, Google maps and satellite (you can make out the actual hotel and the courtyard referred to below), I thought the Marceau Bastille suited our specifications and booked, specifically requesting a quiet room. On arrival, we could not have been more pleased with our choice of hotel, or the room selected by the staff for our stay. Our room was at the rear of the hotel, high up and overlooking the enclosed but airy courtyard, and we could not hear any traffic or other noises to disturb our sleep, even with the windows open. The room also had effective air conditioning, if we needed to cool off after a hard day's sightseeing. We didn't even hear another guest's door shut until the 3rd night. The bathroom was spotless, and the bath/shower combination produced plenty of hot water. The cupboards, drawers and under the bed/desk were clean with no evidence of the lint or dust that seems to accumulate in other hotels we have stayed in. The staff were very helpful and pleasant, delivering a glass of Champagne to our room within 15 minutes of check-in and the inclusive breakfasts were fresh and varied, with little treats like strawberries and raspberries. The only critisism I could make is that the dining tables are too small, so the self-service buffet involved lots of to-and-froing to collect items and the careful arrangement of used crockery - rather like an in-flight meal - before being cleared away by the attentive waiter. I've had to stay in plenty of quality chain hotels during my business travels. The rooms in the Marceau Bastille are of a similar standard and price, if a little small, but the hotel comes without the impersonal service and bland decor. As other reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is not in some buzzing locality - it's in a district where real Parisians live and work. I kind of enjoyed the quiet walk from the Bastille, at the end of a long day hitting the tourist hot spots. It felt like coming home, stopping at the small grocery shops where we could stock up on a bottle of water or some fruit for less than a Euro. In summary, the hotel does exactly what it says on the tin, and very competently too. If you think every hotel in Paris has a view overlooking the Eiffel Tower, don't stay here. On the other hand, if you want something quiet, clean and refined, which is convenient for the tourist must-sees, but provides an oasis of calm, the Marceau Bastille is a good choice.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBest in the Bastille\u201d", "Author": "Design-Family", "ReviewID": "UR8181608", "Content": "We have been traveling to Paris frequently for the past fifteen years, as often as two or three times per year. For a long time we stayed at Hotel d'Aubusson (St. Germain) but it is often booked, and we are often looking for a great design hotel in Paris which is good value (ie. not necessarily cheap, but one that lives up to expectations). We tried to book the Marceau Bastille in February but it was sold out; luckily, we were able to snag an 'Urban' room at a great rate for this past weekend. The hotel is fantastic, and that is the first time I've been able to say that about a Paris property in some time. I would not say that this hotel is for those who are not accustomed to Paris or the whims of the hotels there. It is not in the more classic tourist locations (read: mass tourism). It is on a simple street in the Bastille, steps from a charming footbridge with direct access to the Marais. Like all Parisian hotels the rooms are compact, but thoughtfully laid out and oh-so-comfortable. The design is fantastic for those of us that appreciate modern design - if you are not a fan, you will characterize it as too stark (we loved it, along with the art in the gallery!). Some just prefer chintz and faux Parisian decor - tant pis, their loss. The staff is incredible professional and accommodating - this is a 'real' hotel with someone manning the desk, real air conditioning, flat screens, free wifi, a gorgeous bathroom, dead silent rooms, a small fitness center, etc. ... all in all, a place we will most definitely return to. The best feature - truly the most splendid breakfast I have ever seen in a Parisian hotel. The breakfast room is gorgeous, the service beyond reproach - and everything is completely fresh ... a large selection of artisinal cheeses, fresh fruits of every variety (peeled grapefruit segments?!!!!), yummy yogurts, breads, etc.. I never leave my room before breakfast in a French hotel (love that room service), but this was worth moving for!

I'd highly recommed the place to anyone (we booked with railbookers who were also polite, efficient and great value).", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cReally Nice place\u201d", "Author": "Kikouz", "ReviewID": "UR6647076", "Content": "I think almost everthing about this hotel had been said. It's true that it's a lovely, modern, clean and stylish hotel. What was not being said: - The breakfast is 20\u20ac pp - There is a gym center but with only three cardio machines and a flat screen. Very small thus. The personnal is very convenient. For instance, my bedroom was ok but the big bed was with actually two matteress putting together instead of one big one. I kindly asked if I can have another room and they quickly propose one to me. This second was even a bit bigger.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Juno82", "ReviewID": "UR6475453", "Content": "A great little hotel, friendly attentive staff, nice ambiance, close to loads of stuff and a couple of metro stations.
