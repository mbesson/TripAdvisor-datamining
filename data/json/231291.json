It's also a comfortable 20 min walk to the colosseum from which the rest of Rome is very accessible by walk or public transport. The rooms were adequate though nothing fancy. Very clean, and had a picturesque view of courtyards and small quiet streets. The toilets are quite small though manageable. The breakfast was quite adequate too though it would have been nice to have fresh fruits and better hot drinks. The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. They took an extra effort to recognise all thief guests and enquire about our day's plans. We even managed to learn quite a bit of Italian! We were also iffered a room upgrade on our last bight which we much appreciated. One of the issues I had was the price, though centrally located, I did feel the rates were a bit on the higher side.

It was about 5 mins walk to Cavour metro station and another 10 to the Roman forum or the Colliseum (we visited this on a stroll one night to see it illuminated and felt very safe doing so!). Down the hill to the left is the Monti/Via Panispera area which is crammed full of authentic little roman restaurants - we tried quite a few - our favourite being Restaurant Tema - but all the ones we tried were good so you won't go wrong. The room was great, kept very clean, with a big tv (didn't really use it but seemed to have loads of channels) a free safe - which we really appreciated - and free wifi - useful when you're planning where to eat each night! The bathroom was everything we needed and was sparkling clean each evening when we returned tired and a little jaded after another day's hectic sight seeing in Rome. All the front desk staff were really friendly and helpful - however special thanks go to Marco who helped us print off online tickets for the Vatican Museums and thus saved us about an hour and a half wait as we were able to dodge the world's longest queue!

I wrote a review for Hotel Sorrento City as well :) We returned to Rome for 4 nights for the 2nd leg of our trip and to celebrate the New Year! We are the type of travelers who like to stay in good locations, have good service, a clean place to stay, and most of all feel like we are getting a good value. The Verona Hotel delivered on all the criteria. We don't always stay at the four seasons, and we knew what we were getting with the affordable prices we were paying. Trust me, in researching, lodging in Rome was very expensive and over the New Year's holiday, prices were even higher. I would agree with most of the reviews on this forum. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller - but that's Europe! get over it. Most importantly, they were clean, and there were clean towels and an elevator to get up 4 floors with luggage! Breakfast was included and was very nice for a typical continental breakfast. We had a cappuccino every morning, with some toast, deli meats & cheeses, yogurt, and juices. It's in a good location. 10 minute walk from the Rome central station (Rome Termini) We were here for 4 nights, so we bought the Roma Pass which was great. For about 30 Euros, you had a metro pass for 3 days and skip the line benefits for at least two admissions. We used it at the colosseum. and we used the metro to get to Vatican City. Maurizio, at the front desk was espcially helpful. With our limited Italian, and his limited English, we were able to figure out a game plan for sight seeing.

I'd like to share our experiences and also help demystify/realize some of the things mentioned in this forum. We rode the trenitalia from Firenze and hopped off at the Roma Termini. The key thing to do is to exit RIGHT out of the station, walk past the taxi stands and walk straight down Via Cavour. You will pass by the Santa Maria Maggiore church and the hotel is right around the corner. If you walk out of the other side of the train station, it is VERY local and you face many run down buildings. That made us very nervous but once knowing the RIGHT side exit, we felt very safe. There is truth to the tiny bathroom and it is true that the entire bathroom is basically your shower. The shower curtain encloses probably an 18\" x 18\" area and the shower curtain sticks to your body because of the air flow between the bathroom fan and the rest of the room. I ended up having to leave the side of the curtain in front of the toilet open to have enough room to turn (I am 5'2\", 115 lbs) and so that the shower curtain is not clinging to my body (yuck!). This caused water to essentially get all over the toilet, but it will not flood the rest of the bathroom. Be sure to remove the toilet paper before you shower because using my method will for sure soak your toilet paper roll like a sponge. The breakfast was lovely....though I wish they had brand name nutella instead and I wish they had freshly ground cappucino instead. Still very filling breakfast. The great plus about this hotel is it's safe location. Safety and hotel cleanliness matter a lot to me on trips, and I was pleased with the hotel. A quick note to help you out on how to get to the hotel: The hotel is about 6 blocks down from the Roma Termini and in a very safe location. It only took us 10 minutes to walk to the colloseum. There is the via cavour rail station on the B Line, but if you want to go to the Spanish Steps area, that is on the A line, so it's actually easier to walk up to the Roma Termini and catch the train from there.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Alena37", "ReviewID": "UR122589971", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel Verona for four nights.

We didn't plan it this way, it just happened because we could only get certain limited times off work. Needless to say it was a crowded time to go, hotels were more expensive and there weren't too many rooms available. I was a little worried about this hotel since it was a little closer to the train station than I wanted (I think about 6 blocks) and many guidebooks I read said to avoid the area immediately around the train station because it's not as nice and has more crime. However the neighborhood with the hotel seemed fine to me. It's right around the corner from the Santa Maria Maggiaore church. There is quite a bit of traffic on the street going by there, but the hotel was about 1/3 a block in from this street and was far enough not to be excessively noisy even with the windows open. With the windows closed, the temperature could be adjusted to be good, also. The Colosseum was only about a 15 minute walk and other attractions were also walkable distances. The bedroom and bathroom were not fancy, but they were a clean and comfortable retreat when tired or after long days. I found all the staff at the front desk be be quite kind and helpful and they certainly spoke better English than I spoke Italian. I would certainly stay here again, especially considering that the price point was quite reasonable compared to some of the other hotels in Rome I looked at.

We booked it through Thomson. My Boyfriend is great at wanting to plan routes, so we got the train from airport to the termini station. This took about 30 mins and the walk from the station to the hotel no more than 10 mins. You want to head towards the Church Santa Maria Maggiore and its just off the back end of the square across the road. As we arrived the doors were being cleaned and it all looked very clean. The Front of House staff were polite and we were soon off to our room. to get to the lift, you need to walk up a couple of steps we were on the 5th floor the lift stops between floors so you still have to walk up a few steps when you get out of the lift. Not so good if you struggles with steps as they appeared to be quite steep. The room was larger than we were expecting and had a balcony. It was clean and actually much better than we thought it would be. However the only slight problem was our room was right next to the lift shaft so was quite noisy everytime the lift was used. This didn't really effect us as we were out all day and in very late at night when most of the residents had already come in and gone to bed. Breakfast, I really enjoyed it, lots of choice, very European with hams and cheeses, pastries and Yoguart. The breakfast waiting staff were not as friendly as the front of house staff. This didn't really bother us, just gave us something to smile about. Rome itself..... WOW beautiful and so much to see. The sites take longer than you would expect so give yourself plenty of time to enjoy them. Worth visiting is the Roman Forum which leads up into palatine hill. That has to be my favourite site there so far. we also went to the Palm Sunday Service at the Santa Maria Maggiore church. The inside of the church left me almost speachless, with thousands of questions about some of the art work. It was amazing and quite unexpected as I thought it would just be pretty outside but just a local church. Places to eat we did the normal Italian restrants which were lovely and we spent ages over food and really enjoyed it. One night we headed out to an Indian resturant called the Little India. It was quite a walk from the Hotel and parts of the road were dark in places, so we felt bit nervous at times. It might be worth taking a taxi there as the food is wonderful and you are not rushed at all and its the best traditional style Indian I have had outside of India.

We showed her our room as it was obvious somebody had been in... noting the perfectly made bed (with extra blanket), the new bin bag, clean towels and all of our things moved around but left very tidy. The woman then accepted that someone may have been in the room but could offer no explanation and instead insisted that it was impossible that 40 Euros had been stolen! The thing about weekend trips is that its easy to account for every Euro you spend. We did this and we are still 110% positive we left 200 Euro's in our room when we went exploring Rome's sights that morning... on our return there was only 160 left! 40 Euro's may not seem alot but when you have carefully budgeted for a weekend it does get noticed!!

The receptionist agreed to it. So we took the taxi to the hotel, and when we arrived and attempted to check-in, we were informed that our room wasn't available due to some electrical problems.

On top of it the receptionist gave us the wrong directions so we were walking around for half an hour, and eventually ended up in a tourist information booth. From them we got the right directions, and finally were able to make it to this so called 4 star hotel Genova situated on probably the noisiest street in Rome. (Later I did some price comparisons for room rates and found out that the room rate is lower at Genova so we're getting some of our money back.) Interestingly, my brother-in-law also booked a room at hotel Verona, but surprise-surprise his room wasn't available either and he ended up with us at hotel Genova. We think that they simply overbooked at Verona, and then had to shuffle people around.
