We rented two apartments (one two bedroom and another one bedroom) for our family stay. The woman who works at the front desk every morning is lovely and was so incredibly helpful. I wish I could remember her name. She helped us book the whirling dervish show and the bosphorus cruise. The kitchens were well stocked with supplies and the fridge even doubled as a mini bar. We had some maid service every day but sometimes the towels were not changed and even though the sheets are supposed to be changed every other day, it did not appear that way. (This is why I am giving the hotel 4 stars.) The fellow at the front desk in the evening was also helpful with our luggage too. They do allow smoking in some of the rooms so that smell to our dismay did linger in the hallways. If you are arriving by taxi, please note that your driver may find it difficult to find the hotel. All of our taxi drivers could never find it so we were usually dropped off near Istikal Cadesi and then walked to our place. If you are arriving for the first time, I recommend using their car service, even though it is pricey just so you aren't dropped off far away and have to pull your luggage to the hotel. But the hotel provides these nice map cards that we always carried to help explain to our taxi drivers where we lived.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cSo wonderful, we are already planning on returning to Galateia Residence!!\u201d", "Author": "NancyCNewYorkCity", "ReviewID": "UR127948410", "Content": "We (myself, husband and our 2 children ages 10 and 15 years old) just returned to New York City after staying 8 nights at Istanbul's wonderful Galateia Residence. We rented the 2 bedroom, 2 bath, 4th floor flat which had a great view of the Bosphorus from the master bedroom and ensuite bathroom. The flat was very roomy, clean and comfortable, and had a well equipped kitchen allowing us to eat breakfast in daily, (and prepare lunch or dinner had we wanted to.) After a marathon day of sightseeing, we were all so happy to return to our \"home\" at Galateia Residence every evening. The location of the flat was perfect for our needs. We took the tram most days to the sights in the Old City, but if one were super-motivated, you could walk down the hill and across the Galata bridge to many of the major sights (approx 60 minute walk to Hagia Sofia?). The hip, trendy Beyoglu neighborhood where the flat is located had so many fantastic restaurants (found through a terrific food guide titled: Istanbul Eats by Ansel Mullins and Yigal Schleifer which I highly suggest foodies pick up!!) that we ate out every meal with the exception of breakfast. What made the stay at Galateia extra special was the wonderful staff which included: Serhat, Cagri, Emel and Nurhan who were all incredibly accommodating and did everything that they could to make our stay more comfortable. They made restaurant reservations, booked taxis, helped us with public transport and gave us great leads to the lesser-known sights and sounds of Istanbul, and helped communicate special requests to housekeeping. They were all top-notch!

We stayed in two of Galateia's apartments during the two weeks we spent there during our visit to Istanbul. Both units were finished beautifully, with modern, fully stocked kitchens. The beds were exceptionally comfortable. They were quiet. The location was terrific: just steps from Istanbul's major entertainment boulevard -- -- Istiklal Avenue -- as well as a subway stop, and a funicular that takes you to other transportation links to major mosques and other tourist sites. Views from our top-floor apartment were wonderful. And best of all: the nightly price was no more than a conventional hotel.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ruffoli", "Title": "\u201cA spotless haven in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Ventolina", "ReviewID": "UR85192709", "Content": "After a terrible start in other accommodation, which we managed to flee after great difficulty, we were so grateful to find this refuge in Istanbul.

I would highly recommend the Galateia residence to anyone seeking a Sultanahmet alternative. Terrific location just off the Istiklal Caddesi....short walk to Tunel (this is important). Some flats offer Bosphorus views! Tip: bought the freshest fish under the Galata Bridge and prepared it in the apt.

Summary: LOCATION: Very convenient. Half block from Istikal where there are lots of shops and restaurants. Situated on a very quiet street. 5 min walk to Galata Tower. 2 min walk to the funicular. Overall excellent location. ROOMS: Very modern and comfortable. Our room had a large living room, dining area, kitchen (fully equipped), two bathrooms and one bedroom. There was also free WIFI in the room. The room was clean and of an excellent standard. The only small negative is that there were no small soaps/shampoos etc. Just a large wall dispenser by the sink and in the shower. STAFF: Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The front-desk personnel gave us excellent tips re: restaurants and made bookings for us. Being a smaller hotel, you could tell that they genuinely wanted to make our stay as comfortable as possible. OTHER NOTES: Taxi drivers seem to have a hard time finding the hotel despite its very central location. Make sure you have a good map with you to show the driver in case he gets lost. Alternatively, you can also get down at the funicular station (at the top) and walk approx. 200 meters to the hotel if you don't have much luggage. OVERALL: Excellent hotel and great stay. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Istanbul.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMuch needed bit of luxury and space...\u201d", "Author": "Elke1964", "ReviewID": "UR83927093", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel having lost our luggage and we were thrilled to find our apartment was so clean, spacious, light and luxurious.
