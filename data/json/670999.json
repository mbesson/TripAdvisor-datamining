We stayed for one month and Amertha Villas was definately top on our list for Best Hotel/Villa accomodations. Especially villa #3, which sits the closest to the beach.

The Villas are immaculate, the private pool wonderful, the food was excellent and a very good price We happened to be there on full moon so we were able to see the sun set and the moon rise from one of the temples. The staff were very friendly and the massage for $15 dollars was great. We also were able to see a Kris ceremony where people are said to be in a trance. ( Not a tourist staged event). The only thing I regret is not staying longer than 3 nights. I compared this lodging with Taman Sari which has the same owners and found Amertha to be much nicer and more private.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR658312885", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "utahlover"}, {"Content": "Great spot in Bali Our family with 2 kids aged 4 and 5 stayed 3 weeks in Bali and were we glad to have found this place! We found Southern Bali and Ubud extremely touristy, but we loved Pemuteran and the road through the mountains was breathtaking.We ended up staying 5 nights in a double bedroom villa with our own pool for USD 120 per night (including tax and high season surcharge). The private pool did not have a shallow end, so we spent a lot of time at the lovely large pool with a view at the sea so that our youngest (4) could swim safely. The villa was bright and very nicely decorated, the service and food were good. The beach (although not very large) was nice, the turtle hatchery next door an experience for the kids and the snorkelling right off the beach was great, as well as snorkelling near Menjangan Island.No hawkers on the beach and in the afternoon at high tide, the village kids came on the beach to play soccer etc.So reserve some time to go to North West Bali/Pemuteran the next time you are in Bali!", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR486483638", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cwolf22"}, {"Content": "Peaceful Haven AMERTHA BALI VILLAS in Pemuteran is THE place to experience the genuine friendliness of the beautiful Balinese people in a beautiful, tranquil Balinese location. The luxurious villas are set in open, spacious, landscaped gardens  provide an excellent place for a quiet, peaceful stay. Villa 1B would be 1st choice for our next visit. We highly recommend the efficiency  friendliness of staff - smiling faces greet you at every turn.The restaurant offers a very extensive menu with top quality meals at moderate prices. AMERTHA BALI VILLAS offer an experience you won't want to miss if you are looking for the beautiful, quiet side of Bali. To experience AMERTHA BALI VILLAS  its surrounding environment  community is well worth the 3-4 hrs drive over spectacular mountains  through picturesque villages.

So we had a great time while at the Taman Sari but it did have its quirks... I would kind of describe it as beach front camping in very luxurious villas... at a great price... the Amertha is in Pemuteran which is anything but what would be considered a touristy area.... that can be considered a good thing yes but consequently know that while you're here there are very limited restaurant alternatives. We walked down the beach a couple of times to try the sister Taman Sari's restaurant (breakfast and dinner) as it was recommended but found it wasn't much different. There was nothing wrong with the food at the Amertha but you could also say it wasn't anything memorable. Only one restaurant to choose from, very reasonably priced though. The villas are absolutely beautiful, we had a unit with its own pool which I spent the majority of my time in... loved it...The grounds are very peaceful and relaxing and even though the units are all connected by common walkways it still felt very private. I believe the units are just over a year old so everything has that new look to it. The arrival was a bit surprising, as we turned off the main road and came to park in an unpaved gravel/rock lot...someone then came out to meet us with a porter's wheelbarrow of sorts for the luggage. When we got to the room they let us in but we were unable to lock the main entry door. The staff spent about an hour trying to fix it and ultimately had to replace the lock set. There was a modern looking in-room safe but it had no directions for using it and the it was simply resting on a shelf uninstalled (I carried it in to the next room). The main wash area had a beautiful above counter sink that leaked all over the counter. The bathrooms all had open slat windows allowing bugs free passage and there were no ceilings in the villas rooms so at night we were eaten up pretty good... recommend brining good bug spray, we used the bug net every night and still any part of the body that was outside the sheets got bit. Probably had 4 or 5 bites a night. All in all we greatly enjoyed the stay here, just bring your bug repellent and some patience :)", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR689098500", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mikeinthe425"}, {"Content": "Paradise We stayed at Villa Shanti for three nights; Main highlights:Gorgeous property, landscaping, plunge pool, excellent bed (use the mosquito netting!!).  The unit we requested was already booked, so they upgraded us (no extra cost) to the 2 bedroom Shanti Villa, across a little road from the main Taman Sari property. There was still some construction going on next door, but our large yard had a high fence, which gave us plenty of privacy. For $130 per night, including breakfast! 90 minute massages for $45, fabulous. All the people on staff that we dealt with were lovely.We went with the dive shop boat snorkeling at Menjangan Is. two days in a row. Best snorkeling ever, and we've snorkeled alot. (Maldives are better, but not much says my husband)Food good, and you must try the local wine--they actually grow vinifera grapes in the area and the rose's not bad. Also plenty of Australian wine.Would go back in a heartbeat!!", "Date": "May 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR235196307", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "emmajane7"}, {"Content": "All we hoped for and more!
