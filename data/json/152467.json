The rate was to include breakfast, two welcome cocktails, and a bottle of tequila. The tequila never happened, and I had to argue with the frequently rude reception staff to get the welcome cocktails. This is what I call 'fraud' and I would warn prospective guests to triple-check everything with the property management prior to checking in. Based on my experience, it's obvious that the hotel is not compliant with the NH reservations network. Additionally, our reservation was for a queen-sized bed. But, after checking in and getting a single bed, I was told that 'standard rooms' have 'standard' beds. I insisted on a bigger bed, and was put into a different room on a nicer floor, though the bed was the exact same size. I then insisted on a room with two beds, and was accommodated only when I threatened to cancel the 2nd-6th nights of our stay. Management was nowhere to be seen, and the busy meeting/conference rooms on 1st and 2nd floor made using the elevators a miserable experience during the day. Get on the elevator in the lobby, stop at floor 1, and 15+ people cram on, to go the 2nd floor. They get off, and another 15 cram on, to go to the first floor, even though the elevator is going up, and so on. The beds were like rocks; I don't understand the concept of hard-as-rock beds. Why invest in beds at all, if they are as hard as the floor? The room was stylish, though the appointments were somewhat dated, and the bathroom tiny. The floor got soaked each time the shower was used, and housekeeping was stingy with towels, even though I requested a few extras due to the shower problem. The shower head was old, and the water pressure was ridiculously strong, wasting hundreds of gallons of water in this city where clean water is scarce. There was no clock in the room, nor on the t.v. The wakeup call one morning never happened. The lock box/safe was tiny. Apparently rooms on the upper floors of the hotel are udpated and cost more. We were originally put onto the 5th floor, which I would characterize as 'stanky' due to the ugly, old, and stained carpeting in the hallways and the room. When we were moved to the 6th floor, the room was much nicer just due to the hardwood floors. Breakfast was the best part of the stay. The restaurant was clean and well-appointed. There were little things like having skimmed milk on day 1, but not on any other day, that give me doubts about the quality of the management. One other example for this point: it's unacceptable to wait 10 minutes for a cup of coffee when there are roughly the same number of staff on the floor as there were seated customers. The food was OK, and thankfully the variety included European style sandwiches, pastries, and cheeses, which was good because the hot Mexican and American dishes weren't always hot. On one day, most of the yoghurt cups had serve-by dates printed on them that predated the current date.

Both keys were valid for just one night - so we had to get down to the reception again and re-valid our key after trying to open our doors the next day. NH hotel is perfectly located in the Zona Rosa. We disregarded the bad service and booked for one more night. To make sure that we could stay in our rooms we double checked with the reception the evening before our 3rd night should start and everything seemed fine. The next day we went again to the reception and there was Yan, a rude and unfriendly employe - not know how a hotel reception team member should behave and treat guests. She was so rude, told us that we would have to move rooms as she did not know and I told her that everything had been fixed the evening before. She continued to be rude, all of a sudden dealt with one of the bell boys, turned towards some other guests and did not care of us anymore - it was so embaressing.

The gym has a great view..and some cardio machines and dumbbells. Don't plan on doing a major work out, but you can pump up before the club or bar if you want. Lastly, do not call anyone's cell number from the room--the cost is astronomical. Even a Mexico City cellphone number is not considered a local call, so 30 minutes ended up costing $22.

I would have to say that the NH Mexico City is consistent with the chain and I would stay here again. If you're in a renovated room, you have access to the Club NH on the 14th floor, which was a very nice lounge with a beautiful view of downtown Mex City, flat screen TVs, and nice furnishings. They have an ok breakfast buffet here, but it's way overpriced, at 140 pesos plus obligatory tip bringing it to over US$15. The only other complaint I have, and it's actually one that might keep me from staying here -- the internet connection. They have WiFi access, but the connection itself was unreliable and even when it was working, the throughput for downloading files was unimpressive. I do a lot of moving of files and I could not successfully download a 100MB file on the connection because it was so slow, and it would cut out at times. To have paid more than $11/day for a connection so unreliable felt like highway robbery. Curiously though, they only billed me for two days when I used it for four days. PROS: --Good location --Reliable service --Stylish, clean accomodations --Larger rooms than other Mex City hotels CONS: --Overpriced breakfast (but you could eat in a restaurant nearby on the street for much less if you want). --Slow internet connection (also MXN120 per day). --Most confusing hotel invoice I've ever received...the numbers didn't add up, and there were confusing taxes all over it.", "Date": "October 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cThe Lobby is Deceiving\u201d", "Author": "airportsarefun", "ReviewID": "UR5592045", "Content": "I just got back from a four-night stay at NH Mexico City. The lobby looks newly redecorated and makes a decent first impression. However, once I stepped into the hallway of the 7th floor where my room was, I thought I was in a different hotel! An ugly and dated carpet lead the way to my equally dated and ugly room. The ceilings were low with several cracks. The beds were ultra firm (which I didn't mind) and the fixtures (light switches, bathroom mirror, etc) were crookedly attached to the walls. Overall the room (dingy and staid) was the complete opposite of the hotel lobby which exudes a modern and sleek feeling. I had gotten a great discount online and had read on this site to be aware that that this might afford me one of the pre-renovated rooms. I should have taken heed. I could have paid the extra $25US to upgrade to an \"executive\" room but wanted to deal as little as possible with the front desk. They were unhelpful and futzed up my reservation. I was locked out of my room the last night. When I got to the front desk I was told that I needed to present my room coupon by the same woman who checked me in and took my coupon. She said she never took it. Rather than argue, I went to the business center to print out the coupon again. The printer wouldn't print and the ladies at the business center had no clue why. I finally asked to use the computer they were using. Also, housekeeping had a tendency to knock as they opened the door to my room every morning at 8:30 AM. It served as great wake-up call but if you intend to sleep in be sure to put the \"No Molestar\" sign outside. My suggestion is: only stay at NH if you plan on getting an upgrade (although I haven't actually seen the upgraded rooms) and don't expect the best service. Otherwise, the location is central and enjoy the free internet stations in the very deceptively nice lobby.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roamin' The World", "Title": "\u201c!

Four hours later, we still had no power(most of the hotel had power) and had not been moved to the new room. Guadalupe (I didn't learn her last name) was quite surley and downright rude at the front desk when my wife attempted to procure an upgrade room with electricity. Within five and one half hours of our arrival to the hotel, we had a decent room. All of the doors are hollow. You can hear everything that goes on in the hall, doors to other rooms, etc. The beds were very nice and comfy. The upgraded room had a great bathroom. It is located in a great part of the city. We only had breakfast at the restaurant, but it was very good, at a good price(for a hotel). There are many great hotels in this area and at the price of a nights stay at the NH, it would be wise to pick another, nearby hotel.
