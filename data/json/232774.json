When I asked them to fix the air conditioning which I assumed was broken - I found out the air had not been turned on in the entire building...yet. And they couldn't turn it on, nor could they provide a fan. I was told it would get cooler at nighttime when I \"should\" be going to sleep. I was able to switch my room to the street side with windows that would open - but it was very noisy. AND - it was over 55% more expensive than the room that I originally booked. The staff is friendly and the bell boy was particularly helpful in moving my room for a second time.

I'm usually a chain hotel kind of person since I covet those hotel points :) For this trip of Barcelona, I decided to go smaller and found this place through Kayak. I made reservations directly on the hotel's website and the experience from that point on has been nothing but flawless! Days after my reservation, the manager contacted me via e-mail to welcome me (more than 40 days in advance of my visit). They contacted me again closer to the stay to ask about transportation from the airport. I had already made arrangements but was highly impressed by this attention to detail. Check-in was pleasant - everybody speaks fluent English!! They had my room ready at 10 AM which was a blessing since I could immediately go freshen up from the long flight and hit the streets for some sightseeing :) The room was on the smallish side but for a European hotel, it was generous. Bathroom was extremely spacious and well stocked with amenities. The room was beautifully appointed and the minibar well stocked. Prices for the minibar items were also very reasonable. Bed was very comfortable. I found it hard to figure out the ventilation and air conditioning because regardless of what I set the temperature at, the room always seemed a bit too warm for me. But I'd rather be a bit on the warmer side than being cold so no worries :) Great service too - housekeeping was not at all intrusive but did a thorough job. I did not have any meals at the restaurant so cannot rate the food or service there. Checkout was a breeze - the credit card machine was broken at checkout and I did not want to go get cash so they just had me sign a piece of paper authorizing a charge. So much trust!!

The nearest subway is Urquinaona or Catalunya, so really easy to get around. Buy a day ticket for Zone 1, more than 2 trips and you save money, although most of the time we walked around the city!!. Getting to and from the airport, we went for a taxi which cost 25 euro on Monday but beware the trip back on a Sunday afternoon cost 48 euro (different rate for weekend or was it a rip-off??). If you don't have much luggage the airport bus goes to/from Placa de Catalunya and cost a lot less! The street the hotel is in gets quite a bit of traffic but we had a room at the front on the second floor and were not bothered once by the noise. The room was excellent, a good size with a king-size bed with firm mattress, and generally well furnished. The bathroom was also a good size, good amenities and an excellent shower over the bath. Minibar was reasonable but the lack of tea and coffee making (like most Spanish hotels) facilities wasn't a problem as we had been forewarned by an earlier review and took a small heating element and a couple of mugs! The service from Reception was great - friendly, helpful and excellent English - very good from booking the open-top city tour bus (2 euro discount getting the ticket this way) to numerous restaurant reccommendations and help on the train timetable to Figueres to vist the Dali museum - a nice day trip, by the way. Can't comment on breakfast as we went out every day. A few places we ate which we would reccomend were; on the same street, Roger de Lluria 6 (towards Urquinaona) was Casa Alfonso (traditional), Restaurant Barceloneta down by the marina for great seafood, and a couple of tapas bars - Ciudad Condal (Rambla de Catalunya 18) and Costa Gallega (on Passeig de Gracia 71). A great place for coffee and croissant was two doors before the Casa Alfonso. If you see nothing else, visit the Sagrada Familia - it is simply extraordinary. Casa Batllo is a Gaudi classic, walk down Las Ramblas, visiting the Boqueria market on the right which is fascinating and El Born on the left including the Picasso museum. The Fundacio Joan Miro is also well worth a visit if you are into art.

Our trip was a mixture of conference tourism and family vacation (my wife, our 9 yr old daughter and myself). I choose the Hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and I think it was a good choice. We arrived before check-in time but there was a room available for us immediately. What is more, they upgraded us to a delux room which was a nice surprize. The receptionist were very frienly which is mostly nice except if you are waiting to checkin and the receptionist is chitchatting for 5 min with 2 ladys about their beach experience in Barcelona even after he explained in most detail how to get to new beaches. (By the way walk down to the sea and start walking in any direction. It is that easy). But the good point was that they were very friendly with us, too and our light anger evaporated after they decided to pay us a little attention and checked us in. The room was nice overlooking the street with 2 balconies. WiFi was free and fast! Our first experience with breakfast was weird. They ran out of everything and we had to wait 5-10 min to get things restocked. Restarant staff (one lady cleaning up the tables and one trying to restock the food.) was very slow and they both looked as if they lost at least 2 or 3 close family members on one day. Even though there were never more than 10 people in the small restaurant they could not cope with the easy task of refilling stuff so at least half of the things were constantly out of stock.. Interestingly this changed from the second day on: still few guests in the restaurants but the new staff (1-2 new waiters and 1 new lady restocking) managed to run things smoothly. I still find it quite puzzling why they serve coffee (and milk) in 2 small pitchers (not holding more than 1 liter) for the whole restaurant rather than 1 pitcher per table or at least a good size coffee container as in all other hotels. I did not like to reuse my fork and knife several times for salmon and salty things and sweet stuff but I had to as they never gave us new ones except for a spoon which we did not need. As for the food, it was a nice selection (even salmon!) and higher quality food than in the previous hotels we stayed in. One of the best things about the hotel was its location.

The rooms (1 double, 1 single) were large and well equipped, in fact the single was really a small double, beds were very comfortable. What stops me from giving it a solid four star rating is a few niggles. The bar is devoid of any character and not somewhere you will want to linger over a pre or post dinner drink. The bar is mainly used as an area to access the hotel's free wi-fi which only covers the immediate bar area, so no access in hotel rooms. The bathrooms had the odd stray hair in them on arrival but housekeeping was exemplary from then on. One room was on the fifth floor next to housekeeping and below the terrace and occasionally very loud crashes would be heard as staff (or elephants) went about their business.

This hotel stay came after we traveled to Paris, Venice, Florence and Rome as we enjoyed a once-in-a-life vacation throughout our favorite cities in Europe. At each of these tourist cities, we stayed at hotels that were equally priced in similar touristy areas to Hotel Roger de Lluria. By far, the hotel staff and the accommodations at Hotel de Lluria were FAR SUPERIOR! We were pleasantly greeted by a front-desk staff member named Cristina that turned out to be absolutely INCREDIBLE! She greeted us with a welcoming smile and was able to check us in early on both occasions (before and after our cruise). This VIP level treatment never happened at any other hotel we stayed at all throughout Europe. After settling into our spacious room, she spent at least 45 minutes with us explaining the best sights to see in Barcelona and the best restaurants to visit. Her advice proved to be right on! My wife and I saw some of the most incredible sites and ate some of the most amazing food during our short stay in Barcelona, thanks to Cristina. If we ever make it back to Barcelona, my wife and I will definitely stay at this hotel again. It is so centrally located to the sites of Barcelona and the staff is incomparable.

The hotel fully lived up to its reputation--rooms were bright and clean, the beds firm and very comfortable, the bathroom spotless, and, important for light sleepers like me, very little noise from outside. What I will remember most about the Roger De LLuria is the staff, which was cheerful, always helpful in responding to questions in English or patiently tolerating our faltering Spanish, and totally professional. When you encounter staff people like these, you always assume that the person at the top must be making some good management choices. Except for a few cab rides back to the hotel when we had walked long distances and were tired, we went everywhere on foot, to the nearby Ramblas, the Placa de Cataluyna, the Picasso Museum, Sagrada Familia Cathedral, the beaches and seafood restaurants, and many others. Nothing beats this location. My only suggestion would be to lower the price of breakfast in the hotel, perhaps by incorporating some of the cost in the room rate or just simplifying the menu--salmon and cheeses, fruits and pastries of every description are wonderful, and I confess that the breakfast was excellent--but I think most guests would prefer something less grand for a better price--say, 10 euros rather than 20 euros each. Forty euros for the both of us (around $57) is a bit excessive, especially since one can find excellent fare in the cafes up and down the street for just a few euros. But if you are like us, to get our day going, when we are still half asleep, we like to have breakfast in the hotel where we are staying, and there were a couple of days when there was rain in the morning, and going outside was inconvenient. At the very least, how about a coffee bar in the lobby with orange juice and croissants at a cheaper price? Despite this single criticism, our overall experience at the Roger De LLuria was delightful, and we will stay there on our next visit, which I hope is soon.

Location was great, 8-10mins walk to Pl Catalunya. We had a Family Room for my family of four and a Double for my parents-in-law. The family room is situated at the back of the hotel and is quieter than the double room. Not much of a view, though, compared to the double room where it faces the main street. Both rooms were spacious and clean. What is outstanding about this small hotel was the people. Almost everyone was friendly and helpful. Prior to our trip, I had written several emails regarding a problem with booking for the last night, airport & pier transfers, etc and their response came swiftly. This good impression was further confirmed when we arrived at the hotel. We were greeted warmly and given a room immediately upon arrival. We were grateful for that as my in-laws (73 & 81 years old) were tired out after a long flight of 14 hrs. Cristina was probably one of the best receptionist I had ever come across in my years of travel. She is friendly, efficient, effective & most importantly, patient. She rightfully advised us that it was better to arrange for transfer from pier to hotel as we had a party of 6 + lots of luggage. We would have needed 2 taxis and there won't be much of a difference in terms of cost. Even tho I was undecided due to costs & timing, she was patient to let me sort out my thoughts and did not add any pressure on me to make a quick decision. She assured me that if the time arranged with her was not right, I could always call her or send her an email to change it. I was glad I took her advice to take the arranged transfer as the queue at the pier for taxis was really long and chaotic. I can't imagine going through the stress of trying to get transport to the hotel with my in-laws, 2 children, husband & many pieces of luggage. Didn't try the hotel's breakfast as I had read from the reviews that it's not worth it. There is the famous Bracafe nearby and they serve decent coffee & sandwiches. Two supermarkets are located one on the right & the other on the left, approx 5 mins walk. The one on the right is bigger & the fruits seemed fresher. Went there to stock up on water & snacks. One thing lacking in the hotel is that there was no boiler to make our own coffee/tea. I asked about it at the reception and was offered a flask of hot water instead. Toiletries were given but there were only a couple of pieces of tissue cramped in a tiny box. Had to go over to the supermarket to buy 2 boxes of tissues.

Clean, classy decoration, nice bath! 2) Great service. The desk staff cannot be nicer... So helpful with directions, restaurant recommendations, early check in if available. They are so very personable. 3) Breakfast. Nice if you get the breakfast included in the hotel rate - very good selection of hot and cold foods in a large beautiful salon! And, great coffee! 4) Location, location, location! 10 min walk to Ramblas. Also, hotel is just a few mins to Gaudi house (a must see!) and in that area are many, many great restaurants. I'd recommend Citrus - on 2nd floor, overlooking main street, very nice, classy, great food selection, and reasonably priced too!

We were able to move immediately into the new, much quieter and bigger room and incurred no extra charges. There were only two \"issues\" with the hotel. First, the maid service wasn't as good as it could be but it wasn't terrible (sometimes the sink was cleaned and sometimes it wasn't - that kind of thing). When we told Christina she went into problem-solving mode, immediately called the housekeeping manager and the service improved. Secondly, the buffet breakfast was an additional 20 Euros per person. We don't eat that much and didn't want to spend that much so were directed to a nearby \"BraCafe\". It was ok but we would have preferred to eat at the hotel.

As we were checking in on the first day, her bag was stolen from the lobby. The hotel said they were not responsible for the loss, since the bag wasn't stolen from our room. (We spent our first day going to 2 police stations to fill out forms, and then my friend had to replace all of her clothes, shoes, suitcase, etc.) We thought the staff would at least be honest and pleasant to us, and sorry for the loss, but they were not. They lied about a tour we had signed up for, annoyed that we hadn't booked it through them, and said the tickets hadn't arrived, when the agency said they had faxed them to the hotel. They also said the agency didn't open til 10:00 (the tour was for 8:00), but we called and found that they were open earlier). They wouldn't help with adaptors and converters to recharge my camera, said I should go to a department store to buy whatever I needed. But the worst of all was that they gave away our prepaid rooms for the last 2 nights. After driving around for a week in between, we ended up back in Barcelona with no rooms! Since we had already paid, they offered to find us rooms at another hotel, and we spent 2 hours waiting in the lobby while they called around (looking for rooms that were less expensive than what we had already paid). They lied about a suite that supposedly had 2 bedrooms, but in fact, when we went to see it, not believing anything they said, we found it was one bedroom with one bed, and then finally they found 2 rooms of lower quality than what we had paid for. All in all, this was the worst hotel experience of my life, and I would certainly want to warn anyone considering it!!", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islamorada", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "keysday", "ReviewID": "UR84618168", "Content": "Everything was wonderful.

We really enjoyed soaking in the jacuzzi tub. Entire room spotless. Very large sitting room, separate from bedroom, would be nice for entertaining or socializing. Whole suite had unexpectedly high ceilings and lovely tin ceiling in sitting room. The only negatives: sofa in sitting room not particularly comfortable; wi-fi is extremely slow, to the point that it really didn't work unless you got lucky. If you are trying to do actual work during your stay, make other arrangements for Internet access. There is some hallway noise that drifts through the walls but about what I'd expect in an older building. Staff was remarkable. Extremely helpful. I felt that they really, truly wanted to be helpful and accomodating. They speak about a dozen languages each. No matter where you are from, there will be someone here to help you in your native language (which makes it harder for me to practice my Spanish!). Very accomodating of our request for early check-in as our flight from the States landed at 8am and we needed a shower and nap. I did find it just a wee bit expensive even by European standards but I think that's more a reflection on how expensive some things in Barcelona are, and nothing unique to the hotel. Breakfast: having seen several negative comments about the breakfast, I would like to say that this is not a Holiday Inn in America. You will not get pancakes and hash browns as part of their morning buffet. There is, however, a very nice spread of high-quality Spanish hams and salames, nice cheeses, pastries and a small tray of eggs. I found the breakfast to be quite lovely both in terms of variety and of quality. Location: outstanding. On a more quiet block that's within a 5-minute walk to the Placa Cataluna; subway stop right out front; easy access to taxi's; many choices for dining within a block or two; the neighborhood does close down on Sundays so you may have to walk a little further but we managed to find several good choices for dinner within about 4 blocks on a Sunday night.

If one wants a change from Tapas try the Japanese restaurant about 5-10 walk to the right of hotel on Roger de Lluria- fantastic buffet lunch for Eur8.50 - eat all you can and you can even select fresh meats or seafood and the chef will BBQ them for you.

Being nicely tucked away in a quite section of Roger de Lluria Street, this hotel sufficiently solves the problem. We found our room with a king bed to be clean and nicely appointed though the ornate wall paneling with gold accent to be somewhat dated. Concierge is knowledgeable and eager to please. Throughout our stay we never felt that we are just customers using the hotel to spend the nights, rather we felt as though we were being looked after by a caring host. On this trip we stayed in five different cities in Europe, and along with Hamburg Four Seasons, the service here was truly outstanding.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cVisiting the land of Gaudi was charming...\u201d", "Author": "SparkDelhi", "ReviewID": "UR28601816", "Content": "The Ritz Barcelona is located close to the middle of the city with convenient access to shopping areas, sightseeing places like the sagrada familia, Gaudi's restaurant and the Plaza de catalunya.

Room service lacked basic foodstuffs, like bread and ham. We found a dirty condom under the bed, left by a previous occupant, which we discovered while looking for our 3 year old's shoe. Management offered to send a maid to clean the room again, nothing else. Nice bathroom, decent size TV, cute little terrace. Pretty small room. Very thin walls. Good amenities, plenty of towels. Terrible, super-hard mattresses. One of the least comfortable nights I have ever spent anywhere -- and I slept in Grand Central Station once in the 80s.
