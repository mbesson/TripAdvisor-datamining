Compared to other places we've stayed in/near Branson, this place is definitely the best for pet-friendly hotels. Plus, they don't charge an extra fee for pets (at least that I saw...other reviewers are mentioning a pet fee). I did note that we had two dogs on my reservation. My only complaint is that we had a non-smoking room but it was most definitely a smoking room at some point. I got use to it, my husband wanted to complain. But the room was clean and I especially liked how the underside of the beds were blocked off so we didn't have to worry about what our dogs would find under there. There isn't a lot of grass but I don't expect them to cater to that aspect. I was glad they put us on the first floor with quick access to the door to minimize disruption to other guests.

GOOD POINTS: Back in March when I called to make reservations Ed was very helpful. He told me to make reservations on line in order to get a great price (and it was!!). The hotel is pet friendly with a king size bed. Most pet friendly hotels only give you queen (or double) beds. There was no nightly pet charge (but you have to keep your dog crated when you leave the room, which we do anyway). We did learn they now have instituted a $10.00 per night pet fee. The staff is super friendly and will help any way they can. The shower was large with great water pressure and the water temperature was constant - not hot one minute then cold the next. Our room only had a shower, no tub. We called a few days before our arrival and asked for a refrigerator (for our dog's medication). It was in our room when we arrived. The bed was comfy. We had no problems getting on the Wi-Fi in our room using our Nook Tablet. We have never stayed in a room where the A/C was so quiet. You hardly knew it was running, and it kept the room super cool. We also found the location to be great. NOT SO GOOD POINTS: Although the room was clean it could use some updating; too many different patterns on the carpet, drapes, bedspread and mismatched colors. The room carpeting had several stains on it as did the hallway carpeting. The pet rooms are in the back of the hotel; there is no security door to allow only hotel guests in (by using their room key to access the door). Pets are not allowed to come in through the hotel lobby. Although the free breakfast was good, providing some type of fresh fruit (oranges, apples, bananas) would have been nice.

Some of those clunkers have been Knights Inns, so when I saw the low price and the amenities of Knights Inn at Thousand Hills in Branson, MO during my motel search for a 5000 mile trip just completed, I was a bit skeptical. After all, you know what they say about things that sound too good to be true. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised. The room was very clean with all the amenities as advertised and the host and hostess were some of the most freindly and hospitable people we've ever met behind a motel desk. They definitely showed personal interest in those who enter their doors. They had me scheduled on the main floor, but were happy to accomodate my request for top floor in a quiet section. (The room was quiet) I suppose that this review might be suspect if I didn't find something wrong with a $45 room (including tax) in a motel in Branson that includes a hot breakfast and has an elevator, so this is it...the rooms are a bit on the small side. However there was enough room for our purposes...sleeping, and I admit we were a bit spoiled since we had just come from a place that had given us a free upgrade to a room that could have held another king sized bed, another table and still had room to spare. Everything in the motel looked new or freshly remodeled, and there were no irritating smells like those that permeate many lower priced national chain motels. Having spent a lot of nights in motels, one thing we find annoying is when the bed has a lamp and/or night stand only on one side because my wife and I both like to read in bed and have a place to put our glasses (reading and water) when we turn the lights out. Many times I've had to take a drawer out of dresser as a make shift night stand, and or move a floor or table lamp. Here, we had none of those problems.

The owners (Mrs. Becky) and all of the staff were so sweet, most sincere, and very hospitable. She even gave me a big hug upon my departure. It definately beats the high end hotels. They asked repeated if I needed anything, and cordially greeted me (with a big smile) each time they saw me within the hotel. I felt like family staying here!!!! It was quite pleasant. The breakfast was great too, in a quaint country setting. Also, this hotel takes pride in honoring our Veterans, from all of the memorabilia displayed. The location of the hotel can't be beat. It is so close to every attraction and restaurants. And the hotel rate was unbeatable. I feel like we received so much more in value, with all of the \"southern hospitality\" a guest could want! I even witnessed a guest requesting his shirt be dried in the dryer, and Mrs. Becky, without hesitation, immediately took care of the guest's request (w/ a smile). WoW!

Upon learning that her medication had to be refrigerated the owners immediately put a mini fridge in our room at no charge. The night we arrived, despite being tired ,we stayed up til 3 am talking with the night manager who was a very sweet woman and we now count them all as friends. The hotel is well kept and for the price is the best you will find. If we ever find ourselves back in Branson we will be staying with our friends at the Knights Inn.

Before booking I read reviews on TripAdvisor as well as a few other sights and overall the reviews were very favorable. The hotel is an older hotel and the room was fairly small; however, the hotel was extremely clean and provided everything we needed for our 2 night stay. The bed, while not the best, was okay. I will say this was the first time I had ever stayed in a hotel that had pink sheets on the bed. The bathroom was shower only but it was a very, very large shower that extended out into the curved wall area within the room. The shower doors can be tricky to open as you may need to lift up a little bit to get it open.
