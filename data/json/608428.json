{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A bit too noisy for me I was surprised to read the comments from the previous reviewer. Maybe I just had a dud room etc. but I didnt think much of the place at all. Maybe if you made sure you got a good room then the experience might be different.It is set in nice grounds and it does look appealing from the outside but I thought the room very ordinary and ho hum and the room service menu was not very inspiring with very ordinary food.The thing for me was the exterior noise. It was unbearable - so much so that I had to pop my head out the door at laeast once to ask people to keep the noise down [it was 3am after all].There was a nice balcony area but mine only overlooked the bar/restaurant and I got a lot of noise from that too until that area closed. So all in all I didnt get much sleep.The other thing I didnt like was that there didnt appear to be any lifts - I mean there may be lifts in some other parts of the building, but not where I was. So if you are thinking of staying here and have special needs I would check that out first. I was on crutches so it was not very pleasant struggling up stairs with bags and I got no assistance from the staff at all.I only stayed here because the Crowne Plaza was full and I dont honestly think I would stay here again.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR994880562", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BrisCaz"}, {"Content": "Wonderful service.
