We were very lucky as we arrived in Paris to sold out hotels, were suggested we go see Moun, the daytime concierge at this hotel. She is legendary for her helpfulness. She gave her last room, 44, which was very clean and comfortable, with a huge modern bathroom. We slept very well. The next morning at check-out we were stressed about where we'd sleep our second night in Paris and Moun told us to leave our luggage with her, go see the sites and come back, she'd sort it out. And she did, we came back to find a set of keys to a private condo we could rent for the night, just 3 doors down the street!I What a fabulous time we had.

This cozy hotel is within a short walking distance of the Paris Metro, which could be an important factor for many tourists.

The staff were friendly and helpful with directions and tips for getting around Paris (and to the airport). The hotel also has air conditioners, which is a nice feature attractive to many Americans, including myself. The weather was nice, though, and I only used the A/C for a few minutes each day, if at all. Breakfast is not included but was offered at 12 Euro daily. Consequently, the hotel rate is probably lower than if breakfast were included. This offers the traveler the option not to have to pay for something he/she does not need. For whatever it is worth, rue Sainte Anne has an enclave of about 20-25 Japanese restaurants, most of which had lines out the door at dinner time. Who knew the French loved Japanese food so much? Other cuisines are close by as well. In summary, I found this hotel to be clean, charming and cozy. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the rates were competitive and reasonable.

As it is an \"attic\" type room the single is on a raised platform. Bit hard to describe, but it is not a problem for a young person. Might be a little awkward for older people though, so if you need to book a triple room its worth checking with them. Room had a tiny balcony where you can sit & enjoy the view of Sacre Coeur while you have a wine. Room was actually a good size for Paris and was impeccably clean. Had small bar fridge which is great to keep your drinks & a few picnic items in. Would have been good to have a small electric jug so we could make a tea/coffee, but that was only a minor thing. Good TV & air con. Comfortalble beds. The bathroom was modern & clean with bath/shower. Breakfast is in a lovely cellar & is really good. The location is amazing! Half way between the Louvre & the Opera. Close to all public transport & for first time tourists like us the Tourist Bus was a good way of getting our bearings, & only 2 blocks walk. If you get the Roissybus from the airport it drops you at the Opera & it is only a few block to the hotel. Make sure you have studied the map & you shouldn't have any problems. Best thing about this hotel though is the staff. They are its greatest asset, & seem to make a real effort with everyone.

The hotel wireless internet ran fast and we never had a problem. The hotel was quiet at night and the other guests were friendly. We did not partake in the breakfast at the hotel, so we do not have any review on that. A couple tips: -If you need a 'firm' pillow, either ask for two or bring your own. The pillows are very soft (which my husband liked, I just used two!) -As far as amenities in the bathroom, there is only a 'shampoo/body wash' gel, which is nice for washing your body, but if you are looking for a little 'more' in haircare, bring your own conditioner/shampoo. -There was no clock in our bedroom, so either bring your own clock or just set up wakeup calls with the front desk ***You MUST try these restaurants which are a short walk from the hotel... 1.)

It is easier to get a bottle of sake in the most nearby shops than a bottle of French wine. Back to the hotel. The first thing to point out is that the service is exceptional. My girlfriend and I asked if the receptionist knew any good places to eat in Montmartre, which is fairly long distance from the hotel, and we also asked if she could make us a reservation for at nine. A bit later the receptionist had found and called two alternative restaurants, and then she made the booking for us at Chamarr\u00e9 (excellent place, you should try it). Moreover, after somewhat of a journey in the nearby area, we finally brought home a bottle of champagne to celebrate with in our room before dinner. At this point, the same friendly receptionist was most helpful with getting us correct glasses and a bucket with ice for the bottle. Most satisfying! The rom: Nice, clean, tidy and with a charming French style. However, our room was on the small side. There was not much floor space other than for the bed.

But recently I found myself in need of a room for one night in Paris and wanted to stay close to the hotel I would be moving to for the rest of my trip. So after reading the glowing reviews of the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne I decided to try it and I am very happy I did. My comments and ratings of this property are based upon it as a 3 star hotel, and the expectations that go along with such a property. Hotel star ratings are based upon the services the hotel provides, but not the quality of such services. This is especially important to understand and consider in a city like Paris where an enormous premium is based upon location, size and service. The hotel is located on Rue Sainte Anne which I found safe and well lit, and a short 5 minute walk to either the Louvre or Opera. The area the hotel is in is noted for its Japanese and Asian restaurants (with the Japanese restaurant across the road being extremely popular). There are also several other places to eat, drink and shop located just a minutes walk north off of Rue Sainte Anne on Rue des Petits Champs. My room was located on the ground floor (windows facing the side street off of Rue Sainte Anne). During the day and early evening the noise from the street was a bit loud with the window open, but virtually disappeared with the window closed. The noise died down substantially later at night, but if noise is an issue for you and you prefer the windows in your room open I would suggest a room on a higher floor. The bed was a queen size and extremely comfortable. I am very tall (6 feet 4 inches) and have had back surgery twice and found both the size and comfort of the bed excellent. Although the room was not large it was big enough for me to comfortably move around the bedroom and the bathroom (and this is saying something in Paris!). The furnishings of the room were adequate and charming, and in great condition and well maintained. There was plenty of room for my luggage and a small armoire with a safe that worked. The linens were fresh and clean with plenty of pillows. A small flat screen TV was provided that had several English and French stations. The bathroom was a extremely clean and quite large by Paris standards (I believe I was in a room designed for a disabled person) with a European style shower. Towels were average but functional and the room was well lit. The front desk staff both day and night were extremely helpful, pleasant, and spoke excellent English. Edyto during the day was exceptionally kind and attentive. Wireless internet service was provided (free of charge) and worked very well. I had breakfast in the small but charming breakfast room in the basement which was simple but an excellent value at 12 euro. There was a small selection of cold cereals, meats, cheese, croissants, fruit, yogurts, etc, as well as warm sausages, bacon and potatoes. Also there was a woman who served coffee, tea, chocolate, and cooked eggs (although I am not sure if she prepared anything like pancakes or waffles). The food was good by Parisian standards and an excellent price. Overall the room and hotel were extremely comfortable, clean, and well maintained. This isn't the Ritz or the Hotel George V (I have stayed at both), but for this part of Paris at these prices I cannot imagine you will find a better value. For what its worth after my one night stay at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne I moved to the Le Grand Hotel Intercontinental across from the Opera for several nights. My 'Superior Room' rate was 750 euro a night (I used hotel points) and plenty of people were paying it. Although I think its unfair to attempt to compare the two properties, what I will tell you is that I will definitely return to the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne, as well as recommend it to my friends and family.

If going to Paris it is important to understand that in the central historic areas you just don't find big high rise international hotels. The vast majority are small street front boutique style 3 or 4 star hotels. Rooms are 'compact' but adequate in this hotel just as in all others. If you do manage to find a big suite style room you'll pay a small fortune for it. At 165 Euros per night for a 'superior double' with balcony on an upper floor this hotel represents excellent value for money in Paris. You can easily pay a lot more - sometimes for less in terms of quality. The only reason I don't give this five stars is because the decor in this popular gem is becoming slightly tired. Don't get me wrong - the room decor adequate and the standard of cleanliness is excellent but it's time for a bit of light re-decorating. A spot of paint here and there, some fresh wallpaper and revamped flooring and this place just couldn't be beaten at the price. My comments above on decor don't apply to bathrooms which are in pristine condition. Staff - all of them were wonderful. I endorse all previous comments made about their helpfulness and attention to detail. Location is simply superb for sightseeing on foot. 10 mins walking time to The Louvre and 10 - 20 mins for many other famous landmarks. For the really adventurous walker - The Eiffel Tower is about 45 mins away with a return walk via Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees taking another 1 hour. If you get hung up on small details having to add up to perfection then hotels in central Paris aren't going to be for you. If however you can be happy with charming plus very good standards rather than perfect then this hotel is for you. I will definitely go back if visiting Paris in the future.

It was an exceptional stay and met all of our expectations. We booked online at the hotel's website and paid E145 per night. It was our first trip to Paris and this hotel was a perfect choice. The hotel is centrally located in 1ER - one block off Ave. de l'Opera on a quiet street. It is a 5-10 minute walk to the Metro (either the Pyramides or Palais Royal stations). It is a 10-15 minute walk to The Louvre, Tuileries, and Seine. There are many nearby restaurant options (most near Louvre or Opera), a post office, internet cafe, and Monoprix store (Parisian version of a Super Target - including food and wine). After our long flights and the train/metro trip into Central Paris, we were warmly welcomed at Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne. Our reservation was in order and while our room was not ready (we arrived at the hotel about 11AM and didn't expect the room to be ready), we were able to freshen up in an empty guest room off the lobby and leave our luggage before setting out to explore the city. The reception staff was extremely helpful, notably Muan and Edyta. We were given advice on the Metro, attractions, coupons, and general information about the city. The staff spoke English well yet also helped us to learn more French! After our return, we checked into Room 304. The elevator is small, but can easily fit two - although it's tight with luggage! The room met our expectations and matched the description on the website. Our room matched Photo #3 - Twin. The room is tight, but we expected that. The room was clean and had a charming French window overlooking the street. The room included a TV, phone, and safe (which we didn't use). The bathroom was bigger than expected and nicely tiled. The shower/tub was fine, although did not include a shower curtain and made for a challenge to keep the floor dry. There was a glass divider between the shower and sink which generally worked fine to keep the water in. The room did smell of cigarette smoke, but again we accepted this and it quickly became an afterthought. The beds were quite comfortable and the room was quiet (from both the hallway and street). The room was cleaned daily. My only two suggestions for improvement might be lighting in the hallways and key access at the main entrance. The hallways were very dark (although it really didn't matter that much since our door was right next to the elevator). If we were out later, the front door is locked and you must use a buzzer to get the attention of the desk staff. On more than one occasion we had to wait a few minutes before staff returned to let us in, but the street is full of life and very safe. We took advantage of the breakfast buffet on our last morning. It was E12 per person. The breakfast room is lovely with cheery tables and rustic stone walls - exactly as shown on the website. The buffet includes eggs cooked-to-order, pastries, fruit, yogurt, meats, potatoes, cheese, cereal, and various beverages. The service was great and my friend raved about the coffee. While we found it more convenient to just eat on the run most mornings, the buffet is definitely worth considering if you want a larger breakfast. Overall our stay at Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne was wonderful. I'd highly recommend the hotel to friends and stay there again when I return to Paris.

Overall we were very happy with the hotel. Our room was clean and bright and the bathroom was a good size. We had a small balcony which was nice to sit out on to get some air. The reception was manned 24 hours a day and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful anytime we needed anything. The hotel is close to the Louvre, Opera and the big department stores and there is a metro stop close by which makes the entire city accessible. There were some very nice restaurants in the neighbourhood - Willis Wine Bar and Liza's a Lebanese restaurant were two we ate at. There are also lots of Japanese restaurants along the surrounding streets but we didn't try any of these. Getting to the hotel was relatively straight forward. We got the Roissybus from CDG to Opera and I printed directions from Google Maps from the bus stop to the hotel which was about a 5 minute walk. A few slightly negative points I would make are that the lift is not big, the hallways are narrow and the reception area is small. Our room was also a little small for three people and the third bed was up on a ledge over the double bed. The hotel is however a three star hotel and so overall we felt the amount we had paid versus the other good points mentioned above made the hotel very good value in a city where many of the hotels are dingy and overpriced.

I am female and was travelling alone and it was my first time in Paris and I do not speak French. I felt very safe in the streets surrounding the hotel even at night and found the location of the hotel to be very convenient. The street, Rue Sainte Anne, has quite alot of Japanese restaurants. I could see 6 from my window! You're probably not going to Paris to eat Japanese food but if you have a craving for it you will be well accommodated. I did not try the breakfast here, I think it was 12 euros. Instead I went to the little coffee shop at the next cross street (half a block away) and bought a coffee and pastry for 3 euro. I also bought a little treat for myself each evening like a pear or citrus tart. The staff there were very nice and even taught me to say 'take away' in French, although I've forgotten how now. The most impressive thing about the hotel Louvre Sainte Anne was the friendly staff. One lady at the reception in particular was so nice and extremely accommodating. A work colleague of mine was also travelling to Paris. His luggage was lost by the airline and he had only organised accommodation for one night so he had them send his luggage to my hotel once it was found. The hotel kindly stored his luggage for him for the entire day even though he was not a guest there. The lady at reception even phoned the last place he had stayed on my behalf to try to find out where he was. She spent quite a lot of time on the phone for me trying to help me track him down. He showed up eventually oblivious to all the trouble he'd caused. Needless to say I didn't spend any more time with him after handing over his luggage.

And it did not disappoint. The hotel is smack bang in the middle of everything that we wanted to see and very easy to find from the Gare du Nord where we came into from our home town of London. Closest metro to the hotel is definitely Pyramides as it is a two minute walk to the front door. The hotel is in the Japanese Quarter of the city; literally surrounded by awesome Japanese restaurants. More about that later. The staff were extremely helpful and the lady at reception spoke excellent English which was helpful for hubby who is not a French speaker. The room was very nice and absolutely spotless. We had to make do with two singles pushed together but it was not really a problem. Our room was quiet (4th Floor with lift) and had a very nice clean bathroom. Thankfully there was a good shower that had pressure and plenty of hot water. The hotel does provide a squishy shower/bath bottle, but i'd recommend bringing your own if you want a decent shampoo. There was a hairdryer which was good. The room also had a nice flat screen tv with plenty of French tv channels and Eurosport in English. We also had air con which was great although we did not use it as it was not warm enough at night. We did not try out the breakfast as we woke up too late but it looked very nice on the pictures. We did however try out a Japanese restaurant for Brunch on the Sunday. When in Paris, eat Japanese! It's the one directly opposite the hotel and it was absolutely superb and very reasonable. We ate a few different dishes but the tempura is a must. This is how Japanese food should be made. Forget Wagamama's as this was the real deal. Best seats in the house are in front of the Chefs. They are so in sync they don't even have to speak to one another. It was great to watch them cook our food and with such care and attention. A great experience! We had both visited Paris a few times before but did a few new things that we absolutely loved and we think that everyone should do. We tried out the new Paris by bike initiative; 'Velib' that the Maire of Paris has just started up. There are bike stations all round Paris and there is one right by the hotel. It is a much better way of seeing Paris than taking the metro or even walking. You swipe your credit card (150 EUR deposit each), get a pin code, type it in and then off you go. Despite my apprehension about no helmuts being provided and the initial feeling that i was going to get squished by a crazy driver it was the best experience we had all weekend. The bikes were in excellent working order. Had 3 gears which was more than enough and had excellent Shimano break's. And for the ladies, the saddle was plenty wide and there was a useful basket for water and my handbag! We took the smaller back roads and cycled everywhere , even along the cobbles by the Seine. The Louvre was about 5 minutes away and we were able to get quite close to the Pyramid in the gardens without running anyone over. We cycled along the Saint Honore road with all of the nice shops and even ventured up the Champs Elysee until I lost my nerve as we moved closer to the Arc de Triomphe. The bikes also had a padlock so you could stop and leave them securely. You can also put the bikes back on the rack and take new ones out every time you stop as there are plenty of bike stations dotted around. This is also a good tip because if you can be bothered to change the bike every half an hour you only get charged the initial fee and not the 1 EUR or whatever it is past then, but it is cheap so we didn't bother changing the bikes. We absolutely loved it, so if you go in the summer or can brave the icy winds in winter, use the Velib and stay at the hotel.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York State", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't be better!\u201d", "Author": "petitesoeur", "ReviewID": "UR8510236", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Louvre Sainte Anne for 6 nights in June '07.

This is not a problem in Paris in May, so we did not mind that at all. We through the windows wide open and enjoyed the cool Spring air.

The biggest asset of this hotel is a nine-year employee at the front desk: Moen (pronounced Moon). She is cheerful, knowledgeable and helpful. We don't read French and misunderstood the sign on the back of the door. Our room was 145 euros/night. The rest of the sign said breakfast was 12 euros (we got that right!) and what we thought was coffee, which we thought was gratis, actually was the in-room safe! You have to run your credit card through the slot for identification, but there's no charge. We discovered that the coffee was 3 euros, but that was cheaper than anywhere else, which was 4-5 euros/cup. We thought we were being so clever to go to a restaurant to have breakfast because we thought 24 euros for breakfast was too expensive. We ended up paying over 40 euros because the coffee was so expensive and we each had two cups! As Moen would tell you, if you want to go to the Louvre, turn left out the front door, walk four blocks and you're standing in front of it. Bakery with wonderful fresh goods and a great, big cup of coffee? Left out the front door and walk one block, same side of the street. Grocery store: Out the front door, turn right and immediately turn right again to go down the side street, walk one block and there's a market kitty-corner across the street. The metro is three blocks away. You will discover that there are dozens of Japanese restaurants in that part of town. We also discovered a newly opened Persian restaurant, just 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel. Out the door, turn right. Same side of the street. They do not have hotel shuttle service to and from the airport, so be sure to book transportation the day before you're ready to leave the hotel. We're glad we did. We wanted to leave at 10:30 am.

It is well-located \u2013 an easy 5-minute walk to the Louvre, shopping (like the MonoPrix), and many restaurants. We had a room on the top floor with a balcony that has a view of Sacre Cour. The room was adequately sized for my family \u2013 my wife and I plus our 10-year old son. Keep in mind this is Paris, and equivalent rooms are smaller than what is typically found in North America. The bathroom was newish, which would explain why it is quite large and beautiful. The bathroom has a heated towel rack (something I wish our house had). From an American viewpoint, the room would probably rate 2 \u00bd stars, not 3. But this is typical of hotels in Europe. I don\u2019t know how Paris rates hotels (the number of stars is posted outside the hotel). We visited 2 four-star hotels just to check them out, and those hotels had a big difference in luxury (and price too). The hotel TV channels had 3 or 4 english channels, including the English version of EuroSport. Perhaps the best part of this hotel is the front desk staff. Mon, Amina, and the rest of the reception staff were hugely helpful and informative. From restaurant recommendations, directions, etc., they were always spot on and could all easily converse in English. We hadn\u2019t been to Paris in decades so this was greatly appreciated. My wife was to fly out 2 days before us, but a Northeaster caused a 2-day delay in her getting to Paris, and the hotel did not charge us for those nights \u2013 what great service! Other reviews have mentioned that the hotel is in the midst of many Japanese restaurants. We tried a few out. As a former owner of 2 Japanese restaurants myself, I can tell you that the restaurants in this area are hit-or-miss. You cannot go by the crowd waiting to get in, or the ethnicity of the owners (most are not Japanese owned, but that doesn\u2019t always matter). There is an excellent and cheap brasserie half-a-block from the hotel, right on a corner. We had breakfast at that brasserie each day \u2013 great service, great location and windows for people watching (in Paris, people watching is part of the culture).
