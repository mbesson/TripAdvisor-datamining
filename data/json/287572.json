The price was very reasonable ($28, I believe, for 2 adults and one child - the other is under 3) Again, the service was wonderful. We only had time to use the pool once after checking in on Friday evening but it was beautiful and perfect for my preschoolers to splash around in.

We left to go to dinner and a musical and when we came back, we were immediately hit with an overwhelming smoke smell in both rooms of the suite. It seemed stronger in the living room so we had to close the door to the bedroom and were unable to use it while our kids slept, which was the whole point of getting a suite. I called the front desk finally and was told that the floor below ours is a smoking floor and the smoke was coming up through the ventilation system. No room changes were offered, just an explanation. The next morning, my husband called the front desk and after talking to several people, we were only given a $50 deduction off the price of the suite. Instead of staying and swimming and working out, we packed up our things and left as quickly as we could. We were very disappointed with the hotel, the appeasement of management and the visit as a whole. As much as we are in Indy, we will never stay at this hotel again. As a pediatrician, my husband knows the risks of secondhand smoke and as a parent of a child with environmental allergies, we are well aware of the dangers that we slept in that night.

Unlike the other two HGI properties i have stayed in, this was not a new construction. The hotel is within the walls of an old bank building. It is a very elegant decor which incorporates many of the elements of the old bank. They have posted photos of the old bank and interesting bits of information about its former life. My room (king bed) was very spacious and the housekeeping staff kept it spotless the entire time. The A/C took some getting used to - the thermostat did not seem to be completely accurate but after the first day i figured out how to adjust it to my liking. The desk staff was plesant and professional. But i have to say that a couple of times their directions to various attractions were inaccurate or out of date. But i felt that they were far and above the calibre of most i have encountered in my travels. Their event coordinator, Lindsey, was endlessly patient and proactive with the organizers of our group's visit and really made us feel like she was concerned about our arrangements and enjoyment. The hotel sits practically on the Circle and is an easy walk to dozens of restaurants of all price and variety. There was never a problem finding somewhere to dine. Within the circle is the \"Chocolate Cafe\" - candy store and ice cream parlor. Definitely a \"must do\"! Also, stop at the \"Tea Pots & Treasures\" store directly across from the hotel for a bit of calm and sanity. Nothing to do with the hotel - but it was very aggrivating to me that the majestic Monument in the center of the Circle was not open after 5:00 at night and actually CLOSED on Mondays and Tuesdays! In the middle of vacation season? Give me a break! Very very very poor planning on the part of the City or whoever regulates that attraction. Still - be sure to take a long time to walk around it and read the various inscriptions. It is truly amazing.

He immediately reeled off a long speech about how many items, what prices, etc, but never really answered my question. When he was finished, I said, so, uh, does that mean I can order something? He said, I think I just explained that to you. I apologized, saying it was still early in the morning, and he did finally say, yes, I could order something.

If you go, don't miss the revolving restaurant at the top of the Hyatt which is a great way to get your bearings and enjoy some delicious crab cakes.

The good thing is when you first walk in the hotel you don't see or even smell the pool, which is good. The fitness area was closed due to remodeling so it should be pretty nice now if you're into that. The location was great I thought. We walked to the mall (about 2 blocks or so), and to lots of restaurants so there was no need to get our car out of valet (22/night). Go for the valet if you go, it's only about 5 extra dollars a night than self parking. The hotel had nice shampoo/conditioners (Neutrogena) and the bathrooms were nice (no vent though). The rooms were a little small, but fine for the two of us. The tv is a bit difficult to see from the bed (maybe this was just how our rom was set up), but it wasn't too big of a deal. I have read some complaints about the bed, but I thought it was great. I wasn't too crazy about the feather pillows, but overall it was cozy. The only issue we had was that we had to wait about 10 minutes for the valet to bring the car up since the front desk wasn't answering their phone when we called them to have it brought up.

Check-in was fast and easy. We went directly up to our room. Entry to hotel was very nice; it had a beautiful fireplace and plenty of seating in the lobby for guests to relax and gather if in a group. Room: Room was decorated nicely, and the refrigerator and microwave are a great addition to the room for guests staying for multiple nights. Beautiful curtains, though the \u201croom darkening\u201d portion could use some help. Instead of going to the floor, like the curtains, the room darkening portions end at the window sill, allowing light to come in through the top and bottom. With a light outside the window, this did light up the room a bit at night. I am not sure if all rooms are like this. Bathroom: I was very pleased with the bathroom overall. With a granite countertop and granite shower walls, it was very up to date. The soap dish was a cheap plastic, which didn\u2019t seem to go with the rest of the bathroom. Towels are your standard hotel variety. Personally, I prefer the vanity and sink to be separate from the shower in a hotel room (just easier to get ready away from all the steam if someone is taking a shower); but this bathroom was not laid out that way. That said, the bathroom was very clean and provided everything a typical guest would need and expect in a hotel bathroom. Bed: The biggest disappointment was the bed. The mattress pad had a lump line throughout the center. We called front desk and they delivered a replacement that we put on the bed\u2026this fixed the problem. I would assume this was just a random occurrence. With the look of this hotel and the type high quality furnishings, they need to upgrade their bed linens. I would recommend replacing the bedspread with a duvet and/or triple sheeting, especially given the current trends in the hotel industry that seem to focus on bedding. Housekeeping: Fantastic. Everything was clean and up to standards. Location: Perfect location for those looking for downtown accommodations. We were able to walk everywhere; I especially appreciated being so close to a downtown mall to finish up some last minute Christmas shopping. Service: Great service; front desk staff were always very helpful in recommending restaurants and/or providing directions. They even lend you an umbrella when it rains! Overall: The room itself was very small. I assume previous posters with glowing reviews were upgraded to the suites with two double beds and/or corner rooms. Traveling with my spouse, we prefer a king size bed, which meant we had to sacrifice space. I would not want to spend much time in the room other than to sleep. If I was here to work or traveling with a family, it would be too cramped. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean room with great service in downtown Indianapolis, provided you are either traveling alone or able to get a room that is larger than the one we stayed in. It was my understanding from this hotel that the king bed rooms are all this size. If that remains the case, we will likely look elsewhere the next time we are in Indianapolis...for the money, I prefer a bigger room with a better bed.", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clarksville, TN", "Title": "\u201cIt was okay\u201d", "Author": "luvnjoy", "ReviewID": "UR6571528", "Content": "Indeed it was a nice hotel.

On-line the rates were over $200 due to an expo in town, but we called the hotel itself and secured a rate of $159., their rack rate. GETTING THERE: The hotel is very close to I-65/70. The hotel itself is well-marked and easy to find. THE HOTEL ITSELF: Outside is made of limestone, Neo-classical period. It is a historical building, the Fletcher Savings and Trust bank constructed it in 1914. In 2002 the Hilton Garden Inn bought and restored the building and opend it in 2003 so everything looks recently remodeled. Inside: the style is sleek and modern, but with the old bones of high ceilings and marble columns. Look up to see the beautiful mouldings. The fireplace would be nice to warm up at in the winter, a nice feature in the lobby! OUR ROOM: We loved having room 1522 and would consider it an upgraded room since it was a corner room and so there was more square footage and an additional huge window ! The color scheme is sage green, soft gold and cream. We had two double beds since we travel with our two small children. The bathroom must be handicap-accessable since the door was extra-wide and grip bars were provided in the shower/tub. Our room had a view of Monument Circle, very pretty with the fountain at the base and lots of flowers next to the fountain. The bathroom counter was granite, as was the wall in the shower/tub. Attention was paid to detail, the window treatments are elegant and also have sheers and room-darkening panels. Also, the towels were folded to fan out and toilet paper folded to a point. BONUS: Our room had a microwave and small refrigerator with cabinets to store any food items you brought! So, go ahead and pack that microwave popcorn or if you get in late they sell microwavable meals downstairs! STAFF: EXCEPTIONAL!! The nicest, most helpful people! We are used to working with polite staff, but the group here welcomes in a warm, genuine way and we were asked several times if there was anything we needed. POOL: The reality is better than the internet photos. In reality wall-sconces give up-lighting which is flattering as opposed to the internet photo which looks like it would be florescent lighting. The pool was empty every time except once, we visited five times. There are no slides or diving boards, so bring your own pool toys if you have kids. The pool goes from 3-5 feet and jacuzzi looks like it could fit 8-10 people. A nice feature is that the fitness center looks out to the pool. This is good because: 1) Parents can work out while older kids swim. 2) The fitness center is small and having a wall of glass makes it seem bigger. The fitness center had a bike, stair stepper, weights, treadmills, etc. (Don't forget your room key, you'll need it to unlock the pool doors.) The pool is well maintained, it smells of bleach and we saw several maintenance workers come in to check things, turn on pool lights, etc. Plenty of towels are provided and even a bin to leave used towels. The women's bathroom (I didn't venture in to check out the mens, sorry!) is one big room with plenty of space. A hair dryer is provided and tissues. In one corner is a shower scrubbed to the point that it looks like no one has ever used it. The shower curtain looks new. It could be convenient to swim or workout, then take your shower & get ready right there. EXTRAS: Next to the pool is a coin-operated laundry room in case you like to do laundry during your stay. (We don't, so we are assuming that the machines work properly.) In case you forgot the soap, they sell forgotton items and snacks, etc. at \"Pantry Pavillion\" next to the front desk. We did use the business center once. It is well-lit and organized. We had no problems using the Internet in our room and printing off our documents in the business center. Room service is available, I would strongly recommend dining outside the hotel. We are big fans of PF Changs, Starbucks is across the street, there is even a micro-brewery nearby, \"Rock Bottom\". My husband had a business meeting at the hotel's \"Great American Grill\" and noted that the staff were doing their best, but the food itself was not \"great\". Eat elsewhere. We walked to the Circle Center Mall. I would not want to walk there in high heels or in freezing/rainy weather, but in July it was a lovely walk. Bring comfortable shoes. We also recommend the nearby Children's Museum. OVERALL: I would say this is a 4-star hotel for families, business travelers, disabled, and singles! If they wanted to move up to 5-star, I would recommend a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, a cd player, some bathrobes, up-graded bedding (the bedding if comfortable and brand new, but it isn't like sleeping on a cloud such as the Westin's heavenly beds.) and better hotel food service. I would highly recommend this hotel, we have stayed in many hotels in Indy and this is the best 4-star we have found! Uh-oh! The secret is out!!

Hope you keep up with keeping your #1 rating on Tripadvisor.com because Hilton Garden Inn Downtown is a wondeful place for both business and pleasure.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3433140", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April while attending a convention. The hotel is very nice with a beautify lobby. Rooms are small yet well appointed. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean and came complete with a refridgerator and coffee. Room service was very prompt with good food and reasonable prices. Valet parking is expensive ($19) but they have a self park just around the corner in the Bank One parking garage that is $12 a day with in and out privileges. Room rate is fairly high but is well worth the location and quality of the property. May be able to get discounted rates but since we were attending during a large convention, all hotels were at peak rates. Would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowie, MD", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel...great rooms, staff and location\u201d", "Author": "WindowSeatPlease", "ReviewID": "UR3424695", "Content": "The Hilton Garden Inn in Indianaoplis is a fabulous hotel. I stayed based on recommendations on this site and was not disappointed at all. For starters, the location is convenient and overlooks a beautiful monument/circle that you can see from several of the rooms. It feels like it's right in the center downtown and it's an easy walk to a bunch of great food places, a nice mall and several of the sports venues are right nearby. I was in town for business and, from the second I walked in, was greeted by pleasant, friendly staff. My original room was right outside of the elevator area and I wasn't crazy about all that foot traffic. So I went back downstairs and a member of the desk staff immediately offered to help me and, upon hearing my concern, reassigned me to an awesome corner room that directly overlooked the Soldier's monument - no problems. The rooms are a great size and you don't feel like you're walking in a circle - they have beautiful high ceilings as well. The bathrooms are also much bigger than the closets you find in some hotels. Both the room and bathroom were incredibly clean and well-situated - better than any other hotel I've been in. The beds are comfortable and the rooms come with complimentary high-speed internet. The housekeeping staff is through and accomodating of special requests (i.e. I left a note on the bed that I didn't need the underblanket and it was neatly folded on the unused bed for the rest of my stay) The restaurant is top-notch - I had some pasta on my first night and you couldn't have told me I wasn't in an authentic Italian restaurant. The staff are friendly without being pushy and there is generally just a relaxed, cool vibe all throughout the hotel. When you need help, it's there but there isn't a constant \"can I help you? can I help you?\" that gets annoying. This is just a really cool place and, even as someone who isn't crazy about hotels in general and is very picky, I can't recommend it enough. The environment is comfortable and the staff is wonderful.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d287572-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Indianapolis_Downtown-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$143 - $232*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10 East Market Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46204</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "287572", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c7/7e/f0/lobby.jpg"}}
