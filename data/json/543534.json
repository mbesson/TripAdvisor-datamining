The hotel is away from the main area of Madrid a little but quite walkable into town. Taxis are reasonable anyway so no big deal. The room is fine although should there be 2 guests there should have been 2 easy chairs, the one provided was badly stained which looked awful. The bathroom was good, a little awkward to use the shower without getting your hair wet but thats as most hotel bathrooms, its a pity the door over the bath didn't swing out so you can reach the taps without getting in the bath first. The lift is handy when you have heavy luggage, the free coffee was welcome but I had no idea until I wandered down to find some ice. There should have been a snack menu or some information about the hotel facilities in the room. The stair banisters could do with cleaning and the wooden floor is not too level so maybe some kind of warning would be good. The staff were helpful when I need some ice and directions. I wish someone would have told me they have free bikes, I read that afterwards somewhere. The free Wifi was welcome. Ok yes the bed is hard but I was so tired I hardly noticed.

Staff is extremely courteous and since they speak good English, it is a major plus point for English-speaking travelers.

The rooms that do not have the jacuzzi have the street view which btw, is awesome. So take your pick!! A major disappointment is the internet facility in this hotel.

The location in an upscale neighbourhood is good if you don\u00b4t mind stepping out as a typical bleary eyed and bedragled tourist into a fashion parade. Breakfast is fine although when I ask for a black coffee for some reason they give you an expresso in a large cup rather than a normal american coffee. Overall not bad for Madrid with the provisos. For some reason they insisted I pay the whole bill in the middle of my stay when I just asked to see the account...only in Spain", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cWorth Considering\u201d", "Author": "Tiredandgrumpy", "ReviewID": "UR5824470", "Content": "We stopped at the Petit Palace for 5 nights in September and the hotel was excellent, clean rooms, free broadband internet access (theres a hotel laptop in each room, so you don\u00b4t have to mess about trying to connect your own PC to the network) and very close to the Metro.

Honestly I booked it for its low price and had no expectations. I was shocked at how terrific this hotel was! The room was exceptional, lovely high-tech bathroom, great furnishings and the high point--the lap top with internet access. Traveling with a 13 year old this could not have been more welcome! The location was superb as well, among great shopping yest only a few minutes from the Prado. This is a hotel that should not be missed.

A big mistake. The Hotel bar and restaurant were closed and no room service. This information was placed on a small notice in the lift - no mention of this on arrival or at booking. I was informed on checking in that the airconditioning was also not working fully..so with temperature hovering at 36 C that was no joke. Having had a long trip I decided to doze on the bed. Horror ..the sheets were filthy ..they had not been changed since the last person who had some bizarre personal habits ....Exit quick to change rooms as no maid service available. Next day there was no sign of breakfast . \"A continental\" breakfast was available. This consisted of a few rolls, coffee and juice for \u20ac14 !!!. Best to avoid this place..there are plenty of alternatives. The Hotel offers a plasma TV with a big choice of channels ALL in Spanish and only CNN in english.

The hotel is situated in a safe lovely residential neighborhood full of great shops, restaurants and a 15 minute walk to all the best sights- Prado museum, Thyssen collection and the lovely Retiro park-we were able to stroll through the park to and from sites, don\u00b4t miss it, it beats all those overly formal parks in Paris anyday. Two blocks from the metro which will take you anywhere. The staff was friendly and very helpful, made and cancelled reservations and assisted us in all ways needed. The room was great- spacious new bathrooms with sauna shower in the first room and a two person whirlpool bath-shower in the second! One room was on the street and the other on a large painted airshaft/couryard- both were quiet and of a size more to US standards. Breakfast was excellent, good coffee,fresh fruit and juices, pastries, salmon, eggs, yougurt and much more. A laptop and flat screen TV in each room-overall GREAT value for the price in europe. Very modern decor, normally this is not a plus to me but in this case worked very well. Paid about 150 euros-night including the breakfast after internet comparisons. Did not try the restaurant in the hotel. Avoid staying at a hotel on the Grand Via unless you like a real circus, it was better to visit than stay on.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "ukrneal", "ReviewID": "UR4345288", "Content": "My wife and I recently returned from New Year's in Madrid, staying at this hotel. We loved it! It is a high tech hotel, and was recently remodeled. All the rooms we saw on our floor looked very nice, and each had different shapes (not just a cookie cutter). Since it is high tech, it has modern equipment, including a laptop with free internet in each room. The bathroom was excellent. Our room faced the inner courtyard - no view, but very quiet. We chose this hotel for its price for value. There were many hotels in the price range (100-150 Euro/night). But most had some sort of problem for us: seedy location, no internet, dark rooms, poor reviews here, etc. I am happy to report that the service was excellent and that staff really went out of their way to help, although they didn't always know things a tourist might ask. Location right near the upscale boutiques meant that it was fun to walk the area, as well as safe and quiet at night. There is a wonderful restaurant across the street too (in the Rioja club) that is open to the public. It is also 1.5 blocks away from the subway and another 5 minutes from a light rail network station (connecting the key train stations of Madrid). It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Prado and museums there. It was probably a similar walk to the main city center (or a few subway stops). We would definitely be willing to go back.", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Petit Palace Embassy", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d543534-Reviews-Petit_Palace_Embassy-Madrid.html", "Price": "$122 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Serrano 46</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\"> (between C / Hermosilla, C / Ayala)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "543534", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/58/3e/c0/restaurante.jpg"}}
