The hotel is located in a safe and clean area and it is only a few minuted from the Dubai Metro station. This makes it really easy to reach most of the important places in Dubai by the Metro by a daily ticket. The hotel itself is clean and the personal is very kind and helpful. If you book a standard room you may have no \"really\" view out of the window as the rooms are located to the patio of the hotel. But this was no problem from our point of view as we spent only the nights inside the hotel. The breakfast is continental and it changes every day in the selections. Trips and tours can be booked in the hotel or by the travel agancy. There is also a small shop in the hotel which offers some souveniers and postcards if needet, for an accepable price. We would travel again to Dubai and choose this hotel as it has a good Price performance ratio.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GeordieCouple2829", "ReviewID": "UR125177399", "Content": "We stayed in a standard double room for 4 nights in February. The staff were very friendly and we were lucky to get our room key before the specified check in time. The room itself was large and clean. You had a kitchen area and living room as you go into the room and then a separate bedroom and bathroom with a bath and a separate shower. For our taste the mattress was a little hard but that is only personal preference and doesn\u2019t reflect badly on the hotel. We found the breakfast to be just average but it was free with the room and gave you a good start to the day. The hotel is in a brilliant location for getting around Dubai itself \u2013 there is a metro station Sharaf DG just across the road from the hotel which is a fantastic way to get around Dubai. There were also taxis around the front entrance of the hotel at most times. The Mall of the Emirates was only 5-10 minute walk away from the hotel or one stop on the metro. The pool and Jacuzzi on the roof are lovely and the water was heated which is a bonus in February. The hotel also offers Wi-Fi for 15 AED per 24 hours which we thought was a decent price and the internet was reliable and fast enough for browsing etc. All in all we would definitely return to Dubai and would stay in this hotel again. The only negative was it not overlooking the beach etc but we knew that before we travelled and it was easy enough to get to by taxi and for the price you pay I personally prefer this.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Corina937", "ReviewID": "UR123689124", "Content": "Very good location (in front of metro station and 10 min. walk to the Mall of Emirates), large rooms, clean, staff very helpfull, good and various breakfast.

The TV provided in the room had the option of plugging in my laptop through HDMI. Since it was late (past 11pm), I ordered a salad and some basic quick eats. The food was good and was presented well. Breakfast spread was adequate with the essentials in place. I actually enjoyed my breakfast for all the 3 days I was there. I can't say the same about most of the hotels I have stayed at. The internet connectivity was good. People told me that other hotels provide free internet. But I wouldn't really complain about paying 15 AED for 24 hours of unlimited 1 mbps connectivity which actually delivered the speed it promised. The area around had multiple supermarkets and restaurants, which I also sampled. The best part of the hotel is its proximity to the 'Mall of the Emirates', a few minutes walk from the hotel. Spent time at the mall every evening. Window-shopped mostly and bought some stuff. The mall has a Carrefour for people who want to do some extensive value-shopping at Dubai.

Room was quite large, flat screen TV, large double bed, small desk, two chairs and a table, safe, and mini bar. Bahtroom is fairly large, I would caution older or persons with a mobility problem about staying here, as the bath tub/shower is very difficult to get in/out of. There is a large ledge that surrounds the outer part of the tub/shower and it is at least 2 feet wide by 3 feet high and one must negotiage getting across this when entering or leaving the bath area this was not designed very properly.
