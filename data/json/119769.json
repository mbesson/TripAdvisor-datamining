I read some reviews of other similar priced motels in the area and I read some alarming stuff. Then I came across this motel. I called and booked a room immediately. They knew my name when I checked in. The room was super clean with a brand new mattress (I was later told by the nice owner). It is a tiny room, but they pack a lot of awesome stuff other motels do not, like flat screen televisions, refrigerators, awesome air conditioner, brand new carpet and a queen and twin bed. We loved the retro feel of the room itself. The best thing was this place was more than $30 cheaper than any other motel in the area.

Two examples; the housekeeper brought extra blankets to our rooms one evening because the temps were expected to be low that night, and one morning the guy from the front desk came running out of the office with 4 bottles of water for our group as we were loading in the car to head out for a day trip, just because he thought we might need it.

The property consists of two buildings, a main building containing the small check-in office, with rooms whose doors face the harbor, next to the pool and outdoor area, and a second building, which I was shuttled off to. This is basically a sort of shack in the middle of the parking lot, an extremely awkward spot that feels uncomfortably exposed. My tiny room, with its windows facing the stairs and directly over the cars, felt like one of those art projects where a performer lives inside a glass cage on a street. I'm not sure I believe in \"feng shui\" but I felt a sick anxiety the entire time I was in the room. The door seemed like it was made of cardboard and blocked sound about as well as a sheet, adding to the sense of exposure. And the bed was as hard as a rock. For $50 plus tax I'm not expecting mints on the pillow, and yes, the place was pretty spotless, with bright white decor and a new (if small) flat screen TV. But it was such an uncomfortable spot that I barely slept, and longed for the standardized comforts of the myriad chain hotels nearby--Ramadas, Comforts, etc. The feeling that you're in a building that won't blow over in a breeze is worth an extra $25, I think.

We have been visiting SD for over 4 years and have stayed in many hotels from Oceanside to Sanysidro, from o the bigger chains to the little trendy ones down in the Gaslamp district, to the highrises by the harbor, and we have to say that The Dolphin was just perfect for our needs. We love traveling around the area and so most of the time we spend in a hotel is to sleep and take a shower, well we had just what we needed and it was clean, efficient and just right. The folks there are so nice and very helpful. We arrived in SD around 9 AM and our room was all ready for us to take a nap after traveling all night. That in itself was a very pleasant surprise. And that it is located right in the middle of all of the boat action, yacht clubs, we were delighted. We decided to use public transit, so the bus stop was right there, and it was easy to connect with the trolley as well. We have rented cars before while visiting, but because it was so easy to get around using transit, we loved staying there at the Dolphin. We weren't at all disturbed by noise from the street, but if you have a problem with that, just use ear plugs, but truthfully the white noise from the air unit took care of that. The rooms are small, but adequate and the shower is great, no shortage on anything. Wifi, anything that you may need, and breakfast outside in the courtyard. Everyone was so nice, not a grumpy one in the bunch. Where have you been all our lives , Dolphin, we will be staying there again probably next summer. Do not hesitate to stay at the Dolphin, of course if you would rather spend a lot of money go elsewhere. We love the Dolphin and hope all reads this as a total 100% recommendation.I do think that this is one for quieter people, they don't allow loud parties so be mindful of that.There are places in the area for partying, just call a cab to get home.

Yes, the rooms are small, but the bed is very comfortable and the room was very clean and everything in it worked great - especially the shower (great water pressure!). A continental style breakfast was provided every morning in the courtyard - coffee, juice, bananas, yogurt, muffins, McDonalds apple pies,etc. We never had a problem finding parking. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. Even before we arrived for our stay, we were notified that the motel and surrounding area would be out of power the night we were to arrive. Jess provided us with a flashlight when we arrived. It is so rare to find people who actually enjoy thier job. Well, it was obvious that these folks do. I think the friendly and relaxed atmosphere that the staff creates, causes thier patrons to be more friendly as well. Whenever, we'd pass through the courtyard, other patrons would say hello or good morning. You're lucky if other people even look at you in public these days! My only advice to future patrons would be to be ready for thin walls. The folks next to us were not especially loud, but we could hear them talking pretty clearly through the walls. We turned the AC/Heat unit in the room on \"fan\" and that helped alot. So, if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs or turn on that fan. Otherwise, the other patrons were very respectful of the \"9pm-9am quiet time.\" Thank you to the Dolphin for running such an affordable and pleasant establishment!

Budgets were not my main motivator when booking this motel, despite its very very reasonable rates, it was the trip advisor ratings that clinched the deal. My criteria for a hotel/motel is clean safe and friendly, im there to see the city NOT to sit in a room or by a pool (I can do that at my local leisure centre). The Dolphin had reviews by the page full stating my criteria would be hit, they utterly smashed it! From our first steps into the reception both my wife and myself knew this was going to be a great stay. To my discredit I forget the staff members names but suffice to say they will be the same ones that get talked about so positively in all the other reviews. These unsung staff members were fantastic, without being over the top, what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call fake US hospitality. Nothing was a problem, not that we had any issues for them to solve. Vouchers for local attractions, deals at the local Mexican (DO NOT MISS IT) and all the maps you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever need were supplied without hesitation. The rooms, well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.they are exactly as the web site says. Click on their home page, go to room pictures and only book if they meet your requirements. Anyone on here moaning about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms in my opinion didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do their homework and therefore their comments are null and void. They are spotlessly clean, comfortable and perfect for our needs, the needs being to SLEEP. Concerns about TV volume controls from other reviews seem odd to say the least, quite why people need to set up a home cinema experience while on holiday baffles me. We went to bed, watched the news at normal volumes, woke up and watched the news before breakfast what else could you need?? Perfect. The breakfast was as you would expect, please do EXPECT basic. Basic does not mean bad, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you start the day hungry but it does mean you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not getting the Vegas buffet style \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no need to eat for 3 days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd event. A muffin, a banana and an amazing cup of coffee (use the vanilla cream! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it always seemed to be hidden in the fridge) was the order of each day. If you need more there are options just over the road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just remember the price you paid for your room! My only comment that could be construed as slightly negative is the motels location from what us Brits would call the city centre. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book a car and potentially that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our fault but we did assume that being the United States of America your public transport would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kick our [--]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it did not. The bus stop is a 20 second walk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect! The wait for a bus, hmmm not so great. In retro spec I would 100% recommend a car hire OR a fat wallet for a taxi, as the wait was just unbearable on occasions. The issue is exaggerated 100 fold come the evening. We liked to go out on the evenings to the Gaslamp area (check it out!!) but getting back was a nightmare whilst trying to use public transport. The trolly system is ok (ish) but come the end of the line your dumped in what seems like the middle of nowhere. All of this is NOTHING to do with the Motel, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want people to go to this great establishment and get disillusioned by the transport woes. To surmise, a epic motel that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean, safe, friendly and supremely priced.

The reason to stay in this motel is the price. I stayed there this last weekend (Sept 2011) while attending a conference at the convention center downtown. I paid less for the three nights I stayed at the Dolphin than I would have paid for 3 nights in a hotel next to the convention center, especially when figuring in the free parking and free wi-fi at the Dolphin. The motel is very old and it shows it's age. All of the structural parts of the room and especially the bathroom look old. The room was very small. It had a queen bed with about 3 feet of clearance on each side, a nook for a closet, and a bathroom that was 3 by 4 with a shower (no tub) that was like 2 by 4. The carpet, bed, etc did look very clean. There was a new flat screen TV on the wall (27 inch I would guess) and two small night stands with two tiny lamps. No chairs (no room!), but they did provide two luggage racks, a tv tray and a mini fridge. There was also a very bright ceiling light that made it comfortable to read (in bed as it was the only place to be in the room). The room was very bright at night, I could have probably read with the lights off. I had to prop stuff up against the window to help shut out the light. he bottom floor room also had a lot of noise form the room above and the office next door. Breakfast is a tray of costco muffins, some bananas, coffee and OJ. The staff was very nice.

We were greeted by a very helpful, congenial fellow, Jeb who throughout our 3 night visit made it more memorable than the motel itself. Actually the motel was memorable in its simplicity, making you realize just what you do and don't need in your 'home away from home\" when traveling. The rooms are just big enough for a very comfortable bed, a folding chair, a big flat screen TV on the wall, a couple of small bedside tables with lamps, a small closet (no light which was a tad annoying to me) and your basic tiny bathroom, shower no tub but great water pressure (always a plus for my husband). There is a room AC which is fairly noisy when on. If you just want outside air and leave your window open, there is both street, other vacationers and sometimes airport noise. WiFi is free but my husband had trouble at times connecting his iPad. The folks at the desk at one point generously gave him the use of their laptop! You won't find all kinds of specialty bath items in the bathroom, such as lotions, shoe shine stuff etc. BUT if you forgot your toothpaste or run out (as I did) or need a straight razor or other toiletries or even a hair dryer, they have them for you at the office.

Since my husband and I are trying to watch our carbohydrate intake, we tried to find other places close by for breakfast, the closest being the one on Rosecrans connected to the Holiday Inn, I think it was. I think it was called the Point Loma Cafe. We had breakfast there 2 of our three mornings. It was adequate, a sort of glorified Denny's, not cheap but you could find all kinds of egg dishes and the portions were huge. The last morning we decided to find another place for breakfast which I would recommend highly. The Living Room Coffeehouse, 1018 Rosecrans. I think you could walk there but we drove. I will write a special review of this place because I want to give it 5 stars for the delicious food at an incredibly reasonable price. All this said, we went by the Ramada Inn next door to compare prices - twice as much, no breakfast whatsoever and probably pretty much the same type of rooms although we didn't look.

However, after you to look around, you will realize that you wont find any that are cleaner and more hospitable, and yet also cheaper than this place. We are from the midwest and are used to Indiana's cheap motel prices (39.99-49.99). While visiting San Diego, we stayed in a couple hotels/motels before coming to the Dolphin. The first night we stayed at a Ramada ($150 per night), and while on a day trip to San Clemente we first checked out a local mom and pop inn and inquired about the rate. They wanted $80 per night but did not include cable or internet, so we had to stay at a Holiday Inn for ($170 per night). Our 3rd night back in San Diego, we agreed we couldn't afford to keep shelling out the high prices for these Southern California hotels. I happened to run across the Dolphin's website while doing a search for cheap San Diego motels. The website had us a little cautious and apprehensive but agreed we would give it a try. MY DOLPHIN REVIEW To secure the room, they do require you to use your credit card over the phone and pay for the first evening, but allow you to make a decision after the first night if you want to continue staying each additional night. We were given a second floor room in the main building, in the corner of the balcony. (Side Note: If you have disabilities like the second member of our party, this motel does not have elevators, so you will have to request downstairs room if available.). I asked how to access the pool from the pictures, and was disappointed to find out that the pool actually belongs to the neighboring hotel and therefore the Dolphin does not have a pool. WIth the negatives out of the way now, I am free to tell you about all the positives about the Dolphin that have left us with certainty of coming back. Upon check in, the staff asks if you brought a laptop with you. If you have, they will supply you with a wi-fi code to access their internet. If you have left your laptop at home, they have complimentary laptop for you to use at no additional charge. There is a privacy fence that blocks the downstairs rooms' views, but having the room we did on the second floor, we couldn't have asked for a better room with a view. From our balcony, we had a perfect view of the harbor and and yachts at Sport Fishing Landing across the street. As for the service you get at the Dolphin, you cannot ask for anything better. The staff here really care about their guests. From the night clerk we checked in with, to the actual owners that work the desk and take care of continental breakfast duties, service is top priority here. One owner asked if he could carry our bags to our room for us. This kind of service is something you don't get at other chains. The rooms are a bit small. We had one queen bed and one twin bed in the room, which only left a walk way around each bed. While the rooms may be small, you wont find a cleaner room elsewhere. Everything in these rooms is white, and the staff ensure that it stays that way. The showers at the Dolphin had great water pressure and never ran out of hot water, which was a plus compared to the other hotels we stayed at. Each morning there are large sized muffins and juice available downstairs near the lobby, free of charge. All in all, the Dolphin is a great value with great service and clean rooms. If you are like us, we don't spend much time in the rooms while on vacation, so how clean it is and how we are treated is what means more than anything, and this place delivers on that. AREA ATTRACTIONS/RESTAURANTS The Dolphin is in a great location. With everything nearby, we returned our rental car after the first night here. Within walking distance (2 blocks) there is a great restaurant (Miguel's) which the staff can give you coupon for free appetizer, a great white cheese sauce that is superb. If you prefer a hot breakfast over the free continental served, just around the corner is a donut shop that also serves plate size croissants for same price you would pay at Burger King. There are plenty of dining options in the area. Although we did not go to any of the bars/clubs, there are a few within a couple blocks if that is your scene. GETTING AROUND Just behind the motel, you can hop on the MTS bus line that will take you all the way to Old Town (Main transport area), which you can then access the different trolleys or other bus lines to take you to other areas of San Diego. Before you get to Old Town though, there are many stops at area shopping centers along Rosecrans Street. You will come to find, just as we did, that a car was not needed after you get to the Dolphin, as its location is near everything you need. Concluding..The Dolphin actually made our stay in San Diego the best part of our trip. We were able to save money on the room to use for other activities in SD, but not sacrifice room quality. You won't find a more caring staff anywhere else. What you really need in a room is someplace quiet that you can get a good night sleep, with great service and clean rooms. The Dolphin more than delivers on that!

There were many people to assist us when we arrived, and they were all very friendly and made sure to take steps to make us happy; however, I honestly feel that the room itself could be improved a bit. Probably one reason that they can charge so little is that they have not made as many efforts as they could to renovate the rooms. The shower was pretty nice, but the bathroom was very small- I guess I don't see how they could do much to change that. I was able to sleep pretty well on the bed, but the mattress pad or something made it feel kind of \"papery,\" if that is a word. The room was not impeccably clean as some of the reviews have said- I found random hairs scattered around the room in the corners, on the ledges, etc. I have been to similarly priced motels where the room was cleaner upon arrival. I feel that this is something that can be controlled while still charging a nice affordable price, and I would also recommend some renovations in the near future- especially the carpeting. The carpeting was very worn, & didn't quite go all the way to the wall (kind of curled up on the edges). It is kind of a pleasant little hotel/nice location, but I have to agree with the review that someone previously wrote- \"You get what you pay for.\" \"Average\" is not \"bad\"- it is \"average,\" and that is how I am rating this hotel.

The rooms are very clean, have a good sized LCD TV, free wireless internet and the showers are hot and have great pressure. The motel is in quite a convenient location as it is a short bus or taxi ride from the city centre or other San Diego attractions and it is also within walking distance of smaller shops and food (including Pizza Nova which is amazing). Only a couple of negatives which should not play much in the decision to stay here: the rooms are quite small and at times can seem a little cramped if you have a lot of luggage.

You will likely meet the owner, I chatted with him several times. This is an older, well maintained place that is extraordinarily clean. You can practically eat off the floors inside and out. Parking is included with your room rate too. The rooms are fairly small, glossy white walls, frig, a place to hang clothes, shower with wildly high water pressure...you could power wash your boat with this thing. No tub. The walls are thin, you will hear your neighbors on occasion, this is a quiet place though, and will not pose a problem for most. A modest breakfast is provided near some outdoor tables, with umbrellas, it can be a very laid back sociable scene if you choose to get involved, or you can relax in solitude. Bottom line, for the price, location, cleanliness, and hospitality, you will seriously have a hard time beating this place.

The San Diego public works dept decided to chop some of the trees across the road and then chip the branches at 8.30 a.m. one morning which was also pretty noisy, obviously this is not something that the motel had any control over.

If you are looking for a family run, friendly staff, great location, and GREAT owners, this place is for you. Where can you stay and actually get to talk to the owners on a daily basis? We stayed here for 6 nights to visit the San Diego Zoo, Legoland, Disneyland, local beaches, and local attractions. We actually didn't know who ran the chain until the 2nd morning of our stay because all the staff members are so helpful and friendly. They are always asking if everything was ok and if we needed to find somewhere to go for shopping, dining, or attractions to visit. Summary of how friendly the staff and owners were: 1) We left our shampoo at home and they allowed us to have some for free without charging us. 2) We also left our hair dryer at home and they supplied one for us. 3) No matter where we wanted to go, the staff and owners were always able to answer our questions or take the time to show us on a map or draw on a map. 4) The father and son (owners) always made us feel at home like it was a bed and breakfast at the beach!!! They were particular in entertaining our 4 year old son. 5) Breakfast is FREE - Daily bananas, muffins, and yogurt with coffee or orange juice. 6) Last and best, our flight back to North Carolina was not scheduled to depart until 10:50 PST, which is 1:50 AM EST. So we asked the owner (father) if we could check out later than 12 pm since our son naps still. They allowed us to check out at 3 pm vs. 12 pm so our son could get a nap FREE OF CHARGE!!!!!!. The only reason why I gave 1 less than the 5 stars for service was the house cleaning does just a little later than normal. And the only reason for the 1 less than the full 5 stars for sleep quality, was due to the one of the beds being harder than our home bed. But again, this is personal preference. We were not surprised by the room size as the pictures clearly show the size but it was just enough for the three of us. The rooms are always clean and kept up very well.

I stayed at the Dolphin because it was the cheapest motel near the landing, and because it was the closest motel to the landing. Both of these facts remain true... I moved to San Diego a year ago because I am an avid long-range fisherman. Every time I embark on a fishing trip, the day before the trip I stay at the Dolphin. First, I don't want a driving nightmare in the morning as I try to make it to the dock in time to plant my tackle box near the front of the line (get the best location for tackle on the boat). Second, I can leisurely stroll to and from the dock as boats come in, and check out the catch, say hello to other fishermen leaving on my trip (or similar trips) the next day, check out the local tackle shops--there are about a dozen of them, and they are some of the best-equipped in the world. The famous bar, Captain's Quarters--where all the fishermen and crew hang out, both before and after a trip--is about 150 feet away. Shelter Island is where the headliner musical groups show, and it is a fun moderate walk from the Dolphin, as is the second-best view of the downtown--out on Shelter Island. Downtown, Cabrillo (the BEST view of San Diego), America's Cup Harbor, Balboa Park (maybe a dozen attractions there), old town, Mission Bay, Ocean Beach (remember the volleyball scene in Top Gun)--location, location, location... My favorite reason to stay at the Dolphin is that it is, literally, the closest motel to the docks. They have available a convenient hand cart than I use to move heavy stuff effortlessly across Scott street. The parking is a blessing: lit, wide, 24/7 real-time video surveillance, on-site. No worries about leaving $25000 worth of gear in the car. The house staff have been on payroll for decades (no tipping, no worries)--it is family run, Holly and Allyn are well-known, well-respected and like old-school true locals. The staff, Steve, John, Steven are the seasoned vets, are professional real people. The rooms are comfortable and clean. There is no wasted space, but plenty of room for plenty of gear. I once stayed in a 2-bed unit, with 700 pounds of fishing gear, and two computers set-up as a network, for two weeks as my apartment was being readied for my move-in. There is free coffee and the best muffin I've found in Point Loma every morning--perfect for the trips back and forth to use the bathroom while waiting for the boat to load (we usually go to the dock at 4 AM for a noon departure, to get a good place in line). The place is perfect for a fisherman.

After staying in San Diego multiple times, I finally stumbled upon the Dolphin while planning a semi-romantic extended weekend to the city, with the main purpose of spending time at Point Loma for the gray whale migration. That was my first stay, and I've just returned from my second, and will certainly be back. Budget motels are often far from \"romantic,\" but the Dolphin sure comes close. The motel is on the small side with two buildings. On both occasions, I've been given a room in the main building, and this is definitely the more desirable of the two. This building faces the bay, where there is a marina and several restaurants. There are chairs on the second floor in front of the rooms so you can sit and look out at the bay. It's quite relaxing. The rooms are excessively clean. I don't know that I've seen whiter sheets at a hotel under $100 before. The towels, which are typically scratchy and thin at budget motels, are soft and absorbent. The rooms feature one bed and are relatively small. There is a small closet area, a refrigerator (a microwave is available in the patio area), full cable TV and a stand-up shower. There is also an ethernet port for DSL access, which I found to be very reliable. There is wifi available (per a code on the back of your keys) as well. The motel is relatively quiet. There is a strict no-noise policy posted (in addition to a \"no fish in rooms\" policy, which I think is funny) so, if you're looking for a party motel, this is definitely not it. There is a four-lane street outside, but the traffic dies down quite a bit at night, and the only noise comes from a bar inside the Ramada across the street, although that hotel's guests are likely much more affected than at the Dolphin. If you're a light sleeper like I am, you can turn on the a/c unit to low fan and be absolutely fine. The management are some of the nicest I've encountered at a hotel anywhere in the country. At breakfast, which consists of coffee, orange juice and muffins, all of which is of fairly good quality, they're always out saying hello to the guests on the patio. They're always polite and accommodating during check-in and check-out, and are very willing to help with directions and restaurant recommendations. As for the neighborhood, there are several restaurants within walking distance in the Point Loma neighborhood. It's a pretty safe area. There recently opened a shopping center further down Harbor Blvd, toward the airport, that features an Oggi's location (local pizza/brewpub) and a sushi place, as well as other dining options. Downtown San Diego is a ten minute drive down Harbor Blvd, and traffic along it is rarely bad. Ocean Beach (the closest beach) is about ten minutes away, as is Cabrillo National Monument (although check the opening times before you head over there). There are also a couple of bus stops close to the motel. The marina across the street makes for a nice place to walk at night. There is free parking available in the lot and, if that fills up, on the small street in front of the hotel.

Our room was on the second floor which was fine. On first impression we were a bit surprised at the compactness of the room which reminded me of some I had stayed in throughout the UK. Apart from that the room was clean to an acceptable standard and everything that was in it worked accordingly. The place has a kind of '70's feel to it which we have experienced at other SoCal accomodations! We found that the Dolphin was a combination of several pluses and a couple of minuses. The pluses included being situated in Pt. Loma which is a self contained community with most amenities within easy walking distance of the Dolphin. There is a great selection of restaurants, C stores, laundromat, gas stations etc. nearby and the streets are safe to walk after dark. In many ways it resembles most large towns that you would find on the Great Plains with that same \"Howdy neighbour\" friendliness. Pt. Loma is also strategically located in SD to provide quick access to all of the local attractions. We found that having wi-fi was a great convenience as we packed the laptop along. Morning coffee,OJ, and muffins are served in the outdoor courtyard which is very nice on warm sunny mornings. As many other commenters have mentioned the staff and management are very nice folks. The minuses were few and rather petty. The hotel doesn't have a pool (one is located beside the office but belongs to the neighbouring Comfort Inn.) The hotel advertises itself as being on a quiet street (Garrison) which is technically correct, however it is sandwiched between two very busy streets (Rosecrans and Scott). My wife likes to sleep with the windows open and the early morning traffic was very noticeable. The street traffic can be overcome by closing the windows and turning on the circulating fan. Another irritant was the vibrating roar of fighter jets taking off from North Island late in the evening. The snug rooms are fine for sleeping but don't expect to entertain guests. Overall we were quite satisfied with our stay at the Dolphin and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to San Diego.", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay at the Dolphin Motel\u201d", "Author": "PineTree123", "ReviewID": "UR23167878", "Content": "We were very pleased with our stay at the Dolphin Motel.

The good news is the Dolphin is exactly what people say it is: inexpensive, no frills, small, clean, centrally located and a great value. We slept well (in the end unit on the second floor above the office). I did not see any reviews of the bathroom shower, but I'm going to give a special 5 star award to our shower which was an unexpected surprise. My wife and I are so used to \"water-saver\" fixtures that we've given up on getting a decent shower in any hotel. My wife was thrilled to have \"water pressure\" (and I do mean water pressure!) in the shower. Bravo, Dolphin! First time visitors should prepare themselves for some oddities that make the Dolphin what it is. As one reviewer mentioned, the reservation process is peculiar. You have to send a check to reserve the first night - then you can pay for the following night(s) with a credit card. I don't know why -- that's just the way it is. When we arrived at the Dolphin to check it out, our initial reaction was that it was an old TraveLodge motel that had been converted into a Mom and Pop. The huge neon sign and drive-up office with racks of keys, weight scale and video surveillance is off-putting -- like you've entered some sort of alternate motel universe. My wife's initial apprehension was not lessened by a visit to the one of the motel rooms - it was spartan small, with home-made nightstands, and brilliant high gloss white paint that could be wiped clean with 409 or windex. I assured her repeatedly that it was okay - that ALL those good folks at TripAdvisor wouldn't lead us astray (would they?) Reluctantly, she agreed to let me reserve the room. How bad could it be, I figured? When we arrived this past Memorial Day weekend, the weather was drab and overcast. We were planning on taking a dip in the pool and sunning ourselves, but the weather was too cold. Nevertheless, we decided to check the water temperature by taking a walk down to the pool. Unfortunately, we couldn't find the entry gate. We soon learned from the desk clerk that the pool that sits out in front of the motel doesn't belong to the Dolphin, but to the motel next door. My wife told me she would not have been happy if the weather had been sunny and hot and she couldn't go swimming. Be forewarned! That pretty pool with the lawn out front belongs to the other guys! That complaint aside, we slept incredibly well on a firm queen mattress. Our room was very quiet and spotless. On a cleanliness note, the white bed comforter was pristine clean - to underscore the Dolphin's obsession with white, white, white. The air-conditioning unit worked well and shielded some outside noise. Also, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony outside our room earlier that evening with a cocktail, watching the sailboats across the street at the marina. On a related note, the video surveillance cameras that surround the property and the highly visible desk staff probably discourage potential visitors who think that the Dolphin would be a great place to drink and party all night. Our neighbors were quiet and courteous, as was the staff and owner whose primary concern appears to be maintaining quality at reasonable prices.

They would not take our credit card number over the phone even though they take credit cards at the registration desk. This seemed very odd, as it is 2007. (We were prepared for it based on some previous reviews, however.) We were told we could guarantee the room by check or take our chances that the room would be available if we arrived after 6:00 PM. I decided to wait and talk it over with the significant other. She and I agreed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on THREE things: that there was no reason to send a check; that we would probably get there before 6:00 PM and that there would be no harm if the room was resold. We would simply find a room elsewhere. When I called back we went through this all again. I explained we would take our chances with the room not being available if we arrived after 6:00 pm. Then they asked for a cell phone number. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting that and as I am a little protective of the cell number I stated I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to provide it. This started another round of unnecessary discussion. They seemed unsure if they could reserve the room without the cell phone number. The Dolphin representative then handed the phone over to another rep. We went through the scenario yet again and quickly came to the conclusion that it would be fine for me to reserve a room and take a chance that it would be available if we arrived after 6:00 pm. This seemed a very long route to get to the point where we could actually make a reservation. If the rankings weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so stellar, I would have quickly looked elsewhere. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit I was very curious. Upon arrival, before 6:00 PM, everything was in order. Rooms/Cleanliness: Our second story room had a slight view of the marina across the street. The rooms are small and very basic. Ours had one bed, a TV and a refrigerator. Other furniture was of simple board construction. Everything was painted white. The bathroom contained a small shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no tub. All of the above was VERY clean. Location: We found the Dolphin to be very convenient to Sea World and Cabrillo National Monument/Point Loma. It is located across from a large sport fishing marina. This is an eclectic neighborhood. While it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for us, I can see how parking could be a problem in this area. Value: We paid $71 including tax in April 2007. I have to dock it a point for its quirkiness. However, given the location, cleanliness and the fact that this is San Diego I feel it is an above average value.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cVery clean; hospitable staff\u201d", "Author": "TravelerAl", "ReviewID": "UR7278676", "Content": "My wife and I stayed two nights in the Dolphin Motel based on its uniformly positive ratings on the TripAdvisor website.

So THANK YOU to those who've left reviews previously, and I hope this is helpful to other folks searching for a good place to stay. The Dolphin is literally across the street from the sport fishing marina in Point Loma and close to cute little places to grab a drink or some food. Otherwise, if you're a tourist, there is not much in the way of major sightseeing to be done in the immediate vicinity. Still, it's 5-10 minutes from area freeways; 15 minutes from downtown or 20 to Del Mar. The motel itself is a little worn around the edges, but well-cared for: very clean, absolutely no complaints. Awesome neon on the motel as well. Bare basic ammentities (shower, mini fridge, TV, air conditioning, bed, zero else [you wouldn't've been able to fit it in, anyway]). Room was teeny tiny but comfortable. We had one with a mirror at the head of the bed, a remnant from days of yore I spose, and we had a good chuckle over that one. Mornings there's coffee and donuts in the \"courtyard.\" The men who run the place were a little gruff but very good to us, supplying us with maps and recommendations as asked. We felt very safe and well taken care of. Overall I 100% recommend The Dolphin Motel for budget or adventuresome travelers; this would be a great homebase if you're a sport fishing fan, or want something slightly off the beaten path and the peace/quiet that offers, or just want to stay somewhere thrifty and a tiny bit funky (good funky, not bad funky). I stayed for a \"romantic getaway\" - and no, not for the mirrors - and we had a great time. If you're looking for something with a chain hotel vibe and amentities, or are traveling with a family (or a bunch of people in one room): look elsewhere, there's lots of other stuff nearby.
