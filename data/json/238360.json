{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Enjoyed our stay My husband and I stayed for 5 nights. On first look when we arrived, I was surprised it was so small, and right across from a university. A bit minimalistic.Parking could have been a problem, but there was parking for at least 1 car (ours) behind the hotel. A beautiful park several blocks away. Good breakfast for European standards and included in price of room.The view was lovely from our window. The university grounds were pretty at this time of year.Small room, but clean. Comfortable beds. Very small lift, but it had one... Several restaurants on back streets nearby. Reception desk friendly and helpful. I prefer smaller towns, but if you like a busy area, this is good. Right on the bus stop too.If you're looking for luxury, you won't get it here, but it was comfortable for 2 people and the price was fair.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR750556500", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nsf11"}, {"Content": "Pefect for a visit to the University Travelling for business and needed to be close to the Goethe University Westend Campus (in the northern part of the city) and it was literally across the street. The staff was friendly and helpful, the neighborhood was quiet (I was walking around the area rather late and did not feel threatened). The room was small, but that's what I expected. It has a TV lounge and a number of couches -perfect for a quick meeting.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR978511508", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TessM"}, {"Content": "Perfectly OK This hotel is perfectly ok for its star rating, in spite of what the reviewer said. I won a stay there on Ebay with breakfast included. It is buffet style and quite ok--the usual German standard. The hotel is a bit out of the way, across from the Goethe University, but that was fine with me as this made it nice and quiet. It is about a 10 minute walk from the underground to which you can connect from the airport and there is a bus right outside the hotel which connects with the underground if you don't want to walk. There was nothing dirty about my room and they have free internet in the lobby that you can use to your heart's content. There is a supermarket about a 5 minute walk away and you can purchase a daily transport pass for less than 5 euros and cover the whole city. You have a refrigerator in your room to use as you please. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again just for the quietness yet convenience.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR336149830", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "John Traveller"}, {"Content": "Dirty and Cheating The hotel is a little bit dirty.
