The one-bedroom apartment we stayed in this time for five nights is a far better option than the tiny studio apartment we were in the time before, which is really a hotel room with small kitchenette in part of the room. The one-bed is quite spacious with comfortable living/kitchen area separate from the bedroom and bathroom. As others have mentioned, there's a supermarket just a few minutes' walk away in a small shopping mall and Central Station is five minutes away if coming from the airport by train or departing for the Blue Mts as we were, at the end of our Sydney stay. We didn't notice any noise at all during our stay which was surprising as our apartment was on the corner of two busy streets. The bed was very comfortable as was the lounge sofa and chair. There were a lack of microwave utensils - just one chipped casserole dish which I could have cut my hand on easily but which was quickly replaced when I reported it. I did mention the utensil problem on my form when leaving so we'll see if this is remedied next time. There is some pressure for a sales presentation each time when we arrive. This time, we actually slept in and didn't make it but didn't mind as we are quite happy with the level we are on with the timeshare program. We are quite happy to stay there in the future if we take the one-bedroom apartment.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Sydney base\u201d", "Author": "JoJoVanuatu", "ReviewID": "UR127345584", "Content": "I have stayed at the Wyndham several times in the last few months.

The rooms were modern and self contained with all the amenties you would expect, however the rooms are quite small. There was alot of stuff packed into our 1 Bedroom queen room that we had to rearrange some of the furniture to make way for our bags. Once we were settled and made some space though it was fine. The bathroom was an okay size and clean. The balcony is really just a large window, there is no real space to stand outside and we really only stuck our heads out for a look anyway. I have an issue with paying extra for parking and this hotel didn't miss us charging us $30 a night for parking, however this seemed to be about the top end of average for Sydney CBD. It is quite a long walk to the harbour from this hotel but there is an abundance of shopping, food and grocery stores to be found around the hotel. There is a lovely park quite close also.

In the room itself, there was some information about the property which said check out was midday. However, when we returned to our room late in the evening we received a note saying that check out was 10am! This is the earliest check out time I've ever seen and we would not have chosen this property if we had known this in advance. We called reception to ask for a late check out but were told no and the receptionist was very unhelpful and just kept stating, like a machine, \"check out is 10am, these are our rules\". However, upon our request, the manager did call us back and was very polite and offered us a later check out due to the mistake on the booking site. This is a large hotel and they should be able to manage the flow of rooms to at least allow a 11am check out.

We booked the serviced apartment earlier in the year as reasonably priced accommodation is difficult to find for the holiday period, especially if you leave it late to make a booking. The apartment is situated about two minutes stroll from the southern end of Hyde Park. We had previously decided to walk or use public transport for the duration of our stay. Having a car in the heart of Sydney is more of a hindrance than a help unless you absolutely need one. We used to walk to most places - the heart of the CBD is a 10 minute stroll, Darling Harbour about 15 minutes and Circular Quay (CQ) takes 20 minutes. There is a free bus service (555) which runs a circular route between the main rail station and CQ. It stops fairly close to the apartment as do buses to Bondi. If you are staying about a week or more then I suggest you purchase a MyWeekly pass for $41 as it covers all travel on the city rail network, the municipal ferry service and all buses for the southeast quadrant of Sydney. This includes buses to Watson Bay and Bondi Beach and ferries to Manley. A Coles supermarket is less than 5 minutes stroll away as are restaurants. Our trip into Sydney was by hire car but fortunately there is a couple of free 10 minute parking bays very close to the entrance. Check-in was quick allowing us to take our cases to the room, get back to the car within the allotted time and hence, return it to the rental company a few kilometres away. Our one-bedroom apartment was on a high floor (as requested when booking) and overlooked the road junction outside the entrance. The room had a patio door which opened onto a very small balcony. It was possible to stand outside but that was all! The main room had a sofa (which could be made up into a second bed), a table & 3 chairs, coffee table and a fully equipped kitchenette. The bedroom had a king size bed, wardrobe with a safe + drawer unit. The beside tables also had drawers. The ensuite had a walk-in shower but no bath. My wife and I prefer a shower so the lack of a bath was not an issue. The shower head was on a flexible hose which makes balancing water pressure/temperature so much easier than showers with fixed heads. A range of toiletries was provided. The building has three separate laundry rooms for guests and they are well utilised. On the ground floor the building is linked to the cafe next door for breakfasts, etc. We did not use it during our stay though not for any reason other than we wanted to have breakfast in our room. The air-conditioning in the apartment had two zones - one in the main living area and one in the bedroom. They could be set independently of each other. The system was very quiet but effective. The apartment was serviced every day including Christmas Day. Everything in the apartment worked well. Last but certainly not least; we met and spoke to a lot of staff during our stay. Without exception every one of them was very helpful, cheerful and courteous even when I am certain they wished they were celebrating the Christmas holidays with their own families/friends. They were superb.

It's like having a one bedroom apartment with a proper kitchen for the price of an average hotel room elsewhere. The one unpleasant thing this time was a note left under the door when I went out. It said \"Please come down to reception to collect your welcome pack\". This welcome pack is just a ploy to get you downstairs to speak to a vacation ownership rep. He tried to give me two mini snickers when I told him I wasn't interested in the vacation ownership presentation. For those familiar with these presentations, it's a marketing gimmick to get you to part with $20K to get access to vacation ownership.

It was our first trip to Sydney and we wanted to make sure we got great value for the money we paid. We all know Sydney is crazy expensive so the last thing we wanted to do is waste money on a sub-par hotel/vacation rental. I came across the Wyndham Vacation resort and was very happy with the apartment hotel. We got there very early in the morning (8am) and found out only one of our apartments were ready - that wasn't a problem because we at least had a place to drop off our luggage and freshen up a bit. The other room which was next to ours wouldn't be ready until 2pm which was fine with us. We got a *STANDARD* 1 bedroom apartment that included a kitchen area with fully stocked pots and pans and a living room area that could easily sit 9 people. The living area was big enough to where you had space to walk around if you had put luggage all over the place like we did. It also had a flat screen t.v. that was mounted on the wall. I will say that the range of channels weren't that great. You get about 10 channels. At first we were disappointed but realized we were going to be touring all day and only coming back to rest for the next day. We found some stained spots on the carpet but I've seen that at other hotels and it didn't bother us - they might've just needed to do some steam cleaning. The bedroom was a very comfortable king size bed with fluffy pillows and for some reason after touring Sydney I refused to lay down in the bed because as soon as I did I'd be falling asleep. Very comfy bed. The bathroom was well stocked if you forgot anything (which we didn't). We did have to go back every day to get a fresh set of towels which was a hassle. We received excellent service from the staff for recommendations on dining to best routes to take to the city. They happily answered our 4 million questions and provided us extra information on what the \"locals do\". Much appreciated as always. We had to leave early on one morning to take a flight to Wellington, NZ and they were very happy to arrange a cab for us at 5:00 in the morning. The location was big plus. We were in fact in the CBD district but were closer to Elizabeth street and a few blocks from Hyde Park. We were near the hustle and bustle which we enjoyed but due to the hotels location we could escape to the quieter areas. We had no problem with noise as we were on the 7th floor but we also were walking all day and were dead tired so I guess that plays a factor as well. The metro station is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. If you like taking cabs expect to pay no more than $10 from Darling Harbor to the Hotel or from Circular Quay to the hotel.

These are the ones for the timeshares from RCI and so on. The furniture was older and faded, but not bad. The water didn't get hot. You had to turn on the shower 30-45 minutes before it got hot enough to take a shower, the TV would lose color, where you would need to turn off the power from the back, wait 10 seconds and then turn on for color again, the DVD player would feel like it was dying when it would slow down to the point of stopping (tough when have 2 children watching in the evening).

When I arrived at the Wydnham, the property was more centrally located than even I had figured from the map. 3 minutes walk to the nightlife of Oxford Street, the same distance to Museum station, 5 minutes walk to Central station and about five minutes to the shopping of Pitt and George Street. I think you would find it hard to get a better location in Sydney. Location wise, it is directly opposite the Travelodge and next door to the Vibe Hotel. You are on a very busy intersection, although I never had an issue with traffic noise, Saturday and Sunday night you could hear police sirens through to the early hours. The apartment itself was a decent size, probably around 300sqft, maybe a little bigger. Decorated in very modern \"Ikea-stle\" contemporary furnishings. The room is a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures, I think the pictures that they use on wotif.com and also the Wyndham website are of a 2 bedroom apartment. The one bed apartment is supposed to be suitable for 4 people, but I would not want to be in there with that many people. There was VERY limited storage in the apartment, the closet is of a weird shape so that half of it you cannot have anything hanging up in. There was a great little nook by the doorway to store your luggage in. The bathroom is AMAZING. Shower only, no bath, but nicely decorated, the mirror doesn't steam up when you shower. It is small, but perfectly formed! The kitchenette is suitable for making basics, kettle, toaster, two ring stove, microwave oven... Wired internet access is available in the room, no wifi in the property. As with most Sydney hotels though, it is VERY expensive, I think it was $22 per day or $100 for a week. On three floors in the hotel there are laundry facilities. $3 for a wash and $2 for a dry. Nice, high capacity machines. You can only access hotel floors by swiping your room card, also late at night reception access is via card swipe also. There is a tour desk in the reception if you do need to book excursions. In the same building is a small bistro that I didn't use, but offered breakfast and lunch. There is also a convenience store, selling the basics at highly inflated prices, but ideal if you just need to grab something and go... there are also internet terminals in there if you want to quickly check your email. For better shopping, three blocks away is the World Square development with a large Coles supermarket. The only complaint I had about the apartment is that the sofa bed in the lounge was broken, you couldn't sit on it as a sofa, you would fall onto the floor, but I was in the apartment alone, so it wasn't too much of an issue.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surfers Paradise, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in a Surprisingly Good Location\u201d", "Author": "goldcoastguy71", "ReviewID": "UR21729390", "Content": "When I saw this hotel on a map, it looked like I'd have to do a fair bit of walking to go anywhere.

This used to be called Trendwest Sydney and Southern Cross Suites before its current name. Limited eating options at the hotel with a cafe on-site, but you are in Sydney, so eating options abound! A nice Indian restaurant (Jaipur) is just around the corner down Foy Lane, barely a minutes walk. Within 5 minutes you have everything from kebabs to Thai to Greek to Chinese to an assortment of fast food, and more. Vibe Hotel next door has a nice bar, and there are several pubs in the immediate area. There is a convenience store around the corner as well. Hotel rooms are nice, particularly suited to those who are not fussed about eating at the same hotel. Rooms start with studio apartments and progress to multiple bedrooms, so great if you are travelling with family or friends. The bedroom type units have full cooking facilities. The establishment is sort of membership-based, so you need to buy \"credits\" in their programme (Worldmark) to stay, but you can also pay for a room instead of using credits. However, I have seen the hotel available on some Internet sites, so I am guessing they are perhaps bending the rules sometimes. This is often my choice of residence in Sydney due to its location, and the size of the rooms, and amenities/facilities.

The airport train also goes to this stop making it easily accessable from the airport, even with loads of bags. We had a 2 bed-apartment, which unlike the previous review we found the living area quite small, particularly with 2 young children. As people have said it is quite worn and the ensuite shower in the main bedroom tended to flood the bathroom so the corner of the bedroom carpet smelt quite musty. The cooking facilities are quite basic, just a couple of rings and a microwave, but good enough for what we used it for. On the plus side we were on the 15th floor, so although there wasn't much of a view, we were above the level of the surrounding buildings so it didn't feel to closed in. The rooms were very quiet, other than the sound of the odd emergency vehicle we didn't get any noise at all, and also clean.

The restaurant is a very small cafe with a limited menu, counter service only and which closes in the afternoon.

The delivery service company will go to a set list of area restaurants then deliver food to your room. It requires an outside phone call, and as far as I can tell neither are affiliated with the hotel. Claiming this is room service is a bit of a stretch. Any local hostel can also give guests these pamphlets. The furnishings in our room were also drab and seemed worn. The hallways could use fresh carpet and wall paper as well, as these are also clearly worn with age. There is no swimming pool. There is a pool service available for a fee, which is less than a 10 minute walk. However, if you are trying to entertain children during a rain storm, leaving the hotel to go swimming is not ideal. The staff was friendly and courteous though. And check in and check out was efficient. My complaint is that I feel they claim to be much more \"luxurious\" than they are.
