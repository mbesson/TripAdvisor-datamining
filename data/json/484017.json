{"Reviews": [{"Content": "friendly staff We arrived in Singapore without a hotel booking and after walking around and being turned down by numerous hotels we tried the Tropical hotel. The rooms are quite small no windows with a wet room for showering that doubles as the toilet. however the room was tidy and the shower/toilet was clean enough so that I felt comfortable being barefooted in there, there were even some basic toiletries. There was a flat screen television on the wall with a reasonable choice of stations. A very basic breakfast was on offer in the morning however we never stayed for this. We were there two nights and the staff were very friendly. This hotel is very basic however if you are just looking for somewhere to lay your head you could do worse.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR805449607", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BthereCthere"}, {"Content": "must think over Infact, it's not too bad if u stay in the other rooms but single room.

This hotel looks OK from the street and the reception - cost S$80 for a single. BUT out of the reception into the corridors and rooms its terrible - nothing adorns the walls - not even a picture. The large mirror is just propped on the wall, toilet seat hangs off, shower holder is broken so its a hand hold only, carpets and curtains are filthy and smell is musty. Positives? - price is good for expensive singapore, staff were helpful, a/c works, and if you just want to crash at midnight and be gone by 7am then just maybe - just maybe- its worth itotherwise be warned.....", "Date": "May 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR664674980", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nzbased"}, {"Content": "This is bad hotel........!

I booked this hotel on the internet and was completely disappointed. The nicest thing to say is that it is conveniently located to public transport and looks quite OK from the outside. You'd better stay outside...My single room was extremely small (just room for one small bed), dirty, smelly and had no window. The bathroom was extremely small, dirty and while showering everything else in the room got wet.Being in tropical climate and having no window, you could only bear the temperature with noisy A/C on.This hotel is in contrast to the overall tidyness of Singapore. Better spend a few dollars more and avoid this place", "Date": "Nov 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR988494817", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Smelly and small rooms I was desperately looking for a room as my friends suddenly visited me and most of the hotel in chinatown were fully booked. The reception is very small and the price was S$60 per room per night with no breakfast for a standard room.I was shocked when we went up to the room, it was pretty small which was actually ok since most of the hotel room in chinatown are small anyway but as we came out from the lift, the hallways were dark and smelly already. As we stepped into the room, it has a very strong humid smell and the windows couldnt be open. Toilet had the same smell.
