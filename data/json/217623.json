It is conveniently located right near the corner of William and Wall Streets. The Wall Street station is just a few steps from the doors and it is a short 5 minute walk to the 9/11 Memorial site. Only about a 10 minute walk to Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Ferry. Plenty of great restaurants in the area. The hotel itself is simple and nothing to fancy. We have stayed here twice (both times less than $145.00) per night over weekends. In New York that is unheard of. The rooms are a decent size and very clean. The showers are a little small but were sufficient for our needs. For NY hotels rooms, the size of the room was decent. There is a nice desk area and closet in the room as well. On each floor there is a guest closet with extra pillows, blankets, toiletries, etc. This is very convenient and you don;t have to wait for these items to be delivered. There are also irons, and ironing boards available in this closet as well. The hotel also offers free, purified bottled water on each floor. The majority of the staff are very friendly, however, we did encounter several that couldn't even say hello. Check-in/check-out is very simple and is done through a kiosk. We were able to check in over 3 hours early both times we have stayed here. The front desk is located right next to the two kiosks in case you need help. Overall, pleasant stay both times at a price you can't beat.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and clean, but ....\u201d", "Author": "kimmer1966", "ReviewID": "UR126742607", "Content": "This hotel was convenient and clean, but we ended up having a room with twin beds.

That was one down side-you could hear noisy people in the elevator, which freaked me out the first time I heard voices. We had planned to park our car in New Jersey and take the metro into the city-but Club Quarters offers parking at a lot 2 blocks down for $28/ 24 hours-a real steal in Manhattan.

The hotel provides filtered water and plastic bottles, as well as coffee and tea. In addition to fine living accommodations, convenience is the key here. The immediate neighborhood is littered with good restaurants, and South Street Seaport is a 10-minute, safe walk away. The subway is about three blocks distant and trains run directly to Times Square and Grand Central.

For the price we paid for two rooms (one with a queen bed and the other with two twins beds), we were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this hotel which is right smack in the middle of the financial district of lower Manhattan. Location is everything and this place delivers. One block off Wall Street, across the street from the Wall Street subway station (#2 & #3 lines), brand new Duane Reade store across street, cheap breakfast places on William Street, dry cleaner one block away, wine shops, restaurants and happy hour bars everywhere. This hotel does a lot of things right: 1. Location. 2. Clean and comfortable guest rooms. 3. Free wireless Wi-Fi access in all guest rooms and public areas of the hotel. 4. Free water bottles and chilled purified water dispensers on every floor of the hotel. 5. Living room area just adjacent to the lobby with large screen tv, PC, Mac, printer, complimentary coffee, tea and cookies. 6. Friendly associates throughout the hotel (thank you Briget for your assistance). 7. Great cocktail lounge off of the lobby. Prior to our arrival, I was a bit concerned because of some of the comments here on TripAdvisor. If you too are concerned, let me explain some things to you. Yes, the guest rooms and bathrooms are small. But in my opinion, hotel rooms in Manahattan tend to be smaller than say, a beach resort in Hawaii. The important thing is their rooms are clean, modern and comfortable. When we were there (March 20-23, 2012), they were offering upgrades to a suite for only $40 more per night. We were out of the rooms all day so all we needed was a place to shower and sleep. We didn't spend much time hanging out in the rooms during our stay. We never encountered any rude associates during our stay. So if you ask me, this hotel offers the best overall value we have found on the three trips to Manahattan we have made over the past three years (we usually stay in the Times Square area and we found this area much more convenient for our needs). I hope you enjoy this place as much as we have!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greeley, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price\u201d", "Author": "btpersons", "ReviewID": "UR126327274", "Content": "This hotel was near everything we wanted to see, so we walked to most of the attractions. including Broadway plays,Central park and a good pizza place a block away.Clean and friendly would go back again for sure.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gonzales, LA", "Title": "\u201cEasy Access to Lower Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "CaptainJ47", "ReviewID": "UR126231102", "Content": "Came in to NYC for an interview and was put up at the Club Quarters.

Nothing really that sets it apart in an exciting way-- but that's just preference in style. The only drawback is that I asked for a late check out, they granted it, and then there was a miscommunication about it, and they attempted to charge A LOT for those two hours. We worked it out, but not without a lot of back and forth on the subject, which sort of sours the experience.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga, Latvia", "Title": "\u201cConveniently located business hotel\u201d", "Author": "hansmoleman", "ReviewID": "UR118957376", "Content": "Stayed here for two weeks for a business trip to New York positives - even if you aren't in New York on business, its location downtown (very close to very many subway lines) makes it a good place to be based out of - is no frills - which is a good thing (quick checkin/checkout) - free wifi - comparatively cheap (compared with, for example, the Andaz Wall Street, which is much fancier) - rooms are very quiet negatives - the deluxe room (with 'kitchenette') has a sink, small fridge, and some plates and silverware.

I called the manager and he was somewhat indifferent. He told me That I should have written down my \"special needs\" when I made my reservation. That did not help me much at 10:30pm, in the middle of an allerrgic reation. Thank God that I always carry Bendryl. They were eventuly able to find me one thin non-feather blanket and pillow- I froze all night. I had to put up a real fuss to have my sheets changed that night as well.

The next day I spoke to the manager ( a different one) and when I came back to my room after working all day, they had added more blankets and pillows. The room and bathroom is very tiny with very little space to unpack, but it's not horrible for a night or two. If you are working downtown near Wall Street, you can't beat the location. Also the train stop is just around the corner. One thing that was difficult was as a woman traveling alone.

The hotel itself was fine. The front desk was somewhat disorganized, especially during checkout on Sunday when one poor soul tried to do everything for everyone...slowly. Later in the day the desk was overstaffed. Huh? Complaints are few and minor. Service was a bit slow, especially if front desk forgot to tell house keeping to deliver (in our case) extra pillows. No rate card in the room meant it was unclear when checkout was (or that there were no late checkouts; while waiting to store bags we overheard several calls in which guests were told that the computer-as if it were autonomous- automatically added $35 to the bill for checkouts between 12 noon and 2 PM). But the room itself, though a little small (standard for NYC) was clean and well furnished; the bed was large and comfortable and the room was reasonably quiet (especially for NY). Bathroom was small but it worked; \"fit and finish\" of paint and spackling would not have passed my test during construction, but had no impact on the functionality of the bathrooms. Neither did the absence of a lock on the bathroom door (the presumption being everyone knew each other in the single bed room?). The location was incredibly convenient to Wall St and environs and the subways; one subway stop was across the street, others two blocks away.

For reference, this location is right in the heart of the financial district and steps away from Wall Street and the Federal Reserve. If you aren't looking for luxury accomodations and are doing business in the area, in early-June for US $220, you can, like me, get a room on the penthouse floor. Check-in and check-out are efficient. You can choose to do either at the automated kiosks. Directly opposite to the main reception area are the elevators. If you have a penthouse room, then you'll have to take the left-most elevator and actually press down instead of up. Gym is on the 3rd floor and is very basic with a couple pieces of cardio equipment, a bench and some light weights. Closes at 9:30 pm so hours are limited. Restaurant on the bottom floor is more of a bar - to your left after you walk in the front door open early for breakfast ($14.95 continental breakfast offers coffee, scrambled eggs with choice of bacon/sausage, and trips to the cereal/pastry/fruit/luncheon meat bar), and adjacent. Lounge with business centre, large screen TV and sofas adjacent to the reception area, except on the opposite side. I can only speak to the penthouse hallways - however they seem as if they were updated in the past 10 years or so, but the natural dingyness of the hotel was obvious in the obvious age of the exposed ductwork, the peeling and grime on corners of peeling wallpaper. My room (Penthouse #7) had a double bed, large workstation facing the window with a decent city view, 20 inch TV, closet with iron and ironing board. Washroom was pretty basic, retrofitted to look similar to other Club Quarters (stainless steel trim under the marble counter and sink). Nothing special, but nothing bad either. Bottom line was the room was fairly clean. The area is fairly quiet in the evening, I had no problems sleeping. The only hindrance to a good night's sleep, if any, was how worn out the pillows were. They were pretty cheap.

I won this deal on Priceline for $85 for a Sat-Sun stay and I believe normal average rates for this room goes for $119 which is a very good deal to begin with. What I love about this hotel: -Literally 1 block from the Wall St-William St subway stop. Only accessible to the 2 & 3 train (red line) and a Duane Reade pharmacy is literally right next to it. 6 blocks from Century 21 and World Trade Center -Entering the lobby, I expected it to be a dimly lit area that is small and boutique-like. However, it was well-lit, clean and open. -Beyond the lobby there is a lounge with several chairs, couches, and a table to play chess. There is a TV and a counter with 2 computers to use free-of-charge with internet. Use this to relax and read a book, internet surf, waiting for a ride, etc. -Check-in has become impersonal and more practical with 2 kiosks next to the reservations desk where you swipe the credit card you used to purchase the room with. There, you can choose the number of keys you would like along with a sheet of paper confirming your room number and floor level. -There are 3 elevators and 20 floors. There is a fitness facility (which I didn't get to check out) along with a conference center. -I was on the 20th floor in room 2011. The room was of a very good size considering this is a hotel in NYC and clean. I requested a queen size bed (options are queen size or 2 twin...no doubles at the hotel) and the sheets, pillow and blanket were all \"new\" in that it didn't have that musty smell nor look like it's been used for years. Super high ceiling with a small flat screen tv, desk, chair, closet, alarm clock , AC unit with temp control setting and coat hanger, which is fantastic so you have more space to utilize in your closet. -The bathroom was small but as expected and bigger than most I have experienced in NYC with ample counter space. -People there were friendly, courteous and helpful. They happily stored my bags when I checked out of the hotel to go hang in the city at 11am and came back to pick them up at 5 at no charge. They give you a ticket with the number of bags written on it and then stow it away in a storage room. -They lock the doors at midnight so in order to get in you, you need to either be buzzed in or insert your key card to get in which is great because they value security for their guests and don't want random people coming in and out. -Eco-friendly in that house keeping didn't come and knock on our door in the morning or clean the room during the day unless requested to conserve water by not having to wash sheets/towels if we didn't them to be. -Full length mirror for those who are getting dressed to go out and need to see their full outfit (keeping in mind that it is NYC) Minor things I didn't like: -no ice machine nor vending machines. However, I must say it redeemed itself by providing machines dispensing cold filtered water. They provide cups in the room and you go outside and like a Poland Spring water dispenser, pull the tab and voila, free cold water to drink which is great because I always find myself having to run to a convenience store to purchase water for the room. -no ipod dock on the alarm clock. -not enough lighting in the room -water pressure was pretty low I absolutely loved everything about this hotel and can't rave enough about this place.

I had a free buiscults and coffe/tea in the orning which you can always have.The hospitality and the service which was provided was really overwhelming and i felt really at home but for the family. The american food which was served did not go with me very well as i was a vegeterian there was not much of choices to make there but what i like about this hotel is the service and the location which makes it the best. There is a free fitness room which you can avail and the equipments which they have there will keep you fit if you have a try on it.. all were really very good to keep yourself fit.

But the bathroom was clean and big and not too bad at all! Bed was comfy. Bad draft coming in through the window made the room cold. Noisy heater that didn't seem to do much. Just one small window but plenty of lamplight. TV small but flat; only basic cable. Also we were two in the room but they only provided one washcloth, one handtowel, and two pillows. They didn't have a seperate quilt, all in one with the comforter, and just a top sheet underneath, which I don't like, as I'm not sure how often that duvet cover gets washed! Minor issues. The lobby and outside of the building were nice - old NY grand style! The elevators were spacious, fast, and there are 3 of them. Two computers in the lobby were usually being used. Coffee and tea only on weekdays apparently. Water dispensers with bottle on every floor a great idea and more eco-friendly (if you reuse) and saved us money on buying bottled water. Other guests appeared decent; no rowdiness or late-night noise (except from us after a couple too many in the East Village, but we weren't that bad! :)) Good location around the corner from the subway, a few eateries and bars in the area (recommend Leo's bagels, open on weekends, and Adrienne's Pizza).

We walked up to the front desk (lobby is tiny and nothing fancy), and waited for the receptionist to serve us. Then another couple walked up behind us to get in line while we waited. However, instead of serving any of us, the receptionist served a pushy young woman who walked up and butt in front of all of us to ask about her dry cleaning. My friend and I, as well as the other couple behind us all looked at each other for being brushed aside like that. He could have politely told her to wait while he served us who have been waiting patiently. Thankfully, that was the only negative thing about our stay. Although the lobby was tiny, there was an adjoining \"club room\" with nice furnishings and 2 computers for free use. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, i had no problem using my ipod touch to surf the net from my room. I was relieved when we got to our room, and it was big enough for NYC standards. It's not like we spent a lot of time in the room, anyway. It was very quiet. The furnishings were modern and new (albeit kind of IKEA-like), and the room and bathroom were clean. There is free filtered water w/ bottles in the self-serve closet in the lobby, along with other little basics like more coffee & sugar so that you didn't have to go ask for it. The hotel is right next to Wall Street, directly next to Trump Tower and convenient to subways. It's within walking distance of the Staten Island Ferry and the ferries to the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. The only thing is, since it's in the financial district, it's pretty dead on the weekends, and even Starbucks near the ferry opens late (9am or later). That didn't bother me too much b/c it also meant the area was quiet at night. There are some restaurants behind the hotel. If you want to be right where all the action is, stay further up in midtown Manhattan. For us, it was no big deal to jump on the subway to get up there quickly. Checkout was better than check-in.

The highlights of CQDT include: + Great location; 1 block from the 1 2 & 3 lines. + Only 1 block from NYSE & Federal Hall, as well as the Trump Building. + Adjacent to the CitiCorp complex. + Excellent proximity (walking distance) to the WTC site, Battery Park, Statue of Liberty ferry, Staten Island Ferry (free), South Street Seaport, City Hall/Municipal bldg, Brooklyn Bridge entrance, China Town, and so on. + Lots of great eateries in the area (must try Water Street Deli a few blocks away). +VERY clean & nice rooms. Lots of stuff packed into a relatively small room, but it works. + Queen room includes an awesome bed, desk with comfy chair, 32\" flat screen TV, extra sitting chair, wardrobe cabinet, two nightstands, alarm clock. + VERY clean bathroom - yes, it's tiny, but it works. Great water pressure and temp (hard to find in any hotel, much less in nyc), nice towels. + Self-service guest closet on each floor. Here you can get extra pillows & cases, iron & board, coffee/tea, etc. + Chilled water dispenser on each floor, next to the closet. These are refreshed throughout the day w/new bottles--great on a summer day on your way out--just grab a bottle, fill it up & go! + FAST, LARGE ELEVATORS -- and three of them! + Front desk VERY helpful, even printed directions (subway route) to Target in Brooklyn for us. They'll also call a private car for you, and it's roughly the same $ as a taxi to the airport. + Large menu binder in the room w/lots of local restaurants menu's, most of which will deliver. + Hotel has arranged for restaurants to deliver to the hotel, and the hotel staff will bring the food to you and just charge the meal to your room. Nice if you don't really carry cash. It's basically room service without having to stick with the hotel's menu! Things that could improve or are slight annoyances (still not THAT big a deal in the grand scheme): - Only one ice machine for 20 floors. It's located on the 3rd floor. - You must request addt'l towels/washcloths. They try to conserve resources (\"going green\") so unless you throw your items on the floor, they won't be replaced. They also do not provide any extras (many places give you an extra towel or two). - The TV remotes aren't so hot. You have to reeeally press the buttons in order to get it to work; almost feels like you're going to break it. Had this twice now, so it seems to be the norm. - Shower could use another shelf or two for shampoo, etc - only one tiny corner shelf in the shower stall. Overall this has become our favorite hotel in NYC. Yes, it's off the beaten path, but it's very easy to get to all the \"typical\" parts of the city. Although very quiet at night, it still feels safe, even around the subway station. All you have to do is tell your driver you're at \"Wall St and William St\" and they should know where that is (at the very least just tell them you're a block from the Stock Exchange...everyone in the city knows where that is!). One thing to note, however is that the Financial District isn't on a grid pattern like the rest of Manhattan so it can be rather confusing when walking around, especially due to the numerous 2-block-long streets that seem to go nowhere. Otherwise it's a fantastic spot with VERY easy access anywhere else you may want to go (take note however; subway routes change at midnight, so the stops aren't as frequent and lines change). Stay here, you'll love it! No, rooms aren't huge, but lets be serious...IT'S NYC for goodness sakes, what do you expect. You want large rooms, stay at The Plaza or the Ritz.

Beware of street closures on the weekends that can make getting here a bit tricky. Also the nearby 2/3 train line has service interruptions (no uptown trains on the weekends). On the weekdays, it is rather congested (not a surprise given it is NYC and the Financial District) which can make getting to a meeting etc. via cab.

Pros: Cabs - surprisingly easy to get either right outside the hotel or a couple blocks up on Broadway. Rooms - I stayed in the Diplomat Suite and it was VERY nice! Nice sized room (not your typical small NYC hotel room or bathroom). It was very clean and the bed was AMAZING!!! It was so hard to get up in the mornings!! The bathroom was well lit and had a great ledge for putting your toiletries/make-up bags on. It also had a nice facial mirror. Amenities - free wifi, complimentary business center, do-it yourself bottled water station on your floor. Staff - front desk staff is limited in number, but it doesn't matter.

It was not above average, not for that price, but it was clean, it was comfortable and had a good location. We were just a few steps away from Wallstreet, Broadway and Ground Zero. The check in was a bit strange, though. They had an electronic system, which didn't work, So it was not possible for us to check us in ourselves.

However, when we arrived at the room, we found it to be small with only 1 queen-sized bed - for all of us. When we advised management, thinking it was merely a mistake, we were told that there were no other rooms available to accommodate us. When asked how they would accommodate the number in our party, management said they would provide a full-sized rollaway. While not what I paid for and not what I would expect in a smaller-than-normal room, we agreed to give it a shot. What arrived was not a full-sized rollaway, but a twin-sized rollaway to sleep two children! When we inquired about the full, we were told that the twin was all that was available. Going to another hotel was not realistic, as we had already pre-paid for our room through Hotwire and finding a suitable replacement was not practical in downtown Manhattan at such short notice. Despite the size and lack of proper beds, the hotel in general was well located for our needs, and we found the rooms nicely appointed - appropriate for a three and a half stars. However, I would say that service fell far short of that designation. For example: 1. Housekeeping was far from adequate. Not only did the housekeeper fail to clean the room in any real sense, she/he inexplicably failed to make up the twin \"bed\" every day. Further, she/he never once provided us with the proper number of towels for the number of occupants. Each day we would have to ask the front desk for more. 2. Prior to our departure, we checked our bags at the hotel for the afternoon, as our flight was not until evening. The morning staff was more than pleasant in assisting us, but when we returned in the afternoon, the staff was less than helpful. It took over 30 minutes to retrieve our bags and when we inquired about the delay we were told, \"people don't realize we have over 300 rooms and so it often takes a while to retrieve the bags.\" This comment only served to make us more angry about the accommodations we were given...with over 300 rooms, one would assume that they could have adequately accommodated our party with the room type we reserved. 3. But most importantly, at no time during our stay did Club Quarters apologize for not adequately accommodating our pre-paid reservation or do anything additional to attempt to accommodate us. Essentially, Club Quarters Downtown is a nice hotel in a great location with poor service and is apparently not suitable for parties greater than 2.

This time, however, Midtown was booked up, so we stayed at their Downtown location, right by Wall Street. My husband had stayed here a couple years ago and didn't like the location as much as Midtown, because it's further away from a lot of the sights of Manhattan, and the area can be a bit dead at night. However, the Wall Street area is now starting to be a bit more lively at night, and there are a few restaurants open in the area. One of the unexpected benefits of the quiet neighborhood is that it really was quiet -- I've had trouble sleeping before in hotels in midtown because of the noise outside, and that wasn't a problem down by Wall Street. I think the windows were relatively soundproof in this hotel, as well. Anyway, the deal with Club Quarters is the front desk isn't really full service -- you check in by sticking your credit card in an ATM-like machine in the lobby, which spits out your room card. You check out the same way. Some people hate this, and some people love it -- just be aware. Still, every time we came in or went out, there were still at least two people at the front desk. As in the other Club Quarters, the rooms were clean (not a given in New York, even at chain hotels) and relatively spacious (for New York). The price is competetive, also.

I will try and expand as follows: Good points: 1) Got it for $185 which is cheap for NYC 2) Near to subway - 1&2 lines 1 min walk, 4&5 lines about 5 mins walk. Walking distance to Staten Island ferry and generally easy enough to get a cab if you walk down to Water St nearby. 3) Not as quiet at night as we'd feared - which I realise is slightly contrary to the previous reviewer. There are some slightly contrived bars and restaurants at the South Street Seaport which is quite nearby - it also has a few decent shops (including Abercrombie and Fitch) and a museum, etc. Worth a visit if at a loose end. We also had an amusing time one night when we stopped in at a bar on nearby John St (which also has a good diner called Andrew's on it) and got accosted by some drunken wall st types. 4) The area seemed safe and there are certainly quite a few security guards and cops around given the nature of the financial district location. 5) The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. 6) There was free internet access. 7) There was free bottled water. 8) Its walking distance to Century 21 (and Ground Zero if, unlike us, you view such a place as a tourist attraction). Bad points: 1) Location - too far downtown, hence a heavy reliance on subway or cabs - not so good late at night if cabs are hard to come by! 2) Customer service - reception staff weren't great and certainly didn't exactly go out of their way to help you. This would've even been pretty apparent if this was a hotel in the UK, but I was very surprised at this being the case in the USA (anyone who has been to the UK will understand the customer service point I'm making here). 3) The place needs a good refurb - the last one was only half completed and some things like wallpaper in the corridors, the signage etc. are still surviving from the 70s. 4) The heating/air con unit in the bedroom looked and sounded like it was from the 70s - luckily this was okay if you left it on when you went out for dinner and could then switch it off to go to sleep, but I wouldn't want to stay here in the summer when its boiling hot and you need the air con on all night. In fact there's no way I'd stay here in the summer! Would we go back?

I did a quick run-through before we left the hotel and noticed that we had been charged a $15/night extra person charge. I took the bill over to the front desk and asked what this was for. The guy said that it was because there had been an extra person in my room, ie., two people instead of one. To me, two people in one room is not a crowd and should not justify a surcharge. I told him I had been quoted $194 and that no one had mentioned a surcharge, as he claimed they had. This must happen a lot, because he immediately took my bill and credited me the $30 (two nights' worth of surcharge). The experience left a bad taste in my mouth, because it felt like they'd just tried to see if they could get away with tacking on an extra charge -- if I didn't notice, great, and if I did notice, they'd just remove it.

The garage across the street and around the corner was completely inconvenient and horribly expensive. You pay each time you get out.

The poor bellman was running himself ragged, the front desk phone was ringing constantly, and they were running out of things like pillows (yes pillows) and water bottles. Many of this weekend's guests were parents moving their kids into the NYU dorms. So, lots of families sharing rooms. Hence the pillow shortage. Another issue--the bar closed at 8 p.m. on Saturday night. After having dinner in the Village, we decided to go back to the hotel for a couple of drinks. Boy were we disappointed!!!! My final complaint was the AC unit in my room. As I said, my room was tiny--double bed only--no queen. But, the AC unit was incredibly loud.

Overall, we believe that this hotel is under-priced for the quality, and especially for NYC, a place where hotels tend to be expensive . It is located just around the corner from Wall street, and the subway station is a good 30 seconds walk from the doorstep. Needless to say that the neibourghood is very safe, and quiet on week-end also because not many people live there. The Club Quarters downtown caters mostly to businessmen's and traders during normal office hours, so it get's quiet during the week-ends and prices are following the same trend. It's a great place to stay in NYC, but be advised that you will have to jump in the subway to get to where it happens. By the way, the place is a good 30 seconds from red line #2 and #3, 3 minutes from green line #4 and #5, 4 minutes from yellow line R and W, 5 minutes from red line #1 and #9, 5 minutes from blue line A and C, and 1 minute from brown line J, M and Z. These lines will get you anywhere in Manhattan fast, at any time. Typical travel time from hotel to Soho, Greenwich, Chinatown, Little italy and Time square is 20 minutes. I recommend getting a subway metrocard if you are there for a few days, it's good value for money at 24$ for 7 days, instead of paying 2$ for every trip you make. Staff at the property is polite and efficient, but this is not a 5 stars hotel so you won't find a doorman with white gloves at the door. If you wich to find a doorman at the door wearing such gloves, check-yourself in at a fancy address midtown, and expect to pay 4 times what you would at the Club Quarters. Otherwise, book with confidence at this place, and increase your shopping budget! By the way, parking in now 28$/24hrs. There is no valet, you just pull out in the front, unload, check-in and then go leave the vehicule at the parking facilities. 3 minutes walk from the parking to the hotel. Parking is safe and well looked-after by the people who run it. They will park the vehicule for you. Don't forget to have your parking ticket stamped when you check-out, otherwise you won't get the Club Quarters special rate. P.S: for those interested to know, we took the subway to Harlem (125th St) on a sunday afternoon, and have to say that the place is not really attractive, but by all means not dangerous at all.

The dark wood, granite counters and plasma TVs (two of them) were quite the hit. The sleeping area of the room was rather compact with a well-designed bed with small, built-in night tables, cordless and wired phones and a clock radio that had a jack to play any MP3 player through. The bathroom was also very compact, but extremely clean and well equipped. The water pressure was very good. In fact the entire room was extremely clean. I am usually slightly grossed out by hotel rooms but this one was so clean I felt very comfortable. The sheets felt and smelled very clean and were soft, with a high thread count. I also enjoyed using the comfy terry bathrobe that was in the room. Alas, there was only one to be shared. Being the Exectuive Suite there was a rather spacious seating area. The wall dividing the two areas was at the foot of the bed. On the sleeping area side it contained the closet and TV, on the seating area side of the wall a desk was mounted. The desk was equipped with several tour books, as well a couple of business books and a dictionary. There were two comfortable side chairs, a sleep sofa, and another table and chairs. There was also a small, again well-designed, kitchenette. There was a microwave, a cabinet with plates, dishes and flatware, a small counter with a coffee maker and a 'fridge.

A book listed menus from several area restaurants that delivered to the hotel. The hotel restuarant was good, on the pricey side, but this is NYC of course, so not unexpected. I didn't come prepared to use the gym, but I did check it out and it looked very well equipped with ellipticals, treadmills, weight machines, all the typical equipment one needs. It is also possible to have a portable bike or stepper delivered to one's room. We would definitely stay at a Club Quarters again, but would perhaps seek a different location.

We chose the hotel mainly because of 2 reasons: first was the hotel rating on the Tripadvisor (far better rating than Holdiay Inn and other hotels in NYC) and second because it was on the approved list of hotels in my company. Although the website is nothing to be proud of, we trusted the reviews and could not agree more! We booked 4 double superior rooms, got 3 superior and one normal size but was acctually a Penthouse. All rooms were very large, even the smallest one, absolutely clean, very comfy beds and pilows, nice LCD TVs. The kitchenettes are great, the self-make coffee machines too, the superior rooms even had large sitting areas with sofa and additional LCD. The price was very reasonable - 225USD per night. The view from the room is not spectacular, but you can't expect that since you are surrounded by tall financial buildings. The staff is friendly and on our check-out day we even had a guy at the reception who spoke our language (Slovenian). The restaurant in the hotel is not the best (neither for breakfast nor for dinner), but if you need a breakfast you have plenty of coffee shops arround the block with real Italian esspresso. Location is definitely great for eveyone who likes to stay downtown. The subway is on the corner of the hotel, wall street is a few steps away, wtc area is a few blocks off. The area is very quiet over the weekend, when the financial district is empty, over the week it gets crowded, but not noisy at all!

On our most recent trip we decided to use the points on his credit card to save money. We chose the Club Quareters Downtown (steps away from Wall Street), as it was in a familiar location to us (we typically stay at the Millenium Hilton). The hotel itself is average. The front desk staff is fairly pleasant and check-in was quick. We were in a hurry after check-in so I did not make much of the fact that when we got off on the 5th floor it smelled of smoke. I figured that it must be a smoking floor but not all rooms are smoking. We dropped our bags off quickly, not really surveying the room at left. Upon returning very late that night we realized that the room was itself a smoking room (outfitted with an ashtray etc) and definitely carrying the odor of smoke (which highly irritates my sinuses and lungs), although nothing like the hallway which might as well be a lounge pre-smoking ban days. Given how late it was and how exhausted we were, we just went to bed. Aside from the the fact that the room smelled like smoke it was fairly decent. The size was average for a NYC hotel room and it had no frills as it is primarily designed for a business traveler. We did have to call down for additional towels because although they knew there were 2 people to the room they only had just enough for one person. I did not sleep too well due to the smoke that first night and also because the light from the hallway (shining in from underneath the door) kept bothering until I threw a towel down to block it out. Lastly the noise from garbage trucks also contributed to the fact that I slept little. The next morning my husband went downstairs to ask for a different room (NON-smoking). THey were very accomodating and we found ourselves in a smaller room but one that did not irritate my asthma, so I had no problems. That night proved to be much better than the first and I actually slept. I would be somewhat hesistant to recommend this place for the following reasons......fairly dusty rooms, not a prime location for those who want to be in the middle of the action and not an entirely helpful staff when it came to leaving our bags for the day in the bell closet (they also charge $2 a bag). The smoking room issue was further irritating as my husband had called the previous day to make sure that the room we had was NON-SMOKING. Of course during that phone call the front desk confirmed that we were in a non-smoking room.

Yes at the weekend it was quiet, but in a nice way, still lots of tourists and people milling around, but on the weekdays it was buzzing with real New Yorkers buying hotdogs and going to work. Getting uptown was 15 minutes on the 2/3 subway from outside the hotel door. The room was very nicely decorated in a modern style and clean, not the biggest, for Americans but fine for Europeans, the shower room was definately small , but with a double size shower and plenty of hotwater, so no problem there. I requested, before I left ,a microwave in my room, which was there and all rooms have a an empty fridge which you can stock yourself from the supermarket right across the road open 7 days. Breakfast in the hotel was $12 plus tax for continental, but we ventured outside and had breakfast in the many cafes, all serving loads of hot and cold food, especially on Broadway. Try the 'Variety Cafe', just head towards the church at the top of Wall Street, you won't miss it and turn left on Broadway, the Cafe is up on your right, was under some scaffolding, so look out for it. Free wireless internet is available in your room, so take your laptop. Plus 2 pc's with printers in the lounge next to reception. Staff were fine, didn't have much interaction with them , but anything I asked was greeted with a smile and a positive response. Free water bottles and drinking water available on each floor, so you could stock up for the day, plus each floor had a guest cupboard with stocks of extra stuff like pillows and blankets, plus irons and ironing boards, just help yourself, but return the iron so others can use after you.

It would be too far a stretch of the imagination to call it luxurious, but on the other hand, it isn't down-market either. My room was exactly as the candid pictures indicate, though contrary to some of the reviews on this site, it was actually fairly spacious. It had all the facilities you would need for the average business trip (minus only a room safe), and it's main selling point - the location - just cannot be beaten. The commute to nearby Water Street was a matter of minutes, rather than the standard half-hour plus from Midtown (on a crowded subway train!). On holiday, it's perhaps not the best place to stay. The hotel and its surrounding area are much quieter at the weekend, though never unsafe, and although there are restaurants and local stores in the area, the best places to eat/visit are definitely further uptown. Having said that, subway lines 2&3 stop on Wall St, literally 20 seconds from the hotel, and if these are closed (as there were over the weekend of my stay) then all other lines are within walking distance, including the N&R, which take you directly to Times Square. In terms of the actual room, the furnishings were fairly modern and reliable, although my shower did make a very loud groaning sound when on full heat (not the nicest wake-up call for my neighbours!), and some mornings it took ten minutes or so to warm up. The air conditioning did not heat the room terribly well, either, and even though I was ten stories up I could still occasionally hear the subway below. But, the bed was comfortable, room service was quick with the food and after eight nights, having the option to order from five nearby eateries was a blessing! Overall, if on business then I would recommend this hotel. Its problems are fairly minor, and if convenience is what you're looking for then it doesn't get much better.

The hotel is used for businesses during the week and is open to the public on weekends. We got our room for $159 a night and let me tell you it was worth a lot more! The room was contemporary and designed well. There was a flat screen tv (loved it!!!) that looked to be about 26inches. The bathroom was immaculate! There wasn't a tub, instead a shower stall, which was perfect for New York because you don't really need to take a bath while you're in the city. We also stayed on the top floor so our ceilings were about 13 feet high!! It made the room feel huge! (I can't say whether the other floors had ceilings that high.) They did a great job designing the rooms and made the best of the space they had. You need a room key to use the elevator, which may seem annoying, but it was actually comforting and I felt safe knowing that you had to be a guest to get around. One of the best features is that each floor has a closet on it with extra blankets, pillows, irons, ironing boards, coffee, etc. It's perfect because you don't have to annoy housekeeping and wait forever, instead you can just get it yourself. Another great feature is that the hotel will deliver food to you from any restaurants near the hotel. We didn't take advantage of this because we were out in the city most of the time. The location of the hotel is perfect for anyone who likes to get away from the tourist areas of NYC. We usually go every year so it's nice to stay in downtown.

I'm a pretty easy going person, I call myself adventurous, but particular and a little bit of a Princess when it comes to where I plan to sleep and shower. The location is a key selling point. Right near NYSE and walking distance to Ground Zero. Though we were in the midst of the city, the hotel is tucked away on a one-way street and therefore contributed to a peaceful and tranquil stay. It is conveniently located near the subway, a drug store, and a Starbucks! These amenties, particularly the drug store, are a plus in consideration of all the airline carry-on restrictions these days. We stayed on the 11th floor, not far from the elevator. We did not take advantage of the on-site restaurant, only because we are in walking distance to other food places. Though the room is small (in comparison to Atlanta, Southern living), the room and bathroom appeared very clean and neat. The room was decorated with a modern style including wood paneling as the headboard, around the desk, and a sleek alarm clock, and flat screen TV. Everything was operable. The heat worked well, and the hot water lasted as long as I wanted to shower (thank goodness). The complimentary coffee wasn't bad either. Guests can access extra pillows, blankets, an iron and ironing board just a few steps outside your room in a hall closet stocked with these items. My interactions with the front desk were pleasant. One couple as we checked in loudly argued over the rate they were promised online, and the rate they were about to be charged, but we didn't have that problem. In the end, it sounded as if the hotel gave the people the lower rate. The team was professional and helpful. They were very knowledgeable and gave us subway directions to various destinations within the city. No wireless access in the rooms, but the lobby was equipped with 2 PCs, with printers!! That was a nice touch. I still had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes to get on (waiting for others to get off), but it was convenient, and as I mentioned, I really appreciated the printers.

They would give you directions & basic info but as far recommmending restaurants, sites to see and such, they had a ways to go. I do give one desk person the credit for friendliness because he gave me several band-aids for my blisters on my feet. We would consider staying there again or possibly one of their locations closer to Times Square.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't go back\u201d", "Author": "sixteencmg", "ReviewID": "UR5521628", "Content": "We stayed here last year, I guess before it was open to the public, but my company had an account. My husband and I hated it. We stayed at the penthouse (and as an another reviewer stated) the room wasn't special and actually seemed sub-par. Our blinds were broken and the room was overall very shabby. But the real problem was the location. I used to live in NY and thought ok this trip let's give downtown a try. Never again. It's a ghost town on the weekends and really the only time I feel unsafe in NYC is when I'm alone on a street, which was pretty much a constant around the hotel. It seemed like a 20 minute walk just to get up to Chinatown.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cA Solid Choice for Weekend visitors\u201d", "Author": "JoshuaVincent", "ReviewID": "UR5294796", "Content": "Club Quarters opens its rooms up to non-members on weekends. I never stayed before, but I will if I can now. My subway (#2 or #3) from Penn Station let me off across the street. I was checked in quickly, effieciently and with a smile (even though they were dealing with mobs of pouting Euro-types). I've stayed in literally dozens of hotels in NYC over the years, and I think my room was fairly spacious, it was well appointed, internet accesss was fast, HDTV on the wall, VERY comfortable bed, and I LOVE the fact that hallway closets store irons, blankets and as many coffee packets as you can drink, which is a mark of genius (I hate being left with decaf!). The room and bathrooms were a tiny bit banged-up, but were spotless. Check-out was just as easy with an effiicient clerk illustrating the automated check-out. It's Wall Street, so it's not in the tourist areas, and is quiet on the weekends (except for pouting Euro-types). As it is right off Wall Street, there was plenty of street lighting and more police than pedestrians at a late hour. For $165 with tax, I don't believe I could have done better on Memorial Day weekend with short notice.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cit was great!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5234513", "Content": "I had a great time here.
