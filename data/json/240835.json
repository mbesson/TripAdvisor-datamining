The staff was nasty. I asked if I could by chance get the complimentary upgrade due to being a member of Small Luxury Hotels, hotel clerk lied and I was told we already were. The room CLEARLY was not an upgrade. It was about 8x10, with just a small stand up shower, cracked bathroom tiles. Later, another hotel person confirmed we did NOT get the upgrade. The girl told us that was because my travel agent did not provide her with my Customer ID number for the Small Luxury Hotel club or provide any notes when booked. I happened to have the paperwork which included the customer ID number (lie #2), so she was caught lying too. We were told by a 3rd lie by the 3rd hotel rep we asked for help (his name was Ferdinando, I insisted on getting his name, none of them wore nametags, so I was finally smart enough to demand his name) we could either get an upgrade that night, or if we waited we'd get a suite the next night. Since we were going to Florence the next day, we opted for the Suite upon our return. When we returned from Florence, we were NOT moved into the suite, but into a slightly larger room. If we'd know that was going to be the case we would've moved the night before. We asked a hotel staff where a particular restaurant was, he said, \"I don't know, never heard of it\". He had a computer next to him, he could've at least looked up the address and let us know, we're good at following maps. So, overall the staff was dishonest, rude, and did not help with anything.

One commonality I notice among many reviews: the rudeness of the front desk staff and the small rooms. The front desk staff is not particularly helpful or friendly. There are so many wonderful, friendly people in Rome. I would fire these front desk clerks and get people to better represent the hotel. Although they weren't overtly rude to me, they were cold and unfriendly. It's true the room was painfully small, but the bed was comfortable, the internet very strong, and I did like the bathroom. The location is fantastic...down a small, quiet street lined with art galleries in a very chic part of town. It's a quiet little corner of Rome to escape and relax after a day plying through hordes of people sightseeing. The team who serves breakfast was fantastic (Breakfast was delicious, by the way. Lovely assortment of fruits, cheeses, juices and wonderful coffee). The wait staff was extremely attentive and polite. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again.

The hotel is near the Steps but located on the very quiet and charming Via Margutta about 200 meters from the center of the tourist scrum. The rooms are not big but nice. The hotel provides a lovely breakfast in the morning and has a pleasant bar space for drinks in the evening. For a longtime, the bar was presided over by Maurizio, a charming guy who seemed to speak a dozen languages and made the best martini in Europe. Maurizio is now gone. The Hotel Art is still nice but it has not kept up with the times. The wifi connections, for example, are nonexistent in the rooms and barely functioning in the lobby area. The business center charges a signficant fee for internet connections and then does not always deliver consistent access. The fitness room is small and barely functional especially by the standards of most modern hotels even in Rome. I still like this hotel a lot and will probably continue to stay there despite missing the advice of Maurizio and being annoyed by the above concerns.

A little annoyed at how stiff the mattress was and the fact that they pushed two beds together to form the double bed, but that's a Roman thing, and hardly unique to the hotel. We still got a great night's sleep. We were advised that the internal air conditioning controls didn't work, so if we wanted any adjustments to the temperature, we should call the front desk. But we were checking in during late October, so temperature wasn't an issue. Query if things would have gone so well in August, but anyone who visits Rome in August already knows they're taking their chances, so I'm not docking any points. The style is very modern, and makes some bold design moves. But you should know that by now if you visit the website at least once, so can everyone stop complaining about the color scheme, already? What was far more important to me was that the concierge was in good humor when he checked us in. He took care to recommend a number of different restaurants to us, and the one we chose was excellent. And the concierge was also very cool about responding to my e-mails requesting a restaurant reservation the last second before we checked in. He was very kind in explaining that the restaurant was closed on Sundays, and so he wasn't able to accommodate our reservation request. And he said it with grace so I didn't feel like the dopey American I was, so kudos for that. The bar / cafe staff were also very friendly, and the hotel's dining area itself is a comfortable place to relax after a long day of walking. Finally, we took advantage of the breakfast spread, and it shouldn't be missed. They provide extremely high quality breakfast options, and large portions at that. OK, and finally for real this time, the place is extremely well situated in the Spanish Steps area, but it's tucked away in an alley, so our room was extremely quiet with respect to outdoor noise.

It is very elegant, new, and the design is very very special. The hotel itself is already a piece of art. The breakfast restaurant is very relaxing, with big lounge chairs instead of the usual high uncomfortable dining chairs, good to enjoy a relaxing morning coffee and the good inclusive breakfast. The hotel has a top location, anything you want to see in Rome is at easy walking distance . The main shopping area is round the corner, as are many bars and restaurants. The \"Spanish steps\" are 100 meters away. We travel around the world a lot, both for business and pleasure, and we mostly don't like the typical tourist hotels, but we found this hotel a real gem. That is why we could not understand some of the negative comments made by some writers to tripadvisor. We went through the guest book and 99% of all comments written were very positive. Perhaps some writers who experienced a problem used tripadvisor to vent their frustration. One writer wrote about that he could not sleep because of a crying baby next door and faulted the hotel of giving him a room next to a family with a baby. Sorry you cannot blame the hotel for a crying baby. We anyhow found the rooms very well isolated and quiet. Another one complained a bout the air condition. We had no problem, temperatures could be adjusted to anything we liked. But this writer also told that more guests had this problem, so i guess that their might have been a technical problem. In that case the hotel should have told this and give the guest a discount. The hotel is not cheap, perhaps twice the price of the cheap tourist hotels around the termini train station, but still half the price of the big chain hotels, but with double the elegance. We found the hotel real value for money. Rooms are not big, but reasonable and very well equipped and decorated. If you prefer a bit more space book a suprior room. Everything you need is in the room, a plasma TV, internet with a remote keybord.

We just got back from Rome and my husband and I stayed at Hotel Art for a week. The service is not the same, their attitude has changed and they are not friendly. The staff are the same as our last stay but they have an unfriendly attitude, the hotel owns one wine opener, the guy at the bar had to come and open our bottle of wine and take the opener with him. The staff don't go out of their way to do somehting for you, when you ask them a question or request information they don't really want to do it, they look like they are pushing themselves. This experience was with the older staff, there were couple of new people which were much nicer and friendlier. The aircondition gets shut off from the front desk, I called from the room to ask them to please turn the air off, they didn't, after five minutes I called again and they guy in front says when I'm finished with what I'm doing I will turn it off. Most the hotels in Rome have breakfast included, so don't get excited about their breakfast, the breakfast used to be great but it's not as good of a quality as it used to be. At the last night of our stay, I requested an address to an Osteria which we had been before, he writes the address down on a post it and I kindly requested to show me where it is in the map and he responded he doens't exactly know where it is, without even asking or wanting to find out. We requsted for a scale to weigh our luggages before leaving, they said we only have two scales which are in our two suites, after an hour and my husband's effort they gave us the scale. It's the little things which make your stay very special. We had to wait for everything, call a few times and they made us feel like if they do somehting for us after our secound call, they are doing us a major favor. You would think that a four star hotel has to give you a good service more than one wine opener and two scales. Overall the service is just okay, the mojority of staff besides the bell man and two of the new people are just very unfriendly, lazy and their attitude is very poor, I wouldn't stay there again.

The bedroom was adequate and comfortable and definitley compact , if this was a superior twin the twin must be a cupboard. The bathroom(no bath) was also small and once again style took the place of functionality with a fancy shower head that pointed most places but down. The walls had funky green glass wall tiles three or more of which were cracked, the toilet cistern required a bit of fiddling to stop the water constantly running and the finishing around the shower door was unprofessional. The rooms and hotel were spotless and the housekeeping team were most cheerful and immaculatley dressed a real credit to them. Breakfast was very good with a large selection and the courtyard was very relaxing. The fitness room would be as well closed as it want open either of the two days we were there a complete waste of space(in my opinion) The staff at breakfast were all very nice and attentive. I would reccommend this hotel for its excellent location and i know that quality in any capital city comes at a premium but the operators of this hotel seem to belive that corridors on each landing of different colour neon type lights make it somehow special and this is probably the worst hotel gimmick as far as a usp goes that i have ever seen this is just Art for Arts sake. I had also notified the hotel that i was bringing my daughter here to celebrate her eighteenth birthday and not a mention was made a simple happy birthday on arrival would have been nice, less preening and more customer focus!

There are lots of good things about the Art hotel but the location is definitely one of the highlights. It is literally a 5 minute walk to the Spanish steps but because you are one road removed from the main street the hotel is actually quiet and secluded, while at the same time being right in the middle of things. My second favourite thing was the breakfast. They have an extensive breakfast and everything was high quality. I have had worse breakfasts at better, or at least higher ranked, hotels. D\u00e9cor is also a plus. The entrance to the hotel is down a long outdoor hallway and then you walk into the lobby. The outside courtyard is very well done and the indoor lobby is also a great place to just relax and have a drink. Staff was actually very friendly. If I sound a little surprised it's because my experience at most Roman hotels has not been so good. But I found the staff both helpful and friendly really going out of their way to help out. OK so what's the downside? The only downside is that the rooms are small -- and I mean they are small (makes the rooms at the W Lexington in New York look like mansions). The bathroom is particularly tight. But they are very clean and the beds were comfortable and the room was cool in the summer when I stayed there and warm during my winter stay. Perhaps the other downside is that the work-out facilities were also a little small. Good equipment though, really quite new and they had a steam room which was nice. But no more than 2 people in the steam room. And you really couldn't have more than 4-5 people in the gym, tops. Personally the room size did not really bother me. We were too busy seeing the city and shopping to spend a lot of time in the room. And I am of the opinion that when I am in a place like Rome I prefer location, and cleanliness to room size. But if you need a big room (ie you may be a little heavier than your ideal weight) you may want to look elsewhere. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Rome. You really cannot beat the location, and the place has a great feel to it with friendly staff and a great breakfast. If you are staying for a long period of time (more than a week) the room size might bother you but if it's for 3-4 nights it shouldn't be a problem.

As a previous reviewer mentions, the hotel has hardwood floors so it can be more noisy than a hotel with carpeting, however, I thought the only noise problem was people out late in the courtyard smoking and laughing. The temperature of the room is controlled by the Hotel, however, you can call down to the lobby to have the temperature adjusted. I had mine lowers to 23 C without issue. You may want to note if you open the windows, the air automatically shuts off. The staff is very helpful, and very friendly. In fact, once you check in they hand you a map of Rome and circle the hotel. They are able to recommend local restaurants, and tips for taking a taxi around town. They also recommend some walking trips & guides in the city which I would definitely look into next time I am in Rome. In addition, they offer a car service for a fee which is quite comparable to other local liveries. It is worthwhile to book a room which includes breakfast which is a very good buffet spread: many different fruits, cereal, toast, muffins and danish, several juices, bacon, eggs, sausage, salamis, cheeses, yogurts, coffee, expresso, et al. The Hotel is located very near the Spanish Steps, however, off a side street so surprisingly quiet considering its closest to one of the busiest sites in Roma.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria,TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "coachkatie", "ReviewID": "UR15995591", "Content": "We are an older couple in our mid 60's and loved this place because of the closeness to a lot of the sights.

They do not provide iron and ironing board in the rooms, claiming that it is a fire hazard. But I suspect the real reason is that it would be difficult to fit the ironing board in the room. To get something ironed, you must use their laundry service instead, but be warned that this is only open Monday to Friday. Room was very stuffy with little air circulation, and the temperature control seemed to be broken. We had to leave the window open every night.

The hotel is ultra modern in decor with painted hardwood floors in the corridors. The downside to this ultra modern appearance is that the lack of carpets in the hallways and rooms creates more noise than would be the case with carpeted hotels. My initial room overlooked the hotel's internal courtyard where there are some seats where guests can have a drink during the night if they wish - it was a little bit noisy so I asked to be moved and was. The room I was moved to was reasonably quiet. I was able to sleep in this hotel after I was shifted to another room and I am a light sleeper. The noise in the corridors was a little bit annoying, and I would have preferred less corridor noise, but it was relatively quiet during sleeping hours i.e. 11pm to 8am as there is obviously little activity during those hours. There is no individually controlled air conditioning in the rooms - if you want the temperature raised or lowered you have to call down to the front desk. This was not a big issue as the air conditioning worked well and was lovely and cool, but I would have preferred individually controlled air conditioning. I was very impressed with the staff at the front desk who were very friendly and helpful without being pretentious in any way. In fact, all the staff were great at this hotel and work very hard to please the guests. This is a 4 star hotel so it is not as expensive as the 5 star Hotel de Russie [where the cast of Ocean's 12 stayed when they were in Rome] or the Westin Rome. The Hotel Art has an impressive ultra modern entrance and appearance throughout and the breakfast buffet was great. I wasn't blown away by this hotel, due to reservations about the noise in the corridors due to lack of carpet in the corridors, but this hotel was ok for the price. I can't complain. Hotels in Rome are very expensive and this place was very modern and well located. I expected 4 star and I got it and I liked the hotel's ultra modern \"cool\" appearance. The hotel is in a good location right by the Spanish steps. The guests at the hotel were fairly upmarket - the place is not cheap so that is what you would expect. Next time I go to Rome I think I would go for a more traditional hotel - perhaps the Intercontinental de la ville or one of the hotels on the Via Veneto but I did not have a bad stay here. The buffet breakfast is particularly memorable with a lovely atmosphere in the large breakfast room at the entrance of the hotel and lovely food. Better still it was included in my room rate.

The location is absolutely ideal: via Margutta is a very quiet street near Piazza di Spania and at reasonable walking distance from almost everything one wishes to see while in Rome. We had also reserved a private limo airport transfer from the airport with the hotel. The driver was an extremely pleasant gentleman. The problem is that he could not find us at the meeting point he said, although our plane had not been delayed and we had been waiting for several minutes. The other problem is that he had parked his car in the public parking of the airport which obliged us to walk to the car with our suitcases for 5 minutes, which is not what you expect from a costly private transfer. Welcome at reception was just polite, not very friendly. We had been confirmed an early check in and late check out by e-mail and when we arrived at the hotel this was not true. We did not bother to ask if we could stay a bit longer than the official check out time on the next day. On more than one occasion, we had to wait until the person at reception eventually finished their private phone conversations before taking us into consideration. The double bedroom was an average size, the bathroom average size also with a large bath tub and shower. The single bedroom was actually VERY small with almost no space around the bed.

Not random hammering, jackhammering. We asked to be moved and they did so, without a problem- we came back downstairs and they didn't even need us to say anything, they said \"we'll switch your room\"- seems like they had had a problem pawning that room off on other guests as well. Our second room seemed fine, but literally was so tiny there was no room to move. NO place for suitcases AT ALL- we had to completely repack everything each night just to have room to walk. The bathroom was ridiculous. The shower was large enough to stand upright in- ladies- forget shaving your legs while staying at the Hotel Art!! Now here's the thing- I wrote ALL of this off on the size being just \"how European rooms are\" but the next 3 hotels we stayed at on our trip in other cities- which we paid EXACTLY the same amount for per night as at Hotel Art- disproved that theory with their spacious rooms and bathrooms. DO NOT SETTLE FOR THIS PLACE! It is not worth the money. Their neon-looking hallways looked nothing like in the pics, either- expect, dirty, black scuffed floors and walls. The kicker was, however, when we checked out. We were told it would take 5 minutes for a taxi- when one did not show for THIRTY MINTUES- I went back in (after asking them to re-call the taxi company 2 previous times) and demanded they do something as we were going to miss our train- and they looked at me and told me, shrugged his shoulders, and said \"Sorry, nothing I can do\" WHAT???? 330 euro a night and they cant even help you get in a taxi. They also have only a few people that speak good English, so it got to be kind of difficult at times.

We were there when the temperature was in the 90's and the air conditioning was inadequate (one of those new energy mangement systems that automatically turns off when you leave the room) such that the room was constantly too hot and certainly no escape from the heat of the city. Further, our room was on an interior air shaft such that it was impossible to get any outside ventialtion and the room was very dark. (A room with an oustside exposure would no doubt be better). We found the desk and concierge staff to be mixed. One young lady tried very hard to be helpful, but the rest seemed to be put off by our questions and not very knowledgeable about tours or how to do anything that was not in the general vacinity. No real \"insider suggestions\". In retrospect, we wondered if this was in part do to the fact that they had limited ability to speak English nonetheless whatever the reason they were not helpful.
