Even though I requested a rear room the place was booked and the owner would not move us. The owner/managers attitude was you can stay in that room or you may look for another hotel because I am booked. The room was clean but the bed was like a rock as well as the pillows. Made our Venice experience a tiring visit. Last but not least is the never ending sewer smell in the 1st floor entryway.

Lovely modern shower room. Frederica on the desk was so lovely and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, extra pillows, ensuring we were happy with our return water taxi transfer etc. Breakfast was adequate for us, we do not expect a full course, buffet breakfast in Italy. Beautiful decor and furniture, it really has character and may original features - our room had a lovely beamed ceiling.

The hotel was listed in the Rick Steves guidebook and tripadvisor.com reviews were generally favorable. I would also recommend this hotel, as it is very convenient to the St Mark's Square area, but far enough of away from the madding crowd to ensure peace & quiet at night. It is located in a historic building that oozes Renaissance ambiance. The cleanliness factor was actually quite good, and I have rather severe OCD issues. For a hotel, this one was maintained decently. However, as with most hotels in Italy, the showers are excessively small, which really grosses me out. If only they would dispense with those unsightly bidets and the revolting imagery they subsequently conjure, there would easily be room for a full-sized shower. Also, breakfast was rather insipid affair, with only ersatz coffee & juice, and bread, bread, and more bread. A carbohydrate overload, to be sure. The service also left something to be desired, although the night manager (a portly Asian guy) assisted me, in his peculiarly comatose way, while I frantically attempted to locate my lost luggage. I somehow suspect the manager/owner would not have been so accommodating, as he had a subtle way of making one feel like something he just scraped off his shoe. One day, I was cold and tired and sick to death of lukewarm, overpriced cappuccino (which is 3/4 foam anyway!), so I asked the manager if I might prevail upon him for a cup of coffee to enjoy in my room. He seemed appalled that I should suggest such a thing, and I was made to feel that I should apologize for my provincial misstep. Overall, however, my opinion is that the positive attributes of the hotel outweighed the negative, and I would consider staying here again if I should ever find myself in Venice, which I probably won't - it's overrated and overpriced, as is the rest of Italy.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cAn old, roomy hotel in a convenient location\u201d", "Author": "ConnTravelor", "ReviewID": "UR37019893", "Content": "Finding this hotel the first time can be tricky since it doesn't really look like a hotel.

The service was great. The location is actually very close to the Grand Canal and St. Mark's, once you get your bearings this becomes apparent.
