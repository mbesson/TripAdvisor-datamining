It's quite close to the airport too.The room while small (and too grey in my opinion) is very modern with an open bathroom/shower area. Wired Internet is free (not wireless) and you have free pay-TV.The breakfast is quite good, the bar is open late and the cocktails and long drinks are OK, but the red background color burns your eyes late at night.I would rank it at the same level as the NH which is 2 minutes away and better than the Novotel (10 minutes away).", "Date": "Dec 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR622638989", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nico_ch"}, {"Content": "Amazing modern hotel in Frankfurt The Innside hotel is a uber modern hotel in a business district outside Frankfurt. Perfectly suited to business people, but as tourists with a car, it suited us fine. It's space-theme modernist decor is stunning, and although the rooms are small (like most hotels in Europe) the ingenious use of the space is spectacular. Service is perfectly Germanic, and everything works. We love travelling in Germany for the same reasons we buy German cars, everything works as it should. Perhaps that's why British hotels are erratic and rusty; Japanese hotels are clever but tiny, American hotels are flashy and poorly assembled......The Innside hotels we've stayed in certainly reinforce this line of thought.", "Date": "Oct 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR523022482", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Mozza47"}, {"Content": "Worth a trip to Frankfurt just for the hotel Best hotel I've ever stayed in. An expensive hotel, very chic and modern, but at a bargain price - $75 a night excluding breakfast, on the weekend. The taxi ride from the airport was 18 Euros and the subway ride back was 3.90 Euros directly to the aiport terminal 2 from 2 blocks from the hotel. The subway system was a great way to get into the city proper or the Haupbahnhof from the hotel at a minimum of effort and price. The room was superior in everyway and the staff helpful. The bar was great at night, and the area was quiet as it is really the business section with no residences within a two block radius. We tried the breakfast buffet one morning (30 Euros for 2 of us) and it was fairly sumptuous in the German manner (meat, meat, meat). And the fitness center - though no pool - was fantastic. Sauna, steam room, some fitness equipment, great showers, and a massage area or just a lounge. Makes a trip to Frankfurt worthwhile.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR124170804", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mccolleen"}, {"Content": "Worth the Effort I needed a convenient hotel for a long layover between Lufthansa and Condor. I just wanted some place convenient to the FRA airport and a reasonable rate. Since I was traveling as a 'single' and only 18 hours in the city, I wasn't interested in seeing the sights. Innside Hotel was the right answer for me. However, I forgot my confirmation sheet and had a horrible time trying to find the location from the airport info desk to give to the taxi driver (my stupid fault). But it was well worth it! Lovely quiet hotel with stellar design. I wouldn't recommend it for a family or even a couple since the room is fairly compact (i.e., small). The bathroom/shower is part of the bedroom - open concept. Toilet is in small type closet. Location would be horrible for sight seeing but would be fantastic for a business traveler with business in that location. I walked about two blocks and found a great yuppie high-end grocery store. Bought all sorts of sausages, wine and goodies and had a picnic in my room! Oh, I only paid 75 Euros/night but I think it was a 'weekend' rate. I tried to get the same rate for my return flight and it was considerably higher!!!", "Date": "Sep 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR884072492", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "waynegoat"}, {"Content": "Nice  Great business hotel. Excellent sleek design for the rooms and furniture, a choice of magazines in the room, the famous fully-transparent shower within the room.

Also, there is a restaurant which going with the theme of this hotel serves unusual (non-traditional) but tasty dishes.I cannot wait to stay there again-it is really an experience....", "Date": "Jun 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR787944365", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "andywa"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel !!!!
