I'm sure an actual \"review\" of the hotel and amenities isn't really relevant anymore (as it was so long ago) BUT I will say that I had a great stay at this hotel and would definitely go back, even now that they've changed to the Verdanza. The location was perfect. The beach was in close proximity. Approximately one block up. There were many eateries around in walking distance (including an Ihop for all my fellow pancake lovers!). I traveled with my best friend so we did a bit of partying at Drums and Club Brava (inside El San Juan Hotel & Casino) both were in walking distance. Safety was never a concern. We even took the local bus into Old San Juan. If you want to be close to everything, this is definitely a good option.

Upon arrival the lobby was clean and the staff seemed nice. We registered and got a room over looking the pool, which by the way it took us 20 minutes to find this room and we had to drag our luggage up the stairs because the elevator did not run in the outside rooms over looking pool. When we got to the room after 20 mins. of looking our keys did not work and a housekeeper opened the door for us, we then went to the front desk and got new keys but it took 10 mins. every time we had returned to the room to open, so I guess it was a lock problem. The room was terrible, it was so humid in the room that our clothes in our luggage were wet. The tv had about 5 of the same channels that were on 10 stations...(the same channel's), the TV also was not watchable not only for poor channels but it had static lines constantly and the channels changed sometimes on it's own. We stayed two nights Feb 25th and 26th, 2012. Upon checking out to go to the airport I had prepaid my room with expedia and went to the front desk to give my keys and had to wait 30 minutes because there were people lined up to complain about there keys not working and tv problems. Finally it was my turn and the guy at the front desk gave me a receipt and wanted me to sign it. I looked it over which normally I don't but this had been such a nightmare I guess I felt something was up. The hotel charged us for a movie, named (IMMORTAL COMBAT), or something like that! I told the guy first off we did not watch tv because it had only about 5 channels 10 times each and the tv had so much static you could not view it, Secondly my husband is 57 and I am 43 we do not even know what that movie is and have never ordered a movie in our life. He told me he was not removing the charge and I told him I was not signing that paper with the charge. I asked for a manager and he went into the back and said I had to pay for it. I then asked for a manager to come up front and he said that I would have to wait because one she was not there yet. We moved aside and the very next person in line complained that her tv was changing channels itself and had bad static and her key did not work...(same problem's that we had). We waited for two hours and finally after three other customers were upset for us they said that they were not leaving until a manager came. I guess now I had a line of people that had problems and felt sorry that we were being done wrong. This rude clerk called the manager and spoke in Spanish which I do not speak, but anyways I am not sure what was said but finally they removed this charge. It only took 2 1/2 hours! We left that day and when we got to Omaha, NE I had a 104 degree temp. and had to be admitted to the hospital with a Viral Respitory Infection. I was told that because that room had been so humid and not very clean that a virus can spread easily in that enviroment. It took me 2 weeks to recover from this. I can't say for sure I got that virus from the hotel but I am almost 100% sure of it. I was shocked at how many people were in the lobby complaining the morning we checked out, so my advice to Anyone thinking of saving a few bucks by staying here please be advised it will cost you more in the long haul. There are so many other choices include vrbo condo's that you can stay in or other hotels, which by the way embassy suites was our pre cruise hotel and it was wonderful and not that much more.

I was able to get a beautiful rose boquet for my wife for just under $70 USD (FTD would have been the same at home in WI). The flowers were in the room when we arrived and they were simply amazing, and they were still beautiful the day we left a week later. The Verdanza also took the liberty of sending what they called \"a small plate of chocolate covered strawberries\" to the room. The strawberries were complimentary. This was no small plate! It was huge and it featured a box made entirely of chocolate with chocolate covered strawberries and blackberries as well as whipped cream. The presentation was so awesome and it was certainly more than a \"small plate\". This went far beyond my expecataions, in fact, I was completely blown away.

We had a room on the 8th floor, where there is a gym and a roof deck with excellent views of San Juan and the mountains beyond. The hotel is a block from the beach, but the sea was clearly visible from our small balcony. Our bathroom was small but everything was clean. The bed was large and comfortable. The best thing abut the hotel was the pool and hot tub. It is possible to walk to the beach in five minutes, but as the beach was pretty windy, we elected to stay in the more sheltered pool area. Both the pool and the hot tub are a good size and the spray park was kind of fun too. I like the fact that they allow you to hang out in the hot tub at night. The food was excellent. A special mention goes to the Risretto coffee bar, which has fantastic coffee, and the Di Vino wine bar. Owner Dario is a real character and has a fantastic knowledge of wine. The Asian bistro is also good. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a bad meal at the hotel.. There were a couple of negatives. Remember that things take longer here, not least the water in the hotel room which on the 8th floor took about 10 minutes to become hot. Also, the elevators were a little old and tired and could do with an update. Overall, this was an excellent choice for the price.

I am glad that I did and can recommend this establishment to anyone who want reasonably priced accommodation in an excellent location. The hotel is so close to the airport that the taxi price is very modest and it takes no more than 5-7 minutes from arrivals. This used to be a Holiday Inn and is still recovering from neglect over some period of time. I was assigned a room quickly and this was of a fair size - not enormous but then I am alone and need to sleep, bathe, and change. I do not need vast areas to cross. I thought that the position of the bed under the air conditioner was odd as cold air would be dropping all night so I turned it off and it was fine. Likewise the clock was plugged into a well unit which meant that there was a wire stretched across the wall. It was not dangerous but it just seemed odd. The front desk were charming - they offered my a fruit cup on both arrivals (I stayed twice during my trip) and did all they could if I had any queries. I had one problem in the main restaurant and this was dealt with by the manager (a kitchen problem) in a proper and honest fashion.. One could eat outside by the pool which was pleasant as I found that the air conditioning was so high indoors that it was chilly enough to need a sweater!). The great find was the Asian restaurant. The food was delicious and very well priced, beautifully cooked and the portions were generous. Moreover it does not shut at some ridiculously early hour as do so many places. I ate here several times including Christmas Eve after mass. We were seated at 10.15 and there was no fuss, no bother, no looking at watches. nor worse starting to clean the place before the guests have finished. It is most unpleasant trying to have a conversation with a vacuum cleaner running amok! There is also a rather good bar with excellent friendly staff and there is also a rather chic (especially for Puerto Rico) wine bar. One can drink and eat there or outside should one prefer.I do wish that they would sort out the parking though as I really feel that parking should be offered to one's guest - but that is just my thought. Although my room was on the \"airport side\" I was not bothered by aircraft noise and I slept extremely well. The swimming pool is delightful as were a group of young men who seemed to be part of a swimming team. Ons of them managed to break the cover to to the filter controls. This cover flew into the pool leaving a hole which could have caused someone injury had someone walked by the pool and not noticed this. This was treated with complete indifference by the person who had caused this and whilst this was an accident - no one (except me) bothered reporting this. It was dealt with promptly and efficiently. Clearly this hotel has a few issues that it has inherited but they are being addressed and I repeat that this hotel is very pleasant, has good facilities and is only a short walk from the beach.

The Verdanza is a short ride from the airport (I think the taxi cost $15 with luggage?) and check in was a breeze (we booked through Orbitz.) When we got the room there was a mini fridge and a nice tv which was nice to watch the sports we were missing out on because we were away from home. They had all the major channels. We walked down to the lobby for dinner the first night because we were tired and had a nice dinner- you can see our review on that on Tripadvisor as well. We rented a car through the car rental place but only after we rented it online- we saved $30 doing this- the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special hotel offer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the guy offered us was $65 for a day for the regular size car- we went online through my phone in the hotel room and booked it online for $35 a day. We chose to fill it up with gas on our own and saved money that way- the guy said it would be cheaper to fill up with him but it was cheaper for us to fill up ourselves. We drove out to El Yunque and to the Bacardi distillery and had a nice day for not very much money- I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for a tour to do these things as driving is not complicated- just one word of caution, your GPS may or may not work- both of our GPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s did not work so we wished we had printed directions from the Rainforest to the Bacardi Factory because we got lost and my Spanish is not as good as I remembered. \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 Anyways, back to the hotel.

As an afterthought we decided to look around for a hotel in Isla Verde and though every hotel was sold out this one wasn't. So, the hotel property itself has the makings of a decent place and is moderately on the high end of a midlevel hotel (or low end of a high end hotel). Lobby was nice, and the room was surprisingly well apportioned and decorated. Nice bathroom, work table with internet with a couple of full size bottles of fiji water on the house, big comfortable bed, and a nice flat panel tv. We didn't see the pool area so I can't comment. The gym was ok, generally what you would expect of a hotel- nothing spectacular (though I would STRONGLY avoid staying on the floor that houses the gym since the potent smell of gym people's hard work was very prevalent everywhere). The restaurant we went to (one of three they have on property) , adjacent to the pool (eighty20 bistro) was ok. Food was alright, service was a bit lacking but overall it was fine. Service- the BIG miss, the one that cost this place two stars, and made us leave. So, there we are after a long, active, and wonderful two weeks (two nights left to go) trip through the island, having just gotten back from Culebra (definitely suggest a trip there) we wait to check in. There was someone in front of us, one person, and well, we continue to wait, and wait. 25 minutes in total (now, even island time and pace was offended by this length. We, however, didn't care all that much, so I only mention it for your information). We check in, getting the complimentary coconut ice-cream (a VERY NICE TOUCH). We had previously been staying at the double tree by Hilton (which we LOVED) but decided to change it up. When we checked in we told them we were booking for one night, but would likely stay two, asked for and were granted a late check out so we could decide and went up to our room for the night. Ah, the joy of sleeping after a long trip. We doing just that when at 7:30 a.m. we get a loud and urgent knocking on the door. uh, ok. It was housekeeping. I did not want to be answering the door for housekeeping...at 7:30 am. \"we are still sleeping\" I yawned and was left in peace. Kind of annoying but ok, it's done right? Wrong. Half an hour later... knocking. Every hour (and with this, I am deadly serious) until at 12 the supervisor comes a knocking to give us the business because the maid had to clean up and rudely stated that we needed to get going. WTfing hockey sticks?? I had previously explained to the maid that we were staying another night and didn't want our room cleaned. Guessing that message didn't get through. So, at that, I had had enough and let the supervisor have the business, that it was obscene to come calling that early, and I wouldn't even expect that from a freaking motel eight. That we had intended to stay but because of this were not and that I had full intention of complaining, all the while in a big way writing her name down in dramatic fashion on a piece of paper to illustrate how things were working out (checking in at 11:30 pm heading to bed at around 1 I was all bluster and peacock feathers). And I did just that. Complained. The very sweet and professional front desk agent was, rightfully, mortified (as well as very confused) when I explained what had happened and that we were leaving for greener pastures. She immediately offered to buy us breakfast (we obliged) and asked what she could do to keep us. \"take money off either this night or the next\". She, apparently, was unable to do either. She said she would speak immediately to her manager, and I suggested someone tell the housekeeping staff that that was simply unacceptable. And with that...we went back to the hotel we love!

Now I planned a birthday getaway for my mother. I had bought a getaway package in which I chose El San Juan Resort and Casino but due to the hurricane and loss of electricity I was called by my travel agent and given the option to change dates to stay at the same resort or change resort/hotel. I was unable to change the dates so I decided to just pick another hotel. Before choosing Verdanza I checked the reviews. I seen some great reviews and a few bad ones. Now theres always those unsatisfied people that you can bend backwards for and yet something is still not right. So I overlooked the bad reviews and went based on the good reviews plus how the pics of the hotel are clearly beautiful. The location is great!! So we arrived at the hotel, the lady at the front desk was very nice allowed us to check in early. Once we passed the beautiful main lobby and restaurant and entered the elevator we noticed a horrible odor of mold...yes mold. The previous reviews of mold is most def true. Theres no way that smell can go unnoticed. We stayed on the fifth floor. Walking down the hall the smell remained. I thought ugh maybe it's because of the rain from the hurricane...let me give this place the benefit of the doubt. Our room was beautiful. The furniture in our room was fairly new. The bathroom was very small. The shower force was absolutely horrible. The sad part was that the room had a slight odd odor. In which we woke up congested every morning. We ate Coladas...The waiter was very nice, food was amazing!! We rented a car from Dollar Car Rental which is based out of Verdanza hotel. Well the rental was last minute but as we got the keys no one told us we had to pay parking. I didnt realize til days later when they kept asking me my room number and I finally ask for what. I assumed because I was staying at that hotel I would have free parking. Nonetheless no one informed me previously which I thought was deceptive. When I spoke to management about it, his response was \"Its posted on our website\". In which I explained how I didn't look at their website because 1) I wasn't suppose to stay here and 2) I didn't intend on renting a car. Anyway that was a lost cause, and management didnt seem to care that I the customer felt deceived. Ok! So that morning I told management I did not want housekeeping in my room and that if I needed something I would come ask for it. He said okay. Sure enough, later that afternoon when we got back out beds were made. Someone clearly came into my room. When I called to complain the managements response was \"Did you leave a do not disturb sign on the door?\" Hello...I told the manager directly that wasn't good enough. He said he would speak to housekeeping's supervisor. Either way my rights as a customer at the hotel was clearly violated. Housekeeping didnt even have any fault because most likely the manager didnt relay the message. Great management!! Some of the employees were very nice while others such as that specific manager, were rude individuals. And thats an understatement. Also, we had the buffet included in our stay every morning. Well our first morning, I get a bill for 30.00 I told the lady It was included in my stay but she had no clue. Now if I would not have paid attention and signed the bill...without realizing it was adding up on a tab to my room to be charged to my card before I leave I would have paid 30 a day for breakfast for two. I stormed to the front desk and got it all settled. But I should not have had to. Overall, the hotel looks beautiful and the location is great but it is def not worth it. There are several hotels in the Isla Verde strip. El San Juan looks beautiful and Its a block away. I was astonished of how elegant they make the place out to seem but yet the service is really horrible, people are rude, and theres a horrible smell of mold. Our shower ceiling had a little bit of mold. I think a lot of work would have to be done to get rid of the smell. And to think they clean that place every day all day long. I think its to hide the smell. I noticed it smells stronger before they began cleaning than after. Good luck!! Hope someone finds this review helpful and actually trust me :) p.S I didnt run into roaches or any bugs at that but I wouldnt put anything past the Verdanza Hotel.

At the time it was a Holiday Inn and we decided to stay here because we enjoyed our other vacations at Holiday Inn's and the pictures looked decent for a 2 night stay before leaving on our cruise. Well we weren't disappointed and had a wonderful time, the hotel was clean the pool crystal clear and the staff very knowledgable about the island and very attentive and extremely polite. We even saw a couple celebrating an anniversay in their catering rooms. We were so happy with our stay that we decided the next time we vacationed in Puerto Rico this would be our place to stay. Fast forward to 2011 we were going to vacation in Puerto Rico in July, this time taking our 15 year old son with us. We decided what better place to stay. I couldn't find it online using the Holiday Inn website and decided to call, it was then I found that it was no longer owned by them and now being called hotel Verdanza. I was a little skeptical at first but went on their website, they seemed ok and the price was right and booked a 5 day stay at the hotel. Well my title tells it all. From the moment we walked in I was able to tell the difference. The Lobby was ok and clean, but the atmosphere was different the staff was not as attentive and knowledgable as they were the last time we visited. The room seemed as if it hadn't been updated since the last time we were there, you would think if they purchased the hotel from someone they would make some type of renovation and you could tell none were made. They just purchased the hotel and kept it business as usual. The lamp shade had rust, maybe from a leak from somewhere it smelled a little musty and the bathroom was no better. There were rust stains and the shower smelled as if they had a mold problem in the past. My husband and I also complained about the water pressure which wasn't the greatest and the concierge's response when asked what would happen if they could not fix the pressure was \"Well we will try and fix it and if we can't then we'll discuss what COULD be done\". Not reassuring in the least, but that wasn't even the tip of the iceberg, the worst part of the stay was the pool, when I went to the back I noticed the water was a little cloudy, I mentioned something to my husband and he asked that we try to make the best of our vacation, he mentioned it could have been because they're were so many people staying at the hotel that weekend, it was due to the amount of lotions and body oil's people were putting on, and that they have to pass inspections so it couldn't be as bad as I was imagining it was. While swimming I kept seeing strands of hair floating in the water, grossed me out, but it was July in Puerto Rico and I was hot, I figured I would just cool off and not try to think about it too much. Well 3 days later my son starts to cough and complain about a sore throat, I give him some aspirin and kept him hydrated so he would be able to kick whatever bug was trying to make him sick. Then the following day my throat starts hurting and to top it off I feel a tinglig on my lip and I get a fever blister, needless to say I was glad to leave there when my stay was over, as soon as we got home, my husband gets sick with fever and sore throat, we all ended up going to the Dr, especially when my fever blister for some reason would not heal and it was now spreading to my bottom lip. Well when we get to the Dr he puts us all on anti-biotics and tells us we all had a virus that could have been caused by the dirty water they had in the pool. I didn't complain to the hotel, because I don't ever want to stay in that hotel ever again, not even if they offered me a free stay.

We came in at 11:00am, 4 hours before 3:00pm check-in time and were told they would call us if the room became available before 3:00pm. Not expecting that call, we went out to eat.

Rooms were generally clean however there are areas that need the attention that a 4 or 5 star hotel would not miss, dust on mirror edges, dust on bathroom exhaust vents, noisy hvac system. Their weaknesses are evident in the maintenance end, some walls needed painting, unanchored closet safes, loose shower curtain rods, unnattached ventilated shelving on closet floor and most noticiable, a funky, musty smell in common hall and portion of room. Not offensive but none the less there. We carried 2 way radios with us and were on the same frequency as the maintenance staff and therefore could hear as they addressed the calls, they do try.

I searched for a month online to get a good deal under $1000/pp for flight and hotel. I was a little hesitant to stay there because when it was the Holiday Inn we stayed there in March 2008 and the room was very mildewy-smelling, but I had high hopes things had improved since it had changed ownership, and we really liked the location of the hotel. I booked a poolside room. When we entered the room, I immediately smelled mildew (room 1011) but everything else looked cleaned. Well, by the next day we noticed every time we flushed the toilet, water seeped up around the base. This would be sewer water. You could tell that they didn't use a flange to seal the toilet; just looked over-caulked. Plus, the toilet was crooked. I also noticed that the carpeting in the closet was wet. I would not normally pick up on this, but I had to step into the closet to pick up one of my shoes, and it made a squishy sound. Upon further inspection, the water appeared to be coming from the wall of the closet. Air conditioning leak? Or the plumbing in general?We complained, and were offered the room next door (1010). It also had a mildew smell, but again, everything else looked clean, and the toilet did not appear to leak. By evening, however, we noticed a small river of water going down the crevice in the tile, and then the more we used the toilet, the more it seemed to leak. Even the housekeeper was aware, and said she had told management, and that she didn't know why they didn't use a \"donut\" (flange) under the toilet! The housekeeper seemed to know more than maintenance, because when maintenance looked at the toilet in room 1011 when we first complained, he looked at us like we had two heads! And, by the way, room 1011 had new occupants in it within 5 hours of us moving next door, so we knew the problem wasn't fixed. After reading the review of another traveler from March of 2011 in the very same room (1011) it's clear they don't take maintenance issues very seriously, because that traveler complained of the very same thing!

Come on management, this is an easy fix to create ambiance. Move the care rental desk nearer to the reception and put in some big potted plants to screen off the rest of the lobby.

They are in the process of remodeling, so my advice is do not stay pool view because those are the older rooms which have MINOR upgrades to hide the true flaws. When we first arrived, I asked Joyanne (she pronounces it Joan) are we in a refurbished room, she hesitated, smiled the room has a \"carribean feel to it and the other rooms are formal\". From that point on I knew not to expect much. We arrived in the room, bed was decent but the room is overall OLD. I have plenty of pictures I will upload soon. The bathroom is beyond horrible, wall below the sink is cracked. Our toilet was crooked, you walk into the bathroom and you have your granite countertop, then a stand up shower, the toilet was crooked, if it were not you would not be able to close the door to the actual shower area. When my boyfriend first entered the bathroom, there was dried urine on the toilet seat and the toilet leaked everytime you flushed it. I did not trust taking a shower bare foot let alone at all in the shower. We called to have the room changed and of course they never got back to us. Its a good thing we were out all day and only slept and shower in the room. The pictures on the website of the rooms are beyond deceiving, beware that they NEVER show any pictures of the bathroom on the website. Do not stay at this hotel. The pool and hot tub were nice at FIRST! We mainly went tout to the pool at night, so we decided on our last day there to lay out most of the day in the day time. The pool was filthy, my boyfriend was in the pool and he saw a bag of crack floating around (of course it fell out of someones pocket obviously). He went to the front desk to tell them the pool needs to be cleaned and they lied and said it is cleaned every morning, we saw someone cleaning the pool for the first time during our last day. Also Internet Connection was very slow, you have to be in the lobby to get good connection! And you pay $10.70 a day for parking, ridiculous. The look of the lobby fools people into thinking this is a good hotel, it is not. The only good thing is the beach is literally on the next block, the Eighty20 Bistro Restaurant in the hotel serves good food and so does JH Yees Asian Restaurant.

One of our belongings was apparently removed by housekeeping, and while it was an inconsequential item, the theft really left us feeling unsettled. We were assigned a room in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s separate wing with balconies overlooking the pool. The balcony was a plus, since rooms in the main hotel building do not have them, but our pool wing room was poor in many ways: no hot water during our entire two-day stay(!); beaten-up furniture; an older, tube TV; an Internet cable connection that was hard to find in a mess of small wires on the floor beneath the desk; no shampoo. After our room was serviced following the first night of our stay, we were unable to find a round travel neck pillow that probably cost us about $10. One of us had used it the night before and we had not taken it with us or thrown it out. We searched everywhere for it in the room and concluded that it had to have been taken by the hotel housekeeper. That gave us a very uneasy feeling, and we were glad we had left the room that day taking with us our more valuable property, namely our laptop and iPad. We called the housekeeping desk to complain about the pillow, but they simply said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look for it. We were pleased that our room came with two complimentary bottles of Fiji water, the outdoor pool and hot tub were nice, and there was no Internet fee. But, on the downside, the hotel slaps its guests with a sneaky resort fee. Hello, YOU ARE NOT A RESORT but a two-star hotel with a pool! The resort fee was never disclosed at check-in, so I will be disputing those charges with my credit card issuer. Bizarrely, we were charged different resort fees for the different days: $8.80 for the first night and $9.30 for the second. The hotel also would seem to play \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gotcha!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with guests over its pool towels. At check-in, each guest is given a ticket to exchange for a pool towel at the front desk. When you return the towel, you are given another ticket, maybe for the next day. The fine print says that if you do not have a ticket to return to reception when you check out, you will be charged a $20 fee. I imagine many guests toss out the tickets and are hit with the fee. The final major negative for this hotel is that you must in fact stand in line at reception to check out, there is no sort of express checkout. We left at noon and had to wait in a long line to be helped by just one reception agent on duty, at a time when many people were checking in and checking out.

After considering locations, prices, reviews, and amenities, I decided to give the Verdanza a try. Being in the hospitality industry, I know that hotels that aren't attached to a big brand often try a little harder to earn your business. The Verdanza is an example of this, and I'm glad that I took a chance on them! The hotel is located a few blocks from the beach, close to some great restaurants (definitely visit Mi Casita!) and the staff were friendly and quite helpful. The price was very reasonable, and the grounds were well kept. At check in, we received complimentary frozen treats which were a nice touch. The front desk was quick and efficient even when the lobby was pretty busy. The concierge desk gave very good info on tours and directions. My room was upgraded to one in the tower on the 8th floor executive level instead of the building near the pool which is where it sounded like I was originally placed when I called back to reconfirm our reservations. This was great because I was a little worried about noise from the pool area in my room, and the pool building seemed to be where some people stayed and noted mildew smells. The executive level had a gym and business center with internet right down the hall, and exclusive access to a continental breakfast each morning we were there. We also rented a car for a few days to allow ourselves scheduling freedom and again, the desk couldn't have been more helpful. The only three issues I had were: * the hotel's restaurant. While the food was good, the service was a little slow. I think there were staffing shortages the day I ordered lunch. I had calamari and a mojito and it took 25 minutes, and I had to check on it more than once * my exec room: although well appointed, it was pretty small. The balcony I had did not have room to sit; the pool building seemed to have bigger balconies with chairs, but I can't speak to the size of the rooms there. * my room was not ready at check in, but to be fair we did get there at 9 am when the hotel was sold out the previous day. The desk did take my cell phone number and call me when the room was ready, and it was...exactly at the time they said it would be. I unfortunately missed the manager's reception, which was also a nice touch. I would've liked to meet the manager to tell him directly what a great hotel and wonderful team he has. Thanks in part to the Verdanza, my fiance and I had a fantastic and memorable vacation in Puerto Rico.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Haven, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cSurprising\u201d", "Author": "skr23", "ReviewID": "UR97643681", "Content": "I stayed here in 2008 when it was the Holiday Inn.

(We have stayed at the Intercontinental before as well and did'nt want to spend $400+ for one night before a cruise) We booked a room for one night before our cruise and for 2 nights the next week after our cruise. There was a fire alarm at 5:45 a.m. And the room phone and safe were not working. I informed the front desk about the phone not working and the safe. I also asked if I could have that same room when I returned the next week. It had a balcony and a view of the pool. We returned the next week and while checking in the front desk person said to my husband \"someone should be up soon to look at the phone\". No-one ever showed to fix anything. And while we were there for our 2 night stay the fire alarm went off 3 more times. All false alarms. I did not say anything about the phone or safe again because they made it pretty clear they just didnt care. They had a whole week to fix it and chose to do nothing about it. Also the David's coffee shop located in the lobby has the worst customer service I stood there for 5 min and the person behind that counter was on their cell phone and did not acknowledge me or the other women behind me. We both walked away. This happened all 3 days I was there. There is a Starbucks in the El San Juan hotel but I just wanted a quick cup before I got on with my day.

Wasn't overly impressed and found the hotel to be an average hotel. The lobby area was very nice but the rooms were outdated. We are generally a pretty easier going couple and very rarely change rooms but we had to do so at Verdanza. Our first room we got there was a bunch of hairs in the bathroom (ew!), the remote control didn't work which was proabably due to the batteries, but when we tried to call down to get new batteries, the phone wasn't working either. There would be a dial tone, but when we dialed to Front Desk, or Housekeeping, it just went dead and would take forever before the dial tone came back up again. The sink also seemed to be clogged. So we got a new room which was a bit better but not by much. Our sink worked on and off during our stay and the water was lukewarm in our shower at best. There were cracks in the walls and the tub had mildew. The bed was also too hard for my liking. All in all I don't feel we got good value for our money. It was only an ok hotel. The plus is that it is only a short distance from the beach but perhaps we went at a bad time, but the area was quite dead. Besides the beach there really isn't anything else to do in the immediate vicinity. Cabs are expensive, we took a 15-20 min cab ride to the Plaza des Americas and it cost us US$20. Luckily we had already seen Old San Juan, as I can only assume the cost would have been a lot more to go out there. I had wanted to take a tour the day of my husband's meeting but the hotel didn't really offer a huge variety of tours. The one tour to Ponce that I wanted to take wasn't offered the day I could go, the only other tour was one to El Yunque and a snorkeling tour but those ones didn't really appeal to me.

Let me get the unpleasantness out of the way first - Lousy concierge. We arrived at the hotel and went first to the concierge with regard to transportation into Old San Juan. The bellhop mentioned to us that a bus cost 75 cents into Old San Juan and took about 35 minutes as compared to a taxi which costs $25 (plus tip) and takes 15 minutes anyway. We asked the concierge about it and she said take the C-53 there and back, it will pick you up in the same place it drops you off and buses run all the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bus stop close to the hotel. We took the bus in and everything was great until 7pm when we walked back to where we were dropped off. Not only did the C-53 not show up (after we waited 45 minutes) but there were so few buses that late that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even sure what was running. After taking a $25 (plus tip) taxi back to the hotel we talked to the bellhop who told us that at this hour we would only be able to catch the T-5 back because the C-53 was not running as often but the T-5 takes only a few minutes more and drops off at the same place (we did see the T-5 but never considered taking because we were told C-53). Well everyone has a bad day so the next morning we went back to the concierge and asked about a hike in the rainforest. My wife and I are active hikers and were looking for an all day hike through El Yunque. She jumped into action and said great and no problem and booked us an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all day hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for $68 per person. We were picked up at 9:45 and retuned to the hotel by 3pm (all day?). In total we \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hiked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for 1 hour which was down a paved trail to a waterfall and back (Guide did not come along). The rest of the time on our tour our guide took us to souvenir shops, a cave opening, lunch at a local kiosk place and drove a round about way to get to El Yunque. The guide was pleasant enough and the tour was fine it just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what we wanted or what we paid ($136) for. This tour was a waist of a day and money. When we arrived back to the hotel we explained our grievances with the concierge about this not being an all day hike and she actually said these words to us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, you wanted a hike hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This woman was neither friendly nor helpful and we never talked to her again. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe I received better advice and guidance from a bellhop!

Our flight was not until 2 AM on Monday, so we wanted a decent hotel near the airport for a reasonable price and Verdanza fit the bill. We arrived at 10:30 AM on Sunday and they were able to get us into a room within 15 minutes (we had contacted them earlier requesting this). Room: Our room was a city view on the 5th floor and it was spacious and clean. Upon arrival, we were happy to see that they had provided us with two free bottles of Fiji water. The room also had a mini- refrigerator. We had a king sized bed and flat screen television. This is an older hotel that has had some recent updates but still needs some more. The bathroom seemed updated except for the tub and stained and broken ceiling tiles. Even though we were close to the airport, we could barely notice the sounds of the planes. The only noise we heard from the hallway was our neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door every once in a while. Grounds: On the eighth floor is a nice little gym and an outdoor patio. The ground level has a computer to check in for your flights. They were decorated for the holidays and it was quite pleasant. The pool area was quite large with plenty of chairs and a hot tub which was overrun by children. My husband and I just laughed since we had just gotten off a cruise with the same situation (we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the hot tubs with kids). I wish some resorts would actually enforce the age limits that are posted!! They had a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s area which was quite cool and seemed to be very popular. We only stayed here an hour (had lunch) and then walked down to the beautiful beach which was a quick two blocks away. There is a place where you can rent chairs and umbrellas but we walked a little to the right (in front of the Intercontinental) and plopped our butts. This is a beautiful beach with large waves but still swimmable. Restaurants: We ate lunch inside the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bistro. We were the only ones in there at the time. The waitress was friendly and pleasant. We both had a fish sandwich (I had red snapper, my DH tuna) and split them. They were delicious. My pina colada was the best one of my whole vacation and the most reasonable at $5. My DH also loved the coconut flan. This was a great lunch and very reasonable in price. Before heading to the airport, we ate a late dinner in their Asian restaurant, Johnny Yees. Again we were the only ones in there but it was a late Sunday. We split a bunch of appetizers and once again, they were very good and reasonable. We took naps after the beach and before dinner. The bed was on the hard side but what bothered me the most was the quality of the sheets and pillowcases. They were very stiff and scratchy. We checked out after midnight for our quick ride to the airport (all of 6 minutes!). This hotel met our expectations and was just what we were looking for. We tend to lean towards luxury when on vacation, and this is not a luxury hotel but that is not what we were looking for that day. We knew we were only going to be there for 14 hours so we wanted a comfortable, clean spot at a reasonable price and the Verdanza delivered.

We packed up our things and went directly to Verdanza which for my surprise the front desk agent recognized me. Very impressive. We told him about our situation and he helped us out.

Would definitely recommend the rooms in the tower; the room I was first assigned was in the poolside section and was just too damp and old for my taste but I was kindly moved to a newer, nicer room and very much enjoyed my stay. The room was quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. Used the computers on the 8th floor; reasonably fast internet in my opinion. Didn't use the fitness center up there but it looked well-outfitted and the view from that floor was profound! There's a deck outside the business/fitness area with views to the beach. Check it out! The staff is very friendly and helpful and it was pretty easy to get around from the hotel. Had to take taxis if going away from Isla Verde area for dinner (ie. Condado). As others did, used the bus to go to Old San Juan; it might take 30-40 mins for it to arrive, and it took about 40 mins to get to OSJ, but at 75 cents each way, worth it (and you get to see other parts of the city on the way). A little tip: at the top of the city, near El Moro, there is an art school and inside a courtyard with a little place that sells some very fresh and yummy puerto rican snacks and meals. I happened upon it sort of accidentally and took advantage of the cool seats in the courtyard, the very clean bathrooms and the water fountain. You can't normally go in, but I asked about eating there and gained admittance. They will not let you just go in and use the bathrooms. Other food related tips: Ate breakfast twice in the hotel; $12.00 buffet, which felt a little high but was convenient and if you're a big eater, a good deal. Had a tuna nicoise salad at the 80/20 restaurant, which was delicious except for the tuna (!) which was a tad dry. As for the lettuce wraps at J H Yees, yup, those are amazing and should not be missed! Eat them like tacos; still a little messy but yummy! I also ate at Jam Rum Bar which others have recommended on TripAdvisor and it was very good; agree with others that the white bean soup is to die for. The black truffle oil on top is such a treat. When I was there, they also had a black bean soup so I tried a little of both and would vote, just barely, for the black bean if available. Also had the postelon pernil which was super filling and tasty. And Mia Casita, just around the corner from the Verdanza--near the Ponderosa (eek!) was great! I had rice and beans with the beef a la native--marinated and laced with onions. It was enough for two meals, and with a fridge in the hotel room, it was leftovers the next night :) Outings which should not be missed include El Yunque rain forest, and the snorkling trip--both available and recommended through Castillo tours (they maintain a desk in the lobby of the Verdanza, and you can also call them directly if no one there). I booked both the night before and they made my trip! Met some very fun people on both! The hotel has a nice pool and is truly a very short walk to the beach. I did not feel at all like I needed to be on the beach; I get the feeling my hotel was quieter for being a little further back. Weather was certainly hot and a little steamy, but only rained for 30 mins the whole time I was there. Stunning!

I had to return to reception because we initially put in a room with only one bed, but that was immediately fixed. The beds were soft, but comfortable, and the air-conditioning was powerful (a rarity for San Juan), and with a fair sized bathroom stocked with plush towels and the usual toiletries. Reception provided a hair comb upon request. Hotel has a large, impressive looking pool; about an hour in that pool was the cure for my earlier fatigue. Of the three restaurants (Asian bistro, International, and Puerto Rican), we choose to dine at the Asian bistro. What a remarkable restaurant! The menu included entrees from practically every major Asian cuisine (except Korean). I had the Jakarta shrimp curry, which was excellent, and my Dad had a Polynesian pineapple chicken. While walking my dog (the hotel is pet friendly!), I noticed the large parking lot behind the hotel. Overall, if we had to be stranded overnight in San Juan, we were fortunate that Continental Airlines put us up in the Verdanza.

I was beyond pissed that we were told to just wait, & we were assed out. A man working @ Verdanza named Jose hooked us UP! He contacted a friend who works @ a diff hotel & she got us a car that JUST arrived!

Its alot of walking but well worth it!! Great pics!!) -Also check out Loiza for some decent food & a nice beach. OHHHHHHHHHH & IF u plan on having some decent food- Coladas in the hotel, AMAZING!! We ate there 3x in our stay! The Mondongo was great! Also, the lil plaza up the street has a spanish restautrant that was always packed for bf/lunch/dinner, but the food is on point & good prices.

When I booked originally, I was told that it was a 4 star hotel, that certainly did not seem the case during my trip. I've have never written a bad review before in my travels but felt compelled to do so now. I have contacted them directly to complain (with other details from the trip) and they said they would look into the issues discussed. When we checked in we were greeted nicely & some of the staff there really do try (unfortunately the overall issues overcloud them). One major plus was Coladas, the staff there were the ones that really did try & make us feel welcome. The food was good, as well as the drinks. They really check up on us to even see if we were happy with service. I can honestly give them a positive rating. Now onto the issues, in summary... First I was given the wrong room designation (pool ground no balcony, which as another reviewer said, smelled & was musty), then I was switched to another room. When I checked into the room, I was horrified. I called my husband up to be sure and judge as well. The room was the last one on the second floor all the way in the corner, it had a smell to it, and seemed as it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been aired out in a while. The chair in the room was in shambles, the plastic covering on the chair was completely stripped showing the exposed cushion foam underneath. I went back to the front desk, explained the problem & detailed some of the problems & was switched again. The room was not in optimal shape as well, but had less of a smell that other room & appeared to be not as damaged as the previous room we were in. The bed was firm, but with only three flat pillows, we awoke with neck pain in the morning. We had other issues as well, luggage not being transferred with the room, internet connection issues, even cleaning services. If you would like more details let me know! Essentially I have been in no frills places, as well as top of the line. no matter what, if you are made to feel welcome and the staff is friendly & accommodating, it makes all the difference. I had to make this trip, unfortunately for a funeral, so the accommodations were last minute. If i had known, or had more time, I would not have booked there at all, if anything it added to the whole stress for the family.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA city hotel, not great access to beach, poor service\u201d", "Author": "drironwoman", "ReviewID": "UR75520763", "Content": "This was the second hotel during our ten day trip. I chose it because it was one of two hotels chosen as the \"hq\" for an event I was participating in. The other was the Embassy Suites which was across the street. Practical issues first - if you have a GPS, ask the hotel if the street that runs in front of the hotel is one way or two way. It is currently a one way street due to construction and you will not be able to turn into the hotel the \"easy\" way. So, if you're staying here, get very precise instructions on how to find the road that turns into the Embassy Suites that will get you to the Verdanza. And be aware that the road is not well marked and will suddenly appear (\"like magic as a local put it) and you should be in the right lane to make that turn. The beach is not really near the hotel. You have to walk about 500 yards (?), basically you have to walk down the currently one way road to the busy road, cross it, and go behind the hotels and buildings that front the beach. So, maybe a 6 minute walk depending on how fast you walk. You can hire lounge chairs for $4 once you're on the beach. The pool with the August heat was really bath water temperature (if they had fountains like the other hotel we stayed in, it would have helped with the circulation, I suspect). They do have a water spray play area for kids which I saw children enjoy. The room is decent, we had two double beds. The bathroom is small but adequate. There is a hotel safe and a fridge. The internet is rather slow. The location is good because it is in Isla Verde, so you can walk to fast food places, restaurants, and there is a Charlie's car rental place on the main road. There is also a large supermarket called Pueblo near by (really driving distance, it would be a very long walk if you're loaded down with supplies). The scenery around the hotel is \"urban\". A friend called it getho style. The Embassy Suites would have been more comfortable. Service at the Verdanza is uneven to poor. We came back at 5pm one day to find the room had not been cleaned after we left early that day. We called and called room service. We had no clean towels. Finally at 9pm, after another phone call, room service came. She had a friend with her, and spent her time casually chatting with him, which of course involved having to stop working at times to have a conversation about mutual friends. not professional at all. one evening, I asked the concierge about pizza. I asked him about the pizza joint in the Embassy suites, he said he never heard of it. I asked him about the pizza place in the Howard Johnson, he said he didn't know there was one (it's about a 3 minute drive). He said there was one down the road, but he didn't have a menu and didn't have a phone number, and that was it. I walked across to the Embassy Suites and decided against that pizza place. I asked THEIR concierge about the Howard Johnson's pizza (it's called Fazzios and is a restaurant that happens to be in the HJ). He thought they were closed and I expressed surprise as friends had just eaten there. So you know what the Embassy Suites Concierge did? He called howard johnson and found out they were open and made it easier for me to order take out pizza. (they will deliver for $3 - fazzio's, they also have a website but it was down that evening). I was very disappointed with the Verdanza. It wasn't worth the money. We had just left Numero Uno which provided breakfast, was right on the beach and were service oriented. And we went on to the Conrad which while a much larger hotel and a resort type hotel, provided excellent service at all times. Re restaurants - Barrachine has local food and is a good choice, and is quite close (we drove) to the Verdanza. Fazzio's will deliver. there is an outback steakhouse in the embassy suites (if you're too tired to drive and don't want to look for a place to eat). I also saw Chile's and Ponderosa near by. There's also a local place called Platos (need to drive or a nice long walk) and Metropol (which I\"ll review later) also local food. Parking by the way will cost $10.70. And if they are hosting an event, it may be hard to find a spot to park in the outdoor parking area (there isn't a covered area). I'd say this is a 2 star hotel. So as long as you know what you're getting, you won't be disappointed.

When were first arrived we were pleasantly surprised at how sleek and modern the lobby looked since were weren't expecting much since it wasn't one of the bigger named hotels in the area. We did check out a few other hotels during our stay like the San Juan Hotel and Casino and the Water and Beach Club to party but you can't beat this hotel for the price and location. It was in walking distance to these hot spots and many more. There were local bars and restaurants mere blocks from the club and fast food restaurants if you are afraid to try to the local fare (which I don't recommend). And it is literally two short blocks from a beautiful beach so don't let the \"not on the beach\" location scare you. The staff were very nice and friendly and immediately let me and my friend know all the hot spots to go to during our stay. The Coladas restaurant is the best in town. With the nicest staff and the yummiest food, even with all the other places in the area me and my girlfriend ate here often. The bartendars are the sweetest and will make you specialty drinks upon request, just tell them the type of drinks you like. There are other restaurants here too but we loved Coladas so much we didn't try the others. The hotel's pool was great and relaxing, which we went to each day after the beach. The only downside was the business center computers didn't work and never got up and running on our trip but I'm sure they have fixed this by now. As for your trip I also recommend going to Old San Juan, we took a cab there but the bus back and the trip wasn't too far. It is absolutely beautiful there (especially at night fall), with the shops and hills, and quaint restaurants. It is a must do, we stayed for the day but you may want to devote two days because there is so much to do there. And visit the Bacardi factory for a fun tour and free drinks!!

You can see my review titled \"A Gem of a Hotel in Isla Verde\". Since then, we have stayed at the hotel three more times; February 2008, December 2008, and most recently December 2009. This review is for our December 23, 2009 - January 1, 2010 stay. Effective December 4, 2009, the Holiday Inn San Juan was re-christened \"Verdanza San Juan\", a memeber of SUMMIT Hotels. Having stayed at this hotel three times prior to our latest stay, we were interested to see the impact of thei move from Holiday Inn to Summit. I can happily report that we were very pleased. Our check-in was quick, efficient, and friendly. The doormen at the front of the hotel always open the doors for all guests and visitors at all times of the day, giving a warm and welcoming feeling.Upon arriving at the reception area, we were provided with complimentary towelettes to freshen-up as well as frozen ices in multiple flavors - - a cool and refreshing treat! The furniture through the lobby and common areas was all new and ultra-modern. The configuration added to the ambiance and intimacy of this very 'boutique' type hotel.The bellman immediately brought our bags to our room, a junior suite. The freshly painted room was nicely appointed, with new night-tables and a new dresser.There is a pillow menu to accommodate the most discriminating traveler. We were advised that new flat screen-tvs, bed-coverings, and draperies had already been ordered and would be arriving very shortly but in all candor the current fixtures were in excellent condition and we could hardly believe that they were being replaced! As the entire hotel (with the exceptionof the outside) is a non-smoking environment, there was no smell of smoke or must. The beds were immaculate and the linens were changed every-day. There was a large desk held the telephone, two complimentary bottles of water, and an ice-bucket. The free high-speed internet access which was most helpful since we all brought our lap-tops to stay in-touch with work (even though we were on vacation). There is also free wi-fi through-out the common areas of the hotel (the lobby, by the pool). The climate control/air-conditioning was excellent. The bathrooms were also well appointed, with plently of lighting, a great lighted 'shaving mirror', lots of thick, fluffy. large bath-towels, face-towels, and wash-cloths. Of course, complimentary soaps, body-lotions, shower caps, and shampoos were provided. Each room is also equipped with a safe, fridge, and iron & ironing board. Soda and ice-machines are located on different floors. The buffet breakfasts at Bistro 80/20 were delicious and offered an extensive variety of food including eggs, home-fries, danish, bagels, fresh fruit, sausage/bacon, quiche, hot and cold cereal, fresh squeezed orange juice, hot coffee - - I am sure that I have left a few things out. In additon to the buffet, guests could also order 'a la carte'.The waite staff was friendly and attentive. The hotel provides large towels (complimentary) for guests who chose to use the pool as well as beach-goers.rWe are strict beach-goers and one of the best beaches in the San Juan area is only a short-walk away. Although the hotel now provides their guests with a complimentary bike-shuttle to the beach, we opted for the short walk to help burn off the breakfasts! Although we ate there on previous visits, we can highly recommend Coladas restaurant and J.H. Yee's asian restaurant, both in the hotel. Of course, David's Cookies is a great stop for those with a sweet-tooth who want to grab that extra something before bed.While we were there, the hotel was very festive, decorated with all of the holiday fare one would expect. As part of their new image, the hotel features local musicians and the works of local artisians and craftspeople. The trio in the lobby included a singer/guitar player, trumpeter, and key-person that added a great latin-flare to the evening. In addition to going to the beach right down the block from the hotel, we also rented a car (Thrifty Car Rental is great!) and drove to Luquillo Beach as well as a public beach(some 2 and 1/2 hour drive each way) in Rincon. Of course, the trip to El Yunque was a must! We ususally stayed close to the hotel for dinner (Mi Casita and The Asian Station in a local strip mall one block away from the hotel are highly recommended) but we also ventured into Viejo San Juan for dinner at The Parrot Club on Fortuleza Street. The place is 'red-hot' and the food was outstanding but be prepared to wait because the kitchen staff simply can not keep up. The Mahi-Mahi (Pescado Dorado) was great as well as the Tres Leches chocolate cake for desert. When it was time to depart, the check-out was just as easy and efficient. A special 'shout-out' to Mariela Cintron at the front desk for her warm and friendly manner. In closing, we'll definitely be returning to the Verdanza San Juan in December 2010.

The carpet was terrible, as was the bathtub/shower. Ceiling tiles were moldy and falling down in the sink area. Mini fridge was old and did not keep our drinks very cold at all (there was no knob to adjust the temp).
