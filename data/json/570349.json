Extremely noisy. As for the area, we actually feared for our safety at night, surrounded by nasty looking high rise flats with gangs hanging around. We left after one night and found a nicer place to stay. Do not give them your credit card until you have seen the room. we made that mistake and they charged the full week immediately and it took calling the owner several times each day of our holiday to finally get our money back", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Residence Magnolia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d570349-Reviews-Hotel_Residence_Magnolia-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$78 - $157*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">via di Valle Aurelia, 116</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">167</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570349", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ea/8a/ea8ada670477300953f272ecda9886af5large.jpg"}}
