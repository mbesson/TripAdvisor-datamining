{"Reviews": [{"Content": "reasonable place to stay I stayed here twice in January and February 2006, booking through Elong who were doing a deal (278 rmb inc breakfast)The hotel is conveniently situated close to Chaoyang subway (7 minutes) at no 75 Chaowei road. The hotel doesn't have and English or Pinyin sign but the 75 is visible. The hotel is made up of two buildings A and B. the deal i got was for A building though an overbooking problem on my first stay put me in the B building. My second stay was in A building. A is being decorated at the moment and quite badly too and it is a shame that no care is being taken as this hotel has potential. B building rooms are better furnished with more ammenities (paper slippers as opposed to plastic ones, hotel information etc ) but altogether much the same. There are some rooms without windows. On both stays the rooms were quiet over night, though I always unplug the phone to ignore the potential Mr Massageee phone calls in any cheaper Chinese hotels I stay in. Chinese breakfast is served buffet style and it isn't bad. I think there are restaurants in each building though i'm not sure as i was rushing for the bus on my second stay. Check in and check out is in both buildings and there is a little English spoken.If leaving the hotel for the airport you can flag down a taxi on the main road outside the hotel. Some taxis won't want to go to the airport so just wait for the next one. To the airport from here was 86 rmb (inc airport high way toll) and done in about 40 minutes around 9am. Coming back into Beijing from the airport I caught the number 3 airport shuttle (16 rmb) which dropped off just at Chaoyang subway as mentioned earlier which was really convenient.", "Date": "Feb 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR585768299", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "johnniew"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d602540-r6803087-Binhai_Sunny_Business_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "602540", "Price": "$68"}}
