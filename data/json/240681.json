The rooms are average-sized, with comfortable beds, there is a free shuttle to and from the airport, and it is only about ten minutes from the rental car facilities. It also offers a free continental breakfast. Management is very friendly and helpful. Less than a ten-minute drive to downtown and less than five to I-10.

This hotel looks more like a motel or condo because you can park your car infront of your room. The host there were very friendly and had brochures with useful info. The room was big and comfortable. Everything was clean, the bed, the bathroom and the tube and believe me, im picky. I really went there kind of scared because i read bad things about this hotel but specially because had no option since everything was full and some other hotels were overpriced because of the game, but when i opened my room's door i felt i made the right decision to make a reservation there besides i thought it was for one night only. They had free shuttle service, wi-fi and continental breakfast which was really poor but at least gives you the chance to eat something at early morning while you get ready to go out and eat real food. It says on their site that is really close to the airport but is not. At least it didnt seem to me. So you better take the shuttle service. They have courtesy phones at Sky Harbor (airport) so you call them to pick you up. The tricky thing is that nobody tells you that Van Buren st. is well known as a prostitute and drug dealer street. 3 cab drivers told me so. They said that was time ago, now is clean but still has the good fame. You can hardly find people walking there and very few cars. Some blocks looked scary and shady and some others depresing. If you dont bring your car and plan to visit downtown call a cab before leaving your room. You wont find a cab easily there and will have to walk making it unsafe for you. The distances in Phx are huge. Very long streets. Therefore, I strongly suggest you either bring your own car or get a cab. You can always use the train but anyway you would need to take a cab so they take you to the nearest station. It will cost you 17 bucks one way to downtown. Cab drivers are very friendly. Once in downtown you can easily find a cab to take you back to the hotel, cabs are all over the place specially near hotels. My recomendation is to avoid long walking distances if you are a solo traveler and of course get a better hotel with a better location if possible. If not just follow these steps and you'll be fine.

It was about midnight, at least 100+ inside the room, and all we wanted to do was sleep. Miserable!! -The heavy \"marble\" facade on the front of the bathroom vanity had come unglued, and was hanging by a thread of caulk. I had to yank it down and put it on the floor so that it wouldn't fall off on our feet while we standing in front of the sink. -We stayed there three nights, and NOT ONCE did housekeeping clean our room! We ran out of towels, ran out of TOILET PAPER (!!!), and the two tiny trash bins were overflowing. This was after we both called and went in person to the front desk to complain. -We had to get our room cards re-programmed every single day.
