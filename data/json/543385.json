Sunotel Aston Review: Where to start? This place is a dump. Instead of admitting it and letting us get on with our vacation it keeps coming around. My bride is not one to let anything go, especially when someone lies, so it continues. 1) The rooms. Our first room was very dirty. Nothing in particular but overall it did not look or feel clean. The bed was a box spring with a sheet over it. Seriously, not even a mattress, just an old box spring. The TV (although I do not watch TV on vacation) was a 14\u201d (30cm) tube TV that did not work anyway. The remote had crusty stuff on it, the battery door missing, and really too disgusting to touch. The window was broken so the street noise came in fairly loudly even though we were on the back of the hotel. There was no heat or blankets. The bathroom was small and although adequate, it was dirty and had lights that did not work. As we had dinner plans we dumped our bags and headed out figuring we would address the room later. Upon return I requested a different room for the reasons above. The second room was the same as the first except the TV actually worked. From this room we heard a loud groaning noise every minute or so. Being exhausted we went to sleep anyway. In the morning we decided to move on as this was already our second room. If someone has a problem with their room do not move them into the same type room on a different floor! The room we had was not what they showed online, maybe twenty years ago, but not now. It was disappointing. 2) The breakfast. Breakfast is served in a musty basement. They did try to brighten the place a little but after our terrible room I felt they fell short. Someone had a bad hacking cough, another of my bride\u2019s peeves. When she saw him go into the kitchen that was the end of her food. The selection was typical European breakfast nothing special. 3) The hotel. The lobby is very small. It reminded me of 70\u2019s-ish hotel that you rent rooms by the hour. The elevators made strange noises, and shook when in motion. The hotel is located far from the tourist areas and 2-3 blocks from a Metro. Although Barcelona is safe, this area seemed seeder than most others we ventured into. 4) The staff. The young man that changed our rooms was reluctant to do so because we had checked in a few hours before. But he did do it. After we decided to move on to another hotel is when the staff really showed their true colors. First, we were told by Kuoni (travel service) that we would be charged a 115E fee for canceling our room. I was told to take this up with the hotel as they were trying to accommodate us. No one from the hotel contacted us when they knew we were leaving. Once we went to the lobby they engaged. While waiting for the desk manager (a random employee who was sitting there at the time) to contact someone about the 115E extortion the desk clerk explained several things to us. The hotel was a three star but since Barcelona is in the tropics they have a much different rating system. When I said I was from Germany I was told that Germany really doesn\u2019t count as part of Europe as their standards are too high. As I explained about the strange noise every minute or so she offered that the noise is the elevator. She thought our dissatisfaction was from the noise so she was trying to move us to a \u2018nicer\u2019 room away from the elevator. I asked why we were put there after we were not happy with our first room but she did not have an answer. As the desk manager could not reach anyone to discuss the 115E after about 20 minutes he decided that we did not have to pay, this time. They again offered us a \u2018nicer\u2019 room but I was decided that I had had enough. Two points why I was leaving: 1) I already changed rooms, they should have given us a \u2018nice\u2019 room once I complained; and 2) the location, I wanted to be closer to the tourist areas. 5) Travel service: Kuoni and Swiss Airlines. Kuoni was helpful while we tried to change hotels. They offered us a similar hotel with the same rating but further out. We tried to get them to put us in the Rivoli Ramblas as it was available online. I was offered a room there for an additional 70E per night, 185E per night total! Seriously? Instead of fighting I decided to get my own hotel within my own needs. I told Kuoni that 115E for the dump they put us in was not fair. They offered 30E back if the hotel actually cancelled the 115E fee that they were supposed to.

The first issue was parking (@ around $15 Euros per day). I spent at least 10 minutes maneuvering my skateboard-sized car into the hotel's underground garage. In hindsight, one does not need a car to see Barcelona--pay for the Hop-On busses that run from morning til night for a daily rate. The hotel room was quite small, but clean. We booked the room due to the hotel having wireless internet in the rooms at no extra charge. Unfortunately, the internet was down for the entire hotel for most of our first evening. To their credit, the problem was fixed late in the evening, and I was even notified by phone of the repair. Also, the hotel was nice to allow an adjustment for the lack of internet. Finally, the breakfast, at 10 Euros, was pretty good, and not a bad price for the selection (eggs, bacon, fruit, yogurt, etc.).

The one I stayed (Ashton - Barcelona) was pretty ok. It is very comparable with other budget chains like Ibis or Holiday Inn, with no frills. The room haves adequate space, with a small wardrobe, a small \"office\" desk, and a small TV set. The bed was good and big. The bathroom was bigger than other budget hotels, but my shower had some problems regarding maintain the correct temperature. Sometimes hot, sometimes cold, oscillating during the bath. Not a huge problem at all. The staff was good and very friendly. They speak English with no problems. Ashton is very well located, near \"Avenida Transversal\", or something like that, which is one of the major avenues on Barcelona. It is located at about 10 minutes walk from the nearest subway station, one hour walk from some of the major attractions, like Parc Guell, the Docs and beach, etc. By taxi you can easily reach those sites under 20 minutes. Some reviews complain about noise coming from the street ahead. I really didn't hear anything. My room was very quiet and welcoming. After all, Sunotel Ashton is a good place to stay. Could be a bit cheaper to reach the same price point as Ibis. Unfortunately, Barcelona does not have any Ibis at a reasonable place (they are all far from downtown) Would I stay again in Ashton? Probably yes, specially with a little price drop. Hope my review helps you to make a good decision, like the others helped me. Adriano A.

We had a room on the fourth floor at the front of the hotel overlooking the main street. There was some noise intrusion from traffic, which does go on all night. There appears to be a lot of call for ambulancies in Barcelona, due to the constant noise of sirens. The room was spacious with a large bathroom, with bath and over bath shower. Once again very clean and well presented. Clean linen was provided everyday. The room was air conditioned, but not controllable from the room, you needed to make arrangements with reception to have it turned on, which they weer very reluctant to do for some reason. The corridors and receptioon were air conditioned all the time but not the bedroom. Our first night we couldn't have it on at all, and the second night we could only ahve it on for 15 minutes. No explanation was forthcoming. The hotel does have alovely pool sauna and hot tub with sunbed area on the roof offering lovely vies of the Barcelona skyline and providing a relaxing experience at the end of long days sight seeing.

As previously stated, it is only 2 minutes from the nearest metro which is dead easy to navigate, and there are plenty of lovely little bakers/places to get breakfast (for cheap price) locally. The BAD...... It is SOOOOOOO noisy. It is right on a really busy road (like 4 lanes of traffic, which seem to be an inordinate amount of motorbikes all racing away from the lights......... all night.....). There also seem to be sirens all the time, which I think is cos its near hospital. THEFT............ we didn't realise until at airport on way home, but my husband had money stolen from his wallet left in the room, and I had a bracelet stolen.
