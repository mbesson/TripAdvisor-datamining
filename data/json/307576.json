{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointing My boyfriend and I have just returned from Bali and this hotel was the second leg to our holiday. We had previously spent a week in Nusa Dua and had intended to spend the latter part of our vacation in an area which was 4* class and easily accessible to tourist hotspots such as Tirta Gangga and Pura Lumpuyang.My first impressions of Candi Beach Cottage, (I will not lie), was that the reception area was dated and tired looking; on first appearances it did not have the edge it boasts in its website. We were taken to our first room (superior bungalow) which was off-set in a dingy corner. The room was cramped, furniture worn, walls cracked and dingy but worst of all it smelt musty. My boyfriend and I were looking for simple luxury at a relatively cheap price which is what the Hotel's website appeared to offer. The pictures on its website are most deceptive - do not be fooled!Note, after I had complained, we were shown to another room (deluxe bungalow - no different in size to the superior although it was nearer to the pool). This had had a lick of paint and was generally better kitted out (newer fridge, newer toilet, less scarred furniture). It was nearer the pool and thus civilisation. I was pleased that they had dealt with the matter immediately and had taken the feedback on board. To echo other people's comments - the rooms were small but accommodating. Furniture dated with the twist of a new bathroom suite (grey toilet, white and grey tiles, white basin - I think they need to hire a new interior designer!!). I am not sure that they cleaned the floors every day, as there were black marks on the floor that had remained there for several days before they were cleaned.Now - the food. Breakfast was included in our rate and having been spoilt in our first location I held out strong hopes that Candi Beach would deliver. Unfortunately, it didn't. Fruit was left out uncovered and thus there were several flies feasting on holiday makers breakfast. The brown bread was often a little stale and there was little on offer unless you liked one type of cereal, toast or pancakes. Oh, and ants were a general accompaniment to your table whilst you ate your breakfast.Furthermore, my boyfriend and I had happily spent 40,000 Ind. Rupiah travelling back and forth from the hotel to Candidasa to eat every night. This was by fear of trying the hotel's evening food - considering the breakfast had not lived up to standard. I had buckled, and allowed my boyfriend to convince me that it was worth trying - even if it was just for one night.The evening started well, to Candi Beach Cottage staff standards. We had a trainee ask what we would like to drink. We enquired about wine and agreed on a red Hatton wine; along tottered the trainee with white wine. We let this slip - after all she was a trainee, and thought the better of it. (All fool me)I ordered prawns in a garlic sauce and my boyfriend ordered Chicken in BBQ sauce. Not very original for Brits, granted - but we had been trekking in Ubud all day and barely eaten a bean.The food arrived - my main was swimming in grease and my boyfriend's was not even chicken. He had been handed fish instead.This was more than enough, so hence I complained again. This was handled relatively well, in that we were offered 20% discount on top of the 10% discount that residents at Candi Beach would normally get. All very well and good despite the fact that this was the most expensive meal that we had eaten the entire time in Candidasa, and the least pleasant. With discount, the meal was a little shy of 400,000 Ind. Rupiah (with a starter that, including taxes and service charges amounted to approx. \u62e27 - more than you would pay in a decent restaurant in central London - without the nice taste!)All in all, Candi Beach Cottage is great if you're looking for a small, tranquil place to stay. It is excellent if you're not willing to trek out of the hotel - but be warned that you will be charged a premium for that luxury that is a little less than mediocre.SUMMARY:Food - rubbish, not worth the moneyAccommodation - average and small, website is very deceptiveAmenities - dated, average pool and pool areaLocation - great for views of the sea and tranquillity; excellent for scuba / snorkellers alike; great little town with some very, very nice restaurants.I would strongly recommend Alam Asmara as a place to stay in Candidasa, which is where I would stay if I have the opportunity to return.Good Luck!!Miss.

My wife and I are returning in 2008 to Candi Beach Cottages for 23 days for the fourth year in succession. For both of us, it is a lovely secluded oasis in the sun !The resort has immediate beach access to two small beaches, and is set well away from high traffic roads and urban areas. The gardens are well kept, and the two pools are immaculate.The staff are friendly and efficient, and well managed.Although the restaurant is only adequate, the ambiance when sitting outside, looking right over the bay to islands and fishing boats is wonderful. There are good restaurants close by.The main cultural attractions of Bali are all within a reasonably easy drive, and there are many rural treks organised by the hotel.We have heard that the diving is excellent and well organised.If you are looking for a quiet, well managed Bali resort with lovely surrounding, try this one !Robin and Wendy.

We were given a room facing the hotel fitchen which provided a constant smell in the small room's terrace. The room was OK, clean and fairly new but the service was poor and the worst thing was the food: overpriced and not very good. Since the resort is quite isolated, you have to eat in the hotel. There is a shuttle service to Candidasa center but is very cleverly schedules for 'out of eating' hours. The swimmingpool was great.

Our visit to Candidasa was in between stays (at 5 star accomodation) in Udud and Legian. Canid Beach Cottage is not a luxury hotel. However it has a lovely, totally relaxed atmosphere (I took my empty glasses back to the bar). The food in the restaurant is fair. The pools are great - with plenty of sun-lounges around them. The rooms are clean, with modernised bathrooms. Although we did not spend much time in our room. The gardens are large and tidy with views out over the sea. If you are looking for a relaxed, inexpensive getaway in a quiet part of Bali then Candi Beach is worth considering. My parner went snorkelling just off the beach at the front of the hotel and said it was great. Candidasa is a very quiet little town with a few shops and restaurants. I would definitley go back here for time out and stay in the Beach Cottage.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR448953751", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pony25"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u51a6\u5120\u9287\ue1bc\ue1f3\u8e47\u6ebf\u4f05\u923c\u5b28\u20ac\u4f78\u57c4\u6e1a\u630e\u20ac\u0441\u4efa\u690b\u71b6\u7c28\u9287\ue1f8?#x201d;   showReview(19914219, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR273620584", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Eine wundersch\u679ane Anlage, die beste Wahl die wir treffen konnten   showReview(6932754, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR453074258", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lacarina"}, {"Content": "Tranquilit\u8305 et s\u8305r\u8305nit\u8305...       plage sauvage \u813f proximit\u8305", "Date": "Jan 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR111172901", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Despinafromfrance"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u20ac\u9288\u3083\u5122\u9288\u70b9\u5120\u9288\u00b0\u5136\u9287\u0443\u57c4\u9422?..   showReview(19920356, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR731330027", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608484-d307576-r21106381-Candi_Beach_Cottage-Karangasem_Bali.html", "HotelID": "307576", "Price": "$42"}}
