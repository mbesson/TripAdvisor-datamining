Literally steps away from everything you could want in the village. Turn right and you get the gay district, turn left and you get the Latin Quarter. We didn't have to walk more than ten minutes to get anywhere, the bars, clubs, restaurants, and two metro stations are within a ten minute walk. The hotel looks a little disjoint because I think they are working on making it nicer. However, the rooms are nice and fairly clean. For such an inexpensive hotel in such a prime location I was expecting something much worse. They brought warm croissants and french bread with juices and spreads and hot coffee in the morning as a wake-up call. There were some homeless people outside, but I never felt unsafe, its just the price you pay for being in a large city. There was some confusion at check-in, and the gentleman implied that it was my fault that they had it in the system wrong, but once I was able to show him the price online he relented. That was only 2 minutes of bad service out of all my interactions, which were otherwise GREAT. I would definitely come back and recommend it to friends. I don't know that I'd bring a family there, but for a weekend going out on the town, you can't beat the price/location combo.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cI loved this quaint hotel !!!!\u201d", "Author": "NelsonNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR122307511", "Content": "Whenever I am in Montreal, I always stay at this hotel.

I love the Continental Breakfast which is served right at your room at the time you desire.

Here is my take. Location was perhaps one of the best to be. When you visit Montreal, you want to be near where everything else is. At least I do. Location was great. It is located in a downtown area, so expect to see some homeless people at night, some police activity and some drunken fights here and there. Hey, you chose to visit Montreal right? that's all part of the big city. The hotel itself itself is not bad. Its about a 2 star. I am am not very picky and did not expect much. I was not dissapointed. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and simple. Fine with me. The FREE breakfast, is not breakfast at all. Its toast and coffee. Its an insult to most Americans, but at least they bring it to your room at whatever time you choose. So, you don't have to leave your room to have your morning coffee. This hotel appears to be visited by a lot of young people. I am 40 years old and I am ok with that, but if you are going there expecting to have very quiet nights, perhaps you should go somewhere else. The staff was probably the most helpful I have ever experienced anywhere. They are very, very helpful and are willing to do just about anything for you. Overall, its not bad. Great price.

But need I mention again that it's FREE? Yes, the hotel is a little run down. There was some peeling paint in our room, and it's a little eccentric that the elevator doesn't run all the way to the fourth floor.

The manager at the reception is a friendly person and he helped us settle in quickly. The room is functional but more about it later. The manager asked when we would like the breakfast (it is served in the room). That is a nice touch. Now the negatives: While reserving the room (2 weeks in advane) I had to extend my stay by one day. I had very clearly stated at the time of extension, that I want to to stay in the same room for all the three days. During check-in I was told that I will have to change rooms. That was not a good start and there was no attempt to rectify the situation. The room is small and has a noisy air-conditioner (hope it doesnot disturb too much in the night), no soap or shampoo in the bathroom, there is also a fridge and a smallish TV but no closet. The bathroom is small with wierd soap dispensers in the shower and the wash basin. The car parking is a bit tight. Let's hope the car stays in good shape over the next few days. If you plan to book in advance on a website be careful of the taxes and fees. In my case the taxes and fees were neither added nor informed at the time of the reservation.

Although I'd not stayed there for several years, over the long haul -- more than 25 years -- I must have lodged at the St. Andre at least a 20 times or more. I've seen it go through various changes, such as the redesign of the lobby, but it has always retained its character as a modest, friendly boutique hotel with a touch -- just a touch -- of European charm; (which may explain why it tends to be favored by foreign budget travelers.) The hotel has never undergone a complete renovation. It always seems to have been piecemeal and there's always something that's likely to bother fastidious travelers. Housekeeping standards have varied over the years too. It always pays to ask if a room is renovated or not and, if you don't like stairs, which floor it's on. (The elevator is way at the east end of the building.) For my most recent stay I had No 21. It was clean (which has not been the case with all my previous visits), simply furnished, well lit, and, although on the small side by the standards of North American chain hotels, had plenty of hanging and drawer space. The queen bed was firm enough although the bedding, like the towels, is low-end stuff. The CRT television delivered a good picture (cable) and it was possible to set it as an alarm (there's no bedside clock radio). Rooms on this (north) side look into a grim alleyway which at night is brightly lit. Because there are cheap venetian blinds rather than drapes, the room can never be blacked out. A small writing desk was needlessly cluttered with a vase of cheap artificial flowers. There were two small armchairs and, a useful touch, a small bar fridge. An air conditioner beneath the window is concealed behind slide panels when not in use. The renovated bathroom was fine. It is among those where the old bathtub has been replaced by a large, tiled shower -- so large in fact that it tends to cramp the rest of bathroom, especially the crapper! There is no hairdryer, only basic soap and those rather low-end towels I mentioned. (Irons and ironing boards can be requested.) As others have mentioned, sound proofing is not good. The halls and floors creak as is common in older European hotels. But then experienced budget travelers know to carry ear-plugs (and a blindfold can be useful too). Depending on how you plan to spend your time, the location is good; very close to the Metro (Berri-UQAM) and bus station. By foot you can be almost anywhere you're likely to want to visit in the downtown area within 30 minutes. There are plenty of restaurants along St. Catherine St (immediately north of the hotel). If you turn right at the intersection you'll be heading into the gay \"village.\" Turn left and you'll be headed towards the seedy red-light neighborhood around St. Laurent but soon pass into a more salubrious section of this long thoroughfare. Turn north off St. Catherine at St. Denis and you'll find a lively street scene with lots of cafes and small eateries. The hotel lobby is well stocked with tourist maps and informational brochures to guide you on your way. And, of course, there is something rather charming about the hotel's long-standing tradition (except when it briefly experimented with a breakfast room) of delivering a continental breakfast to your room. If you want heartier breakfast fare you don't have to walk far to get it. And if you fancy a tipple in your room, there's a liquor store only steps away, heading west on St. Catherine. Internet savvy travelers should have no problem finding a room here at a decent rate although in high season prices rise and the hotel can often be fully booked during one of the city's many festivals, especially during the jazz festival and Gay Pride weekend (yes; the St. Andre appears to be very gay friendly judging by the provision of a number of free gay publications it makes available) so it helps to plan ahead. In the off-season, you can probably get a room in the CND$70-$80 range/44-50 Euro (pretax). The St. Andre apparently has a high return rate among those who appreciate its unpretentious charm and who prefer to save their money for things other than a lavish hotel room. It will always have its detractors -- yes, there are things it could improve, at a price -- but clearly has also won itself a loyal clientele.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cFilty, dirty\u201d", "Author": "Chris2phe21", "ReviewID": "UR24323552", "Content": "I have stayed a few times in the past at this hoted, it was ok and clean.

I stayed here for four nights with a group of 5 other people to spend some time in Montreal and see McGill University as prospective students. It was very clean, and our room on the 3rd floor was newly renovated. The room itself was pretty spacious, the air conditioner worked well, and the staff was extremely reasonable and able to provide us with an extra mattress as we were a party of 5 and there were only enough beds for 4 people. My only complaint about the staff is that they didn't seem to know much about Montreal itself in terms of tourism, but otherwise they were very friendly and accommodating. As long as you bring your own map or guidebook, it is no problem at all. The free breakfast in the morning was really good as well - hot croissants, baguettes, orange juice, and tea or coffee brought straight to our room. It is also in a great location - a few blocks away from St. Denis at the beginning of the Gay Village. The neighborhood was not seedy at all, and it was very quiet because the hotel is down a small side street about a block from St. Catherine. I would not call it a \"Red light district\" at all: I think that further down St. Catherine this definition is plausible, but not near this hotel. Obviously there were a lot of night clubs around the major streets but there was never anything to worry about: we walked around at 2 AM and never felt in danger. It was also walking distance from a ton of interesting places such as Old Montreal, the Old Port, Rue St. Rue St. Laurent, St. Catherine, Chinatown, & etc. For further places the Berri-UQUAM metro was very close and accessible at almost any hour. During the summer there was tons close by - the Jazz Festival, fireworks on Canada Day, as well as a HUGE variety of night clubs, festivals, and restaurants. I normally stay in 4-5 star hotels and think that this one is just as good as the rest.

Even the Old City and Chinatown are within walking distance, or a short subway or cab ride. It's easy to find by car.

It wasn't the worst hotel ever... you just need to be aware of its shortcomings. I will start off with the positive aspects. The hotel is in a great area (if you wanted to stay in the gay area). The hotel staff was very friendly and professional. They were also helpful when we had questions about the area and how to get to attractions in Montreal. The lobby was a little dated, but nice. The breakfast in the morning was nice. You have a choice of a regular crossaint or a chocolate crossaint; coffee, tea or hot chocolate; orange juice; and a baguette with assorted jellies and peanut butter. Just let them know what time you want it served at. Now for the bad aspects of the hotel. When we arrived, they told us to take the elevator to the second floor and then take a \"quick ten steps\" up to the third floor... so the elevator does not go up all the way. The hallway on the first floor seemed okay... so we were not worried. When we got to the third floor the hallway was a havest gold mustard yellowish neon color. Very ugly. The rooms are the same color. It seemed that the entire third floor is a renovated attic (why would the elevator not reach that floor?). The room itself was small (but we expected that). It was fairly clean. The bathroom was clean and nice. Listen up people: this was the MOST uncomfortable bed we have EVER slept on (or tried to sleep on). It was rock hard and the matress squeeked everytime you moved (as to wake up your partner). It was awful. We stayed four nights there and thought about sleeping on the floor instead. The ceiling in the room is one of those tile type ceilings (think school classroom). It wouldn't have been so bad if our neighbor did not smoke like a fiend (even though they were all non-smoking rooms)! The smoke poured into our room every day until they left. It was awful. While we were in Montreal, the weather was quite cold... which we love. The air conditioner didn't look like it even worked... or worked well. When we left we overheard the manager or owner talking about renovations planned for the lobby. I certainly hope they also plan on renovating that third floor. Also... the pictures on the website are of rooms on the first and second floor. The chairs pictured must have come from the lobby. No such chairs were seen in the rooms.
