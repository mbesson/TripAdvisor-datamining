We were a couple but travelled with family also staying in the hotel. The airport bus takes you to the Atocha station for \u20ac5 and takes about 20 mins off peak. The location of this hotel is great - just about 3 minutes walk from the Atocha train station and within walking distance to most places of interest. We like walking around cities exploring but if that isn't your thing taxis are very reasonable only afew euros to most places. The Botanic Gardens and Retiro park are a stone's throw away. We discovered you can walk straight though the Retiro Park to one of the busier parts of town housing some really nice restaurants and bars. Close to the hotel there are plenty of nice restaurants. The hotel and surrounding for me felt quite safe. The rooms are not large but they are very comfortable and clean with air conditioning, tv, lockers, wardrobe and writing desk. The bathroom / shower room are separate from the bedroom which I personally like. When you enter the room you have a nice large washbasin and mirror area with a toilet / shower room off that, there is a door separating this area from the bedroom. The shower is very good and the toiletries are really nice here. Pleasingly there is a good hairdryer (better than normal hotel standard hairdryer) in the room so no need to bring your own. The breakfast here is fantastic huge range of cereals, fruit, hot breakfast made to order, breads, pastries, juices and the best of it is the freshly ground coffee. The only negative I have is that I ordered poached eggs on the last day and they took a long time to arrive and were overcooked. The sleep quality for me was very good - we did have a room at the front of the hotel but I didn't have any problem with noise the shutters are really good and kept the room quiet and kept the light out so we slept right through till 9 or 10 which was great. I found the Staff very helpful and knowledgeable, they were friendly and happy to help with queries or if you need suggestions, directions or help with transport.

But let me first point out its strong points. The hotel is perfectly located across the street from Prado Museum, the rooms are on the small side but clean and well appointed. Breakfast is varied and the staff working in the breakfast room are kind and helpful. I would have been satisfied with the hotel had we not received such poor treatment. We arrived at the hotel past midnight, tired from 2 flights, expecting to meet friends we had not seen for a year, dying to lie down, only to be informed that somehow our reservation (made in January!) had been lost and there was no room available for us. A receptionist who barely spoke English and who I doubt understood even half of what we said to him tried to explain what had happened with an IT breakdown. We were told (with little or no regret) that we had to go to another hotel for the night and come back the next day. I somehow had the impression that these people thought that as long as they offered us alternative accommodation everything was ok. It was not. Firstly, my friend is of limited mobility and she was exhausted from being wheeled around 3 airports between the flights. Moreover, the hotel we were sent to had stairs leading to its entrance and these were simply too much for her. Secondly, we were meeting friends who live in the USA and Canada in Madrid for our annual reunion and they too were staying in NH Nacional. Obviously this was very inconvenient for us. What they did for us was reimburse us for the taxi to the other NH hotel at 2 am and the taxi back to NH Nacional the next morning; we were given a bigger room for our second and third night (looked small until we saw how small our friends\u2019 room was), a free bottle of water and some sweets\u2026The manager came to speak to my friend to apologize in person. Little consolation, in my opinion, especially when you have in mind that we did pay for all three nights. I am not sure I would stay there during my next trip to Madrid. If you choose to stay there, make sure you confirm your reservation with them a couple of times. One last word of warning: there\u2019s a very big and very popular night club in the basement of the building.

After passing a couple of dodgy looking ones, we found this very nice hotel on the north-east corner of the large plaza 800 metres from the railway station, at the corner of Paseo del Prado and Calle de Atocha, above a McDonald's restaurant. We did not know it at the time, but it was just 200 metres south of the Prado Museum, which is further along the same street, on the other side of the road. It is also only two blocks north of the Raina Sofia art museum. We were so relieved to find a lovely double room with comfortable king single mattresses on a king base, and great pillows. Also pleasant service from the staff on the desk, who were happy to show us the room. There is free wi-fi for 30 mins in the reception area, as well as a bar, and a solitary computer for hire as well, which is fairly expensive but handy if you're desperate. The breakfast was also not not cheap, but was so good that it was worth every euro cent. It was late January, so the rooms may have been heavily discounted at 105 euros. There is a metro station (also called Atocha) just across the road from the hotel on the same plaza.

It is modern, clean and reasonably priced. The ambiance is not impressive. It obviously caters for busy people who are not interested in luxury. The lobby area and bar are not the sort of places where you would want to chill out with a drink, or meet people. The bedrooms are OK, but nothing special. They are well-serviced. The hotel is a pleasant and interesting walk to Sol (the centre of Madrid) via the busy tourist haunt of the Plaza Santa Ana. Atocha station is a short distance away - great if you want to visit Toledo. DOWN SIDE The NC Nacional is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at. We were on the 8th floor. Directly outside our bedroom window was a huge arched roof. It rolls back to reveal a night club. The partying commences at 12.00 and goes on until 5.30am - well, the Spanish don't eat until very late. Sleep, even with ear plugs, was very difficult. On looking out of the window you could see the kids drinking and dancing and generally having a great time. Personally, when I am in my bedroom at 5.00am I prefer to sleep instead of watch teenagers and twenty-somethings partying. VALUE FOR MONEY Poor if you value sleep.

Location is good - right near the retiro park and prado museum - although there are more central hotels. The only negatives would be the size of the bed (pretty small for 2 people - esp since we were in a premium room), the temperature of the room - too warm and unable to cool it down as well as the noisy traffic.

You have to pay 10 Euros per hour in your room with your own laptop and more at the \"business centre\". On the whole this hotel didnt live up to my expectation, especially after reading from reviews written by other guests. There were always more than two people behind the reception desk but only one speaks good english, and not as friendly and professional as they should be.

Although the location of the hotel (opposite the Atocha railway station) is excellent for making trips to villages in the neighbourhood of Madrid (such as El Escorial or Segovia) , as well as for a visit to the Prado, Reina Sophia and Thyssen museums, a problem is that it is located at the busiest roundabout of Madrid. You will hear the combined, continuous noise of about 32 lanes of trafic. The noise if very loud between 6am and 2am (whcih leaves 4 hours of sleep). Hence, don't expect that you can relax in the hotel or get a lot of sleep. NH Hotels probably know this, which is why the hotel is not expensive. Breakfast is excellent (but not cheap!).
