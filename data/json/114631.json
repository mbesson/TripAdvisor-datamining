The hotel itself was a treat-from the piano music playing in the lobby during the afternoon and evening, the beautifully adorned lobby and nicely appointed rooms. Elevators and hallways are small and narrow as expected in an older hotel. We had a king room, can\u2019t remember what floor we were on, but the size was never an issue. There was a large, flat screen in the room, an armoire and a desk. It didn\u2019t feel crowded or cramped. Bed was comfortable; lots of pillows; linens were soft-no issues with any of these. The view from our room wasn\u2019t great, but we didn\u2019t come for the view. Location was perfect. We were able to leave the car in the garage and walk to different restaurants and the mall (connected to the hotel.) Great location for visiting downtown Indy. We didn\u2019t dine in the restaurant or take part in the Sunday morning pastries offered, so I can\u2019t comment on any of those. Personnel were exceptionally professional, courteous and friendly.

When we arrived in our updated room, which looked awesome, charming and exactly what we look for in a hotel, the TV did not work.

Very close to the Indiana Convention Center and Lucas Oil Stadium. When parking in the parking ramp the cost is $20 per day and you have to walk through the mall with all you personals to get to the Hotel or walk around to front (outside) or of course opt for valet which is hard to find. The rooms are very charming and beautiful with full amoire for our clothing. No coffee pot avaliable, no fridge, no microwave, no iron. Water is left near your ice bucket for an amenity. Would have prefered a coffee pot. The rooms are EXTREMELY DARK, you need to open every single window just to see a little and that is still not much at all, it was very frustrating. The bathroom was leaking around the faucet and soaking all our items on the sink. Doors let in a lot of light from the hallways and not good sound deadening at all in these rooms. Shower was very nice, newer shower head and no water temp fluctuation. One thing that caught our eye several times was that people would order room service and when finished they would put the tray with dirty dishes, coffee etc.. out side of there room in the hallway. These items would sit for at least 2 days (we stayed 4 days) in the hallway and you'd have to walk around or over them and they started to stink, this was very very odd and happened at 2 rooms, not to mention the cocktail glasses that where left for 2 days on a table overlooking the piano in the balcany. Very Odd and untidy!! The staff was pleasant we had no issues with them at all.

However, I will say that the management of the Canterbury Hotel has been very responsive after hearing my concerns. I would have preferred that employees at the time had felt empowered to make decisions to correct issues and deal with problems; but, that said, the Manager and General Manager have made considerable concessions to us, and to my son and his bride, in the interest of service recovery, for which I thank them. _______ We were looking forward to this stay, as part of my son's large wedding party. However, the customer service was poor for a place of this caliber (and price!) and considering we had filled 29 of their 99 rooms! Aside from poor customer attention, the facility itself is lacking and the rooms are not up to the expected standard. Some examples of the lack of meaningful customer service: - No valet was available to unload our vehicle and take our belongings to the room, so I schlepped everything up myself. I even passed staff members on my journey and was not offered help - Night staff was lackadaisical, with one staff member rude to the point of being surly; he couldn't be bothered with requests \u2013 he was too busy surfing the web on the computer in an alcove by the desk. The night manager left my son and his new bride in their full wedding regalia sitting on the floor for 2 hours at 5 AM when the door to their penthouse suite wouldn't open! - Room service staff was unhelpful and generally rude - We requested an iron be sent to our room; an hour later we went down to the desk to fetch one. The facility itself is not up to par, either, although the lobby area and Tucker\u2019s bars are both very nice. The rooms are tiny, dark and HOT! (Our room was so dark -- bulbs that were of low wattage or missing -- that we had to iron in the hallway.) The outlet in the bathroom didn't work. Our daughter's room had no working light in the bathroom at all; she and her husband had to insist on a room change several hours into their stay. Fixtures throughout looked worn. The keycards routinely malfunctioned, necessitating trips up and down to the desk. And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance -- there was roach crawling on the floor.

When we arrived in our room, we were taken aback at how cramped and small the room was. We had multiple lights out in our room, then had to switch rooms because they couldn't get them working. The real disappointment was the staff. I ran into one young man late at night and asked where breakfast was served the next morning. He wasn't at the desk, but rather at the computer and could hardly be bothered by my question. He was rude and completely unprofessional. Additionally, we ordered room service late another night and were treated with rudeness as well. We were also continuously locked out of our room, as our key cards only worked randomly...this included the night of my brother's wedding when MANY of us, including the groom and his bride, were unable to get into our rooms. I'm honestly not picky when it comes to staying at hotels, except when I'm spending a good amount of money for a hotel that prides itself on impeccable customer service, as the Canterbury does.

Celebrating the completion of a work project and Valentine's Day, we checked in on a Friday afternoon. We were blown away by the beauty of the lobby and were warmly greeted. We quickly dropped off our suitcase and laptop computer, ran errands for 1/2 hour, then returned to check in. Our suitcase was immediately located, but our hearts sank as the bellhop said \"You got the computer earlier, right?\" We were obviously distressed as he checked the desk and several places before finally locating it five minutes later it in a storage closet. These things happen, but he offered no apology. We thought the elevators were fast (other reviewers complained about this). The standard queen room on the 9th floor was ok... but very small. We had been told that the new owner plans to update the rooms in a Ralph Lauren style, so we were not disappointed with the older wallpaper. The room was very clean, had easily accessible outlets by the bed for my laptop, and good reading lamps. Furniture was worn (one post on the 4-post bed had been glued on and was very rickety). We were most disappointed with the sheets which were rough (come on, since the rooms are outdated and dinky at least splurge on luxurious linens). I slept well, but the fan blew directly on my husband in bed and he was up several times trying to correct the setting. Overall, you only want a standard queen room if you plan to be out most of the time since this is not a comfortable, relaxing space (which was our goal). It's nice that there is an entrance to the City Centre Mall and the location to other restaurants couldn't be better. Turners Restaurant was the best part of our stay (both dinner and breakfast). Excellent food (worth the price) and extra friendly service. Although the Groupon web page says 10% discount on Turners, the Groupon print-out does not mention it. So we had to leave paying full price. I looked it up overnight and told the staff during check-out. It was quite a lengthy fuss (20 minutes or more) to get them to reimburse us and they seemed flummoxed and even suspicious that the last name on the restaurant credit card (my husband's) was different than my card which we used on the room. They finally reimbursed us, and we got a quick apology for the length of time it took, but we both left with the impression that reception staff do not like discounts and special deals and had not been told enough about the Groupon). The young staff needs to learn the value of a smile and a sincere apology. To seal the deal, we left our cell phone charger in an outlet. Several calls to housekeeping and a trip back downtown to look at cords, and no luck finding it, and again no apology. I had to suggest to the receptionist that she record my name and contact information in case they find it (I'm not holding my breath). We had such high expectations about the wonderful service that others had reported, but other than the great restaurant, waiters, and grand lobby we might as well have been at a Super 8 (they would have probably offered an in-room coffee maker, though).

According to the hotel's website and some reviews, the hotel is undergoing a must needed update. Unfortunately, I saw little evidence. At the registration, the two clerks were pleasant, but not efficient. After assigning me my room, I took the EXTREMELY SLOW elevator to the fourth floor. On entering the room, I thought I was outside, the room being very cold. I then turned on the heat. Interestingly, half the vent threw out cold air while the bottom half threw out warm air, leaving the room cold. I then called the desk and told them about the problem. To their credit, within five minutes someone was at my door to move me to a new room. I then was assigned a room on the 12th floor. It was a nice sized room, but once again the heating--although warm--was not easy to control. The room was clean with a comfortable bed. Unfortunately, it was right near the elevator whose door and sound awakened me very early in the morning. The television is out of the 1950s, very old with poor quality picture. Also, no coffee machine in the room, but there were bottles of water. A breakfast did accompany the room, but the breakfast room was being painted. Hence, breakfast was simple, but okay, and serviced in a room by the front desk. Actually, the coffee was good! Overall, I would rate the stay as average. I believe I paid a \"special\" rate of $139.00 the room. There are other hotels in the area that are less expensive and much better updated. To be fair, the staff was courtesy, helpful, and pleasant. The room, simply average and needs updating, greatly. If you have any difficulities with elevators, stay away from this hotel. Sometimes people have to wait ten minutes to get the elevator. Finally, some of my friends simply walked down the stairs from their room on the third floor with their luggage due to the slow elevator.

Not only would I recommend the hotel to a friend, but I'd stay there again if I returned to the Indy. We were within walking distance to many restaurants, shopping, Conseco Arena and Lucas Oil Field. It was easy to access the hotel from the expressway and easy to get back to the expressway when necessary. I'd like to say that before booking here, I'd read a lot of mixed reviews on the property. I decided to book the room based on great reviews of the most important things to me- cleanliness and service. Many of the complaints were about the outdated decor of the rooms, which I think is really superficial. It's a historic Hotel, it'd seem wrong if everything was slick and modern. Yes, I felt kind of like I was visiting Grandma's house with the wallpaper & furnishings, but that's okay. I found it welcoming and comfortable. The \"flaws\" in my 8th floor room were so minor - I actually looked for them based on the reviews I'd read - I commend the staff for keeping the hotel in such great shape. There was a little tearing in the wallpaper next to the tub and the switchplates for the light switches had little scratches. The service was impeccable. When we arrived, Keith - the valet - introduced himself and parked the car. After that, whenever he saw us come and go, he greeted us by name! The rest of the staff that we had contact with was equally as friendly. Lastly, I want to comment on the restaurant/breakfast. Some of the reviews I read had negative comments on the breakfast. The complimentary breakfast is a nice buffet. They offer scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, bacon, some sort of danish/pastry, varied fruits and one day we also saw English muffins and bagels. You could also order from the menu, but that was not free. While some may feel this breakfast lacks in variety, the quality of the food was excellent - much better than mini boxes of cold cereal, or stale, pre-packaged pastries.
