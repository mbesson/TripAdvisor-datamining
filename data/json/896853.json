You can hear the chairs dragging above you...on top of the howeling stray cats, barking dogs and frequent trains. My mother and sisters room had wall paper coming off the walls, black mold in the shower and a foul smell emitting from \"somewhere\". There are nicer places to stay...so I would avoid this one.

The service offered by Erdal and the rest of the staff was outstanding, always friendly and warmly inviting, always helpful, even when it was very late/early. They helped me get to and from the airport with a minimum of hassle, which was great since my outbound flight was quite early. First thing on arrival Erdal gave me a map with the location of all the nearby sights and amenities (e.g, pharmacy and ATM). So I was ready to roll right away! I was traveling solo, so I received one of the smaller rooms on a lower floor, which was fine since I was literally only in the room to sleep! Even so, the room and bath were both quite adequate in size. There was even a mini-fridge in the room, so I could keep small amounts of my own drinks etc there. The bathroom had a towel warmer so if you did any hand laundry it would dry easily and quickly. Shampoo was provided; the showers were nice and hot (which was welcome after a cool damp March day!). There was also a safe in the wardrobe within the room, so you could leave extra cash, or your passport, or other valuables safe. The breakfast was just wonderful, thick yogurt, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, other cheeses, halvah, figs, apricots, raisins, nuts, some slightly sweet biscuits (which I could not get enough of!). Plus, served on the rooftop patio/sunroom, making it an enjoyable experience year round. I just wanted to sit and drink coffee all morning there, but got myself moving and out to see the city! I still dream of that breakfast though! There were great unobstructed views of the Blue Mosque and the Sea of Marmara from the sunroom, which provided a great location for some nighttime photos of the mosque. The location of the hotel can't be beat....a 5 min walk from the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. It was almost too good to be true!

Abdullah, the second gentleman to staff the desk, was also very personable and truly interested in the quality of our stay. Hilmiye staffed the restaurant (among other roles) and always made sure we had a great breakfast! All three fashioned a great resource to make our stay 100% fantastic. This is a great team. The location of the hotel, it could be argued, was effectively perfect. While its just being in the old city already makes this true, the hotel's location within this area -- a quieter but fantastically convenient street -- made it even better. We had a magnificent city at our feet! We stayed in two rooms while at this hotel. The first night was spent in one of the smaller rooms on the second floor which one might find a little tight if one is used to conventional Western/North American rooms. The remaining nights were spend in the Dolmabahce Suite (top floor, overlooking the Strait), a genuinely great room. The beds were comfy, the water was hot, and the view was perfect. The all important question: Would we stay here again? Absolutely an unqualified yes. Thank you, folks, you gave us memories which will last a lifetime!

This is an old converted Ottoman mansion which is in a fantastic location with a 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and all the historic sites and the Sultanahmet tram stop. That being said, the hotel itself is average. We had a very small room, similar to a cruise cabin in size. I believe all the rooms are slightly different, we might have had the smallest room though. The bathroom was tiny as well and again the shower reminded me of a cruise shower- tiny ( if you drop the soap, you are bound to hit some part of your body in an effort of bending to pick it up). I am not overweight and am only 5' 2. I can't imagine what would happen if you are a bigger person. We were on the first floor and were thankful for that as the hotel doesn't have an elevator and the stairs are very steep. The rooms are decorated in Turkish fashion, not my taste, but everything was clean and functional. Air conditioning worked, but leaked on the floor a bit ( nothing crazy), but we did bring it up to reception one eve, and were told tat someone would check it out in am, but was never followed through. Since we brought it up once, but never taken care of and really wasn't a huge issue for us, we did not bother to mention it again. I have to say that if you are person that uses a blow drier on a regular basis BRING YOU OWN!. This hotel has the worst blow dryer I have ever used. It doesn't stay on( energy saving?) and you have to keep the button pressed down the whole time, except the button is very poorly positioned and your wrist is at an odd angle the whole time. My other complaint is the balcony, which could have been a a lot nicer and an extension of the room. There were 2 chairs and a table, but that's it. It overlooked an old dilapidated house in an alley full of stray cats ( we counted 12 at one time), and the train tracks. Now I realize that the hotel has nothing to do with that, but the balcony could have had some nice plants on it or flower pots. Minimal changes could have made this balcony a pleasure to use. All of the above were minor inconveniences that didn't detract from our trip, but I thought were worth mentioning. The breakfast was adequate on the rooftop terrace. The staff was pleasant. The train stops running at night ( train tracks in the back of hotel), so you are not disturbed during your sleep. Some great art pieces throughout. If you are looking for a modern or Marriott/Hilton, etc.. chain hotel experience, this hotel is not for you. We knew coming to this hotel what to expect after reading other trip advisor reviews, although I thought the rooms would be a bit bigger. The price and location is the reason I would recommend this hotel. If your booking qualifies you for a free airport pick up, great. If not I would recommend taking a taxi which was only 35 lira. Just make sure you have a map of the hotel, as there are so many little alleys that even the taxi drivers get lost once they get into Sultanahmet. It was really helpful that we had one.

We opted for the Dolmabahce Suite which is really giving one an Oriental taste of luxury, as attached photos should testify ( even the the trash bin is graciously wrapped in tulle). As the other reviews warned, the room gives over a railway and the immediate backyard view from the balcony is far from enchanting, but if one raises the eyes to the horizon it is is greatly compensated by the beautiful view of the Maramara Sea, with a glimpse of the Asian coast and, on clear days , of the nearest Prnices islands. The train did not disturb us at all as it stoped circulating at around midnight and probably in the morning when it started again, sleep was to deep to be disturbed ( we spent in total three nights there) . Location is also absolutely unbeatable for this hotel, it's really walking minutes away to Aya Sofia, the Blue Mosque ,and most Sultanahmet attractions. As other reviews mentioned the staff is one of the friendliest and most eager to help we ever met in a hotel! However there are a few areas for improvement which if overcome would make this place absolutely perfect. - Cleanliness is acceptable, but not spotless! It was great to be able to get to our room immediately upon arrival ( before 12 am) however it was a less pleasant surprise to find in a drawer stuff left over by previous room occupants . Blinds were badly needing a clean and the white furniture a vigorous wiping. - The quality of the sleep would be excellent if it wasn't for the pillows that are stone rigid cylinders and the thick, rigid cloth with a very unpleasant touch that's provided as a cover sheet... - If it wasn't for the beautiful view and the pleasant atmosphere on the rooftop terrace, breakfast would be a big disapointment . Coffee is an awful pale couloured liquid, no fresh fruit except (literally) the same ( excessively) ripe watermelon and a poor variety of cereals and cheeses/ charcuterie .

He introduced us to Atilla, who also made sure our every wish, to their best ability, was satisfied. Erdal communicated with me via email for several months prior to our departure. He offered great suggestions as to what to do while we were in Istanbul and made reservations for us to have a Turkish speaking guide for a day. Breakfast was on the roof of the hotel overlooking the Bosphorus Sea. It was a traditional Turkish breakfast with tomatoes, cucumber, yogurt, figs, hard boiled eggs and cereal, Turkish tea and biscuits. Every restaurant that either Erdal or Atilla recommended was fabulous. Erdal even walked with us to one fish restaurant to make sure we got a good table. The rooms and bathrooms are small but the prices are great and, really, who stays in their room when visiting Istanbul? They were decorated very well with more of a feminine flair. We understood from Erdal that 2 women, one of whom is an artist, own the hotel. Her art is tastefully throughout the hotel.

We stayed three nights and on the second day, the maid, having done a decent job of cleaning the room, had for some reason thrown our bed cover on top of the wardrobe. It got fairly chilly at night so it was puzzling why the hotel thought we wouldn't need the covers and why on top of the wardrobe? There is a TV and fridge with softdrinks. As far as we could tell there was no English news available and there was no complimentary water. There is a train nearby that goes by now and again but it didnt bother us at all. The interior design of the hotel is quaint as is shown on the website. Breakfast consisted of fruits, cereal, boiled eggs, bread, jams, coffee, tea, orange juice, hams, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese and was satisfying. The woman in the breakfast area could have been a little more friendly. There is a nice view of the Blue Mosque from the roof. Free wireless internet is available throughout the hotel but didn't always work properly.

Our daughter who is based in Egypt then said that she would join us in Istanbul. Yilmaz wanted 130 Euro per night for a room for her to stay with us. We refused and found another hotel for her about 100 metres away at 50 Euros per night. The car we had ordered to collect us from the airport arrived an hour after we cleared passport and Customs control. Yilmaz still wanted to charge us 30 Euros for the transfer when the going rate was 30/35 Lira, which is what we paid a taxi for all 3 of us on the way back! [The hotel my daughter stayed at gave her a free transfer as she was staying 7 nights]. I had read reviews that warned about the rooms next to the reception area being noisy and so had asked for a room on another floor. We were given room 202 at the back of the hotel. It was tiny. It may have been ok for one night for one person but totally inappropriate for a couple staying for a week. The room overlooked the Marmara sea but the foreground was a mix of broken roofs and run down buildings. Perhaps the most annoying feature was the railway line running past just 50 metres way. The sound of trains building up speed or slowing down as they approached the station was unacceptable. Nowhere to hang clothes or store in drawers in the bedroom and no place to put toiletries in the bathroom made it uncomfortable; particularly when the very small shower cubicle leaked all over the floor. We naturally complained and Yilmaz accepted that there were problems and moved us to room 303 on the third floor; a triple room at the front of the hotel. The added space made for a more comfortable stay but the lack of heating meant that it was far from cosy. We did manage to get the heating turned up one night but it was down again the following day. The hotel is clean; it is in a good location and the staff; Ahmed the night steward, and the lady who prepared breakfast and cleaned the rooms were as helpful as you could possibly hope to find. Not too sure why anyone rated this hotel so highly in the reviews we read before we booked the place. We went with an open mind but felt really quite let down by Yilmaz who had a number of rooms vacant throughout the week and could easily have accommodated our daughter and made a few extra Turkish Lira as a consequence; his loss. Hopefully he will improve the facilities in the future so that new guests see an improved value for money service. This is classed as a \"Boutique/ 4* hotel\" but it barely scrapes above a hostel level. Calling itself a refurbished \"Ottoman Mansion\" is a meaningless term and doesn't translate into any quality measure. On a scale of 0 to 5 this hotel must rate at about 2 and that is only because of the friendly staff, the overall cleanliness and the proximity to the major sites of Istanbul .\"", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ankara", "Title": "\u201csmall pearl in Sultanhamet\u201d", "Author": "maxluis", "ReviewID": "UR22702402", "Content": "The location is perfect to visit the most monumental side of ancient Istanbul, including Hagya Sofia, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi.

I asked for a fruit basket with a note from me to my wife (as we were celebrating a special occasion) and they provided it free of charge. And on the day of our departure, Yilmaz arrived a little earlier than the start time of his shift just to say good bye to us. Also they have well arranged the shuttle from and to the airport in a comfortable car. We stayed in two rooms during our stay because the sea view room was not available for the first 2 nights (we were well informed of that before making the booking). Both rooms were absolutely beautiful, especially the room in the back side of the hotel which had a balcony with a magnificent view of the Marmara sea. The rooms were small but that is the case for nearly all the similar hotels in the area, they were cleaned everyday and towels were changed everyday. The heating system was working properly and the shower had a good flow of warm water, which was something we appreciated every night after a long stroll in the cold city. The breakfast served every morning was basic but delicious, it contained; boiled eggs, cheese, mortadella, butter, jam, honey, fresh Turkish bread, olives, corn flex, nuts and dried fruits, plus American coffee and tea. Also espresso coffee is available (but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for free) The hotel is within 5 minutes walk to all the major attractions in Sultanahmet area, Blue Mosque, Aiya Sophia, and Top Kapi palace.

We found the hotel very handy to all the historic buildings such as Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque and Basilica Cistern to name a few. But equally important was its proximity to the tram, rail and City Explorer buses if we wanted to go further. We walked along the waterfront and explored the Hareem garden easily and always found time to unwind on the rooftop terrace and take in the views with a cold drink as the sun went down - beautiful. The hotel was very clean and has been tastefully decorated by the 3 sisters with a large variety of paintings and sculptures throughout accenting the hand painted furniture.

The staff were icredibley friendly and made a huge fuss of our 18 month old daughter. They were really helpful with everything from transport to organising getting some laundry done.
