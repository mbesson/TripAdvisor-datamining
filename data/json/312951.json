I got used to it and the kids and my husband didn't hear anything. The kitchen was modern and small, but so well equipped and I loved the small dishwasher and the microwave. Water and teabags were ready as a welcome package. The first day the cleaning lady washed even our dishes, that we forgot, but unfortunately she didn't on the second day. We weren't sure, if this service is included. However, the beds and bathroom were done every day. The bathroom was just great. Full of daylight and the huge nice tub. Our kids just loved it. We felt as if we had an apartment of our own in Paris and we will definitively come back again with the kids. Also because the neighbourhood was so peaceful and with hardly any tourists. The bakery and grocery shop just downstairs were very convenient and there were many small restaurants. The metro station is just 2min away and on a very good line to the Trocadero (5min) and the Champs-Elysees (8min). In a 5min walk you are just at the Seine and say hello to the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower.

We were able to accommodate nine comfortably for breakfast one morning (including friends who had rented an apartment on the ground floor). Paris was in the grip of an intolerable heatwave when we arrived and the air-conditioning was extremely welcome. The rooms were all clean and the kitchen was surprisingly well-equipped. The bathrooms were obviously renovated recently and the showers were spacious and efficient. The area has a village atmosphere and there are plenty of good restaurants locally. The sushi takeaway on the right just past the Jasmin Metro station is excellent - we bought bento boxes for a picnic lunch and they were excellent value and quality. The arondissement is very safe, so much so that we were happy to walk back from the Eiffel Tower at midnight with our two teenaged daughters.

We took metro/train to Hotel from EuroDisney (which took us about 45 minutes) and it was very easy to find! Very safe neighborhood! If you want to live like a Parisian, this is a place to stay! Bakery is in the same building, so you can get fresh croissants every morning and make your own coffee, since cappuccinos are 4.50 Euro in Paris, you can save a lot of money just on it. Groccery store is a 5 minute walk away, small market to get fresh fruit and veggies is right there by the groccery store, and I've seen it there at least three times, I assume it's an everyday morning event. We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights, beds are comfortable. Kids enjoyed sleeping on a hide-a-bed in the livingroom (we had a deluxe suite). A teakettle, a coffee maker, pots and pans, even a small dishwasher, everything you need to make a dinner, small refrigrator! AC or heater, whatever you need to make your stay like HOME. There was always plenty of hot water, actually the shower is super nice, mordern, updated. Everything in the hotel is very well taken care of, SUPER CLEAN. I could let my baby crawl everywhere and I knew that it's all safe and clean for her. The service is excellent! Professional, friendly, helpful staff, they all spoke good English. The laundry room is in the basement downstairs, we were given laundry detergent for free! Just remember, European washers and dryers take a lot longer to wash and dry your clothes.

The staff were wonderful and we were treated so kindly when we were caught up in the volcanic ash plane delay! We phoned from the airport and were told straight away we could return for as long as we wished and we were allocated a simpler apartment that would help with the cost of what turned out to be an additional 5 nights! An extra bed was put in at no extra cost and we stayed for free on the Sunday. This apartment was again very well set out and spotlessly clean. We enjoyed looking out over the street and people watching from the balcony although the downside was that on the first floor now we had very disturbed night's sleep because of the extremely noisy traffic building up at the corner junction from time to time. The local area was wonderful and we made friends with lovely folk in the boulangerie next door and in the Village Restaurant where we went for the 3rd time on our last night and were given free drinks and delightfully gallic embraces as we left and promised to return!

In general hotel terms it would surely rank no higher than 3 stars. Let me qualify first by saying that we chose an apartment as there were 4 of us and we were hoping for a living area where we could chill out in the evenings rather than having to use a hotel bar. Just somewhere to sit and chat in between the day's sightseeing and going out for an evening meal and then at the end of the evening. Unfortunately the living area was cramped and uncomfortable. We had the family suite on the 5th floor which sleeps up to 6. The living area has 1 two seater sofa (not very comfortable) and a dining table with 4 chairs. Had there been 6 of us it would have been very cramped. Even with 4 of us it just wasn't comfortable.and not somewhere that we wanted to sit for any length of time. Based on the price we paid, we would have been as good in a reasonable hotel. As others have said the kitchens are small and very basic but given we only used it for breakfast it was more than adequate. The bedrooms were also a bit on the small side. The main bedroom was well furnished but the other two bedrooms were very basic and lacked cupboards in one of them, bedside tables and bedside lamps but they were adequate for a 4 night stay and they were clean. There is a maid service to make the beds and clean the bathrooms each day. On the plus side, the hotel is in a residential area quite a way out of the tourist part of Paris but only a 15 minute Metro journey away. It only took us 30 minutes to walk to the Eifeel Tower and it was a very pleasant stroll. There are lots of little shops and restaurants around and we felt that we were living as locals rather than as tourists. However, on the two weekdays we were there, we were awoken at 4.30 each morning to lots of banging which we think must be the Boulangerie/Patisserie in the same block. Good restaurants nearby are Bistrot 31 (excellent) on Rue Theophile Gautier and Brandevin (very good) on Rue du Dr Blanche. As it's off the tourist track little English is spoken but both were very welcoming and served good food and are within 5 minutes walk..

The broad, tree lined, main street (R. de Mozart) invites strolling. It is a 25 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower or just a few blocks to 2 different Metro lines. On a map, the hotel appears far from the center of Paris, but the Metro puts all of Paris just minutes away. This very upscale residential neighborhood has wonderful bakeries, cheese shops, small groceries and prepared food take-out food shops, which we tried several times. We ate our main meal of the day at lunch and ate lighter fare for dinner. After days sightseeing and shopping, returning to the hotel for a light meal and relaxing was a welcome opportunity. Parisians also eat dinner quite late. We stayed in Apartment 12 on the second floor. It had a very large and comfortable bedroom with plenty of illumination and ample storage space; a bathroom with a stall shower and plenty of hot water; and a fully stocked apartment-sized kitchen. After a week's stay in several quite small hotel rooms while in Provence, this apartment was a very pleasant change. It also had several large windows opening onto a courtyard that provided fresh air but no noise. The hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful. This included several pre-trip and post-trip e-mails, as well as during our stay. Happily, we had very few needs. An on-site laundry is a convenience, but there also are several laundries nearby in the neighborhood. Overall, this hotel was a great find.
