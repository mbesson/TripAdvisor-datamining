The room was clean and everything was in good order, although I struggled to understand the point of a small safe that could be locked, but could also be picked up and carried away - as it was not bolted down to anything. The bed was very comfortable and the TV had BBC World, which made a pleasant change from our recent experience in NY where it was difficult to avoid Fox. Breakfast was good if not great. Don't arrive too late or there may be no omelette/scrambled egg left. The star of the hotel is Hamuk, the long-haired cat which looks a bit like a rug and who has eyes of different colours.

I am one of those people who gets thoroughly miserable if I am given things I don't particularly want just so that the hotel can justify fleecing me. As many tripadvisor reviewers have pointed out the prices reflect that this is a no-nonsense, clean and friendly hotel in an extremely convenient location. Our room was really very small. That said, it was clean and tidy. The bathroom worked and it was reasonably quiet at night (although we were slightly disturbed by other guests rolling in in the small hours). The views are good, especially if you look out to sea rather than down to a rather scruffy, rubbishy area down below. The self-service breakfasts were first rate A steaming samovar of tea, bread and simit, a wide choice of delicious and unusual jams, eggs, and (an especially good touch) a mixture of pekmez and tahin that looks rather unappetising but tastes delicious. The cheese, though, was rather disappointing. Surely good fresh white cheese is readily available, so why the rather tired processed cheese? But the rest of the breakfast was so good that this can be overlooked. The service was extremely friendly and helpful.

Walkable distance to any attracts. The terrance for breakfast is lovely. However, the reception is a terrible terrible experience, erasing all the plus from this hotel. There's a young guy, called Mustafa (not sure if it's his real name cause he refused to write his name for us) is the worst receptionist I ever met during my trips anywhere before. 2 small things to share. - The pick-up I booked did not show up when I arrived in Istanble on first day. Mustafa insisted it's not HIS problem. When standing in the front desk, he's representing the hotel not himself, but seems he did not know this at all. Keep arguing with me even when I managed taxi to hotel by myself. Apprecited that he arranged early check-in for me when I finally agreed it's not his personal fault but sth. wrong with the communication. - When left Istanbul for Izmir, we left 2 luggages in their hotel & informed them we'll be back to pick up at very late night on Oct.6th. The front desk even put a note with our name & arrival date on the luggage, making sure there'll be receptionist to take care of this when we're back no matter how late it is. However, the thing did not go smoothly. When we arrived in Istanbul at 23:30 on the 6th, we called poem said we're going over to take our luggages, it is exactly the same guy, Mustafa, took the phone (bad luck), said he's not informed & did not know anything about the luggage at all, so we could not come over at the moment but should wait till 9:00am next day! We said there's a note on the suitcase and we could bring our passports over to identify ourselves. He still insisted he did not know anything about luggage and did not know where the luggages were kept. He did not even try to help at all but wish to get rid off the trouble asap. My friend was really pissed off for his rude attitude on this simple issue. So she asked his name on the phone & said we'll let the manager know this the next day. He's then changed a little bit & agreed us to take the luggage. When arrived in the hotel, it took him 10 seconds to find the luggage, which is just around the corner under the stairs. It did not cost him anything to give back OUR luggage. The worst thing is he still keep argueing with my friend said all he did is to secure our luggage even when we took the luggage at midnight, did not caring the guests were sleeping at the moment! Jesus! And he did reconganized us at his first glance and did not check any identification at all. When we tried to write a comment in the hotel notebook, he even stopped my friend, pushing her away with his elbow! How childish the manner seemed to us. It should have been a nice stay in this small hotel. We love the location & the terrence. But with this rude guy, Mustafa, we will never come back again. and we strongly suggest you do not live with this hotel unless you did not meet this young guy for any communication.

A cozy place wher one easily feels at home, especiallly with the genuine friendlienes of the helpful and efficient staff, located just at the edge of the gentrified section of Sultanahmet, in a perfect location for sightseeing on foot and close to public transport to anywhere you might want to go, yet away from the crowds. Istanbul has many wonderful places to stay, but Hotel Poem offers excellent value for your money, plus the special charm that no money could buy. Be aware that there are trade-offs for staying in an authentic historic building: some rooms are extremely tiny. They are not claustrophobic, though, but cheerful, bright, and immaculately clean (this was a great place even before the recent renovation; now it has become even better.) The charming maze of the hotel's steps up and down to the rooms and to the lovely terraces may be dificult to negotiate for elderly or incapacitated guests, even if the friendly staff is happy to help. Also, in this location commanding over the busy waters you will hear the constant murmur of passing ships and boats. I didn't find the sound disturbing or offensive, rather, it is part of the magical location. And then, nothing can beat waking up with the view from above on ships and fishing boats on the Sea of Marmara and at the mouth of the Bosphorus.

On the other hand, my last two nights I got four hours sleep due to all the party's coming from the adjacent youth hostels and clubs--not the hotel's fault of course, but be clear, this is not a quiet neighborhood this time of year, even if the street it is on is less noisy than the ones with restaurants on them. And this was a Sunday night. Thump thump disco beats from the west, and very loud Oriental music from a restaurant to the east. There are also two buildings, the main one and the second. In mine, the second, it was also quite noisy in terms of doors shutting and opening and even normal conversations in the hallway seemed amplified due to the acoustics. So if you are lying in bed falling asleep and someone comes home, their conversations and doors shutting can wake you. Also, if you do stay here, get a room in the back, mine, which faced the street, had lots of street noise early in the a.m. and into all hours every night of the 6 i stayed there. But overall, this neighboorhood, is full of backpacker's hostels, which means young people drinking alcohol into the wee hours on a pretty regular basis; in future i would just find a different neighboorhood with less night life and tourism, since its so easy to get into the old town by tram and even ferry. Another issue was the AC--the remote was faulty, and the first night the night staff person seemed put upon to fix it, and the first time just replaced it with a second broken remote (there is no manual way to operate the AC). So I came home late and tired to another broken remote that was jury rigged with aluminium foil. Finally got a third one that worked, though not too well (have to get up and stand right next to the ac and aim real well to get it to go), after a bit of stress, and in contrast to the great shower, the AC did not work very well at all, with a very weak fan, so the first nights when it wasn't that hot, and i just wanted some neutral air circulation without opening the windows to the voices of the street, it wasn't possible. They should just replace these ancient AC units and get remotes that work. Finally, and this would be the primary reason i wont be back, the managing partner, Adnan, was quite rude for no reason i could think of. My first morning i could not get the door open to the lobby from the back patio, and here again, there is a faulty door handle that you have to fiddle with until its right. So he comes up behind me, and grabs the door handle to open it, i imagine he will graciously let me pass as i am ahead of him, rather, he just rushes thru ahead very brusquely, a la a scene in Faulty Towers. Now, as i try to close the door behind me, i tell him (he is now behind the desk) i am not sure i can close this, and he yells at me in an irritated scolding fashion, \"oh just leave it open\" all of this with no eye contact and a real annoyed tone. His assistant, whose name i don't remember, the early 40's-ish female. My second day i asked her about the open air spice market that their web site mentions is in front of the hotel on Wednesdays. She well nigh yells at me like I am accusing her of treason, \"there is no spice market, where did you get that idea.\" When i told her its on the web site, but hey no problem if there is none, she yells in a rather shockingly vociferousness tone, \"there is nothing on the web site about that....\" So when i bring up her web site on the lobby computer just to show her i am not insane (at this point this interaction is so stressful i just want to calm her down ) she says, ohhh, that's really old information, sorry. But the whole interaction was so bizarre, i mean i am quite a gentle soul, so i have no idea what generated that. In my other interactions, such as asking how to get to the bus and what not, I found both this woman and Adnan, impatient, irritable, even aggressive, not at all as described by some folk on this site. By the end of my stay, they had warmed up a tad, but definitely this was a huge minus for me..Especially with a name like \"Poem\" and with a poem in each room, i expected a staff with a more gentle nature. I believe some of the glowing reviews must be written during off season when this bizarrely tense staff hopefully relaxes, perhaps also by people staying in the \"superior\" and \"deluxe superior\" rooms, which i got a look at and they did look lovely. My room was essentially a postage stamp, with an uncomfortable uneven mattress to boot. In a town like Istanbul with hundreds of hotels in the 5 block radius of \"Poem\" I think one could easily do better, and I also would probably not stay in Sultanhamet again, as its so easy to tram or taxi in to see the blue mosque and topkapi and then retreat to a quieter saner neighboorhood. Finally, about the \"view of the city and sea\" my room at least had no view of any city other than the street immediately below, though the folks in the opposite hotel roof had a good view into my room. My friend's room, which was in the back had a tiny sliver of view of the Bosphorous, nothing terribly atmospheric. But the back yard view, which on the website is of a lucious garden, is actually a giant vacant yard full of rubbish, garbage, construction debris, and fighting cats. The pictures i have posted are of what you see from the patio dining area. It is actually worse than it looks. And when it rains the whole patio is covered in snails. One got on my shoe un-beknowns to me, and when i got up to my room a heard a crunch.

It was in the heart of the city and a very short walk to The Blue Mosque and the main attractions. It is in a quiet street just off a main street full of lovely restaurants and a few bars. It was lovely to be woken up in the early morning with the call to prayer. The hotel has 2 seperate buildings. The main building with the reception area then across a walkway a second ajoining building with more bedrooms. The reception area is nice and cosy but not the staff or the welcome. Staff often ignored us and only spoke to us when they had to. The only exception to this was the guy who looked after the breakfast room who was polite, kind and gave faultless service. It was also in stark contrast to the local people who could not have been more helpful and friendly. On the recommendation of staff I walked quite some disance to visit what they called one of the best and most important mosques in the city only to find it closed and half way through a massive long-term renovation programme, surely they knew about this before they sent me off to visit it. There is a roof terrace but it looked bare and neglected. The hotel across the road looked much nicer and their roof terrace looked fantastic. Breakfast was continental, yummy and plenty of it. I gained several pounds on the breakfasts alone! My bedroom & bathroom were tiny. I barely had any floor space to walk in and the minibar doubled as my bedside table as there was so little room. The bathroom was that small I virtually had to step into the shower in order to close the door and I had to squeeze passed the loo to use the shower. It was very uncomfortable. My friend had a room in the other building and his room was much bigger and although his bathroom wasn't that much bigger the layout made it much better to access and use. The walls are paper thin and I struggled to sleep the first night due to the snoring of the person in the next room, thank goodness they checked out the next morning! I did have my doubts about this hotel and went on to their website for reassurance however what you see on their website is not what you get. The photos on the website must be years old as it does not remotely resemble the hotel as it it now.

The basic rooms are quite small and the bathrooms in the smaller rooms little more than closets, but then they are small in the other boutique hotels as well. The breakfast is fresh and while the variety is not terribly wide, (about the same as other hotels of its size in the area), it is plentiful and one can relax in the lovely glassed in porch and drink tea while eating fresh pastry for as long as desired. It was cold and rainy during our stay, and we sat in the breakfast room for more than two hours, drinking coffee and glass upon glass of tea. Never once did I feel as if I was being rushed to hurry and finish. The hotel is less than a five minute walk to all the major sites and the view from the rooftop is stunning. The Bosporus is one of my favorite bodies of water and to sit and sip wine on the balcony of a room or the rooftop is a pleasure to be savored. I cannot speak too highly of the friendliness of the staff. We truly felt at home and at ease the three days and nights we were there. In short, there are more elaborate (and expensive) hotels in the area, but none with more caring staff. The hotel was booked while we were there, even in winter, and still the staff were attentive.

Firstly, when we arrived at just gone midnight, we were told that they had made a mistake and had let our room for the night. This was despite the fact that we had contacted the hotel that morning before we left home to conform our booking! They then said that it was ok because they had arranged for us to stay at another hotel and that they would pay for a taxi to take us to it. However, the taxi driver took us to the wrong hotel, and we ended up having to walk to the other hotel - with our luggage - in the middle of the night. When we complained about this and asked for a reduction as means of compensation, we were refused, and told that at least we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to sleep on the street! We also later found out that they appear to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble book\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on a regular basis, and they had done so to another lady who arrived midday as we were leaving. Secondly the room was tiny! We stayed in a twin room which was only really big enough to be a single, and only one of us could stand up at a time! Thirdly we found the hotel staff (with the exception of the cleaners) to be unfriendly and unhelpful on the whole. One of the staff even refused to order us a taxi to go to a fish restaurant (by the fish market) that I had visited before, and argued with me when I said it was much cheaper and better than the restaurants on the Bosphus Bridge (which I was scammed at the year before). I have travelled to Turkey many times and I can honestly say that in the past I have always found the Turkish people to be very helpful and friendly; this is the worst treatment that I have had in any hotel there. Istanbul is a fabulous city with many good hotels, often at very reasonable prices; unfortunately Hotel Poem is not one of these. My advice is to look around for deals and stay somewhere else.

Its major pluses, apart from the price and location (the latter is perfect: right in the Sultanahmet hotel district, but on a dead-end side street with no traffic, a 5-min. walk to the Topkapi, Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque and with shops and restaurants all around), are the wonderfully cooperative (and English-speaking) staff, the buffet breakfast served on the garden patio, the rooftop terrace with amazing views out over the rooftops to the Sea of Marmara and of the Blue Mosque, and 24/7 free fast Internet service from a comfortable work station in the reception area. I stayed in two different rooms and they were both quite small (and the bathrooms even smaller with only a hand-held wand shower) but I was only there to sleep. If I wanted to read or have a drink I would go up to the roof. I would definitely stay at The Poem again.

The reception has free internet access, and the staff can't do enough for you. The breakfast was basic but again adequate to set you up for the morning. Tea, coffee, fruit juices, fresh bread, jams, cheeses, yoghurt and fruit. Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely. Comfy beds, helpful staff, great location. I would also recommend the turkish bath that arranges pickup from and transfer to the hotel, plus the half day city tour that also picks you up and drops you off.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Tony3357", "ReviewID": "UR6156816", "Content": "Booked a twin room (for two single people) - and the room was desperately small, really not big enough.

We were fortunate enough to have 'all of a sudden' room for the first two nights. We were gobsmacked by the view from our private balcony, over the sea of marmaris to the asian side of the city. We couldnt wait for daylight to see what the city had to offer. After a great nights sleep in a comfy bed the shower first thing in the morning was fantastic, loads of water pressure... but be careful getting out of the shower if you are unsure on your feet. Breakfast was adequate but the 'nescafe' coffee was dissappointing (which we found to be the case in most of Istanbul). The staff were very helpful and the location was fantastic... the views from the terrace took your breath away, although the decor was uninspiring. The second two nights of our stay we were moved to a room on the lower level overlooking the street which was much smaller and more basic. We were perhaps spoiled by 'all of a sudden' but the rooms were both very clean and the air-con was most effective. All in all a terrific budget hotel in an amazing location which we would not hesitate to recommend. We suggest you book direct through the poem hotel website and ask for 'all of a sudden' room. The reason we had only 2 nights in this room was because of returning guests who stayed at the poem a few times before, and its nice to see customer loyalty being rewarded. The main drag outside the hotel has great bars and 'kosk' restaurant on the corner was a wee gem.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeenshire, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cA diamond in the dust!\u201d", "Author": "clarabelleno1", "ReviewID": "UR5812057", "Content": "A perfect location right in the heart of old Istanbul The staff were so friendly and helpful and breakfast out on the patio every morning in the glorious sunshine was a treat!
