The hotel is loacted on a steep hill but wasn't much of a big deal, I walked everywhere, never had to take the tram or cab. A one thing, in my opinion will make this place very good or excellent. You get will ripped off most of the time when you buy anything in Istambul and it will be helpful if the staff can give more advice and help on prices. 1) I took a taxi from Ataturk airport to the hotel and it cost me 30 lira (on the meter). When I needed to go back to the airport, I asked the hotel receptionist how much it would cost for their private transfer service for the journey. The guy I spoke to said 50 lira. Later in the day I asked another receptionist later the same question, he said it would cost 55 lira, \"but he would do it for 50\" making it sound like he was \"doing me a favour\" He said that a normal Taxi fair would cost 40 lira and I knew it only costs about 30 lira. I didn't make a fuss as I could be asked to haggle or dispute the cost. The taxi guy came in the morning, didn't put his meter on and he quoted 40 lira, at this point I just felt sad and just paid this amount. I know we are tourists, but not made of money!! 2) Water is a necessity!!! And they don't provide water for free - Fair enough they want to charge for water but charging 3 lira for a small bottle (250ml) from the mini bar I thought was extortionate when you can buy a small bottle of water outside for as little as half a lira and a big bottle (2) litre for 1 lira? A little bit of extra help will go a long way and if these things are taken into consideration, I think this hotel will be a little gem.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Zalobeidi", "ReviewID": "UR111554456", "Content": "This isa small quaint nicely located hotel.

When you come to the hotel, they will to sell you a map of central Istanbul (5TL) without asking you if you need it, they gave it to us and after marking on the map where we are staying they demanded 5 Turkish Lira for it. It is not the cost I am complaining about (they rip off tourists everywhere), but the very principal of selling me what I do not need (I had my maps with me), but ended up having to pay for additional map. We arrived in the evening and they gave us a room on a ground floor. It was very tiny double room with very tiny wardrobe (not big enough for 2 people), nowhere to put suitcase (and we had only one suitcase!), so we put it on top of the wardrobe. But it was not the worst point. The worst was that the noise was terrible, we felt like we were put to sleep on the street (windows were facing very busy street with people walking up and down and lots of factories working 24/7 (with night shifts), so noise was really (and I mean REALLY) loud (and we did request a quiet room in our reservation form). The bathroom was small, but the shower was a joke, you can hardly squeeze in it (and I am UK size 8!!!). You definitely cannot move in it, it is like standing coffin. I went to request another room. Receptionist said that it can be arranged, but next day after 12pm, as the hotel was fully booked. I was not happy, as I could not unpack, because we were changing room next day. However, we did not have a choice. Next day we got a room on top floor with a small balcony (only top floor rooms have balconies in this hotel, 1 person can use it at the time, no space for chair or small table on it, you can just stand there alone and look around). Room was hardly better (apart from balcony), but the noise was just the same! So we understood that we will be stuck in this noise for all 8 days of our holiday. Windows were facing factory windows, so it was noisy at all times. Roof terrace was nothing special, again facing factory windows and a small bit of Marmara Sea). And the \"icing of the cake\" was that there is a mosque few meters away from hotel, and mosque's minarets with its speakers face the hotel! Therefore, every few hours there was a 10-minutes long call for prayer - extremely loud. I could not believe it. The 1st call for prayer is at 5am every day. You are guaranteed to be woken up, as the noise is as loud as in rock concert! So forget about any sleep there... We literally could not sleep well a single night. Maybe it is like this everywhere in Istanbul hotels, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, as mosques are everywhere and cover all area of Istanbul. The location of the hotel was quite good - 20 min walk (or 5 min by Tram) to Sultanahmet old town centre with Blue Mosque in it and 25 min walk to Aya Sofia, 7 min walk to Tram stop \"Beyazit\" (Tram costs 1,75TL for a plastic coin-like jeton for single tram journey, you can buy them from the machine just by the tram stop). You can only pay with Turkish Liras in Istanbul (unlike seaside Turkish resorts, where you can use other currencies, too). Hotel is also 8-10 min walk to Grand Bazaar (and the tram takes you to Blue Mosque, Eminonu Port (where you will take your Ferry for Bosforus river cruise (25TL each) or visit Spice Bazaar (nice for buying spices, tea, nuts and dried crandberries), Spice Bazaar starts near Eminonu as well); please note that the walk to the tram stop and Grand Bazaar is up very steep hill, which was not a big problem for me, but if you are not very sporty and fit, it might be quite a challenge). Fish restaurants (quite a rip-off) are downhill from hotel (3 min walk), and they are open until late, we had dinner after 10pm. So location is convenient for touring Istanbul despite all the noise from factories, which are everywhere (including in adjacent houses from hotel). These factories produce shoes and leather goods and accessories for bags, belts, shoes, etc... By the way, I wanted to buy shoes in the area, as below factories there are normally shoe shops (all over the place near hotel), but they sell shoes only in big boxes, in packs of many (for other traders), so in most of shops you cannot buy a single pair of shoes, despite of nice display of single pairs of shoes. They are displayed for traders, not individual buyers. In order to get to hotel from Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6k\u00c3\u00a7en Airport, we took Havas bus to Taksim Square (costs 14 TL each), and from there we took a cab to hotel (he was going in circles and could not find the hotel, and the payment is counted by the meter), 25TL for taxi from Taksim Square to hotel. So have some Turkish Lira with you, you cannot pay with other currency even for your bus or taxi from airport. Breakfast (buffet-style) in a hotel was very poor (served from 7am to 10:30am every morning), stale bread and processed cheap meat, fresh oranges (which was probably the best part of it), tea/coffee, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes, nothing much, every day the same stuff. The waiter was rather rude, harassing us for tips every single morning (it is self service there, so I don't know why he thought he deserved a tip). Istanbul itself is a fantastic city and I enjoyed it every minute, there is a lot to see and do. istiklal Caddesi (near Taxim Square) is the best street for going out at night - shops, clubs, restaurants, busy and lively street, especially at weekend. We found a few live music venues on a Friday night - very good! I loved this magical city despite of a little disappointment from hotel disadvantages.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cvery good service, clean, but noisy\u201d", "Author": "daniel_osorio", "ReviewID": "UR103354588", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel at the end of march 2011.

There is a tram station 400 mts away (Beyazit) but you have to consider that the hotel is in a very steep hill, so it can be exhausting for some people. The neighbourhood is working class but it felt safe and we did not have any problem. The only real problem of the hotel is that rooms are very noisy as walls are very thin, almost like sharing the same room with other people.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be influenced by the good comments on TripAdvisor because honestly there is lots more to discover when you get there. Bad things about May Hotel This hotel is just like a Caravan looks good but it is totally pants. Firstly its very small like a caravan. The walls are so thin you can hear people when they fart next door, when they have sex, even when turning on the bed. You can even hear when the lift doors open. On each floor there are 6 rooms. We were first given a room on the 2nd floor but after a horrific night listening neighbours having drink and sex I complained to the manager about the level of noise from next door he then changed our room to the top floor right at the back. Even then I could hear people next door and the lift opening even when the door is shut. The rooms are so small that even Travelodge in UK has spacious and cleaner rooms. All rooms are shower only and its so small that its only suitable for kids. I am not kidding this is true. The sink is so small you can only wash your hand and not your face. If you are not too bothered about Noise, room size, comfort then you have hit the jack-pot welcome to May caravan hostel. Good Thing: The bed does not squeak, shower is powerful but so close to the ceiling that a single splash will touch the electrical circuit resulting in death. Room service is good. Breakfast is satisfactory. Although the location is good you have to climb high to get to the tram line. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like climbing Mount Everest. If you like going up hill then this is the best for you. The surrounding area is full of leather shoes whole sellers and there are many small gambling/bars where you will find lots of old men waiting to perv on you if you are a lady. This hotel is in the heart of perv land. Honestly if you have \u00c2\u00a310 extra I would recommend you to look for a better hotel because the review people have given for this hotel in TripAdvisor is very misleading.

However, it cannot be so. Immediately after arrival from the hospital the proprietor continued the same story he'd told on the phone: that his transport service said we didn't show up, and that the crash had nothing to do with him since we went off with an unknown driver. But my wife and I simply found the only driver holding our name on a sign in the airport, and he already knew where we were going, and didn't ask for money or anything. I suspect that we got traded between drivers, but whatever happened the guy had our name, he had a decent car, and the accident was the other car's fault. . . But here we were arriving at the hotel, being told by the manager I thought was going to take care of us for the next two days that this was my fault for not showing up for the transfer (?!?). And it didn't stop there. . . I admit, I arrived at the hotel after my hospital stay with a broken sternum expecting to be given special treatment. Maybe an upgraded room? Or not to have to pay mini-bar rates for water as I recovered? But instead it became apparent that our gracious host had smelled desperation, and thus, an opportunity for profit. \"Oh, can't check out during the day ahead of your evening flight because you're too weak from your accident to tour all day? Too bad, you'll have to pay for an extra night for those six hours.\" \"Oh, can't take the metro to the airport because you can't lift your bags? Our shuttle will be 50 TYL, payable cash only.\" \"Oh, you lost your lonely planet guide book in the accident? Here take this map, only 5 TYL.\" I actually had to convince the guy that the ride they gave us from the hospital to the hotel should count as the original free airport transfer, since the first one crashed! But my arguing was limited there due to my shock and weakened state. On checkout day I gave a goodwill offer to pay half of the full room rate for our late checkout which he declined because it was too late to re-rent the room. I had naively assumed that both ourselves and the hotel were partner victims in a crash caused by another crazy driver, but it turned out the hotel was quite happy for us to be the only victims. I have no legal complaint against the hotel, and in the end we paid what we had to in order to protect our health and recovery. But realize that when you stay here I've illustrated what kind of hospitality you receive.
