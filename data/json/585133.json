{"Reviews": [{"Content": "OK, but careful with dinner! The bad news about this place is we both got food poisoning from the chicken meal they cooked us. As I write this review 1 week after we stayed there I am still recovering! It wrecked the rest of our holiday, whenever I think about that place I shiver.However this resort is good value for money. We paid US$55 a night and got our own villa with air con, a nice king size bed, bath and the room was nice, tidy and clean. They have a pool and the staff are super friendly and helpful.We were the only people at the resort and it got a little boring. The resort is miles away from anywhere (about 25 mins from Ubud), but is close to the local villages and culture which is interesting. We were lucky enough to have the manager drive us in and out which was great.", "Date": "Sep 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR868334350", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "656y58n"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297695-d585133-r5773280-Puri_Saron_Hotel-Gianyar_Bali.html", "HotelID": "585133", "Price": "$61"}}
