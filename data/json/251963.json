This hotel was just cheap though. The room did smell clean, and housekeeping was doing their job, but the walls had small holes in them and the furniture had signs of wear that made you have to think about all the previous guest who were staying there and just made me feel uncomfortable. Bathroom The bathroom towels were thin and hard, the ceiling over the shower was crumbling, and the shower head was covered in calcium build up. Bed Overall comfortable but with thin pillows and old pink blanket that needed to be replaced. The headboard was covered in nicks and chips.

As I walked into the lobby I noticed that water was dripping from the ceiling (if it wasn't late and i was desperate, I should have taken it as a sign to leave right then!). The person on duty shrugged it off like it was nothing. My room itself smelled of mold and like it hadn't been cleaned in a long, long time. The comforter was raggedy and the wool blanket was pilled and smelled terrible. The carpet in the room seemed like it had not been vacuumed in a while, and I didn't dare go barefoot. Finally, the bathroom was gross. The shower had hair in the drain, the towels looked like they had been around for to many years, and the soap bar wrapper had already been opened. All in all, this place should be checked by the state to ensure that it meets the basic standards.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad!\u201d", "Author": "donna s", "ReviewID": "UR121410396", "Content": "Due to unfortunate circumstances, I found myself needing an extended place to live until mine was available.

It would have been nice to have had two bedside lamps (one of ours plugged in right behind the mattress and wouldn't stay on), four pillows (there were three for two people - who gets the extra one?), decent bath towels (not plush, just ordinary would have been nice), and a hair dryer that would stay on (circuit protector kept blowing).

The plug-ins are not secured in metal \"boxes\" because when you plugged something in, the wall moved. The towel racks were hanging off the walls. The towels were threadbare.

No fruit, no bagels...only waffles (batter was spoiled this morning) and biscuits and gravy. The biscuits could have been used as hockey pucks. I couldn't even tear them. My room was supposed to be non-smoking, but obviously the maid smoked in my room while cleaning, because both days when I came back to the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke and there was even ashes in the ashtray, and on the top of my laptop. Otherwise, it was cheap and close to both places I had to be at while in Indy. The bed was very comfortable, however, u needed 2 pillows to make it thick enough.

They were able to answer our many questions and gave helpful suggestions. Their shuttle service made it easy for our late-waking friend to join us at the convention. The breakfast was great, we ate in the morning and didn't feel hungry until late afternoon, not bad for 3 large-sized guys! The rooms and beds were clean and comfortable. I only have 2 complaints: 1) The bathroom. Like others have said, the bathrooms need to be re-vamped. The low-flow toilet was...unexpected. 2) The ice machines. When we stayed there, the upstairs machine was broken and the one downstairs was usually empty. Luckily, there's a Wal Mart & Target nearby, so no loss to us. Overall, a nice, quiet place to stay.

Finally, while we never used the pool, it looked pretty nice as well. I only have one major and one minor complaint about this hotel. The minor complaint is that their TV's have very few channels beyond local channels, I think I counted like 12 channels. The major complaint was that the water pressure in the shower was an absolute joke, it wasn't very good at all. Other than those things though everything else was fine.
