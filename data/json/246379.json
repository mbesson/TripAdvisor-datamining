This hotel fit the bill. The Colosseum, Roman and Imperial Forums are in the immediate vicinity. We also visited the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and Piazza Navona by foot one afternoon. We often got back in the late afternoon and headed out for dinner later in the evening (8:30/9:00pm), so it was also handy that there were seveal cafes and restaurants nearby - one is only10m down the street, well priced and has fantastic food. So, position-wise we could not have asked for better. The room was smaller than we had expected, but it wasn't really tiny or cramped. There was a Queen bed (I think), a very comfortable lounge and a smaller chair. The wardrobe space was large enough, but we didn't unpack anyway. The bathroom is spacious enough and the water pressure is great. We never had any trouble getting hot water (very important). A bonus for our room was that we had our own balcony/verandah - it was on two large levels and had a nice little table and chairs set. We also checked out the rooftop terrace. It was good for catching a breeze in the heat of the day. Our only gripe with our room was the air conditioning - as you had to keep your key in the slot for the power to work, we always had to come back to a hot room and, though we would turn it down to its coldest setting and up to its highest fan level, it struggled to do more than take the edge off the heat. We could see it was quite an old unit, so maybe an upgrade to newer equipment would fix this one problem. Breakfast was included in the room price and we enjoyed it. It isn't the full on buffet you may find in the more expensive hotels, but there is a decent selection of food - bacon, sausages, eggs, cereal, pastries, cheese and cold meats - and they will make you a cup of whatever coffee you prefer (not just poured out of a pot, but brewed on a proper barista machine), or provide juice if you prefer. One morning we were being picked up for a tour before breakfast started, and they were kind enough to let us grab a few pastries to take with us. Reception was manned 24 hours by several different people, all of whom were pleasant and helpful. We had no problems with any of the staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay somewhere central to the ancient sites. If you don't expect the Hilton, you should be satisfied with the level of accomodation provided, and enjoy the friendliness rather than false deference from the staff.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "GlobeTrottingChris", "ReviewID": "UR118328364", "Content": "My family and I stayed here recently for two nights.

At 130 Euros per night it was competitive for Rome, and we had a very large room for a Rome hotel (302 - I believe it was actually a quad room). The breakfast was excellent and large enough to keep you going until lunchtime. The nearby restaurants (Iaro and La Piazzeta) looked scruffy and touristy, but served great food. The latter stocks a really top quality Pinot Grigio at 20 Euros. The rooms have aircon and hotel has a roof terrace (though it was raining the night we went up there). If I return to Rome the Hotel Fori Imperiali Cavalieri would certainly be my first choice. One tip on the local restaurants by the way: those recommended on Trip Advisor were all booked up when we visited. You need to reserve in advance if you want to visit the top places.

It is down a little alley, but it is one block from the Colosseum and the Metro. You cannot get around Rome as a tourist without the Metro - the busses are rubbish and the taxis are ripoff merchants - the taxi from the train to the hotel (2 km) tried to charge us \u20ac15... We had several problems with the room but the main problem (the shower) was repaired during our stay (good news for you!) and we got a discount for this. The rooms are small, but here you are paying for location. 24 hr front desk, and a \u20ac50 limo to the airport was good too - when you see driving in Rome you will want that Mercedes with 57 airbags when you're going 140 kph on the motorway! Continental breakfast was OK if limited - I would say this hotel is 3 star as advertised. Getting around Rome - you can walk to the Colosseum, Forum etc from the hotel easily. Get a Metro for all other sites. Don't bother waiting and working busses out - the Metro is much better and \u20ac1 per trip. Just keep an eye on your wallet/handbag. In Rome tourist books say get away from the main sites if you want to avoid touristy restaurants - I recommend against this as you won't find any unless you know Rome. Suck it up and pay \u20ac40-60 for a good meal with a bottle of wine - very tasty! Try to find places that have Italians and don't go anywhere that is empty, has a guy trying to drag you in out front, or only has tourists - anywhere that locals are dining is fantastic! Just around the corner from the hotel on the main street there are 4-5 restaurants that do street dining under cover and they were lovely - probably tourist lovely but that was fine with us. Opposite the Spanish steps there is a narrow lane (1 block away from where all the designer stores are) and 150m down there we found another great place.

After no help from the hotel, we located places to park around/near the hotel. The next day we checked on the cars only to find that 2 of them had been towed. The hotel made a phone call in which they were not willing to translate! Lucky for us we had someone in our group that spoke fluent Italian. $600 US dollars later we got them back. Check in was very confusing and the gentleman did not seem to care for Americans. He seemed to be very demeaning at every opportunity throughout our stay. We learned not to ask him for anything! Our room was a triple that was very cramped but a pretty room. The view from the room was the gorgeous! The last day that we were there the group began talking and realized that all of us had noticed mysterious bites on us....bed bugs!!! Yes, bed bugs! We spoke with the front desk with no attempt to assist us or concern. One member of the group also had a necklace stolen from the room while we were gone to dinner. We were gone about 2 hours at the fabulous restaurant around the corner! Nonetheless, we abruptly checked out and contacted our hotel in Sorrento and took off. We didn't care if we had to pay for the last night or not. I do not recommend this hotel at all unless changes have been made. It took 3 weeks and medication to treat the bites.

The hotel itself was not as smart as the photos online suggest either. My first impressions of our 4th floor room was that it was small and adequate but by no means luxurious. Maybe I was influenced by the fact that we had just come from a 5* cruise ship, but even so........... There is a tiny sitting area in front of a bar, just by reception, and a small seated area for the breakfast buffet. The \"roof garden\" was a great disappointment. It was a covered paved seated area, very small with views of the residential backstreet area around. I had hoped to sit up there to read or have a pre dinner drink, and to enjoy the sun, but having seen it I gave that idea a miss. The cold buffet was adequate, one type of sliced cheese, slices of one type of ham, croissants, cakes, cereal, two juices, nice coffee, sometimes fresh fruit. On our first night, the air conditioning failed so we opened the windows in an attempt to cool down. I was unable to cope with the heat and street noise and eventually went to reception at midnight to plead for another room. I was given one, and the air con was sort of fixed over the next few days . We weren't offered any compensation for the inconvenience. The location in Rome for the tourist is by far the advantage of this hotel.

It was a little hard to find at first, as we walked from the train station, but we did eventually find the place. FYI, it is off of Via Cavour, a major street in this part of town; use it as a point of reference. This was our first experience with any hotel in Italy, as we had just flown into Rome from the states. Hotel rooms are a bit small, but no different from our experiences in either London or Greece. The showers, but this was the same everywhere in Italy unless there was a bathtub, are small. I am a small girl and I wouldn't plan on shaving my legs in this shower. All the bathrooms in Italy have a string on the wall next to or in the shower. We didn't know what this was for until we asked our B&B owner in Venice. She said that Italian law requires all hotels, etc. to have them to pull in case one falls down and needs assistance. So do not pull the string unless you need hotel assistance! The breakfast was typical; Croissants, yogurt, meats, cheeses and cereal. There was a barista that made excellent cappuccinos. We each had two. We were in Italy for a wedding, but came early to make the trip a vacation. The wedding was at the end of the trip, therefore we were required to carry my husband's suit, dress shoes, shirts, etc. and well as my dresses and shoes not only the wedding but the rehearsal dinner around for the entire portion of our trip. The morning after our stay when packing up our stuff, I failed to look under the bed and did not pack my husbands very expensive dress shoes. We did not realize this until 2 days later after a lovely stay in Tuscany. I was packing our bags to leave for Florence and realized we were missing the shoes. My husband was able to contact the hotel and they held the shoes they found in our room. We were heading back through Rome on our way to the Almalfi Coast a few days later from Venice. Needless to say, he ran from the train station in the intense heat to the hotel and they gave him his shoes. I was very impressed the shoes were still there. It was really nice to be in a foreign country and experience a trustworthy establishment. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. Check out the rooftop lounging area. Bring up your own drinks and enjoy the outdoors. You can flip to a channel on your TV and view the rooftop. My husband was able to watch me hang out up there from our room.

When we arrived at 11 am on Sunday one of our rooms, (we traveled with another couple) was ready and we were able to change and shower. The location is incredible. A few minute walk down a back alley to the Colosseum and Fori Imperiali as well to the Piazza Venezia (climb the stairs to the top of this monument as the view is one of the best in Rome). The map supplied at the hotel site looks bigger than the area really is so everything in that map is within a 10 minute walk. There is a Taxi stand at the Piazza Venezia and at 8 am the Vatican is a 6 Euro trip for four. The metro station is also handy for those that want the expericance of crushed travel. There are excellent Trattorias (inexpensive family run restaurants) on Via Corvour, just through a connecting alley as well as a small fruit store where bottled water, wine and pop is cheap. Most Trattorias and Restaurants except all credit cards but tipping is in cash. The Shamrock pub is around the corner and well worth popping your head in to say hello, the owner speaks English and can save you some time and money over a pint of Harp. (We made it our local and had a pint or two everyday so say the Canadians sent you) The reason I go on to explain the location in detail is to point out the fact that the location is excellent and made the trip. The hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful with arranging airport transportation as well as a couple of tours. The rooms are exactly what you see in the pictures. The rooms are quiet with an excellent (and noiseless) air conditioner and clean. We had the Superior double pictures and the other couple had a large terrace room. The only issue we had was with the size of the shower. The bathroom was large but showers in most of the hotels are unusually small. It wasn\u2019t a big issue, however if you are 300 lbs you may want to consider making that known before you go. There is a very private roof top terrace which we took advantage of so reserving a terrace room really doesn\u2019t seem to be of advantage. The breakfast is like most served in Rome, boiled eggs, cakes, cereals, juice, hams, toast, cappuccino, espresso or tea. We had a chance to look at other hotels both 2 star and 3 star in the area and really found this the best of the bunch. The fact it is in one of the alleyways (see picture) makes for a nice quiet sleep while still affording you the advantage of an excellent location. I would recommend this hotel and gladly stay again.
