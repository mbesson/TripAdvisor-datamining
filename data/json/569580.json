The staff was really helpful, Wifi worked really well in my room, the metro station Gran Via is really close to the building. The continental breakfast costed 4,50E, but I did not try it ... The room had enough space for everything, with dresser, locker and a huge bed. If you want a place to hang out and meet people, maybe it is not the best choice. I did not see any other guest during my stay. I only do not give 5 stars because they do not have any late check out policy, reason why I had to pay an extra day, because my flight back home only departed in the middle of the night.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, friendly, safe and central.\u201d", "Author": "stevex1966", "ReviewID": "UR123273434", "Content": "This is the 3rd time I've stayed here and I would not consider choosing anywhere else in Madrid. The location is unbeatable - Madrid is very compact and this spot on Gran Via is beautiful and right in the middle of everything, being only seconds from Gran Via Metro. The rooms are light, airy, brightly decorated and maintained to a very good standard. The bathrooms are a little small and in some rooms arranged a tad bizzarely, but you have to remember it is an old and very tastefully restored building adapted to house a number of hotels. Cleanliness is taken very seriously by the cheerful maids, and everyone from the owner to the night-porter is friendly, helpful and makes you feel welcome. The hotel is not 'basic' as described in other reviews and everything you could possibly want is right on your doorstep 24/7. If you prefer warm, friendly, cosy and being made to feel like you're staying with friends to the cold, clinical hotel chains - this place is for you. I will definately be back!", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cVery basic with great location\u201d", "Author": "Matarsak Z", "ReviewID": "UR106576664", "Content": "This is a very basic hotel in a great location for a reasonable price. The room provides the bare minimum, but with a comfortable bed and is very clean compared to most hotels of the same price level in Spain. The hotel is family run and not advertised well, so it seems to be rarely booked by US patrons - but its friendly staff and great location should make it a good choice for anyone interested in a good deal. The area is very busy, but very central, with public transport just two blocks away. Unfortunately some seedy areas are also close by, and petty crime is rampant throughout this particular neighborhood. However, there is security in the multilevel building, which houses many other small hotels and bed and breakfasts (Felipe V is on an upper floor it shares with a few other hotels). You should select this hotel if you want a simple clean room to sleep in and not much else. If you seek any amenities, it may prove too basic for you. We were OK with it, although I might opt for a bit more in a future stay in Madrid. Its perfect for students and those on a limited budget.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wise_rita", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Budget Accommodations\u201d", "Author": "wise_rita", "ReviewID": "UR47665303", "Content": "I participated in the Pueblo Ingles program and spent 2 nights, 1 week apart, in 2 different rooms. The hotel is literally 2 minutes from the easy-to-use Metro, Gran Via station. The beds were not fancy, instead of 2 pillows there was 1 body pillow, which I didn't care for. They beds weren't particularly comfortable, either. The bathrooms could have been cleaner as there were some mysterious black hairs in the corners on the floor. The bathroom in room 26 was comically small. The door could not open all the way because of the toilet.

The hotel is located on the Gran Via, one of the major arteries of Madrid. It is within walking distance to great sites, theaters, and restaurants. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. It is economical, so don't expect a super hotel. It is clean and the rooms have a very good size. The bathrooms are also very clean and spacious. If you're just looking for a place to rest at night, or even to take a nap during the day (because it is so easy to get to), then this place is perfect! It is very easy to get to. Just get off the Gran Via metro stop and if you come out on the same side as the McDonald's walk to the right. When you get to No. 15, go up to the 4th floor.

Its very basic, much like other hostals, but clean and run quite efficiently. The location on the Gran Via in Madrid is very central, right next to the metro and other transportation. There are many many food options in each direction and you are walking distance to most of what is interesting in Madrid. The hostal is in a building with about ten other hostals, and there is a night security desk for the whole building. Half the time this guy is asleep in the back, however, so if you arrive back late at night and need to get in, you may have buzz the bell for quite a time. This was not a rare event and kept happening to us. Two elevators allow easy transport to the higher floors in the building. The hostal also has a twenty four hour desk run by one of the two sisters, neice or other family member owning the property. Everything is kept very clean and the staff are helpful and friendly. The only problem I had was a sewer smell on and off in the bathrooms especially after running any sort of water in drains (and we stayed in two different rooms). This would go away, and return sporadically. The beds are actually more firm than the typical hostal bed, which was a nice change. Be aware this Gran Via area is also the hot pickpocketing capital of Europe (yes, EUROPE, not Spain) ...so you do have to be very very careful. The rate of pickpocketing in Madrid now far exceeds most any European city and gangs of two to four operate with the most unique set of tricks right around this area. Many will have U.S. university sweaters or T-shirts, or are dressed up as tourists carrying the typical tourist accessories. Others are constantly on cell phones, communicating with comrades on the other side of the streeet so you can be targeted from two directions as you cross. A disturbing and always packed red light district of underage prostitutes is just one street over, at the Calle de la Montera but this is not really a reflection on the hotel or this location, since every hotel in this central area is exposed to this same region and the police are parked in numbers on either side of the very same street, watching the action and not doing much about it. The volume of blatant underage prostitution in Madrid is actually quite astonishing until you get used to it. For the most part you need to worry far more about the pickpockets and con artists on Gran Via than you do about the prostitutes and considering the huge number of hostals and hotels here, the Felipe V is just as good as the next, if not far better.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cright in town\u201d", "Author": "k00ch", "ReviewID": "UR11701728", "Content": "Hostal Felipe V Very central and close to city center.
