He seemed to get lost several times, even after stopping in another Hilton nearby and asking for directions. That started our visit off on the wrong foot, but our equilibrium was restored when we entered our room, a nice large room, and saw the plate of snacks and goodies and a complimentary bottle of red Turkish wine. And then, the view from our window was incredible - the Bosphorus in front of us, and the Ayasofia and Blue Mosque off in the distance. The only negative was that our room was supposed to be non-smoking, but it smelled like it had been smoked in very recently and not cleaned after that. When reviewing Hilton properties, I have to remind myself that my experiences there are exceptional, since my girlfriend is a Diamond member and we therefore get the best rooms and everything complimentary, etc. Nevertheless, it was great to get free Wi-fi, and the large breakfast in the Executive room every morning with English newspapers was nice, and we also ate the free dinner there a couple of nights as well. The hotel has a restaurant upstairs with a gorgeous view, but we decided to spend our food dollars on the meals we ate in the historic section when we were out sightseeing. When we go back to Istanbul, we will probably look for a hotel closer to the action, i.e., in the Sultanahmet district.

We did enjoy it but if I was to to choose again I would pick hotel on the other side of the Bosphorous. The area itself is quite nice for long walks along the water and is appearanlty meant to be place to live for middle class people. There are planety of bars, cafes and restaurants to choose from if you don't wnat to travel across the water every time you want ot eat out.

To my great surprise, when we confronted the hotel management they insisted that this was due to excess alcohol, while she doesnt drink in the first place. we escalated to the hilton management and the hilton worldwide in vain, they still insist on covering up for the rotten food with this lie, the only mistake we did is we didnt record this somewhere offcially in istanbul before we left the city.

We had arranged a an expensive airport pick-up through the hotel as we did not want to have to take the bus or a taxi and navigate our way through the city after a tiring, long-haul flight. Unfortunately we waited 25-30mins in the arrivals area looking for the hotel staff member who was nowhere to be seen, eventually we gave up and had to arrange our own transport to the hotel after all. Once we got into our room, there was the usual welcome note from the Hilton hotel but this time it wasn't addressed to us, but another guest. The room had obviously been prepared for another single guest, the one which the welcome note had been addressed to, and visible through the single pair of slippers and single bathrobe in the bathroom. On the second night during our stay, the power flicked off a couple of times for a few minutes and the next morning our toilet broke and wouldn't stop leaking water. Poor sound insulation has woken us up early each morning at 5am as we could hear the hair dryer going from the room across from us and heavy footsteps from the room above us. Service was average, the reception staff were friendly enough but not particularly helpful. We were wanting to go on a Bosphorus Cruise and enquired regarding where to catch the ferry. The staff member kept pushing for us to use a tour service which they were affiliated with, but otherwise did not provide much in the way of information (we had used this tour service through the hotel the previous day for a full day tour and did not find it particularly good).

As with most international chains, you'll find English channels on TV like BBC & CNN. Staff are friendly and helpful and language is not a problem at all. The executive lounge is excellent and the staff in this lounge are extremely friendly and helpful. Two new PCs with internet access are available in the lounge, complete with a colour laser printer.

This decision was based solely on the exceptional service I received at the Hilton Park. I arrived at 8:30 am after three long, grueling flights from Asia. I wondered what kind of reception I would receive. The front desk staff worked hard to find a room for me, and even fed me coffee and cookies while they worked. I was upstairs and in the shower within ten minutes and in bed sound asleep within twenty. The service attitude at this hotel must be contagious; the staff in the restaurant, the housekeeping department, the laundry, the bellmen, all--without exception-- seemed to go out of their way to be helpful. I decided it would be hard for another hotel to measure up to this level of service so I decided just to stay put at the Hilton Park. The hotel is located on a hill above a city park, overlooking the Bosphorus. If you stay on floors five and above, you can get a wonderful view. You can walk down the hill to the tramway and the subway station in about 15 minutes. It takes about 20 minutes to walk up the hill. If you walk up the street from the hotel, you find yourself in a nice neighborhood with several very good restaurants. The restaurants in the hotel are good, but the menus are limited. The breakfast buffet is extensive and well prepared. They will also make eggs to order and a la carte breakfasts. The rooms are of typical size with comfortable beds, a decent desk and desk chair, and a spacious bath. Toiletries are Crabtree and Evelyn. The towels are plush and plentiful. Housekeeping was in my room cleaning within minutes of my departure each day, so I always came back to a clean fresh room. The hotel's Internet service is fast, efficient and expensive. The only negative for this hotel relates to the a/c. They had turned it off for the season (it was December, after all) but I found the room got very warm at night and I needed to open the windows. This allowed a significant amount of street noise to enter the room. If you are staying in the winter time and need to have cool, fresh air at night, you may wish to consider foregoing the Bosphorus view and stay on the other side of the hall in exchange for a more peaceful night's sleep-- or bring earplugs.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "hecman111", "ReviewID": "UR14646170", "Content": "The Hilton ParkSA Istanbul is a nice hotel with a kind and helpful staff.

I booked this hotel at HILTON.COM they had specials and it was a good deal.", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPleasant weekend break in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "BA-traveler", "ReviewID": "UR12945283", "Content": "Getting of Ataturk airport was stressful; it took us almost two hours, due to very long lines for visa and immigration. Outside we took the Hava\u00c5\u0178 connection, a luxury bus with enough space for luggage. There are only a very few stops to the city and the fare is 9 TRY (new Turkish Lira) p.p. or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 5.50/$ 8.00. From the end stop at Taksim Square it is only a short taxi ride to the Hilton Park Hotel. The hotel is situated on a hill. From outside it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look very special, inside it has a modern lobby and there are 7 floors, on the top floor is the restaurant. Front desk staff was very friendly and we were given a nice room on the 5th floor with view on the Bosphorus. The room is not very spacious, but it had a comfortable chair with small table, a working desk with chair, a small LCD flat screen TV and a large closet, all very modern furniture. The bathroom was marble and had a bath with shower. Nice detail, there was a fresh flower next to the sink. It is mentioned in former reviews that the bed is terrible and we can only agree. It is hard, not comfortable at all and the thin mattress was too big for the frame underneath. So on one side it felt that you are rolling out of the bed. In the room are also a minibar and a water cooker with cups and Nescafe and tea bags. For our welcome as Diamond members we were given a plate with fresh fruit and a bottle of red wine. Everything was already in our room when we arrived. In the evening we had dinner in the restaurant. There is plenty of staff, but the food is very pricey. For instance, my husband had a small steak for 32 TRY (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac 19/$ 28) and this is served on a further empty plate!!! We had to buy everything as potatoes and vegetables extra, and then you get extremely tiny portions of each. At the end we took coffee and we are used that in restaurants this is served with sweets. Nothing at all, and a coffee or cappuccino costs 8 or 9 TRY a cup, be aware that is for the latter \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 5.50 of $ 8.00 each. We have been all over the world, but have never paid that much for just coffee. There is a business center with two computers and printers. You have to pay for every half hour you use it, but when I checked my mail for just 10 minutes or so, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge me, what was very friendly. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very good. Many things to choose from and eggs could be ordered in every way. Again, there was much staff in the restaurant. The view from the top floor was fantastic in the early morning hours. On our second day we took a taxi to the city center, not very expensive (rather odd, we paid the same amount as for a cup of coffee in the hotel!) After our return we found a plate with delicious bonbons in our room. From the hotel it is a 10-15 minute walk to a very busy area with shops and restaurants (out of the hotel go the right and keep walking in that direction, after a while the road will split and you have to make a slight curve to the right). Istanbul is a nice city, but far to busy with tourists when we were there (last weekend in 2007). After all we had a pleasant stay in the hotel. The staff is very forthcoming, the room is okay besides the bed and the breakfast was great.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel with a Great View\u201d", "Author": "randallbellaire", "ReviewID": "UR8712386", "Content": "Stayed here 4 days in August 2007.
