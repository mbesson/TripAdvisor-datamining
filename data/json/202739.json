If these are your requirements, Continental is okay. We requested a twin room. We were shown to a double room. We immediately asked if there was no twin available, so the porter contacted the reception desk and we were taken to a room meeting our reservation request. Although I am quite sure we would have had kind a a view from this room, I also noticed thick layers of dust on the armatures and the over all impression was very depressing. So we walked the sauna like corridors to arrive to the room we did use during our stay. This room had a more up to date appearance (headboard jugendstil like). The place reminded me of the claustrophobic experience at the Sistine Chapel: no where to flee in case of fire... And indeed the room did not show a map the nearest emergency exits. There were metal bars in front of the windows. The 'view' was the hotel room of other guests 3-4 meters accross an inner court, which itself was filled up with trash, ac units and scaffolds. What else: We did not dare to use the elevator, which reminded us of elevators we have seen in communist countries. The toilets in the lounge are a big insult to paying customers. The hotel bar which the hotel claims to have is in fact out side of the hotel, so a seasonal terrace. The hotel boasts to have an extensive wine list, but in reality they have just a few wines to sell, which are also not very impressive. The lounge is like a waiting area in a train station, but with plush chairs. The breakfast area is lovely, when you are lucky enough to sit in the area near the Canal, but the bigger part of the room is dark, cellar like and uninviting. As high tide was expected one morning break fast was to be served in the room. We are not sure why, because we did not see any water getting into the hotel/break fast area. One night around 5AM an alarm went off. We had no idea if this was a fire alarm or what ever, smelled nothing, saw no one, so were left wondering what was going on. The ac in our room was disconnected (no- not broken!) and the room was very hot. Leaving our windows open was met every single day by the cleaning staff closing it again. Also the shower was disconnected (but there was a bath). During weekdays 8AM builders start working and shouting. We had to check out at noon and left our luggage in the storage. When we came to get it, obviously we were no longer guests of the hotel and we were no longer greeted in a pleasant way by the receptionist. So, if in fact you would like to have a drink at the hotel bar, go to next door hotel Principe. You can also use the toilets there! Right across the street there is a little pizza restaurant, not adding costs for a 'coperto' nor adding 12% service. Consider it as a cafeteria and you will not be disappointed. A bit more in the direction of the train station you will find Brek restaurant. A chain, all over Italy. They have good, honest and affordable food, but this is not the place to be for a special occasion. As mentioned: We were looking for a decent and affordable place close to the train station.

Need to mention that all of the waiters are fantastic and gave a really professional and personal service. If your planning on eating here be prepared to spend approx. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 but as prices go in Venice its worth it. No problems accessing the Wi-Fi as mentioned in previous 'reviews'. Hot water is accessed by pulling string and waiting a minute, no problem. Daily maid service left room tidy even gave us extra pillows without asking. The whole of the hotel is rather spotless and the air-con is welcome after a day in the sun. Remember to close both the shutter and double glazed window, evenings get really noisy. Worst part of the whole stay was the noise from inconsiderate residents made when coming to bed. Overall it's location is near to northern Venice and it's convenient enough to start a days walk into the other areas. Prepare for some walking but that's Venice. Tip 1 Cross over the Ponte de le Guglie pass the supermarket with the ice cream cone bin on the left there is a wine homebrew shop \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 bottles of Pinot Noir etc. The owner has spare empties with lids. Shop is called Vinaria Nave De Oro, address is Cannaregio 1370 Tip 2 Morning Tour of 8 churches. Begin with S.Geremia, S.Leonardo, S.Marcuola, S.M.Madalena, S.Fosca, S.Marziale, C.Della Misericodia, C.Po de la Madonna de L'Orto. Unfortunately some are not always open best to try from 9:30. Most are free but a donation is acceptable. Women need to cover their shoulders. Tip 3 Really look at what your paying for, espresso range from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.50.

A fantastic area full of your usual touristy shops, but also fabulous restaurants and even a fantastic supermarket. So handy for those..\"I just want to have a picnic in my room\" kinda days. My favourite. It's a beautiful area and everywhere in Venice is so accessible from this area. All the Ferrovia(Ferry's) are outside your door to transport you and your senses to another, and any world you wish to explore! The rooms were very clean and a good size bathroom. I even had a bath.

The Location is simply fantastic if you're arriving by Train. We did, and hence were delighted to find that the Hotel was a bare 5 minutes' walk from the Railway Station. When you come out of the Station, turn left and keep walking for approximately 200 metres till you find the Hotel on the right. You don't even need to cross a Bridge (which is quite a rarity in Venice !) Some of the fancier hotels are located around the San Marco area, but personally I found that area a little too touristy and noisy. Moreover, you'd need to take a Vaporetto from the Station (Route 1 or 2) to reach San Marco. Our room was small, but that's what you get in the rest of Europe, so no reason for complaints there. We stayed in Room 373, and it had a large window with a partial view of the Grand Canal. The Hotel is right on the Grand Canal, and even has a landing station for private water taxis (which are terribly expensive). The Room wasn't exactly Lavish, but was clean. The furniture didn't look brand new, but were in good working condition. A Safe was also provided in the Wardrobe. The Bathroom was sparking clean though. Enough clean Towels provided. However, be careful while taking a shower as there is a good possibility of the shower curtain letting out a good amount of the water which would ultimately flood the whole Bathroom. MAJOR CONCERN : The AC didn't work on the first day and night, and we could barely sleep. Venice is Hot in the Summers, and even for people like us coming from a Tropical Climate (India) it can get really uncomfortable at times. No Fan was provided. I wrote a mail to my Travel Agent, and it worked. The second day onwards the AC started running, although it never really managed to keep the Room cool. But we could sleep. That's important. BREAKFAST : The best part about the breakfast was that we could sit right by the Canal, in the morning sun and pleasant breeze and eat. Breakfast is not a lavish spread but I guess you'll find something or the other to suit your taste buds. Canned Juice. Fresh breads. Do not expect anything as grand as the spreads offered by the hotels in S E Asia. Everywhere in Europe, this is generally what you'd get, so I would say I was happy with the Breakfast. There are a string of restaurants and eateries all around the hotel, which is a convenient thing if you choose to have your major meals outside. The Hotel has a restaurant but I never ate there as I found cheaper options outside. There's a Restaurant close by called \"Brek\". You'll find quick munchies out side and a more detailed spread inside. Recommended. The Front Desk is quiet and efficient but a bit too Professional for my liking. They did answer every query that I put forward (Directions etc) and every information provided was correct. However, there is an air of arrogance which I couldn't really appreciate. A smile here and there and a bit of warmth makes it easier for the Guest. The Hotel has free WiFi and upon asking they give you an username & password. The WiFi was more or less good although occasionally there was an issue with the speed. But you can't expect everything to be perfect, hence I would give a thumbs up to the connection. Room was cleaned every day and it was cleaned very well indeed. Towels were replaced daily. The Hotel has a courtyard of sorts on one side which opens to the Canal, and its a lovely place to sit. It has benches and trees to provide you the shade that you so desperately need in Venice. You can also choose to sit right by the Canal and watch the Venetian life go by. This is a major PLUS. We spent a lot of time here, especially when it got very hot in the Room. A lot of people come here to Eat or Drink or just relax. Overall, I would say this would be a good choice if your primary concern is the Location. However, if you're expecting good facilities AND good air conditioning, you need to look elsewhere and also pay more.

We got a table right on the canal and given fantastic silver service with great food and half the price we paid at the restaurant in St Marco's. The headwaiter recommended the angler fish, to which we accepted. It was one of the simplest dish, yet the most delicious fish dishes I have ever had. The risotto and scalopine was also fantastic. My wife and daughter were treated like royalty even though we dressed like tourists. The only bad thing I can say (apart from being a far away from St Marco's) is that the wifi service was poor in my room; I had to open my door to get half decent reception.

Just steps from the Ghetto district which is less busy and has some fabulous inexpensive restaurants. In North america a location near the bus and train station usually means bad area...not in Europe! This location was perfect for getting around in Venice.

The hotel will send a water taxi to the cruise ship terminal for the low price of 110Euros! Make sure you drop your large luggage at the baggage hold place next to the Pullman Bar - you DEFINATELY do not want to be dragging luggage all over Venice!

When I stayed in Venice the first time, a month earlier, it was a different hotel, and I thought I would change to something a little cheaper, like this one. I was checked in by the friendly staff on front desk, (the English was great), and was then taken to my wonderfully clean, modern, fully equipped room, which had the most stunning view of the Grand Canal that I have ever seen. It was just a single room of course, with all private ammenities, but I was impressed from the moment I stepped in. Service, cleanliness, layout of the hotel, and that view! Amazing. I have found that in Venice even one tiny obstructed view of any water, and the hotel's bump up the price well into the hundreds, but this hotel really is something special.

The majority of the reviewers on other sites rated their experience at this hotel as poor. No site as of yet has a rating that adequately describes my experience. The reviewers from NY, NY and their photos match mine. I will try to be brief. We were on a budget, but I would rather sleep near the Grand Canal or any canal outside than repeat a stay at this rat trap. My sister and I had a room that was on the first floor with a view of the alley and wall - consequently it was always dark. The hallways were dark, the bathroom was dark, and yes, shower curtains and wash cloths are nonexistent in Europe apparently. The other guests that spoke English had similar rooms. Although you do not spend a great deal of time in the hotel, when you do it would be nice if it were pleasant. I would consider the conditions of a good majority of the rooms deplorable. Since this was the last leg of our trip in Italy and the room was prepaid, we simply endured the place. One night it was very cold - about 38 F - we called the desk and asked that the a/c be turned on for heat. We couldn't get the thermostat to respond. We were told that the a/c didn't work, but they would be glad to bring extra blankets. We decided that the modern conveniences that you see in the room are really Hollywood props - they give you a false sense of being in the 21st century; however, you are really reliving the renaissance period. I found only one concierge who made our stay barely tolerable, the others were downright rude. My advice for travelers on a budget - find and carefully review B&B's or pensiones. There a quite a few in this section of Venice (Cannareggio).
