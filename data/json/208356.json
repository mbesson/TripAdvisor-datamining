Staff is unorganized and clueless. We stayed for 2 nights room 301, this is a room with a partial ocean view. The carpet is something you would find in an automobile very rough and dark navy so you will not see the dirt and grime....however I did. I had to do a full bed bug inspection which I did not find any evidence but still took every precaution so we would not bring anything home. I did discover a mis-match of box springs and mattresses...very odd....makes me wonder how they get them...are they seconds?? or used?? Sub standard linens and the pillows were the strangest things I have ever seen. Basically they were ball shaped and hard...like they washed them and dried them??? I requested replacement pillows which they did bring quickly but they were the same strange ball shaped mess....I asked if this was normal and the person didn't seem to care or understand. The sliding screen was off track and just leaning against the sliding door. In order to open the sliding door and see our very partial ocean view we had to deal with putting it back on the track...it never stayed. We had to get key replacements 3 times. I was told the door may have issues. I normally would just suck it up and go get new keys but this was not so easy. Getting an elevator is next to impossible....and I was ok with using the stairs but it was very hot and smelly in the stairwell and seemed like a dangerous place to be. Come to find out there are several other elevators in the building but all reserved for employees??? Once you got to the front desk there was usually a line with 15-30 people deep. Keep in mind....I just lugged my wet family up the stairs with all the beach crap and my key doesn't work. I have to trudge back down leaving wet kids and annoyed husband in the hot dark hallway while I try desperately to get a new key. The room included 2 beach chairs which was nice but they were not clear about who you get the chairs from....there is a stand on the beach and I assumed that was the place but was quickly told \"no not us\"....sorry we get this all the time....you have to get them back up at the hotel. When I finally found the chair person who was tucked away next to the trash?? I told her the front desk should be more clear and I told her I had went to the beach stand...she just said well you can get chairs at the beach stand but you have to pay for them.....no kidding....I want my free chairs Einstein! Caution....if you don't bring the chairs back to the person by 5:30 you pay $50.00 for 2 chairs. LOL....they were worth maybe $10.00....cheap,old and abused just like the hotel. We didn't eat at this hotel.....there is great food in OC...not sure why you would waste your time eating here. OK back to the room....the towels are so tiny....laughable.....same with the towels at the pool....they are so tiny and rough it is pathetic. You can't take them from the gated area so bring your own beach towels. The pool is old and cloudy.....nasty! Ice skating rink is a good plus if your kids are into that but we didn't have time to visit it...plus I wonder how many $$$ they would want to skate on their tiny rink. So here's my thought....OC is full of nasty places and you will get ripped off and feel gross. The beach is nice and my kids had a great time. I knew I wasn't going to get the Ritz Carlton experience but if this hotel and some of the other places in OC would just have a tiny bit of pride and clean their places up and have decent bedding, towels and furniture it would be a much more pleasant experience....and I would actually show up more often. You can't keep sucking the money and not put any back in your investment. I will mention that the ocean front rooms I did get a quick peek in on the 3rd floor did seem to have slightly and I mean very slightly better furniture...keep in mind you will pay way more for that ever so slight upgrade.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cProperty 1605 by Shoreline Properties Reality\u201d", "Author": "Menugirl12", "ReviewID": "UR139390760", "Content": "DO NOT STAY AT THIS CONDO UNIT OR USE THIS REALITY.

Some days were good, while the last few days, the coffee service wasn't replenished (no coffee, no sugar/creamer, and no mugs). Microwave was left filthy. * Outdoor pool is TINY, the same size as a residential pool. Indoor pool was dirty, bordered by puddles.

First, it was right on the beach which was great. Second, there were tons of amenities in the hotel, an ice skating rink, saunas, indoor/outdoor pools, a restaurant, a cafe, a gym and more. You definitely wouldn't be bored on a rainy day in this hotel. Also, a few employees were very courteous. The rooms were pretty mediocre however. The bathrooms were a bit dingy and outdated. Also I didn't have a shower the entire first day because I was under the impression that there was no hot water (due to a large number of guests). On the second day I finally called maintenance and they explained since it was old plumbing that I needed to let the water run for a few minutes and wait for the hot to come through. I was glad they informed me of this but it was still a nuisance nonetheless. The sink was completely clogged, which is normal at the beach (because people clean the sand out in the sink). There was no cream for the coffee. We got service one day which was nice to return to but for whatever reason they didn't come the second day when we were out. The AC worked nicely, as well as the TV. The beds were also pretty comfortable. Also, it was very quiet at night (we were on the very end of the hotel) but it was still very nice considering the hotel was very very busy. The balcony was also nice to hang out on. The only real complaint I had about this hotel was the terrible service we got in the small outdoor cafe. A person in our party ordered a pizza but they never brought it or refilled their drinks. Everyone had finished their lunch and we had to ask for the pizza which they then brought with no apology or explanation. I've seen better value for this price.

The room is large with a nice size fridge, coffee maker and microwave. The extra sink outside the bathroom was very handy. The furniture could use a little updating but that is not a deal breaker for me. The beds were comfortable, carpet newer and our view from bayside 5th floor was quite lovely.

The moon bounce and lawn games added to my kids beach fun. Loved that 2 free beach chairs were included each day. ( yes, they are the reclining type.)

You get what you pay for!\u201d", "Author": "teresa f", "ReviewID": "UR137202125", "Content": "I want to start off by saying that some of these reviews are unfair to the Carousel. Our family just returned from an Ocean Front accommodation August 5-9, 2012 and we had NO complaints with the Room or Cleanliness. All the Ocean front view rooms are newly refurbished. Bathroom was very small, but functional. Granite counters in the bathroom and Kitchen. Kitchen, had a mini fridge, microwave, sink and coffee maker. Flat screen TV, Cable and WiFi. It was Very clean, and housekeeping was there everyday. Whatever we asked for we received quickly from housekeeping staff. So saying that, I think when a guest leaves a review they should be specific as to what category they paid for!!! There are rooms that overlook the ice skating rink (that's not my thing, Yuk, tacky !), there are rooms that face the street. These rooms are NOT renovated and therefore are older and are less expensive. There are rooms that are Condominiums and are privately owned! I'm not 100% sure about this, but I think the owner is responsible for the conditions of their Condo! So if it's a Condo you stayed at and not a \"hotel' room, reviewers should specify that! I feel strongly that $298 a night for this Ocean view \"hotel\" room was great considering that there are \"dumps\" in OC that charge the same. And then there are hotels charging 500 per night for a similar room. I have stayed at the 500 a night hotel and it did have some Pros, but not enough to justify the price difference. Also, many reviewers complain about the long wait to check-in and the slow elevators. First, the section of the building for the Ocean Front hotel rooms, floors 1-4 had NO issues with the Elevators. The slow elevators are on the other side for the Higher floors and the Condos. Check-in had a small line.. it went quickly! What I liked: The View in Ocean View Room The Grounds, beautiful. Loved the palm trees and gardens. The Pirate Ship. My 3 year old played in it for hours at a time while I sat on a lounge chair overlooking the grass and palm trees. Beach Access. At first I missed staying on the Boardwalk, but then I didn't miss the \"shlep\" down to the beach from the Boardwalk hotel... This was great, my older children safely went up and down from the beach to the pool. The Bar/Grill: Live entertainment daily weather permitting. Great Music playing all day. Fun atmosphere. Burgers and fries were great too! Staff: Friendly and helpful! Indoor Pool/Sauna/Spa: Hubby and my teenage girls liked this! What I didn't like: The Pool: Small, crowded, water not clear. Pool area is too small. Not enough seating, but you can get a lounge chair below near gardens (loved that spot!) and they need to put a slide or something fun for the kids in the pool area. Maybe make better use out of the area with the baby pool! Towels: Bring your own beach towels (but they do give you two comp beach chairs!). You can only get towels in pool area and you CAN NOT bring pool towels out, not even down to the lounge chairs by the pirate ship which makes absolutely NO sense! Ice Skating Rink: now this is a personal thing. Some people would love having an ice skating rink in the lobby of their Hotel... this just wasn't for me! but to each his own!~ The Atrium/Lobby. The railings outside the rooms are way too low, scary with little ones!", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bel Air, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "Erica W", "ReviewID": "UR136987635", "Content": "This hotel was extremely kid friendly, HOWEVER, the rooms were SO outdated, old and not worth the rate.

With that being said, that is probably the only positive thing we had at first. Check in was horrible. I have never waited in line for over 30 mins to check into a hote and yes I do travel. Once you are checked in, you need to wait for a cart to load your items onto. Then you hae the nightmare of the elevators. You wait in line yet again b/c there are only 4 elevators for this hote. There are 2 that go up to the 11th floor and 2 that go from the 11th floor to the top. Condo 1509 was not as pictured when we had to choose the one we rented. We paid over 2000.00 for the week and had these problems. We had a family of 4 adults and 3 children. We had alotted one set of towels for the week. When I called to ask if it was possible to had more towels I was told to do laundry. The sweeper did not work. With all the sand, we needed to clean the floor and when I called about this, I was told to see if we had a broom and dust pan. The condo itself was dirty. We found garbage behind the sofa, under the sofa and other areas. There was NO toaster. The fridge door did not close b/c the drawers were from another fridge and didn't fit and therefore the door was opened some of the time. The water heater went. Yep we had NO hot water for a period of time. In our bedroom we had a bed that was ok. The sheets and matress pad laid ontop of the matress with no tucking to keep them into place. I felt very uncomfortable laying on a bare matress during the night. Not to mention all the hair on the so called matress pad. YUCK Also, the airconditioner was located outside the door, Therefore you could not let the door opened b/c the hot air would come directly into the room. (there was a screen door on the main door) So if you do not want to do house cleaning on your stay, don't stay in condo 1509. The staff was great. Especially Jerry at the pool bar. Very friendly and actually all the staff took time to talk with us. It does not pay to check in early b/c you still need to stand in line for the key. So that isn't an option. There are many activities for kids which is good. I would suggest looking elsewhere. We spoke with people that have stayed many times and they indicated it depends on the owner. So how do you know if your going to get a nice room or a room like 1509? Not sure we would stay again. Probably not. I might add that I am not a fussy person, especially on vacation. Maybe one of the hotel rooms would be a better choice. DOn't know. Good luck if you have picked this condo. All in all we loved the city.

She informed us it would be about ten minutes until she was finished so we decided to explore the hotel until she was done. Upon entering the room we noticed that there was still food on the carpeting and on the floor between the two beds there was an artificial fingernail laying there. We called the front desk and then we had to leave the room until they came to sweep again(they never swept the first time). Later that evening my daughter got sand in one of the beds and for the next two nights the sand was still there. On the third day after discovering this I called the front desk and was told that they don't change the sheets for a three night stay!

I have fond memories of spending time with family and friends at the beach,tennis court, indoor pool, arcade and ice rink. Over time, my parents sold their condo, the hotel changed hands a couple of times and I have been bringing my own family to the newly renovated hotel. I am excited about all the new amenities that make the hotel even more family friendly such as an outdoor pool, kiddie camp, family movies, nightly ice skating shows, and live entertainment. Hotel guests also get a free family photo and the use of free beach chairs. For these reasons and more, the Carousel has always been our first choice for a family vacation.

We sprung for an oceanfront room overlooking the patio after learning about recent renovations to this section of the hotel. The Bamboo Lounge and palm trees outside our window made us feel like we were back in Hawaii where we spent our honeymoon many years ago. The hotel room was very clean, spacious, and beautifully furnished. The kitchennete and bathrooms had beautiful granite countertops and I was pleasantly surprised to find a large, flat screen TV with HD in our room. We were especially excited to have a king size bed with plenty of pillows and a very comfortable mattress. During our stay, the hotel was very busy with families on vacation but we found it easy to enjoy our time as a couple. The best part of the vacation was feeling relaxed, entertained and comfortable at the hotel. Practically everything we needed for a memorable vacation was either onsite or within walking distance from the hotel.

All employees were pleasant and made us feel welcome. We did not have to cross any busy highway to get to the beach, very lovely and picturesque landscaping, a restaurant on the premises and snack bar. Although we did not have any young children with us, this is definitely a family hotel with many fun kid activities. Other positive aspects of this hotel is that staff members were on hand to help with luggage, hold doors open and answer questions. The complimentary beach chairs were a plus, the fitness center was better equipped than we anticipated and the free family portrait night was an extra bonus. There was also an ice rink, which we did not use, but enjoyed watching others skate and admired the free nightly ice shows. Another advantage to this hotel is that there is plenty of parking including a garage next door which we used, keeping our car out of the hot sun. The only issue we had was that our ceiling was dripping water that we discovered on our first morning. The front desk had maintenance check it out and they believed it was due to a faulty air-conditioning unit above our room, and it was determined that we could move into a different room as soon as one became available that morning. The situation was handled in a professional matter and we were promptly accommodated. Other posts have complained about the elevator wait after check in; we suggest just being patient as this situation is to be expected when there are many guests all with the same idea\u2026to unload and get to the beach.

I also want to add about the big SUV's...the parking garage can be tight backing out but security can put you in an oversized lot on the side. Anyway, back to the condo...the condo was very very dated. The furniture is old, the appliances are really old, the ceilings are popcorn stile, the bathroom ceilings are drop ceilings, the fixtures are dated back to 80's easily, the vacuum cleaner looked like the 60's, the whole place needed painted, and overall the whole place needed major updating. I can't say that I expected much more though since it is a 3 star hotel. Just don't expect anything modern in this resort. I did notice that they were replacing all the tube TV's with 37 inch flat screens. They had three dumpsters full of tube TV's. Now my opinion on the actual resort: it is dated but good for families. The pools are small but work for families, the food was pretty good and a good selection, the ice skating rink is cute, the ship for the kids to play on was a must for the kids at the end of the day, and the gym was used by myself everyday and was more then sufficient for my needs. They also have a game room and bounce house for the kids. The beach is also just steps away which is really nice and the views of it from the condo were amazing. Just beware that everywhere you go...you must have your room key. I gets annoying after awhile actually!!! The staff were all very nice. I have stayed at 4 and 5 star resorts and I think this could have been the nicest staff I have experienced. I think if you can look past the very outdated rooms your family will have an enjoyable trip. Just don't expect anything more then a 3 star room (at best). I think the Carousel has a great staff and now if they just invest in upgrading the place....they will have something overall even better. ****Extras: The elevator situation can get very frustrating because there are only two for the high floors and it can take a pretty long time to fit into one when you have four kids!!!!!

The bathroom shower has no pressure so forget getting clean and rinsing off the ocean and pool. If you have long or thick hair shampooing will take forever. The cable was out for almost an entire day. A note had been left under the doors explaining that the the hotel was switching to full hd and they would need to have access to our room for 5 minutes between the hours of 11:00am and 2:00pm. The cable never came on after that time. When I was in the lobby I heard the clerk telling someone on the phone that she hadn't had cable at home either. I saw someone who looked as though they could be a manager give a grin and chuckle as though he thought that was an acceptable story. The cable wasn't out in the area. It was because they were changing the system in the hotel. It seems that doing so in the winter would have been a far more intelligent choice. After I complained and explained to the clerk that I wasn't buying her story about the cable being out all over Ocean City because the other area hotels weren't having the problem and it was their change over that caused it, they finally sent someone to my room at 11:30pm waking my chidren to repair it. the repair took about 20 seconds and must have been what they had to do to each tv. There were not enough towels in the bathroom and no tub mat so if you have children be especially careful! Even though I requested that the room be cleaned, the carpets weren't vacuumed, the soap wasn't replaced and the bathroom floor mat was not replaced and the sink had not been cleaned. The room had a general dirty feeling...no closet door on the closet and the freezer portion of the refrigerator need to be defrosted so nothing could be stored there. Sand was still in the tub from the previous guest. You can no longer take drinks to the pool area either...so if you are looking to relax by the pool with a cocktail forget that. The indoor pool and hot tub were very murky looking. The second evening there we noticed that no one ever checked the chemicals in either the pool or hottub. So my vacation at the Carousel consisted of: One day with no television - which we like to watch at the end of the day since the outdoor pool closes so early and we have children. Cleaning the bathroom myself Going to the front desk at 6:30am to retrieve soap and towels. Swimming in a murky indoor pool that had a leaky pipe and a towel wrapped around it. Sleeping very little because the bed made a very loud squeaky sound every time you moved on it. We were obviously not valued customers and will not stay there again... Several of the staff act as though you are bothering them. The hotel in general is poorly maintained and seems badly in need of repairs and a thorough cleaning.

I am sorry to say we had a horrible experience. At a first glance, the hotel seemed to have all we needed to have a great family vacation; pools, outside bar, hot tub, work out center, ice rink, restaurant etc. The hotel was definately a flashback to the 80's and lacked modernization or techinical upgrades. That was all fine with us, for the price we paid for an ocean front view. However, the second night we were there, I decided to stay up later than my chldren and husband and was on the computer. The lights in the room were off for about an hour when I noticed movement in the kitchen area. When I turned the lights on, the room was loaded with 3 different types of bugs, which were by that time crawling all over coming out of the carpentry. I am not a bug expert, but i can tell you this: these were not carpenter ants, they look like roaches and bed bugs. I woke my husband up to check out the scene. We turned on the lights. I went downstairs to talk to management about the problem and insisted on a refund. This was 1:45 in the morning. My husband and I packed up and as the lights were back on, the bugs seemed to go back into hiding. Like I said previously we have 2 small children and we had to pack them up and drive to a relatives house 3 hours away. Not to mention, when we arrived, we had to spend the next day fumigating the car, and luggage, and bringing all clothes to laundrymat. I called the hotel to get full refund for the inconvenience, the shortened vacation, etc..and PLEASE READ THIS...they denied us a full refund, and actually denied the fact there were any bugs in the room and went on to say the room had been occupied already...HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!

It would be nice if they had more elevators because they were always packed and we had to carry everything we had to beach down the stairs. My main complaint which is a wry big one was a mysterious \"authorization fee\" that I was charged after check in of $200 which overdrafted my account. I spoke with a supervisor who was very rude about it and was of no help at all. She told me she has no idea why it was charged and pretty much told me she can't do anything about it and I'll have to talk to someone in accounting the next morning, which left me with no money Saturday and instead of going out for a good time i had to sit in my room all night because I was broke. The next day durring check out I spoke with the manager and she called my bank for me and got it fixed for me. She told me we were checked into the system wrong by the front desk and that should not have happen. Her name was robin and she single handedly saved any chance of us returning to the hotel on our next beach trip. So overall a nice stay and I recommend it but when you check in make sure you ask them about that fee and to make sure you are checked in correctly so that you don't lose $200 for the weekend.

My daughter and I heard this place was a \"dump\" and I saw around 2008 on TripAdvisor it wasn't so good but I saw they were doing work,new owners, etc and for price figured what the heck. The balcony was sizable and had 2 chairs and a table and was where I spent most of my time just enjoying the atosphere and reading all hours of the day and night. I would go again. The view was beautiful, staff was very courtious, our screen door came off the track and my daughter thought the refrigerator wasn't getting cold and maintenance was responded in minutes! I love how the luggage carts are under security so you don't have kids or people hoard them and abuse them, you need to leave your ID when you take a cart and get it back when returned. (Although I did hear some snob say he \"NEVER\" had been to a hotel where they didn't have someone to help - middle aged overweight guy probably covering for not being able to push the cart, where I'm married to a guy who refuses, even in high end New York City hotels to allow someone to take our things without his presence). The ice rink was nice since my daughter plays ice hockey and was able to enjoy skating and the free show. Movie night was a nice feature too, but the screen was hard to see without the lights off in that part of the atrium. Usually it's outside. The outdoor bars and atmosphere were nice. The free family picture was cute and a nice perk. The guys taking the pictures were great at their job! Their theme nights and breakfasts seemed expensive in comparison to all of the food places nearby. We didn't bother once we saw the price and someone else said they waited 1/2 hour for breakfast and ended up walking out, so that area needs improvement. A Theme night must be affordable. I wouldn't hesitate to go back, the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 were a few little things. They upgraded to nice clean furniture but it's very cheap. When we arrived a dresser drawer was off it's tracks and housekeeping should have notified maintenance before check in, my husband uses a CPAP snoring machine and after 6 days the bottom of the drawer where he placed it was falling out, literally, but I get they are trying to quickly spruce it up and hopefully will use better quality as they replace? and you could tell light switches, thermostats and doorknobs were never cleaned by the dirt and fingerprints left on them, the bathroom lightswitch and thermostat were nasty with fingerprints. Just take your own clorox wipes like I do since we travel so much. PS - even in pouring rain, kids were great with a really good cable selection. Trust me, we've traveled enough to know that some places have the basic 13 and if they have satellite instead of cable it can take the whole trip to get a tech to fix it and you are stuck.

We chose the Carousel based on a recommendation of a friend as being a family friendly hotel which it was. My granddaughters loved the pool, moon bounce, and pirate ship. We didn't ice skate because the girls are still young and would have needed an adult. With my daughter being 7 months pregnant and me not knowing how to skate we chose not to attempt it but the girls loved watching the other skaters. I knew going in this was an older hotel but was pleasantly surprised at the condition and cleanliness. I consider myself a picky person and I could not find one thing not clean. The service we recieved was exceptional. Anything we asked for we had within the hour. The motor on our hair dryer blew and we had one within 15 minutes of asking. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. We arrived on Thursday when they were just preparing to open everything for the season yet even though the outdoor grill was not completely set up the staff offered to make us anything we wanted to eat. My only disappointment was being told prior the pool would be opened on Friday and it didn't open until Saturday but we had fun anyway so it wasn't a huge deal. My daughter was kept awake most of Friday night by rowdy, young people partying but when I opened the door I determined the noise was coming from a small motel next door. I have come to expect noise in the middle of the night in Ocean City no matter where I stayed. I have attached a couple of photos of the view from our room. I have stayed at many ocean front rooms at various beaches and I have to say the view from this room was probably the most stunning I have ever had. Not only did we have a view of the ocean, the pool was directly below us too. I could watch all the action or in the mornings I could enjoy the peacefulness of the roaring ocean. I would get up a couple of hours earlier than my family every morning while there and sit on the balcony with my laptop. This was my alone time to prepare for a full day with 3 toddlers and watching the sunrise was the most relaxing part of my trip. Considering I hadn't planned on any relaxation this was a bonus. lol The landscaping at the Carousel was absolutely beautiful. From what I understand they bring palm trees in every summer and they are gorgeous. It gave the feel of being in a tropical island. I can only comment on dinners at Seasons Restaurant because we did not eat breakfast or lunch there. I thought it was good food, not exceptional but good. The ice cream parlor was a great place to go in the evenings for a snack and they also have a small gift shop that has a good assortment of sand and beach toys and souvenirs. We didn't use the indoor pool or spa. I know this sounds somewhat like an advertisement for the hotel but please believe me when I say if I have a bad experience I am not afraid to share it. I had such a nice time and so much of it was because of not having a stressful hotel stay that I wanted to share it.

I've tried a couple other properties, but they never quite measured up. I know that sounds very positive, but basically, in my experience, there are a lot of really crappy hotels in OC, and the Carousel just happens to be less crappy. The good: If you have kids, the ice rink, indoor pool and arcade are a godsend. If it's raining, you aren't trapped in a hotel at the beach, which anyone with kids knows is a recipe for infanticide. Ice skating in July is weird, but the kids love it, and have taken advantage of it. It's a unique experience, and a lot of fun. Deserts: The restaurant isn't great, but they have killer deserts. We often go out to other restaurants, then order room service deserts. OC restaurants tend to have lousy deserts. The carousel has a killer creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake and a berry thing that is amazing. Coffee and ice cream: There's a Starbucks in the middle of the hotel; they have good ice cream and make decent, inexpensive shakes. Rooms: The rooms are nicer, sizable, and generally clean. I won't talk about the beer can I found under my bed last time. We always get an ocean front room; they have ocean front rooms with a queen and a hot tub, and an ocean front with 2 queens, no hot tub. Both are very nice. Be warned, make sure you don't get a first floor ocean front room, they abut the pool, so you have to deal with screaming kids and have zero privacy. Indoor pool and hot tub: The indoor pool is quite nice, but as with most indoor pools, it has a lot of hard surfaces, and a lot of screaming kids. One blessing, they actually enforce the \"no one under 18 rule in the hot tub\", so you get a little bit of a break. Food: The indoor restaurant is ok, maybe 3 stars, but the outdoor food is quite tasty and reasonable. The bad: I said I wouldn't mention the beer can under the bed. Kids: The Carousel is \"family friendly: I go with my family, so perfect, right? Not really. I went in April of 2012 and I would have sweared they rent to 12 year olds because I saw no parenting going on. I have a rule with my kids, enjoy yourself, but don't prevent other people from enjoying themselves. I wish other people employed the same rule. Granted, this isn't the fault of the hotel, but a little more \"hey, control your a-hole kids or you'll get kicked out\" would be quite welcome. Employees: As with many OC businesses, the Carousel hires a lot of foreign people. I have no problem with their employees, but I've spoken with a lot of them, and I get the impression that they aren't treated all that great. That bothers me. So overall, it's relatively clean, overrun with unsupervised kids, has nice facilities, and I'll probably stay there again. But only because the only place I suspect is better is the Hilton, and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend $400 a night to ensure that Parris Hilton doesn't have to get a job. I'm going for a week this summer, and have decided to go the condo route.

EXTREMELY SATISFIED!\u201d", "Author": "Jan D", "ReviewID": "UR128130916", "Content": "My family and I have enjoyed a relaxing vacation to Ocean City, MD for the past several years. Having two small children to bring along lat summer, we decided to stay at the Carousel for several reasons. I came across this video on YouTube: ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkKd1bZ-5t0 ) and knew right away this was the place for us. As the video clearly indicates, the Carousel Staff is enthusiastic, friendly, and well-spoken. Further, Each employee was more than willing to answer any questions my family had about the hotel or about the Ocean City area in general. Traveling with two children, my family desired to stay somewhere that offered activities for both adults and kids. Like most hotels in Ocean City, the Carousel has both an indoor and outdoor pool. What sets the Carousel apart from the other resorts in Ocean City, however, were the other activities the Carousel offers. There is an ice rink located in the Atrium of the Carousel. Ice skating was a fun family activity that gave us a break from the beach when we needed it and gave us something to do when the weather was bad (not to mention the boys that worked in there were really cute and funny). We were amazed at the pristine condition of ice, especially when considering how hot it was outside (it didn't melt at all!!!!). We were also fortunate to see Ice Skating Show put on by professional skaters. My kids absolutely loved getting autographs from the skaters and dancing along to the fun and bubbly songs during the show. Also, for those parents looking to get away and relax for an evening, the resort offers a program called Camp Carousel which is essentially a day camp for children. The Camp provides kids with a variety of activities (including games, arts and crafts, movies, and a front row seat to the ice skating show) as well as dinner and ice cream. The kids loved and it and my husband and I got away for some much needed alone time ;). The Carousel also hosted a Movie on the Beach which was something great for the family to do at nighttime. I would definitely suggest getting an Ocean Front Room. Our Room was on the 9th floor and was immaculate. It seemed as though the Carousel was located closer to the beach than the surrounding condos and it was great waking up every day to the beach. There were no problems with the room whatsoever and the Housekeeping staff was always very friendly and outgoing. Lastly, the Carousel's location cannot be beaten. We had never stayed so far north before and did not realize what we were missing. There are tons of great restaurants, mini golf courses, and shops in the general vicinity which are easily walkable. Northside Park is only a few blocks away. There is a lot of stuff to do there and there is a fireworks show on the 4th of July which we were able to watch from the Carousel!! While we did have to drive or take the bus to get to downtown Ocean City, it was well worth the brief trip. Traveling with a family, it was nice to not always be surrounded by those rowdy college kids! Hard to believe that was me 25 years ago!! :) We liked that it was close to the surrounding Delaware beaches too, where some of our friends were staying. I would highly recommend everyone stay at the Carousel. Having stayed at other condos such as the Hilton, the Clarion, and the Princess Royale (dont even get me started!), I can truly say that they do not compare to the Carousel.

The carpets were dirty - as in I did not want to take my shoes off or let kids walk barefoot. The furniture is worn, there walls and trim are in disrepair, closet doors were missing, and the walls incredibly thin. Supposedly they do not allow loud parties, but both nights we were there, parties went on until 2:30 am waking our child on several occasions.

We were somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews but found none of the issues that other reviewers had remarked upon. Our check in was simple and easy and were given the keys to room 448. My parents had room 446. Our room was clean and functional. WiFi worked without issue on our laptops,Kindle Fire and Ipod Touch, TV was a flat screen type. Our room had a kitchen sink, a coffee maker, a microwave and a minifridge. An ironing board and iron were included in a decent sized closet in the room. The sofa could be converted into a bed if necessary and a hair dryer was available in the bathroom. We had a nice view of the beach and also a nice view of the atrium. A quick inspection of the beds and linens showed no bed bug issues. Management brought up extra pillows at our request. The linens smelled clean with a faint trace of chlorine, which to me is a reassuring scent. The beds and linens, while not the highest quality, were comfortable. Furniture exhibited minor wear and tear, typical for Ocean City as this town sees heavy tourism every year. Ocean City is slowly becoming a year round destination too. Over the New Year's weekend, the Boardwalk was surprisingly busy! New Year's was pretty fun and definitely intended for families. The Carousel's reputation as a swinging playground ended decades ago. The property was crawling with kids! If you don't like the sounds of children enjoying themselves,don't stay here. You'll be disappointed. We were treated to a great figure skating show. Young teens and kids from the area were the stars and they really gave it their all. One of the banquet rooms was set up with Legos, board games, and sketchpads. My own children (14 and 17) enjoyed ice skating and swimming in the pool. The rink and pool were well maintained. The ice cream parlor next to the rink serves baked goods, hot pretzels, soft drinks,and of course ice creams. We ordered 4 milkshakes made right on the spot and thought they were reasonably priced. The New Year's buffet was quite tasty, which was surprising as our breakfast served to us the morning before was somewhat disappointing. The buffet, while not cheap, consisted of blue crab claws, steamed shrimp, crab soup, king crab, grilled vegetables, potatoes, jerk chicken and prime rib. All you could eat of course. The staff made sure that the serving table was never empty. I recommend making reservations beforehand as there was a line waiting for available tables. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.

The mattress was comfortable and seemed to be new. My main complaint was due to the time of year. We had a \"Bayside\" room which really means a room that looks over the main highway. Because it was motorcycle week with the advent of thousands of Harleys, the thin-walled room was inundated with thunderous roars of motocycles all night long. We had to sign a \"no party\" agreement when we signed in stating that we would not have a party in the room. Since my wife and I are in our 60s, we actually felt somewhat flattered by the contract, much the same as being carded in a bar. However, the contract did not apparently extend to the parking lot since we were awakened at 3AM with a group of loud party-makers with motorcycles in the parking lot just outside our window. We ate at the Season's restaurant which was pretty good and reasonably priced.

Got a receipt and the down payment was charged to my credit card. 3 weeks before the conference I get a call from the hotel with my voicemail stating my credit card had disputed the charge and they promptly, without speaking to me directly, cancelled my reservation. I quickly had to call them back and rebook to a downsized room for the same price. When I spoke to the manager, he was very rude and made it seem as though \"I\" did something wrong.

When I did check in, the lady I spoke to was very rude and seemed as though she didn't want to deal with me at all.

An employee told us it was due to the humidity, but it really wasn't that humid out. Another guest told us that they were told the machine to keep it cold was not working and they could not get the company to come and fix it. The elevator moved very, very slowly, and was quite congested at times. They had a nice area with ice cream and popcorn, with several kiddie rides. They demand your driver's license if you want to use a luggage cart, and the woman was NOT nice about it at all!

Upon our initial check in we did notice the hotel was having a shipment of new mattresses but never put two and two together. After waiting for about 30 minutes for an elevator as they only have two elevators servicing the entire facility, we managed to make it to our condo (rm 1911) which we were less than impressed with. The condo accomodated about 8 people, my cousin unfortunately selected the room which contained the bed bugs. On her second night stay, she really started complaining of how she felt something biting her and how she was unable to get a good night sleep. Upon examination of the room particularly the mattress, we found it to be infested with bed bugs. We immediately called management to report the incident. The manager on call (Pat) was the middleman and first attempted to get us accomodations at a Townhouse to include linen service, not far from the Carousel but directly on the beach, however; they weren't going to assume any additional costs over what we had already paid for the week. The townhouse costs an additional $2000.00, we had already paid an estimated $4,500.00 for the rental of the Condo. The general manager refused to speak with us as he was communicating directly through his manager. We had to threatened to sue for the stress incurred as a result of this short stay. We had small children with highly sensitive allergies and who are asthmatic. With all of our clothes and luggage, we didn't want to take the chance of bring their bedbug problem back to our place of residence. We did advise that we would tell the rest of our family, as we were there for a family reunion and wanted them to be aware as well to prevent them taking critters home. We told them to expect a bill for the cleaning service that we would have to incurr as a result of their bedbug problem. We did ask why didn't their housekeeping didn't do a more thorough job with cleaning. In brief, they refunded us our entire deposit, gave us three different rooms for free. We weren't ecstatic with the new accomodation but it was a start in the right direction, after a 4 hour trip with small children. In conclusion, the customer service sucked, we didn't have to appreciate having to threaten the managment to see results. We encased all of our luggage in plastic and upon our initial return home, we stopped at our family laundromat to rewash and dry everything to prevent an outbreak in our own homes.

Bad things: Overall Ocean City MD is not a luxurious city, a lot of places are dated looking and rundown. But I agree with other posters, the rooms at the Carousel are visibly dated, cheap furnishing, cheap bedding. And the bathroom was really tiny, barely one person at a time could fit in there. The atrium area could use a facelift. Our ocean front room overlooked a dirty rooftop and the patio furniture was cheap and filthy. For $400 a night plus taxes, it was disappointing. The whole place (atrium, stairwells and indoor pool had very poor lighting which gave it a dirty look.) The outdoor and indoor pools, a great draw for kids, were scuzzy looking, they need painting and new tiles. We'd been promised that we could use the facilities all day on the day of checkout, which was nice, but after going to the beach we went to the locker rooms to shower and change -- they have no soap or shampoo, no towels. I had to bring all of my own stuff, which again, for a $400 a night \"resort\" is sort of skimpy. While we were there, the elevator was broken for part of the time, the ice rink was closed one day due to some problem, the lights were all out in the men's locker room due to some electric problem, the atrium cafe ran out of coffee early on Sunday morning and people were standing around waiting for them to make more...they seem not to be able to handle the amount of traffic they get.

Finally settled on Ocean City but we weren't sure where to stay. We weren't really familiar with the layout and just wanted to be close to the beach and Seacrets. Boyfriend stumbled upon Carousel. I did my research on the reviews of the Hotel and we were not satisfied. The reviews were pretty bad and I happen to really trust Tripadvisor. I never write reviews but felt I needed to write about our experience and contradict some of these low ratings. We arrived Friday night 7/29 and the room was clean and big. We didn't get and ocean view, as it was more expensive, and settled for a standard room. To our surprise it faced the parking lot but it was the most beautiful view of the sunset. We had a balcony and enjoyed the view Saturday night. As soon as we walked in we checked everything to make sure nothing was broken. As it turns out the refrigerator was so I called the front desk immediately so we wouldn't be blamed for it later. Within 5 minutes the repair men were at our door and within 2 minutes after that they brought in a new fridge. Friendliest staff ever. I'll stop rambling and get to all the good stuff. That night walked across the street to the bar which had a DJ and bar and dancing. Just what we're into and just across the street! Next day went to the beach which is right outside the hotel. The hotel provides you with your own chairs as well. Once done with the beach walked back to the hotel's outside tiki bar and restaurant. Food was delicious, drinks were strong, and the live band was awesome. Our waiter was soooooo nice I over tipped him. Once drink in hand headed over to their outside pool and lounged...serenity! Went back to the room and it was spotless. Got dressed and made our way to the crab bag, a few blocks down. All you can eat crabs - AMAZING! Again, more friendly waiters. We then made our way to Seacrets and had a blast there. It's more of a 21-30 crowd and very loud with live bands and DJ's. We found a cab that gave us his number and was there to pick us up within 10 minutes of calling him. All in all everywhere we went was close and convenient. My best experience at the hotel definitely had to be when we left on Sunday. Check out was at 11 so the BF went downstairs to check out as I did last minute packing. He specifically said don't forget anything. As hungover and tired as I was, I forget my Iphone. I make it to the lobby and realize that I forgot it. I rushed back to the room to find that the phone was no longer there, charging in the outlet. This was literally 10 minutes after we left the room. I turn to the cleaning lady and said she hadn't seen anything. I was about to start going NUTS until I see the inspector of the rooms walking down the hall with my Iphone and charger in a little baggy with our information on a piece of paper. I was sure I had lost my phone for good but the honest staff at the Carousel Hotel did not let that happen.

Between the two of us, we have probably been to close to 100 countries. Not surprisingly, we have seen a lot of hotels in that time. Therefore, it is pretty remarkable when a property comes out on top - or bottom - of any of our possible lists. Congratulations Carousel Resort Hotel! You just topped our list of biggest rip off. With taxes, we ended up paying about $320 a night for an experience that felt part like being in a refugee camp and part like the surreal hotel experience in the movie Barton Fink. Yes, we know that trying to book less than a month in advance on the Eastern Shore of Maryland is going to be expensive, but never, never, never have we gotten so little for a room that cost even $100 less per night than what we were paying. Let's start with the kitschy and surreal first. The Carousel has a run down ice rink in the atrium of the hotel. Apparently the compressor was malfunctioning, so no guests could use the rink, but they were treated to a show called \"The Next Ice Age\" with 12 year-old's skating around in some bizarre interpretation of what the next ice age might be if it were an incoherent offering in a $300 rip-off hotel. In addition to coming in first on the rip-off chart, this act almost gets the Carousel the first place award for most astonishing kitsch ever seen in an establishment. As for the cheap, the hotel might also get another dubious first for worst elevator situation. At $300 a night, it appears a lot of families try not to starve on vacation by piling 12 people to a room, hence my impressions of a refugee camp. Yet this enormous high-rise (It must be 25 stories) has only four elevators - two for the lower floors, and two for the upper. To make matters worse, most guests seem to buy a week's worth of groceries at the Food Lion across the street and then use luggage carts to transport the food to their rooms. The result? Lines of up to 20 people stretching into the lobby waiting for elevators! This I have never seen except in an apartment block in a country I will not name (so as not to insult it in a review of the Carousel) that had been transformed into... yes... you guess it, a refugee camp. The room was clean, but ugly and a bit worn. Even if I was paying $200 a night, I might not complain (since it would not be worth the effort), but at $320, I have to say something. The lobby looks like a truck stop. The water in the indoor pool was murky. And the room seemed to have a spider infestation. So you get all of that for $320.

The front desk always greeted us with a smile and whenever we needed something done it was done. Example: Our patio door would not close properly and the phone was not working. I called the front desk to have both repaired and it was done within 30 minutes. The outdoor bar was a blast and all the bartenders were top notch in their service. As soon as I sat down at the bar they had my regular drink ready! My one complaint was the BBQ on Wednesday, my daughter ordered chicken and it as very undercooked. However, it started to rain at that time and I imagine the cook was under a bit of pressure. I felt a bit sorry for him and I did not blame him for the mistake as these things do happen. The manager apologized and we ate in the restaurant instead. The waitress in the restaurant as very attentive to our needs and made sure everything was right for us. We never had any issues getting beach chairs, and the bellmen always held the door open for us. The beach bar food is pretty decent and the prices are very reasonable. The staff at the beach bar as I mentioned before were excellent and they had daily entertainment from 2-6 everyday which made the beach bar the most fun. Our check-out was a bit hectic as the elevators were very slow that day, which was to be expected. So upon check-out, I would suggest you get everything down around 7:30 am just to be on the safe side. I ended up getting a bellman to take my stuff down for me and he was very attentive to our needs. We are going back next year and despite the negative reviews from others, I would say the hotel did everything in their power to meet and exceed our needs.

We try to stay somewhere different each time, and this time he chose the Carousel. Let me say that the room was very clean and the pool was great. The bathroom small, but spotless. Our biggest disappointment was my own fault...the skating rink was closed. This was the main reason we decided to stay there. In going back to the website now, I see that the \"closed\" dates are the last thing at the very bottom of the page, and I did not see them. Also, I booked an \"Oceanfront\" room instead of an \"Atrium room with a view of the rink\", after reading some reviews about noise from the rink. My room had both the Ocean View and the view of the rink. I can only imagine that, when open, the noise from the rink must be difficult to bear, as even in this \"Oceanfront\" room, with the rink closed and drained, music and noises from the \"Atrium\" area were quite easily heard in our room, and in the morning we were awakened by the clanging of metal rods as workers laid carpeting and decor in the rink area for a fundraising party. Well, no skating, but there is always swimming...my next disappointment was in the pool hours. It closed at 9pm. Since check-in isn't until 4pm (the latest I have ever encountered), and we had to go out to dinner (I did know the restaurant would not be open) we didn't get as much time in the pool as we would have liked. At other hotels we generally grab a swim before checkout the next morning; however, checkout is at 11am and the pool didn't open until 1pm. Scratch that idea too. So after the pool closed we noticed the pool table downstairs. We went to the desk to ask for the cue sticks as there were none at the table. The desk clerk called the security guard and asked if he would get them for us. We were told we could wait at the pool table, which we did for 30 minutes. No one brought us any cues. So then we decided to go over to the game room instead. It was closed. By then it was 9:50pm. Earlier we had tried to use the \"complimentary\" computer in the Atrium, but we couldn't get it to work, so we just went back to the room to watch TV. The room was warm (75 degrees) despite having never turned the heat on, so just before sleep I pushed the control for \"cool\" and set the thermostat at 70. It seemed to be running and I fell asleep. I awoke at 3:30am sweating. It was now 78 degrees in the room and whatever I had turned on was still running. I had to turn it off and open the balcony door to cool the room off. An expensive overnight stay considering the only thing we got to do was swim for about an hour. But my grandson still wants to go back again and give it another try in the next off season.

OK...let's go with the good. The staff at this hotel were all very friendly and welcoming and this hotel was very family oriented. Also, my children LOVED the ice skating rink. We stayed for a long weekend over Labor Day, and once the weekend ended, I got rooms for only $79, which I thought was pretty reasonable. Also, we are facebook fans, so upon arrival there was a very nice gift with t-shirts, beach bag, beach balls, frisbee, and free skating passes in our room which I thought was very nice and appreciated. Also, the beach area in front of the hotel was very nice/clean, not very crowded, and there was a lifeguard in this area. We didn't have a chance to swim, but took a peek at the pools and they all looked very nice and well maintained. OK, now for the bad.... The hotel is pretty old and in need of some major renovations. When you walk in, the lobby area is beautful and well maintained, but this is not true of the rooms. The elevators were a little frightening and made strange grinding, pounding, hissing noises. There was dust and cobwebs in the corners of the room and in the air conditioner. The water pressure in the shower was so poor that I had a hard time getting the shampoo rinsed from my hair; I mean, I now that hotels put on water savers, but this was ridiculous! Our TV kept going black and saying \"Unusable signal\", but these were not my biggest complaints. Upon arrival to any hotel, the first things I do are strip the bed to check for bed bugs (none found here=good) and check the bathroom for cleanliness (very dirty=gross). I found black mold/mildew growing around the metal fixtures in the bath tub and small, curly hairs (ew, gross) in the tub. Also, the caulking around the tub was dirty and crumbling all around the edges of the tub. I complained to the front desk and they apologized and told me someone would be sent up immediately to clean it. We went to the beach and came back that evening to find the tub in the exact same condition. I called back down to the front desk and talked to Todd, manager. Let me just say, if you do stay here and need something done, he is the man to get things done :) He offered to send someone right up, but I said that we were tired and going to bed so he said that housekeeping would handle it in the morning. We got up bright and early again and headed to the beach. We returned for showers mid-day and ew...our tub was still dirty. I went down to the front desk and asked for cleaners so I could just do it myself. They were very apologetic and promised that this would be taken care of immediately. So, we were off to meet up with family and returned late again and guess what....our tub was STILL dirty! It was around 9 that night and I called Todd, again, and he sent someone up immediately to FINALLY clean the tub! I never knew that cleaning a tub was such a chore. It was very frustrating. Also, on our first night in the hotel, there was a woman in the room next to us whose husband locked her out of the room on the balcony. On purpose? I'm not sure, but anyway, we woke up to her pounding and screaming on her balcony door around midnight. My husband stuck his head out and she asked us to call down to the front desk for her so we did. My husband was in the hall, getting a drink from vending, when security came up to help her, and guess what...since our door was open, they came into our room and out onto OUR balcony at midnight to help her. I was in bed with two sleeping kids and security was very loud. This made NO sense to me. Did he not have a key card? Why was he in our room waking up my children? Again, I talked to Todd and he did credit $75 to my room for the inconvenience, which was nice, but this should've NEVER happened!

It was a great family place, with a lot to offer for everyone. It was very clean, but there were a few things that drove us crazy....The room with a ocean front view was $279/night.(That seems to be about average for the area.) The web site shows a tall building with a smaller building in front of it. The hotel is the smaller building. Our pull out couch did not work. We called the desk and they sent someone up to open it for us. They said it would be replaced. They never did. I had to call again. While having cocktails at the outside pool bar, the bartender took our change as his tip. We were going to have more drinks and give him a tip. We felt he should have waited for us to \"leave the tip\". The maid knocked on our door at 9 am. I asked her to come back. We went out for the day and at 5pm, the room was not cleaned. This happened two times. The Happy Hour Food specials for the indoor bar were posted throughout the establishment. It posted 1/2 pound seasoned shrimp for $4.95. When we ordered it, we were told it was $10.95 due to the Gulf oil leak disaster. We do respect that, but the specials should be changed to reflect that. When I asked the food manager to honor the price I was told by the food buyer, the best they could do was $2 off. We said no thank you. When I reported this to the front desk, the very helpful woman, called the food manager. He said he was honoring the prices, but we did not ask him. This was a lie. The woman at the front desk told him to honor it the next day. He, Tom Anderson, who lied to us, said he would. We did not bother to go back, because we were annoyed. The shrimp was \"whited out\" off the flyer in front of the bar, the next day. The rest of the flyers as of 7/15/10 throughout the resort still had the shrimp listed. These are small things, and we really did have a good time. I just feel their customer service needs improvement.

Yes the ice gets a little watery from the busy use in the evening. So go during the day when its less crowed. No big deal. The arcade is small but something to do to kill some time. There are two computers to use for Internet access if needed. A gift shop if u forget something that's prices are in line with all local gift shops in the area.

The food was just OK. There is plenty to do from the small ice show to the movie night, pools, beach and moon bounce. The free beach chairs for each day was nice not to have to pack. parking was ample.The elevators are a tad old and slow but nothing more than a two to three minute wait unlike the other reviews that said 20 Min's which is not true. Besides taking the stairs never hurt. Our room did have a leak which i reported and they took care of right away. basically the rooms were like most hotels. A little worn but clean.Beds were a little hard but nothing that prevented sleep.our room had a mini fridge,microwave,coffee maker and sink.

The condos that I have stayed in are all clean, well kept, and I dont think there is a place in OC that would even remotely give you what you get there as far as rooms go.

You can view the condos on their website, so, you see what you get before you get there. Again, I am not talking for the nightly hotel part, just the condos.

I found out about Carousel through a friend that heard about it. I was going for a weekend trip but due to the low Trip Advisor rating I decided to only book one night at this hotel. Thank you Trip Advisor reviewers! The greatest thing about the room was the ocean front balcony. We had 2 queen beds and a sleeper couch. Please, don't even try to sleep on the sleeper couch unless you enjoy pain. The room was clean, but very very average. I expect a little more when I travel. But then again it was a great price. My biggest complaint by far was the rude staff in the swimming pool area that day. The boys could not go swimming without adult guest supervision. When I questioned why 14 yr olds who were taller than the 5foot pool (one 5'8 and had just turned 14,the other 6'2 and turning 15 the next week) could not swim without supervision, the staff lady told me it was Ocean City regulation. When asked which regulation (because we had just come from another hotel where this was not a problem), the staff lady became very defensive stating she did not have to tell me. I asked for the hotel manager information and she refused to give it to me and said I would never be able to speak with him. Finally another staff member did give me the manager's name. After walking around the pool after this altercation, I noticed there was a posted green sign leaning against the wall behind the entrance that said \"..children under 15 should not swim without adult supervision\"(\"should not\" not \"could not\"). When I pointed that out to the original staff lady, she said the green sign was the Ocean City regulation. I reminded her that she said Ocean City regulation said children under 15 \"could not\" swim without adult supervision, but the sign says \"should not\". She then said Carousel regulation said they \"could not\".... I asked again for her to tell me where it say this and got the same rude response that she didn't have to tell me or show me anything. After walking around some more, I did come across the hotel pool sign on the floor against a wall all the way over to the left of the entrance. Mind you, you had to go up to the sign to read it. That sign did say it was Carousel policy that no one under 15 be allowed to swim without adult guest supervision. What was the big secret that the staff could not or would not point out this sign?? They had a sign posted on the entrance door of the fitness room that no one under 18 was allowed. What was the secret with the pool room?? So, being the selfless mother/aunt that I am :-), I gave up my oceanfront balcony time to sit with the two tallest boys in the room, so they could swim. Needless to say, I will not be going back to the Carousel (despite the fact that my boy is now 15) and I will NOT recommend this hotel to my friends either.

First off, even though the Carousel is advertised as \u201cresort hotel & condominium,\u201d it is actually what looks like a 1970\u2019s motel with a condominium building attached. When booking, make sure you know which you are getting. I booked a \u201cDirect Oceanfront Room\u201d and, when I made the reservation, I confirmed that the room would have an ocean view and would be on a high floor, away from the noise of the ice-skating rink and public connector area. I was told that both of these requests would be noted in my reservation and \u201cshould not be a problem.\u201d These were lies number one and two. When we arrived at the motel, we were assigned to room 243. When I requested a room on a higher floor, away from the noise, I was told that this was the only room available (lie number three) and that it was a very quiet room (lie number four). Room number 243 was, unfortunately, not as advertised. In addition to being very run down and dirty, the \u201cOceanfront\u201d view consisted of a low-angle view of the ocean that was 90% blocked by a pool inflatable of some sort. The view out the other window was of a dumpster. When we returned to the front desk and told them that this room was unacceptable and that we would be staying somewhere else, they magically found us another room in the condominium building for only $30 more per night. I have seen other reviews that accused the Carousel of bait-and-switch tactics. In this case, I don\u2019t think it was intentional but rather that the desk staff did not have the authority to take care of customer problems (nor did they seem to want to). It took a manager to agree to give us this \u201cupgrade\u201d at the same room rate. Off to room number two\u2026while much better than room number one since it was a two-bedroom on the condo-side, it was still very run-down, \u201ctired\u201d and dirty. The room was \u201ccleaned\u201d, but the carpets, walls, bathrooms, etc. had had such little maintenance that it just felt dirty. The real problem with room number two, however, was the air conditioner. At any setting, it would blow only hot air, making the room temperature greater than 85 degrees. They did send a maintenance engineer right away but he was unable to fix the problem. Another call to the front desk and a request to speak directly to the manager on duty yielded yet another available room. Our third room was a three-bedroom condo and could have actually have been okay but, again, it was pretty run down. I don\u2019t know what the rate would have been for this room but I am sure it is much more than the motel rate we were paying. Unfortunately, this room, while also \u201ccleaned\u201d was dirty. In addition to an envelope requesting tips for the house cleaning staff, we found a drink-box straw on the floor, several dead insects on the floor and ceiling, and a used bar of soap in the shower. And, one of the toilets was clogged and would not flush properly. We decided to stay (mostly because we were tired and it was easier at this point not to try to move again) but only to stay one night. We thought about going to the indoor pool for a quick swim but, unfortunately, it was closed. I was assured that \u201cit will definitely be open tomorrow\u201d (lie number five\u2026it was still closed when we left). The next morning, when I checked out, I was informed that I had a balance for the remaining night since they have a two-night minimum (the two-night minimum was not in effect when I made the reservation several months in advance and I confirmed this about two weeks prior to arrival via telephone). When I questioned the charge, I was told that it would be corrected since we were checking out early and had had such a bad experience and that I had a zero balance. What I didn\u2019t realize at the time, however, was that they had already charged us for two nights, one night when I made the reservation in January and one night upon arrival.

Before I got here, I had read some of the reviews and was so nervous that I was thinking about cancelling my reservation but it was too late. Once we got here we absolutely could not see what the bad reviewers were talking about. We came here for a weeks stay with my 6 year old son, my husband, my grandmother, mother in law, my 15 year old daughter and her friend. My husband and I searched out everything that was written up as a bad review and could not find anything that was written about. We saw the cleaning staff cleaning the hotel rooms every morning, we also saw them cleaning the lobby and vacuuming the elevators. There are a total of 4 elevators 2 for 2-8 floors and 2 for 9 and above floors. The staff was extremely friendly, the room was clean (I brought my cleaning supplies with me just in case), we had no air conditioning in one of the bedrooms so we stopped at the front desk to let them know and maintenance was up here and fixed the problem in 10 minutes. My son played in the arcade a few times which is actually in a room off of the ice skating rink, not in the lobby. Although, there was a few pinball machines and a few rides for the younger kids in the bistro lobby as I called it. Our condo was on the 9th floor and even though there was a building there we could still see the ocean and beach very clearly. We have not tried the restaurant downstairs yet but we will go there on Saturday morning before we check out. I must say that both restaurants that we actually did eat at this week were over priced and you didn't get much selection even at the buffet, which is why you stay in and cook your own food. We never heard any commotion from other guests and we were always back to the hotel no later than 9:30 p.m. The grille outside looks like something from the tropics, the beach access was great also. My son enjoyed himself at the playground, my daughter and her friend also went ice skating and walked across the street to the mall and they even had computer access so she was able to keep in touch with her friends at home without any time limit.

It was in front of the beach, alright, but it was also in front of the outdoor bar & grill and outdoor pool. In addition to being old, dated, and a bit dirty, it's also a very LOUD hotel. Walls are flimsy, and the noise from the outdoor areas competes with the noise from the indoor areas (crowded, loud lobby). If you have young children who go to bed before 11 pm (or take naps in the middle of the day), good luck with that. Staff wasn't rude, but they weren't overly friendly, either. The \"arcade\" in the lobby consists of 3 or 4 small rides and a pinball machine (50 cents a piece). If you're thinking that the Carousel Hotel actually has a real carousel, you'd be wrong. The \"carousel\" consists of 3 small horses like the kind you find at the mall. Ice rink was a nice little plus, but small (and did I mention loud)? Indoor pool was small and ear-splitting LOUD, the \"hot\" tub was lukewarm with kids in it. There was just no place to go to get away from the noise, not even in your own room. I get that it's a kid-friendly hotel, but if you're paying $350 a night, you should be able to at least retreat to your room for some small measure of peace and quiet. No such luck. The food and drink were WAY overpriced, which seems to be a theme with this place. Room wasn't very clean - toilet was nasty, bathroom floor had ants.

For comparison, last year we stayed at The Irene and had nothing between our balcony and the ocean. Most importantly, we were renting from a private owner, so the furnishings and general condition had little to do with the Carousel hotel. This place was lovely. The carpet and ceremic tile looked fairly new. The furniture and appliances were in great shape, the bathrooms were well cared for. I think the housekeeping staff of the Carousel might have cleaned before we checked in (or a service hired by the owner?) but they did an excellent job. There was also a bay front balcony equipped with patio furniture. That was nice for our boogy boards and sand toys. \"We\" were 3 couples, a 1 year old and a 10 year old. The 10 year old really enjoyed the ice rink. Several times. One couple took the 1 and 10 yr olds to the indoor pool one day and had no complaints. The outdoor pool looked fine but was usually pretty crowded, but we like the beach anyway. We also liked the outside bar and grill. It was very convenient to leave our spot on the beach and get a shaded table for lunch in the middle of the day. Both days, maybe everyday, there was live entertainment which was pretty good. We only went there twice as it was rather expensive, but we kind of expected that. We also got carry out from the indoor bar 1 night: crab cake and hamburger platters. They were very good and not too pricey. We never ate in the restaurant, although they advertised what seemed to be a good deal \"all you can eat\" breakfast. The elevators were crowded during check in and check out days, end of beach times, etc. which is to be expected. Sometimes we took whichever one had room and walked the extra flight. We didn't mind. We never had to ask for anything, but there always seemed to be plenty of staff around. They were all young and friendly. I have to say, we all enjoyed ourselves.

There is a sign that says....No kids under the age of 18 are allowed in hot tub! OK, whatever that I guess can be understandable.

I chose to take pics and video tape them instead! My 3 year old was tired of skating. So, we took his skates off and thought he just needed a little break....put them underneath the chair so no one would trip over them. Next you know.......here comes a staff member running over telling us once you take your skates off...you have to immediately return them. Taking mini breaks are not permitted. WOW! He is 3,,,,its expected for him to get tired. He was eventually gonna put them back on......... Room Key/Door Lock..........last incident........2nd day we were there the room keys would not work. So, we go to front desk and they give us new ones. We try them...they don't work. So, Security comes to check it out....he says once the new keys were given, the door lock had to be re-acvtivated and it never was. At this point we all were hungry and waiting to go get dinner. He finally told us just to go.......he promised when we got back it would work. So, we took kids to boardwalk etc.....get home at 10:30......room keys still don't work. We were furious! Our 3 boys were falling asleep in the hallway! Even the master key would not work. So he said we needed a complete new lock. It took him 45 minutes to put it on and of course the door had to stay open while he was putting it on.

We had a king room with a jacuzzi tub, we didnt ask for the jacuzzi tub so im assuming it came with the room, but it was nice. We had a great view of the ocean, but since it was winter we didnt venture out to the beach. Our room consisted of a very small bathroom, toilet, bathtub and shower single sink and small hairdryer. Of course they had the normal shampoos and such, i didnt really look at them. When you first walk in there is a small kitchen like area, microwave, fridge sink and some cupboards, then you head into the bedroom where there is a very good size jacuzzi tub big enough for two. The only problem I had with the tub was that im really short and the tub was taller than my hips, getting in wasn't exactly easy. They should really provide steps or something. The bed was just next to the jacuzzi, noraml king size bed, mattress wasnt great. There was a small desk in the room, as well as a sofa coffee table and a table and two chairs. Our room also had two large sliding doors and a patio with table and chairs. I did like that there was a secure lock on the two sliding doors. There was also a large closet in the room as well! After we checked in we decided to go down and inspect the pool. We couldn't get in. It was locked. It had a sign on it that clearly stated that it would be open from 1pm till 9pm, but no one was to be found to open it. So I walked around and checked out the area. The ice skating rink, which is rather small is located right in the middle of the hotel. If you want to ice skate it requires five dollars for rentals. When we had made the reservation I had asked if it cost more to use the ice skating rink and was told no, guest could use it free, but then was told differently when we arrived. One other thing I didnt like about the room is when you walk in there is this huge window right next to the door, now the window has a curtain that goes over it, but doesn't cover the window 100% we had to make it with a clip i had in my bag, i dont like people being able to look in my hotel room.

I went down and stood there forever, no one ever came to see if i needed help. All the lights were lit like it should have been open, but I guess they weren't. So I went back up stairs where we watched tv the rest of the night. They only have basic cable. About 11pm we decided to go to sleep. Well lets just say the walls are paper thin. We could hear everything our neighbor was doing. Plus there was staff with some kind of carts in the halls constantly and they weren't quiet. Then about 1am I had finally drifted off to sleep when our neighbor got a pizza delivery. The delivery guy pounded on his or her door and yelled Fat Boy's Pizza or something like that I jumped so much I nearly fell out of bed.

The hotel was clean, and had everything we wanted on site - ice cream shop, several restaurants (indoor and out), indoor pool, outdoor pool, the grounds were beautiful, free beach chair use, and indoor skating rink, which we loved. One thing we notice was that here were many hotel employees (many were exchange students from eastern Europe) at all times roaming around to help us. We had several pleasant conversations with different employees and everyone was very helpful. Never did we encounter a single employee who did not speak English. We even watched the free movie on Friday night - and we hadn't seen it, so it was nice. We watched the ice show, very entertaining - also free. We took the bus (1/2 hour trip) to the boardwalk one night - it was 2.00 for an all-day trip, and the stop is in front of the hotel. We really could not find a thing wrong with this hotel.

They did promptly send us clean towels and the front desk was very friendly. The other staff however (mostly eastern europeans) spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us. I was often confronted at the pool to show my room card which I thought was pretty funny since I could not imagine anyone trying to sneak into this tiny pool! It would not be worth the attempt. The indoor pool was much larger but smelled so strongly of cholorine that I had trouble staying there for long. The hotel itself is old and in need of a refurb. The pillows were hard and lumpy and the sofa bed mattress was horrible. The shower would go from hot to cold all through the shower. But it was clean and right on the ocean. It was great to keep our balcony door open at night to listen to the surf. The view from the balcony was so beautiful as well and we enjoyed having snacks and drinks out there. The ice rink was a bit weird, and you had to pay to use it (even for hotel guests) which I thought was a bit much given the price we were paying for the room. We even brought our skates but did not feel like paying extra just to use the rink. As you can see, I had mixed feelings. The location was nice and our ocean front room was nice. I would not stay there again though. It was very pricey for the quality of the hotel. THe Hilton looked very nice and I would try that if we returned to Ocean City.

The room was an average room, good sized. The beds were a little hard and the airconditioner was noisy. Also the screen door kept coming off the track. The location of the room was very convenient. We were right off the lobby which had the ice skating rink and the ice cream snack bar. We did not need to use any elevators. And out the patio door, we were right by the pool and outdoor bar/restaurant. It was a little noisy in the daytime, but the pool and restaurant closed by 9 so there was no late night noise. We ate at the patio restaurant once, the food was good and the service was fine. We did not eat at Seasons restaurant at all. We also only used the outdoor pool, did not use the indoor pool since it was nice weather. The outdoor pool was fine, although a bit crowded. The ice skating rink was great. The ice show was nice, and my daughter, who rarely ice skates normally, spent 3 out of the 4 nights, at the rink. There were tons of small children around and the hotel definitely was family oriented, not for singles. The room was made up late the first day, not til around 4 so the maid service could have been a little better. The only thing I didn't like much about this hotel was the location. It is far from the boardwalk and the main part of ocean city. Also, we went to Assateague Island once, which we loved. Very nice, handicapped accessible trails. We saw a deer up close as well as a pack of horses which ran through the beach parking lot! We also saw some turtles and crabs in the swamp waters. The Carousel is 45 minutes from Assateague so staying in downtown or midtown Ocean City would have been more convenient. What we didn't like about Ocean City was the prices. The restaurants were very expensive, even the ones that looked like they would be more family oriented. The only reasonable places we found were Dennys (great for breakfast) and Pizza Hut. We ate at a seafood buffet at the Castle Hotel which wasn't very good for the price. Oh, Phillips is a good restaurant too, and not too expensive. Don't eat at the Dough Roller, they were expensive and not very good. We also loved the pro golf on 61st street. There is an indoor, airconditioned mini golf, along with an outside mini golf. The outside one was your average minigolf but the inside one was great. A must if you like minigolf. And you can play both courses all day until 5 pm for $10.

I was impressed with the spacious room. We had a balcony overlooking the ice rink. It was a great rate and the kids really enjoyed the free ice show, not to mention watching the skaters practice, and of course the ZAMBONI:-) We had complimentary beach chairs and the kids ate free at breakfast. There was nice music at the pool bar, good service at the pool patio, convenient location away from all of the downtown noise, and a clean baby pool. Everything closed down at 10PM at the hotel and it was a family atmosphere. Unfortunately when we arrived the front entrance was blocked due to work being done. There are very small corridors and small elevators. The maid service was not the best. We didn't get any more plastic cups and a dirty wash cloth was left on the sink in the kitchenette. I could not find a map or any hotel information in the room. The indoor pool was extrememly sandy! There was a piece of carpet coming off the wall, a cracked tile in the bathroom, a loose ceiling tile in the bathroom, the light didn't work properly, and the parking spaces were ridiculously small! I would stay at the Carousel again simply because it is one of the better places to stay in Ocean City. Beware of all the other hotels. They are expensive and very old! I am a native Marylander and have been visiting Ocean City for 40 years! It is beginning to lose its appeal and charm. It is becoming an old beach town. I come for the Thrashers fries, the Alaska stand cheese dogs, Fishers popcorn, Candy Kitchen, and Trimpers rides. If you can't afford to stay at the Hilton, then quite possibly the Carousel is for you! Eat at the Olive Tree and Harpoon Hannas. I used to love Phillips, but the service was lousy! I would not spend an entire week in Ocean City. The only thing that keeps me going to Ocean City is for the nostalgia! The town needs a complete makeover!", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "samanthasmom02", "ReviewID": "UR16974414", "Content": "Stayed here this past weekend.

I have to admit, I am a little surprised by the overwhelmingly negative reviews. Each of the three times I stayed here, I was quite happy. I will say that it is NOT a luxury hotel. If you are expecting a luxury hotel, you will be disappointed. It is a \u201cnice\u201d hotel, especially for Ocean City which has its fair share of not-so-nice hotels. So if you are looking for a luxury hotel, you may want to consider the new Hilton, but be prepared to spend some money. The Carousel offers hotel rooms on the lower levels; the upper levels are condominiums. We stayed in one of the hotel rooms on the third floor. I paid $80 per night (off-season, non-weekend) through Expedia and found that I got my money\u2019s worth. The room was clean and well stocked with towels. Each room has a fridge, microwave, coffee pot and \u201ckitchen\u201d sink which makes it nice for bringing home leftovers or having breakfast in the room. The room also had a hair dryer, iron, ironing board and large closet. The hotel has easy beach access and provides chairs, although I didn\u2019t use them. I used the hot tub, the exercise room and the locker room during my stay and all were clean. The pool area provides towels (albeit small and thin, not \u201cbeach\u201d towels) for use in the pool and gym area. There is also an indoor ice skating rink for rainy days. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. There was a small mix-up with my reservation; somehow I was listed twice on the manifest. The clerk offered to call Expedia for me to make sure my credit card was not double-billed. We were scheduled to be moved from one section of the hotel to a better room for the remainder of our stay and the clerk blocked the room in advance so that it would be ready for us the next morning when it was time to switch. If I had to make one complaint about the hotel, it would be that you can hear everything. The rooms are not well insulated (especially the doors) so you can hear everyone walking down the hall and their conversations. If you have rowdy neighbors, which we did our first night, it can be very annoying. This is not really the hotel\u2019s fault; it is the fault of rude people. The hotel has a strict \u201cno party\u201d policy and if you call the front desk, they will enforce the policy. If you get a room facing Coastal Highway (eg. not beach front) you will hear road noise and noise from the parking lot if your door is open. During the summer months this probably is not such a problem b/c the air conditioner will be on and the door closed. The only other \u201ccomplaint\u201d I would make is that the beds are hard. They are simply a mattress and box spring, not a comfy pillow top or feather bed that you would find at t Marriott or similar. With that said, I had no problem with this hotel and would recommend it.

I went there with my Mom, sister and daughter for a girls getaway. Lets just say that we stayed away from the hotel as much as we could. We first checked in to the hotel; put our bags in the room and went to take a tour of the hotel. After that we went back to our room only to find our swipe card didnt work; neither did the families up the hall from us who was also standing in the hallway. The reason both our room keys didnt work; there was a system gliche and they got our rooms mixed up. This other family told us they were actually in our room before they realized that it was already occupied; I am so glad that I wasnt changing when they walked in. Front desk could have cared less and thought it was rather amusing vs. being concerned. The whole weekend we had to get our swipe card reactivated 9 times. RIDICULOUS! Friday evening we were laying in bed and were discussing what this horrible racket could be; only to figure out we were beside the elevators well needless to say we didnt sleep at all. Went down to the lobby got our rooms changed; again the not caring attitudes is what disgusted me the most. While in the lobby a customer and a hotel employee are standing in the lobby fighting to where the customer says to the employee I will never stay here again; the employee didnt let well enough alone and made another comment the customer asked the employee if he wanted to take this outside. On the way to the elevator another victim of this hotel steps off the elevator and tells us not to go on that elevator he fell 5 flights (something was wrong with the elevator) the poor man was as white as a ghost...again hotel mgmt laughed and said this is impossible that would never happen. Didnt check it out or do anything about it. After a few more times of being in the lobby to get our swipe card fixed and other complaining customers. The next one that got me was when the manager was on the phone with I am guessing another customer telling them dont touch anything; housekeeping was the only ones in your room...let everything the way they left it. I am not sure what was left in this room or how it was left but that is a little scary. OK to top this whole place off...my Mom went to use the bathroom in the morning when she was getting wet and couldnt figure out where it was coming from...she looked up and the ceiling was leaking...GROSS...was it from the toilet/shower above us...who knows...I dont wanna know. Again went to let mgmt know and he laughed in our faces saying that is impossible. I think this hotel is rather gross management there is not caring at all..DO NOT STAY HERE!

Speaking of summer....there is an outdoor pool (one big and one small) as well as two bar/snack bar areas, plenty of 'deck' space and a nice wooden playground that our 5 year old spent a lot of time in.

The game room, kids activities, FREE WIRELESS INTERNET, the store, the pool, a sports bar and a fabulous restaurant (Seasons).

The staff is friendly, accommodating and willing to do whatever it takes to make sure our stay was just right. One last point I want to write about was the fact that one of the friends we took with us left her glasses in the room. When we got home (3 hour drive) I called the front desk to make them aware that they may be in the bed or under it. They connected me to Security and the gentleman who answered ran 'right up there' to check and said he would call me back. He called in 4 minutes and had them!

I had 5 guests total since I was also paying for my mother to have a room. The hotel charged my card for a deposit for both rooms when I booked. When I arrived to check in on a Friday afternoon the line to check in was rather long. When I finally got to the front desk the problems started. The person who took my reservation charged a reservation fee for both rooms but only reserved one. The desk clerk than says to the manager \"You know that room we are holding for emergencies, well now we have one\". Then she proceeded to send so many credits and charges to my card that eventually Mastercard would not accept any more transactions on the card due to excessive activity from this one vendor. I finally gave them my checkcard and had them charge it to my checking account. It actually took them two months to straighten out the charges to the room. The hotel itself is badly in need of renovation. It looks like everything hasn't been updated in 20-30 years. We went to the breakfast buffet and for $9 a person they had about 10 items to choose from. What they did have wasn't very good anyway.

The hostess & wait staff were pleasant. We made use of indoor & outdoor pools, hot-tub & workout room - all of which were satisfactory.

My kids are really good swimmers and r above 5 feet tall but not over 15. The water was also so green. Then I saw a kid that always disrespected his parents. He then always worried about his lane which was a circle where he put all his sand toys in. He then made a circle which these two couples were sitting in.

We were just coming off the beach; there was five of us total. We sat down and a waitress walked up to us and in broken English said \"Bar B Que\". We all looked around at each other not knowing why she just mentioned Bar B Que so we decided to just ignore it and place our drink order. She again blurts out Bar B Que and starts ripping off green bands and points to a buffet. We all go sure why not. Now in Northern Virginia during happy hour the local bars to attract people will have with a purchase of two beers you get a steak and baked potato. This practice is not uncommon some places have nacho night or even pizza night. So we were under the assumption that was what was happening....... buy a drink get a cheeseburger. So we get the bill and for five cheeseburgers we paid 13.00 a piece. Well needless to say we were upset. Number one we just wanted a drink she pushed the buffet. Number two why not say we have a buffet for $13.00. We even went as far as to look on the buffet thinking a sign was posted saying $13.00 for a dry cheeseburger... nope....not a sign in sight. All you get is a waitress coming up to you in broken English \"Bar B Que\". So my husband complained .......the waitress argued .......my husband got mad. So he decides not to leave a tip. We get back from the beach and my husband goes over expenses and sees that there is an extra charge to that particular bill he does the math and figures out that Tatiana the waitress in question decided to add 20% tip without our authorization. Now I have a problem with that. So my advice is pay in cash when you go there because the waitresses apparently think they have the right to add whatever they want to the bill. So check your bill thoroughly ....they got us with the Bar B Que and now they got us a second time with adding their own tip without authorization.

Starbucks located onsite was great in the morning and also checking email in the cafe with their wireless was great. Drinks from Tiki bar were absolutely refreshing and knowing a new drink to make (sex-on-the-boarwalk) was great to know for future reference. I noticed that when my g/f and i came in after 10 pm that the ENTIRE hotel was QUIET QUIET QUIET that you definitely could have heard a pin drop on the carpet thats for sure. Security made itself VERY present at night. nice and secure. Location was great for shopping at grocery store, beer and wine store, bar - \"the Green Turtle\", 7-11 store, and bustops every ten minutes or SOONER in front of hotel - (across street for all) - all in all.. great location on 118th street in Ocean City. Md. Take the Bus to Everything you want to do near boardwalk for $2 per person all day... the ride at night is entertaining with the intoxicated people but if you are a family looking to use the bus id say ride back by 10pm. (lol... trust me) The hotel gets 'cleaned' every day with employees present everywhere running vacuums and doing maid service during the daylight hours - new towels, washcloths and handtowels every day!.. they keep this hotel as clean as they quite possibly can and they do a great job at it for as BUSY that this place is during the summer months at peak time of year. plenty of parking especially in a parking garage located next to the hotel and i recommend parking in the garage do to it being soo hot during our stay that it made it nice to jump into a cool vehicle IF we were to use our vehicle so thats really nice. The Bad: not much to tell you. the hotel u can tell gets USED but that goes with the whole deal. You see that it needs paint here and there but, It is a family oriented BUSY BUSY and a VERY popular hotel so they must be doing things right. It is a busy busy place then its relatively very quiet at night after 10 pm with security making its presence known to you if you choose to come in late-night. Points of Interest: the Boardwalk - (A huge chunk of metal debris from the Twin Towers is permanently place at a 'tribute' for Fireman the world over on the Boardwalk - people were in awe of this piece and touched it one by one. DEFINITELY a POINT OF INTEREST!) Boardwalk Boardwalk Boardwalk it people. everything to see, do, eat, drink, ride, play and shop. Nightlife? Club it up! look for local \"Beachcomer\" flyer in the hotel for all nightlife of your choice. THE BEACH!! yeah beach it up and get in the water too. its refreshing after sitting in the how sun for 30 minutes. The food!! Seafood Buffets everywhere! look for coupon books and specials located in the hotel restaurant as well. Check out the Bayside. go for a walk and check out the real estate for sale. you'll be amazed not only by the properties but the prices as well. LOL!! take a late-night walk on the beach.. sit in a lifeguards chair and listen to sounds of the sea. ahhhh... so nice. In Conclusion: Id recommend this place to ANY first-time family vactioners looking to visit Ocean City, Md. The only reason that myself, my family and my g/f stayed there was due to our week at our chiropractors condo rental was NOT available for that week (we stayed 7-16 to 7-18 /2007) so we went with an internet search and i came up with \" Ocean City's Favorite Family Hotel - The Carousel Hotel Resort and Condominiums\". I googled Ocean City Hotels and thats what i got. If you Google it or whatever you will come up with \"the Carousel\" as well. welp.. thats really all i got to say about the Carousel. I hope should you entertain the idea of going to Ocean City, Maryland that you would consider \"the Carousel\". Im actually hoping that The Carousel sees this review, contacts me and gives me a few free nights for this review thats how much i liked staying there. ( LOL!! yeah right.) I asked my mom if shed stay there again and she said that she would have NO problem staying there again. I'll let it at that. the pic of the hotel was taken FROM the beach on a weird but kewl day. this fog/haze came in from the ocean that afternoon sooo much that the lifeguards pulled EVERYBODY out of the water. it was weird but its a neato pic of the hotel from the beach.. take a look... hope u can get some kind of idea of what the hotel looks like from the beach?... oh and about the fog?... it went away at about 4 pm and then we were allowed to go back in the water - refreshing!.. later.. dantheman", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cnightmare on 118 street\u201d", "Author": "evicted", "ReviewID": "UR8223525", "Content": "my family vacavtion at this hotel was a true nightmare.

From then on we had to walk around in socks or shoes. There was sand in our bed. The room is very outdated, dilapidated ie. wallpaper falling off the wall, exposed pipes, carpet filthy and ripping. The bathroom is extremely small, I am an average size person and my 2 year old kept coming in the bathroom with me, but we couldn't even get the door open if we were standing there together. The worst part of the trip was 2 of the 3 nights that we were there, the fire alarm went off at 3:00 a.m. The first night, we were scared, thinking there was a fire and had to evacuate(very scary with little kids). Then talking with another hotel guest the next day, they said someone told them it happens all the time due to a malfunction. Sure enough the third night, the alarm went off again at 3:30 a.m. If this is a regular occurence, the hotel should do something about it. It is very annoying to spend that kind of money to be awaken 2 nights out of 3 at 3:00 a.m. with two small children. Also, do not waste your time at their restaurants, the food is not good at all. They have a breakfast buffet for $10, kids eat free, that we planned on doing each day. After the first day at the breakfast buffet, we did not go back, it was terrible. It appears to me that management is letting the hotel get run down and does not care about taking care of it. Our room was very outdated and run down. In addition, many of the amenities were broken.

There is a coffee and ice-cream shop in the atrium, an outdoor bar and grill between the hotel and the beach and a reasonably-priced restaurant in the hotel. The pools and outdoor area (with very nice playground) are beautifully maintained. It's only steps to the beach, and all lifeguard stands were staffed. Parking can be tough in Ocean City, but between the large lot and indoor garage, parking during our time was plentiful. The stay was nice and, although we did, there was little need to leave the hotel for anything.. While our experience was positive, it's only fair to point out the not-so-positive things. When we made a reservation for an ocean-front room, the reservationist said that she should point out that the ocean view from our first-floor room would be partially blocked by dunes. What she didn't point out was that the dunes were blocked by an outdoor restaurant and tiki bar, with tables no more than eight feet from our patio door. The umbrella tables were so close to our room, that during a brief storm, the wind knocked one of the tables on its side, hitting our door. Sitting on a chair on our patio, we had people at the closest table no more than three feet away. The other door to the room opened directly into the activity in the atrium. At one point, the theme from \"Space Odyssey\" from the front door and the sounds of a duo performing \"Rollin' Down the River\" from the patio door were a cacophony so loud that we couldn't hear each other talking in our room. All we could do was laugh. The point is, don't take a first-floor room if you want privacy and to watch the quiet ocean. There have been a number of reviews about service and cleanliness at this hotel. Our experience was that the the room and grounds appeared clean. The hotel did seem to be short staffed, and a number of them had difficulty with English, but those who were there were friendly and helpful.

When we checked out we told the Desk Manager all of the problems and she asked us why we didn't call the front desk to allow them to fix the problems and the since we didn't there was not much she could do. What happend to customer service???? And it is not like our problems just happened when we showed up. All of the problem we had was a result of an old dirty run down hotel. I didn't realize that I should of spent my weekend -------- to the hotel staff of the problems or that I should of called them to the room at 11:30 at night to kill a cock roach.", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWorst Nightmare\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3891628", "Content": "We stayed at the Carousel over Labor Day weekend this year.

We called the front desk who gave us another room but never apologized, offered any help or even mentioned my daugther who the ceiling caved in on. We spent the entire morning dealing with this mess and moving our stuff. When we tried to check out the bellboys had all of the carts and would NOT let us use one. I asked the desk who said call a bell boy, I stated that the Carousel would not get any more of my money and I would move out myself. They refused to let me use a cart and I called the bellboy, had them move it and did not pay them. I heard other families arguing to use a cart to check out, the carousel was trying to take one last advantage of families by not letting them use a cart while four bellboys stood there holding them, \"empty\"!!!

Like many others I had read the reviews and arrived expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised.

The fridge, microwave and sink came in handy for quick breakfasts for the kids. It had a huge closet as well. The kids really enjoyed watching the nightly skate show from the balcony, which was also very nice. It was carpeted, very clean and had a chair with an ottoman. We did not encounter any rude staff members. We let our children (ages 6 and 8) attend Camp Carousel one evening and they begged to go back. It was a good deal for only $12 per child. The food at the outdoor grill was very good. My husband and I ate at Seasons while the children were at Camp Carousel and were very pleased with the buffet. We all had the breakfast buffet one morning and it seemed to have something for everyone. The beach is very clean, the complimentary beach chairs were nice. If I had to think of a complaint it would be that we were overcharged for ice skating. It was supposed to be $5 per child, and we were charged the \"public\" rate of $7. It is a nice, clean decent hotel. Close to everything and far enough from the board walk to be less congested. We will probably return.

The rooms are clean, the service was actually very pleasant, and the setting on the beach is terrific. The public areas could use a bit of a makeover. The dirty carpeting in the elevator, the tired d\u00e9cor, and the freezing atrium, which must be kept at what seems to be about 55 degrees for the ridiculous ice-skating rink, were all things that need to be improved. I would strongly suggest an ocean-view room, which is well worth it, considering that the other rooms either look into the interior atrium or the parking lot. Also, try and avoid the long lines at Saturday check-in and do not expect any added-extras. When I left the weight room with my workout towel, I was admonished to return the towel \u201cright now.\u201d That sort of treatment would not happen at most hotels. The real issue here, to be very frank, is Ocean City itself. For a weekend filled with kitsch and crabs, it is ideal, but do not expect an incredible resort town. The boardwalk and strip-mall Coastal Highway are reminiscent of everything that is wrong with beach towns like OC; things got built far too quickly without any adherence to the beauty of the setting. I would recommend the Carousel, but would not recommend the area. Unless, of course, you are a golfer. Checkout the Lighthouse Sound Course (about fifteen minutes away).
