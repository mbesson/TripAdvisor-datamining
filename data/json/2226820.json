The hotel is new, chick, with two nice pools: one large one for general consumption, and one smaller indoor one for club level guests. The rooms at the club level are a good deal (specially if you book early and get a discount). They include wifi, mini-bar, breakfast, and a cocktail hour at 6pm. They also feature a cool 46\" TV and an even cooler Nespresso coffee machine. The club rooms are on the small size, so the 46\" TV feels like a movie screen. The view from the rooms are incredible (towering over Singapore), and the bathroom as one of the best showers I have seen in a hotel) Not much more to add. The pictures (and small video) on their website are perfectly fair (did not even bother to add mine). The service is ok, although the breakfast tends to be busy, and they run out of things some times. But since this is a club level breakfast (not a full restaurant one), people are patient enough, and the staff try very hard to get all done for you.

We didn`t use the hotel`s transportation, but there was no problem getting a taxi at the airport at that time of night and once we mentioned Novena, the driver found it easily. Even though we didn`t arrive till very late, the Reception Staff made check in a breeze. We loved our room, it was very modern, spotlessly clean and wonderful, comfortable bed. The location was perfect - only 2 subway stops to Orchard Road, Chinatown wasn`t too far and the subway was super efficient and very easy to use. We didn`t eat breakfast at the hotel; there was a lovely little cafe in the mall across the street - actually, there were lots of really nice places to eat in that mall - we really enjoyed it and picked up drinks and snacks for the room. We ran into a couple of minor problems, which were a little irritating, they weren`t a big deal. They were to do with housekeeping and they may not have been a problem if the person who showed us to our room had pointed out that the switch by the door, which wasn`t labelled, activated the `do not disturb` sign! As the lightswitches didn`t seem to correspond to the lights we were using, we were just clicking things on and off and hoping for the best. Remember it was now about 3.30am and we`d been travelling for over 24 hours!! So, the next afternoon, returning after a day of touring, we came back to find that our room hadn`t been made up. Called reception, who said they would deal with it - we went out for dinner later and at 11pm room still wasn`t made up. Called reception again, who informed us that someone had come to make up the room, but the do not disturb light was on!!! If we had only known!!! After that, we checked very carefully!

I'm sure if you stay here you'll be able to guess which condo it is. Our thought was we should check it out to decide whether we should guests who visit us in Singapore there. Good: - Clean rooms - Near hospital (this place gets a lot of medical tourists) - On top of Novena MRT (this can go either way - personally I'd stay closer to city if I was visiting as a tourist) - Nice pool. Not to crowded. There are usually chairs available. (I see it everyday from my condo) Bad: - Service: Singapore is not the most customer driven place to begin with... but this place took it to a whole new level. The vibe I got was nobody was in charge or knew what to do. Kinda lame. - Fire alarm: This place has a problem with its fire alarm system - ie. it goes off often. I stayed here 1-night in December. The alarm went off at 3am. I asked an employee about it. He rolled his eyes and said \"after heavy rain, the alarms get shorted\". I interpret this as poor electrical work, dripping water and moisture triggers the alarms. In Singapore it rains a lot. - Everything is OK Alarm: I believe Homer invented this on an episode of the Simpsons. Basically its an alarm that goes off to tell you everything is OK. The Oasia thought this was a good idea. After the 3am alarm finally gets turned off, just as you're about to fall asleep, the \"everything is OK alarm\" goes off. It is just as loud as the fire alarm. Brilliant! UPDATE So I've been living next to this hotel for 2-months now and they haven't fixed the alarms yet. I hear the fire alarm get triggered about twice a week - often late at night. The Oasia still annoys me on a bi-weekly basis with their stupid fire alarms.

The hotel is about 100 feet from the Novena MRT (subway) station on the red line (north-south line). (by the way, the MRT system is very impressive: easy to use, cheap, and efficient. It is pretty crowded during rush hour, however.) There is, by US standards, a massive indoor mall right next door to the hotel (by Singaporean standards, it is just another mall!) with grocery stores, a ton of restaurants, shops, etc. No hawker stalls nearby, but if you go one stop on the MRT to the Newton station, there is the Newton Food Center across the street which has excellent hawker stalls and is very cheap. The hotel room I had was on the 13 floor: a little bit small by US standards, it was comfortable nevertheless. The room was clean and relatively quiet. I had two twin beds (not by request) and they were pretty comfortable. The bathroom is fine: walk in shower, no tub, and the basic amenities. They offer a massive breakfast buffet that came with my room rate featuring waffles, eggs, vegetable curry (yum!), bacon, sausage, and pretty much anything else you could want. It gets very crowded and you end up sharing tables. Wifi is NOT free ($22 SGD daily). At least the connection had pretty good speed. There are a few English-speaking channels on the flatscreen TV (ESPN, CNN, BBC, Bloomberg). On the 8th floor, there is a workout room with a few barbells, treadmills, and a bike. Not much to speak of, but enough to break a sweat. There's a very nice pooldeck with a small kids pool and a jacuzzi. There's no poolside service that I saw, however. Osaia is not a resort hotel. There is no concierge, at least not for the non-club patrons like me. The front desk folks try to be helpful though. It is more along the lines of a business hotel: well located, clean, convenient, and efficient. There were a ton of people staying here that seemed to be part of an organized group travel operation, I think. If that's the sort of place you're looking for, I think this is a very good hotel to stay in.

The very sweet maid quickly learned my schedule, and every morning when I went to the lounge for breakfast, she would clean my room and have it ready by the time I got back. Speaking of breakfast, there was a changing variety of Asian and Western options each morning, and there was always very good pastry, bread, cheese, and smoked salmon. Evening hors d'oeuvres were varied as well; crackers, cheese, salsa and chips were constant. Overall, the food wasn't exceptional but it was more than acceptable and I skipped dinner altogether on several occasions because there was a lot of it.

Now, king bed was not available in standard rooms, hence the lady at Check-in upgraded us to a Deluxe room at no extra cost as it was only for 1 night. That was a plus to know that upon Check-in after a flight. I had read other reviews and said that all the rooms are same size regardless Standard, Deluxe or Club room, hence did not expect the room to be big. Indeed, the room is not big. The bathroom is separated by a glass, and the toilet is separated again from the shower by a glass. I suspect the bathroom is what makes all the room types different. We found the bathroom to be quite spacious as a result. As the hotel is still new, the room was clean, furniture still new. I found the bed strangely soft for my liking, it was sort of sinking in the middle. I would have expected a firm, new bed for a new hotel. Not sure if it was the mattress protector. We had a view to the pool and it looked nice. It rained while we were there so the pool was closed. What was surprising was that....there was no NIGHT LIGHT!! I was sure because I searched all over and so did hubby. In the end, we just slept with no lights on. We have a 2 year old kid who is afraid of the dark. So that may be something to consider. Under the side of the bed I found a business card. Apparently it looks like housekeeping had missed cleaning under the bed. The restaurant for buffet breakfast downstairs is indeed small and cramped according to other reviews. It had a fair selection for breakfast.

The room is fairly small, but that's not unexpected for Singapore. The room itself has been done out really well considering its size - lovely big and comfortable bed, an ultra thin LCD TV and the bathroom has a quirky, space-saving design that worked very well. Only negative here was that the drain in the bathroom was a bit smelly, but nothing that really upset us.

There's a plunge pull and jacuzzi as well as the pool and some of the sun loungers are in shallow areas of the pool, which was a nice touch.

You have to call them again. This was really awful. I mean Chinatown's food center cleans faster and more efficient than they do. 3.) For the price of over S$300net a night, it was just too expensive for what you're getting. Maybe if it was S$200 it might be a different story. If this hotel could improve their service, internet speed and lower their prices a bit, I think they'd be a good deal.

Although the location is not ideal, i figured that for 1 night it shall be OK. I arrived to the hotel just before midnight, and was greeted by the hotel reception girl. I have handed her my booking confirmation. Although she looked at it, she did not really read it, as she asked me to confirm much higher rate... When I asked her to re-check, she confirmed her mistake and I signed for the proper rate. I was given room 708, and asked for wakeup call, and taxi for my morning departure. I did notice that the girl wrote down both requests. Although it was late and the hotel was not fully booked, this reception girl handed me room for people with special needs. It means that the all bath room is built differently and to me, it reminded me geriatric hospital. In my experience, if such room is assigned to a person who did not ask for it, it shall be clearly stated before and agreed on the customer. This was not the case here, and at midnight, I had to come down asking for a room change. It seems that the girl did not even ware to her fault, or, mistake, same as she did not bother to look at my booking... Well, it needed a local manager to find normal room, which was OK. As the hotel is new, the rooms are clean, and nice. Enough lights and spacious bathroom. However to my opinion rooms are small, and may not be suitable for more than a short stay. Bed was comfortable, and working table was equipped with enough sockets (pity that only one socket is universal, all the other sockets are Singapore style). The working light is useless. 2 bottle of water. Electric sheds, and master light near the bed makes the bed experience smooth. Need to pay for internet- WHY? Now back to our reception girl.... She forgot to update my wakeup call request, luckily I had backup. When I came down by 8:15 AM and asked to verify my taxi reservation I realized that it was not done... I ws presented with the bill, guess which? The one which was mistakenly given to me upon check in. The bill which I did sign, along with the wakeup call and taxi booking, all gone with the wind, or, shall I say with the reception girl? Wonder where she has taken them...? As I had breakfast included in my rate, I stepped to the breakfast area. It looked more as busy train station, with one narrow path to guests to walk. I was seated in a table just outside the main dining area, which was OK, as it was more airy, I struggled my way into the buffet just to find out that bread was finished. OK, no bread. One of the staff brought some soft rolls, which was eatable, not more than that. Cheese selection was a mess. Fruits tray was with some leftovers, and if I had any intention to have breakfast it just evaporate with the remaining of the bread... So, I asked for tea. How wrong can it be? In Oasia or shall I say OH-ASIA hotel, you don\u2019t get tea. You get black thick dark liquid which has weird taste, under the title TEA. So, I asked the waitress if I can get fresh tea, which has tea color and tea taste. It seems that in OH-ASIA it is not acceptable. Guests need to pay $5.00 to get FRESH TEA... If you have your breakfast paid with the room, you entitled for BAD tea. if you wish to get GOOD tea - PAY.

We were allowed to check in 11am! How's that? Initially requested for a king bed since I as initially alone, but my friend decided to stay over as well so they allowed the change to a two-single bed place. The place was just magnificent! Though all their rooms were just 25sqm regardless of your category, we feel this is already adequate, and of course, coming from a hostel backpacker the previous night, this was surely a breath of fresh air. The views are nice, beds really comfy, great amenities (Thann brand), and also complimentary bar and espresso/tea making facilities. We felt we didn't really need to use the machines even the mini-bar because as Club room guests, we are also entitled to free snacks and drinks at the Living Room at the 22nd floor, all day! The private pools were nice, lots of spaces to lounge around, enjoy a drink anywhere on the floor. The views around were great as well. We went back by 730pm for the cocktails (6-8pm supposedly) and we were treated with unlimited beer, wine, and mixed drinks, and we thought their canapes were just biscuits topped with something, but no... they served chicken skewers, baked mussels, asst cheeses, veggie sticks, fresh juices and even fondue dessert! A real value for money inclusive there, wherein you'll pay $40-50, even more somewhere else. FYI: we had grilled teriyaki fish and lime chicken fillets the next day, I kinda miss those already! Since I joined the marathon that Sunday, I already got back 1130am and was really hungry so a bit worried since the complimentary breakfast ends at 11am... No problem on their part, they reopened their buffet area just for me! How's that again? Excellent service right there! The buffet is not too extensive, not too limiting either, just the right amount - no complaints! Housekeeping when we had the room serviced apparently provided the only basic toiletries - called them to ask for the Thann-brand ones, and they delivered a new set within a few minutes, with a smile, and also apologized about not providing it earlier. We also requested for more water during the night and is as then delivered right away as expected. So far, all the staff were very friendly and accommodating to us, and that's a big plus point during our stay. Check-out was a breeze, and they even allowed late check-out (2pm) as I needed to buy stuff at the adjacent malls and my flight is not until 430pm. Doreen (the Club Manager) even offered coffee and took the time to have a chit-chat with me about hotels, traveling, and the likes...

Located in one of the prime locations of Singapore, it is very convenient as it is just about 5 to 7 mins walk away from the MRT and exactly 2 mins walking distance from the Novena Velocity Mall. Being a gym member of the California Fitness franchise, this was certainly a plus for me as I can pop over into the gym for a workout anytime of the day. The hotel was rather quiet, and the room was very clean and cozy with clear views of the surroundings (I was staying on level 19), albeit a bit small. The bed was very comfortable however I did not quite enjoy my sleep as the pillows were not to my liking, I was actually having difficulties trying to sleep on the first night. The room was equipped with rain forest showers that is a plus and the usual basic amenities. As the hotel is still quite new and unheard of by many people, I really enjoyed my swim in the guest pool as there were hardly anyone there. Needless to say, the surroundings were serene and relaxing. I have no complains on the service level of the staff. In fact it was quite good. I have made a request for more green tea packets (6 more) to be placed in the room by writing a note for the housekeeping staff (There were only 2 green tea packets. Green tea is a staple in my daily diet, 2 packets could not last me even for a day.) I was rather surprised as they have provided way more than what I asked for. Kudos and continue to keep up the good work. However, there are a couple of areas for improvements that the management may want to look at. Here's the not so good: 1) SMART TV I am not sure what was the exact problem with the TV. It can also be the connection problem. The channels (HBO | National geographic | Star Movies | Star TV | Sports | Cartoon Network) I have watched, stalled after watching for a while (About 5 mins to 10 mins before the channel will stall). It happened more than 5 times on the first night when I was watching X Factor. It was anti climax when it stalled exactly during the results release. That happened again when I was watching the finale of the Walking dead. I have to keep going back to the main channel menu to restart and re select the channel or switched the TV off and on a few times. 2) Charging for WIFI It's a bit ridiculous when I can access the free wifi services just 2 mins walking distance away. Novena Velocity Mall is providing free wifi access at no charges. i understand Wifi services is complimentary only for executive level guests but not for the other guests staying in the other room categories. Singapore is becoming an integrated media hub where Wifi services is complimentary for many places in Singapore, it has become a necessity for many people to stay connected via the internet. If it is compulsory to charge for Wifi services as part of the hotel revenue, it should be packaged into the room cost and not charged separately. People would probably choose not to pay for Wifi services when it is free next door at 2 mins walking distance away.

Went to Singapore to attend an art gallery opening, the Affordable Art Fair and Musee d' Orsay exhibition at Singapore Art Museum. We booked directly with the hotel. We found the rates cheaper than Agoda and their headquarters, Far East Asia. Weird. (We didn't understand why they had different rates between headquarters and hotel.) If you book now, you can get 50% off the second night. Booked a superior room. Difference between superior and deluxe rooms: The deluxe rooms are located on higher floors, have better toiletries and a Nespresso machine. Superior has a coffee maker (similar to Nespresso), but not Nespresso branded. Pros: 1. New modern hotel, with nice design. 2. Easy access to MRT, food, and low to mid end shopping. 3. Room was small but because of the glass partitions, and room layout, it didn't feel claustrophobic. 4. For a sports buff like me, being beside Velocity mall is a nice perk. 5. Robes, towels, sheets were nice and new. Not the best quality, but decent for the price. Cons/Bad experiences 1. On the first day, I asked Zacko the doorman where the concierge was because I needed help in making restaurant reservations for a dinner party I was planning. He directed me to look for the concierge in Basement 1. I was in a hurry because I was running late for an appointment, but since I needed the reservation done, I hurried to B1. I thought it was poor planning on the hotel's part to locate the concierge in the basement and not in the lobby. Anyway, upon reaching B1, it was a whole floor of conference rooms and the floor was empty! I hurried back up and talked to Zacko again. I said there was no one there and I really needed to talk to the concierge. He said, that the concierge was only downstairs or outside. Huh?! I just didn't get him. Luckily, the real concierge overheard our conversation and introduced himself. For everyone's information, the concierge is to your left upon entering hotel's doors. Clearly, this doorman doesn't know what or who their concierge was. 2. On our last night, at around midnight, we were startled when the fire alarm went off. Then loud instrumental music started playing in the overhead speakers. It seemed like it was the case in all rooms because when we stepped out and looked up and down our hall, all the other guests were getting out their rooms as well. So most of the guests in our floor, wore the robes and went down the fire escape. I managed to get my handbag and passports and went down 15 flights of steps. Upon reaching the ground level, we were worried because the alarm continued to sound. But we didn't see or smell any smoke. No hotel staff was to be seen anywhereAfter 15 minutes of not knowing what was going on, the reception staff ushered us in and said sorry for the inconvenience. When we went back up, at around 1am, the same alarm and music went off! It was crazy!!! People got mad. A man who was staying in the room down the hall started yelling angrily. Most other guests got worried and started to go down the fire escape. Again, no announcement was made by the hotel. No apology!!! We later found out from another guest that there were teenage girls who tripped the fire alarm. They knew that there was a celebrity staying at the hotel and they were hoping that the fire alarm will get them to see the celebrity. I'm not sure if this was true. But it was an extremely irritating experience. 3. On our last day, after checking out, we told Zacko the doorman (there was no one else) that we needed to get to the airport immediately. We had 2 large suitcases and 2 hand carried ones. He said to take a seat inside and he will get a cab for us. We did just that and waited patiently. But to our irritation, we saw other people walk up to the front of the hotel and got into a cab right in front of our favorite doorman! Then before I could react, Zacko gave another taxi away. I didn't get it. These people came to the front of the hotel AFTER us and obviously were not going to the airport. We should have been given priority because we got there first (and were just asked to wait inside) and was going to the airport! Overall, it's a great hotel for a base in Singapore for shopping. Because of the MTR, it can get you anywhere you want. (We found it to be a great way of getting around because we didn't have our kids with us and didn't have to navigate strollers, etc).

The cons: The walls in the rooms are very thin. I don't know how someone can design a beautiful hotel and not put in sound proofing. You can hear the doors in the hall, the motorized window shades from the other rooms and I spent most of one night listening to a high pitch squeal which was the alarm clock from a room 2 doors down. The hotel was not crowded so the breakfast area was not crowded. They have 88 club rooms and seating for 20-25 for breakfast. if the hotel was full, I could see it being difficult to get breakfast. The last issue is becoming popular in a lot of hotels. There's a window between the shower and the bedroom with an electric privacy shade. The bathroom door is etched glass. There is no way to turn on the light in the bathroom without lighting up the whole room.

I was travelling with my 6 month old daughter so was keen to get into the room after our long flight. There were 5 receptionists serving 2 or 3 people when I arrived but I had to wait for around 20 minutes and even at that point I had to approach in a fairly forceful manner! The receptionist who served me was very efficient but she didn't smile once and used the word 'can I upsell to you....' I'm assuming she had been on training recently but in my experience they are not words used to customers, they are used by marketeers!! So on to the good stuff, I was very pleasantly surprised (this almost too away the annoyance I felt at the wait and frosty reception) to be up upgraded, I think it was to a club room and it was great, automatic blinds on the window and in the shower cubicle into the bedroom which was great for me to be able to watch the baby! On the downside they had no cot available for us and my baby had just started crawling and seemed to like attempting to throw herself off the bed. So having to have her sleep with me wasn't especially restful! I would have appreciated a heads up on that before I arrived so I could have made alternative arrangements. I loved the fact we had a bathtub in the room and also the nespresso machine was a wonderful addition. The maid was wonderfully friendly and professional and the room was spotless on arrival and also on the second day on our return. I also liked the free newspaper hanging on the door handle in the morning. The fact that you have to pay for wifi is pretty shocking in this day and age - this service should be free in every hotel, particularly those that cater for business customers. Its S$20 per 24 hours which is extortionate in my opinion but on the plus side is was fast. Location is great. Only 2 stops to Orchard Road but also if you didn't want to dine in the hotel there are many restaurants in the shopping centre just over the road.

Location is extremely convenient despite having to take the train to Orchard. The walk to the MRT is mostly thru a shopping centre which means no sweating under the hot Spore sun.

The shower stall and WC were a bit of a squeeze compared to most other hotels'. Furnishing and fittings are still new but evidently done on a budget and doesn't look like they will stand up to eventual wear and tear. Wifi is charged on a per-device, meaning you had to pay twice if you wanted to use it on your notebook as well as your mobile. There are no views to speak of as the hotel is wedged amongst a mall, medical centre, hospitals, condominiums, office blocks and construction sites. While convenient for visiting the mall and getting to the MRT station, it oddly has no weather-proof access to these. If it rains, it's a short dash across to these adjacent facilities. Breakfast is a relatively simple buffet spread -- those expecting a cornucopia as is normal in other hotels may be a little disappointed. While the hotel is acceptable in spite of these points, what gets it a low score is the service or lack thereof. There's nothing more annoying than being ignored -- call the concierge, guest services or housekeeping, and no one answers! This happened many times in just the first 2 days of my stay. The housekeeping is also obviously poorly trained, making up the room but leaving uncleared many used drinking glasses and empty wine bottles (which I'd left by the waste bin). A bottle cap dropped on the floor under the study desk was left lying there. In the late evening, the bellhop station at the driveway was unmanned, leaving me and my guests wondering how to call for taxis.

I wondered is it that I am an Asian and that is why I was not getting the basic service. I noticed including the Europeans were also not given the basic treatment. For a 400+ rooms hotel, Zaffron restaurant seems to be a bit small to occupy all the guests if it is a full house. Service was utterly poor and disappointing. I entered the restaurant looking forward to enjoy my breakfast and it was immediately dampen by the hostess. When I greeted her she replied \"May I have your key card?\". I was not shown to my seat and had to figure out myself which table I can occupy. Breakfast spread was limited and unappetizing.

Efficient and quick check-in and check-out 7. There are two huge shopping malls (one of which is called velocity) right above the MRT station and are adjacent to the Hotel (less than 1 minute away) Cons 1. Slightly away from where all the buzz is in the city (though still very convenient due to the proximity to the MRT station). Since we had a little baby with us and wanted to break out day into two halves with rest in the Hotel in between we thought it was slightly away and meant spending money on the MRT everytime. 2. No bath tub; which I thought was a shame for a 4 star Hotel Overall the excellent staff, comfortable room and the proximity to the shopping mall with loads of restaurants and to the MRT station makes this good choice.

The room was well appointed and designed along clean lines - like those you see in Ikea's catalogues. Sleep quality was excellent and I loved the blast from the shower. Internet, both wired and wifi, was great. I liked the hotel's infinity pool and the gym with brand new equipment. The in-room coffee machine saved me a morning trip to Starbucks in the adjoining Novena Square Shopping Mall (a suburban mall frequented by the office crowd at lunch and families at dinner) which has a well stocked supermarket on the ground floor. Signage is minimal as the hotel is new but it is not difficult to find my way around as everyone I met at the Oasia Hotel and its adjoining Novena Medical Centre II was very helpful, courteous and professional. I had a very nice three course dinner for just SGD20 (marinara pasta, cake and iced tea) at Doodles Pasta Bistro in the Oasia Hotel/NMC complex. The easiest way to get to Oasia Hotel from the Airport is by taxi if you are not familiar with Singapore's subway system. If you are, then take the train from Basement 2 of the Airport's Terminals 2,3, connect to the westbound train at Tanah Merah Station, and transfer to the northbound train at City Hall Interchange Station. The 40 minute journey costs peanuts at less than SGD2.00 compared with a taxi ride. From the Novena MRT Station, take the elevator which leads to an obscure but safe corridor in the Novena Square Mall, ride the escalator up one level and walk across the Novena Medical Centre I to reach Oasia Hotel - the building with a gray granite facade. I booked through a business associate with a corporate rate and paid a two star rate for a four star hotel with 4.5 star location. My only gripe - the overpowering scent of the air freshener on the ground floor of the Hotel/NMC.
