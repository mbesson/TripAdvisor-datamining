{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Stay out! This hotel is not worth of being called a hotel. I'd rather call it a dump. Bad neighbourhood, no money for value, absolutely not clean at all, restrooms are so dirty, people staying there are very weird, staff unfriendly... Conclusion: never stay at this place, go somewhere else, really, it's the best you can do.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR209529120", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "EuropeGuy78"}, {"Content": "This place just feels wrong... My finance and I were looking for somewhere to stay that was affordable, and near the show we were planning to see that evening. Well, affordable it was, at just under 60.00 dollars it seemed a bargain as i have on several occasions payed close to and over 180.00 for a nights stay in this city. There are however places, that one can stay that are within the 60 to 80 dollar range, that do not compromise ones feeling of safety, or hygiene standards and we felt this place most certainly did.  We based our decision on whether or not to stay here on price, and photographs of the place that can be seen on the hotel's website. When you walk into the place you will be greeted with a steel cage that you need to be buzzed into in order to get into the door, once inside the building, you will see that the desk person is protected and separated from you by a little plexy glass encased room that reminded me of those i have seen at gas stations. The shared toilet and shower facilities were reminiscent of a prison film, peeling paint, a toilet with literally a piece of corn next to it on the floor, and a giant rubber garbage can next to the toilet, filled with empty 40 ounce bottles and what looked like vomit and coffee grounds. The room smelled of stale smoke and Lysol spray. Some, but not all, of the staff that we had met were very rude, and impersonal, little eye contact, etc. We were up almost all night listening to people arguing and shouting profanity at one another. This place had a feeling of sadness, the building and all we encountered within just felt abused, both the energy within the building, and its visual presence as well. The place just felt wrong. unsafe. I strongly recommend that you find somewhere else to stay, This place is FAR far less then desirable, even for those of us trying to stay within a budget.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR307410146", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "genau"}, {"Content": "Very Central, great place This is a great place, downtown, close to MUNI, Cable Car, Shopping and Nightlife!
