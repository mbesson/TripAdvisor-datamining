I've had the opportunity to travel around the world and stay at many hotels. This hotel really fits in the category of \"two ends of the spectrum.\" On one hand the hotel is located in a great location in close proximity to Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor, as well as many other great tourist streets and buildings nearby. On the other hand, the hotel does not meet the expectations of a \"4-star\" hotel. The front desk staff was very helpful and very nice. Raquel, in particular, was always smiling and very knowledgeable, and was definitely the most professional staff member I encountered at the hotel. She worked above and beyond what you would expect from the front desk, but really they are far overworked, and the hotel doesn\u00b4t support their hard work. The manager at the front desk was rude and unpolite, and I question her credentials and education to be in the position she is in. However, despite all Raquel's effort to give us the best experience at the hotel, sadly the hotel itself does not meet up to the expectations of a hotel that is \"4-stars.\" I have a hard time believing this hotel is a 4-star hotel, because management decisions are extremely poor, some of the rooms are extremely small, and the maintenance and upkeep of the hotel is in poor condition (the showers were plugged, the heater didn\u00b4t work, the internet hardly ever works, and the beds are super uncomfortable). My first room was so small that I mistaked it for a maintenance closet. Thankfully, Raquel was wonderful and my room changed! Note there is no fitness area, the elevators are extremely small, and there is no bell-boy to help you carry your luggage up the stairs. Also, be prepared for an extremely expensive breakfast. It's much wiser for you to go outside the hotel, around the corner or across the street for breakfast for half the price. It's puzzling that a hotel that claims it is a 4-star hotel can have as many problems as this one does. I would come to expect some of these deficiencies from a 3-star hotel. Although the front desk staff and the location are great, the price you are paying to stay at this hotel is extremely high for the quality of this hotel. It's not a high tech hotel, as their name suggests. Don't be fooled by the beautiful lobby...the rest of the hotel does not meet these same standards. I would recommend this hotel only if you are coming to Madrid for a few days, with very little luggage. However, if you plan to stay more than 2 days, there's other great hotels in the same location for the city, with comparable prices for a better value for your dollar.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, comfy and cosy\u201d", "Author": "MsPeony1", "ReviewID": "UR132992710", "Content": "Went to Madrid for two nights with two friends.

Before booking I found several websites that indicated that the Petit Palace Alcala Torre had a swimming pool, so was disappointed to find that this is not true. They could have been old websites, however, as I cannot find them easily now. On the positive side, the Petit Palace is centrally located near two major subway stations (Sol and Banco de Espana). Also, the refreshment area was a nice touch, even though it was only available after noon. There are two laptop computers with internet access for guest use and a fax machine. Additionally, the front desk staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. Overall it was a pleasant stay but I don't think I'd book at this hotel again.

Most people in the group I was with had some serious complaint about their room, the main ones being: 1) excessive traffic noise and vibrations (all day and night) in the lower level rooms that are impossible to sleep to and 2) lack of water (hot or cold) in the higher level rooms. I had no water in my room for an entire day and had to wash my face and brush my teeth with bottled water from the mini bar (which they charged me for!). I couldn't even use the loo in my own room because it can't flush without water. Very annoying really.

There are several design flaws which made staying here unecessarily difficult. As you enter, the desk reception is up a flight of stairs, while the elevator for luggage is on the ground floor just to the right.. You pass it as you walk upstairs to the reception desk. This means one is separated from one's luggage in the first few seconds, before one has a chance to check in. Nothing came of this, but it is an uncomfortable beginning. We stayed on the 9th floor which has a view of the sidestreet below, and of buildings across the street. This was as expected. The first problem came with the sleeping arrangements. Bunk beds were set up for the children, but the top bunk had no siderail.. Also, the entire bunk set is end on to the windows. The ladder to the upper bunk also detaches easily, becoming a weapon in the hands of small boys. We wound up putting the mattress on the ground for sleeping purposes, and putting the ladder out of harm's way. Another problem was with the bathroom. The bathroom has an elaborate and unlabelled shower fixture with 4 knobs and, if you can imagine, parrallel rows of vertical spouts aimed directly at you as well. One cannot turn on the shower without standing inside it, and therefore gettting wet. The getting wet part is guarenteed by the parent's attempts to identify which knob is doing what while water is spraying the back wall and flooding the bathroom floor. To ensure flooding, the shower is protected by only half a glass wall, with the rest being wide open. Our kids loved the shower as it comes close to becoming a water slide if turned on full blast. The shower floor itself is slick as butter when wet, and there are no handles with which to steady oneself. My son solved this problem by lying on the shower floor and sloshing back and forth with ease. Naturally we ran out of toilet paper in the early morning, since supplies are more appropriate for 2 adults, The upsides are, as has been said, the closeness to the Seville stop on the Metro, and the good internet service. The hotel is clean and secure, and probably would be fine for independant young adults with good balance and handeye coordination.
