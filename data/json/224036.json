The bed, mattress and pillows were all in good shape and comfortable, no noise from neighbors next door or cars or constructions outside. I slept through the whole night, but heater can be a bit noisy for light sleepers. Bathroom is quite small but served its purpose with no problem. Hot water available for the duration of my shower with good water pressure. The location really cant be beat only steps away to Magnificent Mile and most attractions are within walking distance.

The front desk staff, the concierge, and the bellhops were all so friendly and helpful. After check out, I had to store our luggage until my husband was finished with the business portion of our trip, and the staff was exceedingly accommodating. I hung out in the lobby for about an hour after I'd exhausted my shopping gene, and was offered ice water or a snack - even though we were no longer officially \"guests\" of the hotel. One of the guys flagged a taxi for us, even helping load our luggage. If you check a Google-earth view, you'll see that this property is shaped like the letter C. The long (west) side of the building is the elevator and stair tower, leaving the inner part of the long side for four rooms, with an additional five rooms at the \"top and bottom\" of the C (on a typical floor). If you're unlucky enough to get one of the four rooms across from the elevators (as we were), you will have zero view unless you crane your neck. Even on the 12th floor, we could only see the blank wall of the high-rise next door. In a city of tall buildings, though, this is pretty typical. Not sure any of the other rooms had better views, either, but judging by window placement, I'd assume and hope they do! The other issue with being across from the elevators is the associated noise. I realize that can't be helped, and the hotel isn't responsible for inconsiderate guests! So - if you go, and your room number ends in 06, 07, 08, or 09 - ask for a different room, unless you don't mind being directly across from the elevators. The elevators open into the hallway - there's no elevator lobby - so it's quite a cramped area. The main floor lobby is decorated in a very modernist style, with funky furniture and lighting. It's looking a bit worn, but it is extremely clean. The second floor has two guest rooms, a fitness center, and the breakfast room. The breakfast area, which is located at the bottom of the \"C,\" is large by typical \"free breakfast area\" standards, and a great selection of food is provided: fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, waffle irons, breakfast sandwiches, boiled eggs, several types of bread, coffee, juice... Long windows overlook Ontario Avenue. Our room, which was typically sized, had two double beds, a side chair, desk with task chair, and a dresser/tv stand combo. The \"closet\" was really only a shallow niche in the wall next to the bathroom. The bed was OK - had up-rated linens and lots of pillows, but it seemed uncomfortable to us. The orange (just letting you know it's BRIGHT) carpet was extremely worn, but seemed clean enough - even though an orange TicTac was on the floor under the window both nights of our stay. I can easily see how that would be missed by a cleaning crew - same color as the carpet, but does this mean they don't vacuum thoroughly? As I was packing to check out, my foot \"bumped\" something under one of the beds... A half-full liter-sized bottle of Coca Cola. Really? How long had that been there? We don't drink Coke, so it definitely wasn't ours... And the beds are on platforms, so there's only about 6\" of space under the dust ruffle of the beds. Again - vacuuming??? A vacuum would have surely dislodged the bottle, as my foot did... I'd consider staying here again, but I'd check the room thoroughly before unpacking!

We were really disappointed about the NYC trip interruption, as my sister has never been to NYC, and we had so many plans, but we love Chicago, so we decided to vist an old favorite for the weekend to make up for the disappointment. Did we ever make the right decision! We visit Chicago on a regular basis - usually once at Christmas time and once in the summer -- as a halfway meeting point, as my sister lives on the west side of Illinois, and I live in mid-Michigan. We usually stay in The Loop area at the Palmer House Hilton, but we decided to try something new for this last minute trip. We booked the Fairfield Inn on Ontario Street because its rates were very reasonable, and it is a really nice location for those who want to hang out on the Magnificient Mile and at Navy Pier and the Ohio Street and Oak Street Beaches and the Lakeshore Trail. The rooms were smallish, but very nice, bright, clean, quiet (even though our room was across from the elevator), the flat-screen TV was huge and had great resolution (although we spent almost no time in the room except to sleep, we did check up on Hurricane Irene every now and then). We were very pleased with the accommodations. And the accommodations were nothing compared to the staff -- the staff was really, really wonderful!! We want to thank Monica, Janet, and Charles, who could not have been more friendly or helpful, and, in particular, we want to say thank you to Kenneth, the \"handsome guy behind the desk,\" who, when he learned that it was my sister's 50th birthday celebration (she doesn't look age 50 at all), demanded to see her drivers' license as proof, which tinkled my sister PINK. Kenneth went out of his way to make sure she had a memorable visit. He sent a happy birthday note to our room, with a \"free pizza\" gift card to Quartino's on State Street, and a 2 \"get in free\" passes to Howl At the Moon dueling piano bar, and he found us a really nice rate that allowed us to stay an extra day longer than we intended, because we were having such a good time!

About 12 hours after checkout, I discovered with great anguish that I had left my entire bag of jewelry in the hotel room. Although my initial call to the night desk staff was less than reassuring or satisfactory as that conversation in no way helped to reduce my panic over the lost jewelry, my contact with the hotel manager and housekeeping management the next morning went beyond my expectations. In a perfect world, since all hotel reservations are made with guest phone numbers and e-mail contact, I would have been contacted by the hotel when my jewelry was found, even before I discovered the jewelry missing, and perhaps procedures are in place that that would have occurred the next day. Regardless, as it turned out, Angelica (yes, a true angel), is a member of the superbly-trained housekeeping team at the Fairfield Inn and Suites, and demonstrates that this large-city hotel actually cares about their guests. Upon finding my jewelry in my room, Angelica saw to it that every item was routed for safekeeping. By arrangement with the hotel manager, my daughter-in-law arrived the next day to claim my items and the hotel staff took several steps to ensure her identity and authority before turning over my items to her.

I picked this hotel because of the location and the price. It was fabulous! We arrived at 3:00. The valet area is small (fits 3 cars at any one time) and even though Ontario St is one way, it can get busy. We lucked out that as soon as we arrived two cars pulled out of the valet and we were able to park. Bell services came to help when they noticed how much stuff we started pulling out of the car! We were able to check in right away and got a double room on the 6th floor (out of 15). Bell services followed us up with our luggage cart right away. We were a little surprised at how small the room was (in comparison to what we usually stay in, but then again, this is Chicago downtown, you couldn't expect any more, especially at the rate we got). The view was of the back end of the hotel, and overlooked a roof top and the ventiliation system. Not a pleasant one, but we didn't spend any time looking out the window. The bathroom to the right was adequate, clean and brightly lit. The two double beds were comfy, but small, especially since I am used to sleeping in a large King at home! The TV was a large LG LCD with digital channels! Fabulous! There was a desk area with a comfy desk chair. There is also one sitting chair in the corner. We loved the continental breakfast offered for free, on the second floor. We had make your own waffles, fruit cups, breakfast sandwiches (that you microwaved warm), oatmeal, cerals, bagels, pastries, hard boiled eggs(be sure to cut them up and then nuke them warm), juice, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. It was great to walk down and have a quick, free breakfast, and then head out for a day of sightseeing! We absolutely loved the location of this hotel. We walked towards Michigan Ave (less than 2 minutes) and at the corner was Garrett's Popcorn! My daughter always said that you could tell we reached our hotel by the smell of the popcorn. We saw line ups here every day, all day. We picked up some twice! We had dinner right down the street at Michigan and Ontario at the Grand Lux Cafe. We don't have Cheesecake Factory/Grand Lux chains in Canada, so it was a treat to eat here for us. We also walked to Giordano's (10 min) for great pizza and pasta! We also walked to Navy Pier from the hotel. On the way we stopped into Yolk for lunch. Another hot spot. The service at this hotel is stellar too. From the valet (always quick!), to maintenance services (we had to replace our hairdryer and he came up right away and gave us a brand new one when the one in our bathroom wasn't working), to front desk (who held our luggage for the afternoon). There is a computer with printer in the hotel lobby free for you to use. I also LOVED the FREE WiFi in the rooms! Not many hotels can offer this, but I was happy that this one did and I was able to stay in touch with friends and family from my room using my iPad.

We left for an early dinner a little bit later and a night on the town. After we got back to the hotel room, we found a birthday balloon, a personalized cake wishing her happy birthday, and a mini refrigerator waiting for us. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that the hotel clerks (Kenny and Carlos) would go out of their way to do something like this for their guests. She also received a birthday card signed by all of the staff working that afternoon/evening. The hotel is only a block and a half east of Michigan Avenue which basically is only a two minute walk. Just down the street is Garrett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Popcorn which we visited twice.

The Fairfield Inn & Suites is located in downtown Chicago--specifically Streeterville--and is close to the Magnificent Mile, the Water Tower, and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. In fact, our room actually faced the hospital and the sounds of ambulance sirens were heard throughout the night--if this sort of thing bothers you, you might want to specifically request a room on the other side. Otherwise, the room itself was clean and updated with flat screen tv, alarm clock with i-pod dock, and duvets on the bed. The duvet covers were a little on the thin side, but the bedding was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was pretty basic--certainly nothing fancy, but again, it was clean and everything worked properly, which is plenty for a brief overnight stay. We booked our room directly through Marriott's website and couldn't have been more pleased with the low rate--for a room in Chicago, it was definitely a good value. Valet parking with in and out privileges was included in this particular rate along with free wi-fi and free continental breakfast. The lowest rate at the time of booking (other than the one we selected) did not include parking but would be an incredibly good deal for those traveling without a car (the Red Line is a few blocks away). Parking is otherwise pretty expensive, so it's nice if you're able to travel without a car and save some cash. Be sure to look at all the available rates (standard, special packages, etc) when booking to see if there's anything more suited to your needs. I would definitely recommend this hotel to travellers who want to stay downtown without having to pay the usual high price for downtown convenience. I also want to add that the staff was really friendly and welcoming. After we checked out, we wanted to walk around a bit more and grab some lunch before heading out of town, so the front desk nicely stored our bags for us and we were able to keep our car parked through the valet long after check-out.

I knew I wanted to be fairly close to a subway so I could get back and forth to Wrigley Field easily. There were very few negative reviews (out of 80-plus) of the Fairfield, and the price ($141.55 for the AAA rate) was very reasonable for a major metropolitan area. That's about $50 or more cheaper than one would expect to pay for similar accommodations in New York City, for example. In reading the TripAdvisor reviews of the Fairfield, I noticed a few customers had complained about night noise from a Dumpster behind the hotel. So I called the hotel and spoke with a very helpful man named Corey who acknowledged the noise problem and also pointed out there was a hospital nearby the hotel that also shared that Dumpster. He said the way to avoid the noise was to ask for a high floor in a room facing the front of the hotel. I booked the room, and he noted my request for the high floor in the front of the hotel. He also gave me directions as to how to get to the hotel from O'Hare airport via mass transit. (When I got to O'Hare and asked an airport worker if the mass-transit directions I had from Corey were accurate, he said they were mostly accurate with one change, and he was right. But Corey's and the worker's directions involved only one train transfer, and it's possible that Corey's directions would have been accurate if one of the subway lines, the Red Line, had still been undergoing construction by the time we arrived.) The Chicago subway was easy to find at O'Hare, and I found it easy to navigate once in Chicago. All the lines are color coded, and that includes the station decor (walls, floor tiles, signage). You are never in doubt as to which line you are on; all you have to do is look around. The ride into Chicago from O'Hare took about an hour on the Blue Line. For $2, what could be easier? The Red Line stop at State and Grand is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. It did seem arduous on our way there, because we were tired and carrying luggage. We could have hailed a cab, but we were New Yorkers, and 10 blocks to us is nothing. We got to the hotel and were impressed by the cool, modern look of the lobby, with an ice-blue-and-white color scheme. We were checked in immediately by helpful front-desk people. (I met Corey later in my stay, and he was as helpful as he had been on the phone.) The room, with one king-size bed (not a suite), was small, as other TripAdvisor reviewers have noted. I wouldn't want to be cooped up in there with four kids, that's for sure. But it was just the two of us, so we didn't mind. We weren't there for the room, anyway; it was just a place to sleep. We were initially wondering whether the bed was in fact a king size, as it didn't look as big as one would expect a king size to look. I called the front desk to make sure, and the woman I spoke with said the bed was indeed king size. (When I got home and saw my queen size mattress, I realized the hotel's bed was in fact a king size, or at least it was bigger than my queen size.) The bed and pillows were comfortable and clean, my companion and I agreed. The room was spotless, and there was no peeling paint on the ceilings or walls. The shower--walls and tub--was clean. (Water pressure and temperature were both excellent.) No sign of previous habitation anywhere, actually. The counter space around the sink was limited, but this man and woman seemed to cope well. An iron and ironing board, coffee maker, and hair dryer were in the room. We asked at the front desk upon check-in for a fridge, and one was wheeled into our room within minutes of our arrival, and there was no charge for it. We were glad to have it. We asked at the front desk for directions to the Lake Michigan waterfront and Grant Park, and we began walking. It was about a 20-minute walk, picturesque in spots because you cross the Chicago River. Later, when we asked at the front desk for a recommendation for Mexican food, the nice guy we spoke with steered us to Lalo's on LaSalle Street, and my companion and I had one of the best Mexican meals we had ever had. Lalo's is apparently a local chain. The chips are served hot, and the veggie quesadilla comes with three stuffed soft tacos and beans and rice. Add a pitcher of iced tea and pleasant service for about $15 each, and you have an excellent restaurant experience. The next day, we asked for directions to the Chicago River boat tours, and we were directed by another helpful staff member for about a 15-minute walk. After the boat tour, we walked over to Navy Pier and spent the afternoon wandering around. I went to Wrigley Field via the Red Line, and that was easy to do and took about 25 minutes each way. My companion said she enjoyed shopping the Magnificent Mile, which I think is about a block or so from the hotel. One night (early morning), we couldn't get the air conditioning system to come back on, so I called the front desk at 5 a.m. The clerk said he would send someone up immediately, and five minutes later, a helpful security guy came up to look at it. He adjusted the thermostat on the wall (instead of using the control on the unit), and the air conditioning came back on. He said some of the units worked via the controls on the unit and some worked via the wall thermostat. But I thought it was impressive that the hotel would send someone up immediately, even at 5 a.m. Other than that instance, the air conditioning worked very well (it was 85-plus and sunny during our stay, so the AC was welcome). Our room was serviced efficiently by housekeeping, which we never saw. The TV worked and seemed to have a lot of channels, but we weren't there to watch TV. Checkout was quick and easy, and somehow the walk back to the Red Line to go back to O'Hare didn't seem as long, maybe because we knew where we were going by then. I would like to go back to Chicago someday, this time to see the White Sox play, and if I do, I know where I will be staying: the Fairfield.

The Fairfield is a not too this, not too that hotel. But they try hard. The hotel was small enough to feel intimate and not overwhelming. Check in: Our room was ready when we checked in and check in was very quick. Front desk staff: The front desk staff were professional, eager and friendly. They provdided correct, helpful info regarding bus schedules, local \"joints\" and even ordered a pizza for us late night. Room: The room was smaller than most hotels we stay at, but it was clean. Definitely a no frills hotel, but not a \"bargain\" style hotel either, just simple. I do have to say, the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in!!! Although we travel regularly, I usually dread hotel beds because of a bad back. The bed was perfect. The pillows seemed to be a mixture of regular and down pillows. Nice option. I'm not sure about the other reviewer's water pressure comment. Ours was fantastic. Continental breakfast: A bit crowded but that may be because it was a weekend. Again, the little hotel that tries hard atmosphere. They offered the usual coffee, teas, juices, milk, cereal, danishes, donuts, muffins, toasts, breads, oatmeal, yogurt and fruit. They also had hard boiled eggs, make your own Belgian waffles, breakfast egg biscuits. The staff did a phenominal job of keeping up on supplies as the crowds and masses moved through on a Saturday morning. Nice surprise: About 20 minutes after checking in, our hotel phone rang and it was the front desk checking to make sure everything was alright with our accomodations and room. I thought that was a nice touch. When they asked if they could get us anything, I asked for an extra pillow and blanket. It was brought to our room in less than 5 minutes. Also noteworthy, the windows to the outside were fairly sound-proof. Ontario is quite the busy street and we really could not hear much outside noise. Conclusion: A no-frills hotel that tries hard. Decent location. Good for a stay where you just want a clean hotel room to come back to and a very comfortable bed to lie in at the end of a day.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cLocation, and Breakfast are nice\u201d", "Author": "Bidderman9", "ReviewID": "UR16973401", "Content": "Pros: Location, Location, Location.

A call was made to the front desk and the pilows were promptly changed. One of the perks advertised was a daily newspaper deliverd to our door. The first morning we didn't receive a newspaper we were told it was probobly stolen. There was a newspaper at the front desk we could have, so I picked it up. The next morning we again did not receive a newspaper and I was told that the hotel orders the newspapers the month before and they hadn't ordered enough so only reward members received them. A few minutes later a newspaper was then thrown at our door so that the sections seperated. I called the front desk to thank her for the way the newspaper was delivered and I didn't receive a response. We received a newspaper the remaining mornings. This hotel is advertised as a non-smoking hotel. Our room smelled heavily of smoke so during the day we left the window open to air it out. The stale smoke smell was still just as heavy the day we left. The \"free\" breakfast was one of the best we have ever had. There was allot of variety and it was very tastey. The downtown location was good once you get used to the sirens. The room rate was very reasonable for Chicago.

In relation to other hotels, the $200/night list rate for this hotel isn't expensive but it is hard to get out of your head when evaluating the property. This was a clean, quiet hotel that is really nothing special. I've received similar accomodations at hotels under $100 in other major metro areas. Breakfast was good, though the space was crowded enough that I just took it to my room. Free wired high speed interest worked flawlessly. Those who have read my other reviews know I'm a light sleeper, and noise was not a problem at this hotel. I was right outside the elevator, but never heard it or any traffic noise other than the occasional siren. My only complaint was scarce bedding. Another blanket tucked in a drawer or in the closet area would have been nice when I work up in the middle of the night chilled. The shower had intermittent pressure, but it didn't affect the temperature and the low pressure lasted less than five seconds. Even the low pressure was enough to shower by, so it was more amusing than annoying. The hotel is six blocks from the nearest subway station (Red Line). If you are looking for subway convenience in the same area of town, there is a Holiday Inn Express right across the street from the local station. I am not sure I would stay here again for a similar trip, though I have no complaints about the hotel.

And for the price and the location, it's a winner. For service, it's a bust. So if you need a clean, comfortable, well located place to flop in the middle of everything in Chicago, this is it. If you're looking for the slightest bit of help from the staff, go elsewhere. What a great location. Walk out the front door and your steps away from much of what makes Chicago great. And the room is everything you would expect from a Fairfield Inn, with the newer bedding and towels. And for being in the middle of the city, the room was very quiet. What great plusses. Nonetheless, I did have a significant problem with the staff. Details for those that want backstory: I needed something for the room that was noted in my Marriott profile, this particular reservation, and in another box that pops up when I stay in a Marriott property. Just to be on the safe side, I called the hotel earlier in the day I was arriving and doublechecked with the Manager who assured me the request had been done. When I checked in at four in the morning after the flight from heck, of course the request had not been done. When I complained to the Manager the next day, he told me that was because they didn't know I was coming. This was a lie, as my Marriott Platinum gift was in the room, with my name on it. My daddy always taught me, never believe someone who lies to you. So my warning to anyone who wants to stay here is it's a good hotel so long as you don't need the slightest thing from the staff. Obviously, there is a say-anything, do-nothing environment at this property.

They all gave you the feeling that they were happy that you were there. The room - It was not elaborate, but very nice and SPOTLESS. The bed was comfortable, and there was plenty of room to move around. And quiet! I know we had neighbors, as we could hear them when we were in the hall, but once we were in our room, it was quiet! The breakfast - It was terrific! We had fresh waffles for breakfast - it was such a treat. They also had cereals, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches, donuts, bagels, and oatmeal. The only thing I would improve was the coffee (but there is a Starbuck's at the Courtyard diagonally across Ontario!) The location - Really great - about 2 blocks off of Michigan Ave., it is REALLY easy to walk to the best shopping areas, and to some great restaurants (Capital Grill is next door, and Cafe Coco Pazzo is just across the street).
