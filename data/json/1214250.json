This is first one, where I would not stay even for free again. Semi trucks parked all around the property blocking 4-5 spaces at the time, when the dog show is in town, and management couldn't tell drivers to park at much bigger parking lot near by? Bad management. Dirty rooms? Bad management. I was checking out when guest was complaining about the same things. No blankets? The old paper thin throw was a bit thicker than bed sheets. Bathroom was looking just as rundown, with patched up holes, scratched bathtub... place is not getting any handyman's attention. Bad management sucking all the money out without doing any upkeep.

This hotels high speed is decent, the tvs are nice, in fact, it was nice to have the option of the \"theme\" on the tv which was the moon over the ocean with the sound of waves.

Also, if you are military, they will give you a discount. The front desk was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was basic - waffles, eggs, breads, muffins, fruit, yogurt, and drinks.

The property has become very rundown, and seems to be the new place to stay for truck drivers that are awaiting their next assignment from a depot located down the street. Our room was not very clean, and the carpet was very worn and dirty. I had to take a towel and wipe hairs off the vanity when I went to use the sink....ewwww. Also, there seemed to be random people always walking around the parking lot. My husband was approached by someone asking for money!! There is a Steak and Shake located directly behind that is open 24 hours; not sure if this had anything to do with it. We returned from our evening around 12:30 a.m. and there was a group of four guys hanging out by the main entrance smoking. Also, the breakfast bar left ALOT to be desired.

There is a gas station right by the motel, and a ton of restaurants within walking distance -- Wendy's, Denny's Steak and Shake, Cracker Barrel, Outback, and a few others. I think I might have seen a Joe's Crab Shack sign. Check-in and check-out were fast and friendly. The room and hallways were clean and the furnishings -- bedding, carpets, etc. -- were all very nice. The TV only had a few channels. The bed was pretty comfortable, and the wireless Internet was very good, even though I was at the end of the hall on the top floor. My room was on the front side of the hotel facing Post Road, I-70, and the I-70 entrance ramp, so there was a little bit of noise but it wasn't too bad. You may want to ask for a room on the back side which I would expect to be very quiet. Oh, did I mention the price is great? The quality of the motel is not quite up to the standards of a Hampton or Holiday Inn Express, but it was very good -- better than the vast majority of Super 8s or Days Inns -- and for the price (around 60 bucks with tax) I would call it a superb value in Indy.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "djkrun", "ReviewID": "UR66526453", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed.

We checked in at 10:30 p.m. and went to bed. The next morning, my husband and son went out to the Van to get ready to leave. When my husband unlocked the van, he immediately noticed that our van had been broken into over night. These thiefs broke into our van by using some type of tool to punch our key hole out and then somehow got the door open. They ripped our dash completely off in order to steal our Pioneer stereo/navigation/back-up camera/XM stereo and amplifier (worth $4000). They then proceeded to tear up our van and found my husbands camera equipment ($14,000), rifled through every compartment imaginable and stole an IPOD, my daughter's bookbag with all her books and homework, my son's never worn brand new pair of NIKE tennis shoes, his personal competition bag with all of his gear, etc. Of course, when we told the front desk people, they were very courteous and helpful and said that they were surprised something like this happened. The police officer who came and took our report said that things like this happen at this hotel frequently and cars continually get broken into at the Cracker Barrel across the parking lot at least once a week. He said there are thugs all over the area that break in just to pawn the stuff for pennies on the dollar to get money for Crack!! When we checked in, I did notice a very young \"rent a cop\" in the lobby...apparently he doesn't patrol the parking lot like he should. This place knew they had a problem because I talked to another employee who admitted that was the reason they had a \"rent a cop.\" There are NO Security Cameras anywhere on this property. There should be. Although, we were not able to park in front of the hotel, we did NOT park in the back. We parked right under a very bright light on the front side part of the hotel. My husband was furious beyond belief and my kids were scared to death! Despite all of this, my son made it to his competition, had to borrow some stuff to compete....we were going to stay until Sunday, but we drove half way home to Bowling Green, KY and stayed in a very nice La Quinta Security Cameras everywhere). Before we picked a hotel in Bowling Green, we personally talked to a Bowling Green police officer to make sure we were in a safe city.
