{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Stay away This hotel is right in the middle of the redlight area in Frankfurt and does not feel safe at night.The hotel is very basic and not pleasant at all. The area around it is frequented by people who appeared to be under the influence of drink and drugs and also has a large amount of sex shops and sex cinemas, there are also prostitutes on some of the street corners.DO NOT BOOK TO STAY HERE! You can get better safer hotels for the same cost if you look around.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR372305137", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "grimnod1"}, {"Content": "You get what you pay for... The hotel is one block from the red light district - and close to several bars  pubs... so if you are planning on partaking in this form of entertainment - the hotel is OK. If you plan on spending more than 4 or 5 hours in the hotel - find someplace else. The rooms are small, but clean. The amenities are limited (13 TV, very small desk). No parking except on the street or the praking garage down the street (27 Euro)...", "Date": "Mar 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR233469833", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "frankll1a"}, {"Content": "I agree - you get what you pay for Just returned from 1 night in Frankfurt. Yes, you are in the red light district and yes it is safe. The hotel itself is very simple, everything seemed to be valued at the rate I paid - $80 for a Sunday night with buffet breakfast.Particulars on the room - reserved a room for 1 person. The room was pretty small, maybe 70 sq ft with a small window. The bed was a European single (smaller than a US twin), with only 1 pillow (I usually like to have 2-3, but that's just me). Certainly not a Heavenly bed, but did the trick. The TV was maybe a 13 inch screen, smaller than my laptop. There was a small safe in the room and it appeared to be moderately clean. The best surprise was FREE WiFi (though there were also kiosks in the hauptbahnhof 2 blocks away with limited free access - couldn't tell how they make money).BTW, I don't think the room had AC, but there was a fan in it. I would guess the room would be pretty uncomfortable in the hot summer months.The bathroom was ok, though almost as big as the room, with a small shower. Some toiletries - bar soap, shampoo/shower gel.The buffet was edible. Scrambled eggs, meatballs (more like sausage pattys), and baked beans were the hot foods. Also had cereals, fruit, and salad bar/cold cuts. Pretty standard.All in all, it's a little better than a hostel as you get the privacy, but not sure how this place is considered 4 stars. In the US, it would get 1 or 2.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR944372350", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "IMPCTraveler"}, {"Content": "you get what you pay for This was a very basic hotel, but you get what you pay for.I stayed there with my 2 daughter aged 10 and 13.

The room we were supposed to stay in was so tiny, we booked for 2 adults and 2 children but there was only 1 double bed and 1 single with no room to put another bed. The room was dirty, with none of the ameanities we were told there would be. It is situated in what can only be discribed as Frankfurts red like district. The receptionist was next to useless and was no help what so ever. This hotel would only be suitable if you wanted the sort of hotel that rents by the hour, definitely not suitable for a family.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR879966057", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "maltesetraveller"}, {"Content": "Overcharged for Tiny Room We booked on line and received a confirmation listing the facilities the room would have.
