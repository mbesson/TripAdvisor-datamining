The hotel was well placed for us to walk to where we wanted to be and by taking a family room for \u00a3120 the four of us could afford to visit London. When I was looking at alternative accomodation most hotels would only provide 2 rooms so the cost was upwards of \u00a3200 for us. For the money we got a reasonable sized room with a shower / toilet. It was big enough and everything worked, other than a couple of light bulbs. It was reasonably clean. It was quiet and the beds, a double and something a bit bigger were comfortable. In the morning there was a table service breakfast with boiled eggs, ham, toast and jam and coffee. If you wanted more of anything you could have it. The food was basic but fine and there was plenty but limited choice. A note on car parking. after I think 7pm on saturday you can park your car free outside the hotel until early Monday am but otherwise you need to park it elsewhere. I paid \u00a325 to park in the car parking spaces the hotel has just over the road. It is an under ground car park and you need to ask for clear instructions on how to get in and out on foot. You drive in with a tag which the barrier recognises but you can not walk out the same way. You have to find the right door which is not marked up and use the tag to let you in to the flats above the car park. The staff we met spoke quite limited English but they did their best for us. I guess they don't earn a lot and we made the small effort to be polite and they were helpful. I think for what we wanted, that is a cheap place to sleep and have breakfast, it was fine. I can not imagine staying here for more than a few days. For London it is good value ( a one course meal for 4 cost \u00a350 for reference) and we would stay here again. We were in the new part of the hotel so can not comment on the rest of it but it seemed quite busy and I heard no complaints but it is basic.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Headcorn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "Leeofmani", "ReviewID": "UR123489161", "Content": "This hotel is very convenient for public transport, in a safe and pleasant area.

After we checked in at the Oliver, the first thing we did was to test the Wi-Fi. It didn't work, so we went downstairs and they said \"it might be working in 2-3 days.\" Then the manager came out and said \"Oh, my guy is coming in tomorrow morning and I guarantee 75% that it will be working tomorrow.\" We decided to check in (our mistake, admittedly) and took our bags upstairs, left them and went about our business for a couple of hours. While wandering around, we really decided that we had to have the Wi-Fi for my partner's coursework and that a 75% \"guarantee\" just wouldn't do it (turns out it was still not working the next day either). Before going out to dinner with friends, we went back to the hotel and informed the person on duty that we would be checking out, as the lack of Wi-Fi was a deal breaker for us. His solution to the problem was to call a hotel across the street and ask them if we could use theirs and have us pay the \u00c2\u00a35 for the service. That's right, he wanted us to pay for the Internet service he couldn't provide us with. After a considerable amount of discussion/arguing, the man told us that the manager would be in the morning and I would have to talk to him about having our charges reversed, as he had no power to make this type of decision. Frustrated, we set out to find another room in the Earl's Court area and were lucky enough to find one a few blocks away with in-room Wi-Fi and nicer rooms. We booked five nights and went out to dinner with our friends. After booking the other hotel (at a considerable premium), we went back the next day to talk to the \"manager.\" We explained the situation to him and he told us \"the terms and conditions state that you will be charged for two night's stay unless you cancel 48 hours in advance.\" We told him this was unacceptable, as the room did not have the amenities that were promised to us when we booked the room. I told him that there really was a simple solution to the problem: refund the \u00c2\u00a3320 he had charged my card, I walk out the door and everyone's happy. He refused. He then called Laterooms.com, who we booked the room through, to have someone tell us the terms and conditions. I told him that I didn't need someone to tell me the terms and conditions and that since he failed to provide us with a room that had the promised features/amenities, I was due a full refund. He continued to refuse to credit back my credit card and insisted that I pay for two night's stay. At this point, I asked him if the Wi-Fi was working. He said no, it was still broken. So here we have a hotel owner trying to charge me for a two-night stay in a room I never occupied and didn't have the promised services. After arguing with him for about an hour, we finally gave in and paid for one night's stay (\u00c2\u00a349) for a room that we never even slept in. Of course they never saw a cent of it, as I contested the charges with my credit card company. Absolutely mind boggling and the worst customer service I've experienced in my life. Lastly, the hotel touts \"renovations done in 2009.\" This is a lie. They did nothing more than replace some furniture, fix up the lobby and slap some new paint on the walls.

On contacting the Oliver, the receptionist sounded \"a mess\", not entirely sure of whether she could book us into a double room. following various phone calls, she finally manged to organise herself and get us in. 60 quid, not so bad considering the location for a double room. In hindsight, it may have been a large, or should that be enlarged single.. Our room was on the first floor, bonus, but on opening the door I was greeted with what can only be described as a nuclear heat wave. Ah well, I thought, maybe I'll open the window... NO CHANCE! Window was the size of a small child and utterly smattered in pigeons poo. I arrived late at night so didn't quite understand the reason for this until the next day. Opening the barely locked window, I discovered it looked out onto the side of the building. In this alleyway there was not one, not two, but three pigeon's nests and spikes to prevent said pigeons. As well as mounds, and I mean mounds of more pigeons mess. Utterly vile and completely unhygenic. I'm quite surprised one of the little blighters didn't come in for a nose around. Breakfast, we were told was served from 7.30 to 9.30. As our night's sleep was interrupted by various sirens, traffic and the unberably hot room preventing us from getting any rest, we slightly overslept and got to breakfast at 9.20. Reasonable I thought, oh no. We were ignored until 9.35, at which time I had to attract the waitresses attention with a polite \"excuse me, can we order some breakfast?\" She glared at the clock, about to completely refuse my offer when I again politely informed her that we had been sitting there for 15 mins. She disappeared and slammed down our new cutlery and plates and informed us of the varied and high quality choice of breakfast which was egg or cereal. The manner of this particular waitress was utterly inexcusable, she treated us as if we'd just slaughtered a small puppy. Not 5 mins later, an elderly couple appeared, confused as to what time breakfast was, and at one point it seemed that she was about to refuse them food. Luckily they were fed the same high quality rubbish that we had. And all on my 24th birthday. Utterly disgraceful. Give this place a wide berth in future.

The staff friendly and nice and from the outside really nice to look at. However, when we got in, you could smell the damp and it was really old fashioned and grim. Ordered three rooms - one single, two twins. The twins smelt of damp as soon as you opened the door. Ther was not a proper shower in the bathboom. The bathroom did look modernised but I felt nervous about having a wash in there and so did the others as did not look clean. The rooms were boiling even though the raditors weren't on so we had to leave the windows open which caused alot of noise from the traffic which went on all the night. The beds were hard and it had an awful rough blanket on which didn't look or smell clean so that was off putting. Came back from a show wanting a cup of tea went into the coffee/breakfast room and the cups were dirty, the kitchen was unclean, the kettle was dirty and the tea and coffee were left in maragine tubs which did not look attractive or like I wanted to drink from it. So I didn't have a cup of tea which I was really disappointed about Managed to sleep relatively okay despite the TV next door being contanstly on and the noise of the traffic. Was really looking forward to my breakfast as it boosted of a contential breakfast. Which in my mind is croissates, smoked ham, yogurt, selection of breakfast cereals. No, we got an apple (no choice) slammed on the table, rubbish and vile orange juice, was offered cereral which was really cheap and was left unopened over night as I saw it in the kitchen the night before. The tea and coffee were in old fashioned and dirty teapots. I hated the breakfast and so did the young people. You had no choice. We also was offered an egg. I think in total the breakfast per person was \u00c2\u00a31 worth of the money you paid it was really poor! Overall, I was really disappointed because for the young people it was there first time that they went to London and stayed in a hotel. These young people are homeless and there hostel and standard of living is better than that living in a YMCA than the hotel. Also myself and my work collegue had flea bites when we got up so we have to get some ointment. It was from the hotel because we did not have them before we entered there!!!!
