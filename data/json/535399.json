We could not believe the quality of hotel compared to a British 3 star. It was spotlessly clean and we think it may have been previously redecorated in places as the flooring throughout seemed to be new and different to the pictures (tiles throughout reception/hallway and laminate in bedroom). The bathroom also seemed to have all new tiles and the shower was lovely and powerful... as well as hot! There was also a bidet in the bathroom. The hairdryer was a bit odd and looked a bit like a hoover stuck to the wall but it seemed to do the job :) We were in room 53 and although there was traffic noise from outside this doesn't bother us as we are from London anyway and use to this! Clean towels and bedding were put in the room everyday. The furniture was a sage green in colour and very traditional with painted flowers which we felt added to the character of the hotel! All drawers and wardrobe doors worked and there was a mini fridge in the room as well which we used to keep the water cool. It is true that breakfast was limited with white bread rolls, ham, cheese, selection of pastries, cornflakes, tea, coffee and juice. However, it was all fresh. Just would have been nice to see some fruit and yoghurt as well! All in all, we had a lovely stay in this hotel and it is central to absolutely everything! We could reach the trevi fountain in 15 minutes and the colosseum in 25 :) We would definitely stay here again if we were to visit rome!", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing end to our holiday\u201d", "Author": "MrMrsHill", "ReviewID": "UR122288578", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for the last leg of our Italian Honeymoon and we would never go back again.

We enjoyed our stay in Rome but were dissapointed with almost everything with Augustea. You don't get what you pay for - you get less. The rooms are pokey and breakfast is a cop out. We weren't made aware that the hotel liked you to hand in your keys when you left and went out for the day until our 2nd day here. We handed in our key regretfully. Our personal items that were left in our bathroom including bags of dirty washing, toiletries and reciepts on surfaces had been thrown away, causing us inconvenience and added costs. When this was addressed to them they did not do anything to help or even apologize just shrugged their shoulders. We purchased expensive souvineers from the Vatican City which had 'gone missing' You don't want to have to incur more costs because of their poor hospitality and poor cleaning staff. I would go back to Rome but use another hotel, extremely dissapointed - they could have easily made our stay more enjoyable but chose not to. Poor customer service Mini bar very, very expensive mould on the ceiling, shower doors dont close properly, had to clean the toilet and wash basin ourselves before using it as it was dirty. I wouldn't trust leaving our passports in the room as anything can easily be taken and with the language being a barrier you will not get your possesions back, you will be worse off financially and your trip won't be stress free. left a bitter taste in our mouths The trevi fountain, vatican, Colusseum, Forum and Emanuelle Memorial were amazing.

Really quick check in, although the hotel didn't have any form on life inside getting to the room was easy enough with a small case. The road you are based on was great. There are shops, restaurants and bars so plenty of choice if you dont fancy walking far. The hotel is a 10/15 minute walk away from the fountain. If you come out and turn right to the gallery and turn right again through the tunnel the fountain is down the cobbled street on your left. We did a sightseeing tour and the stops were in great location to the hotel as it stop and the station a 2 min walk away. Breakfast at the hotel was simple, tea, coffee, waters and juice were provided along with bread rolls, cornflakes and a few cake bars, but did the job. There is a mcdonalds just outside the hotel should you want something more filling. We were lucky enough to have an ensuite in the room which some didn't have. I had emailed the hotel before i travelled and requested this so might be worth doing? The hotel was dated i wont lie, but i had a great time.

Though we were clearly pleased to have somewhere to stay for the night without too much trouble, some problems emerged once we had accepted the room (described as a \"suite\" - maybe the same as the\"apartment\" described in another review). 1. The major problem was that the air-conditioning did not work at night. We were therefore very hot and slept badly before the long (2-day) trip back to Australia. 2. The second one was that the room was in a sort of annex, and someone locked the door from the outside, so that we could not get out, and had to call reception to be let out. This door was the fire exit. There was another door indicated on the plan also to be used as a fire exit, but this was locked with a key which we did not have. Therefore in the event of a fire we would have been trapped - there were bars on all the windows. Since it is clear that fire regulations for hotels are very strict in Italy, this was not only potentially dangerous but also likely to be illegal. We were very unhappy about staying in a hotel where this was possiblke 3. A third problem was that the area that we were given was not private - the connecting room between bathroom and bedroom had a glass door to a public area, covered with a curtain, but which was on the OUTSIDE, so any passer-by could draw back the curtain and look in (which they did). The hotel was not up to the general standard we had expected, with narrow dingy corridors and a generally poor standard of presentation (though the room itself was OK).

There is lots to do on Via Nazionale and on the surrounding streets if you don\u2019t feel like going too far from the hotel at night. The hotel is also in a great location for traveling around Rome- there is a very close subway stop within 1 block and a major transportation hub only 3 blocks away. I stayed with my husband, parents and grandfather for 1 week. We originally booked 2 rooms (1 for me and my husband, 1 for my parents and grandfather), but when we checked in they put all 5 of us in the \u2018apartment\u2019. I was not thrilled; as I would have preferred my own room, but the \u2018apartment\u2019 had 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a little pull-out bed for my grandfather. However, when we returned to the US, we found out that booking this 1 room would have saved us a lot of money over booking the 2 smaller rooms. That was somewhat disappointing, because I feel like we got the \u2018bait and switch\u2019 but expedia took care of us and gave us some credit coupons and a small refund. The overcharge was over $500. Be careful and make sure that you are getting what you paid for. As a side note- you should really watch what you pay for everywhere in Rome. I have never been \u2018overcharged\u2019 so much in any other European city- or anywhere else in the world. I don\u2019t know what the deal was, but for 3 of our meals the waiter would throw on some mystery charge, or conveniently add up the total incorrectly. When we would bring it to their attention, they would fix it- but it was just so sneaky! I\u2019ve never had this happen before. The breakfast was a little less than average. Every morning they had really hard rolls, glazed croissants, corn flakes, and deli ham. They had milk, pineapple and orange juices, coffee, and tea. I know European breakfasts are smaller, but this breakfast was still a bit lower than average in comparison to other European hotels that we have stayed at. The hotel clerks were nice, not overly friendly, and able to give good recommendations and advice when requested. This is the perfect balance for me- I don\u2019t want to be your best friend, but I appreciate good advice when I ask for it. On a scale of 1-10, the beds were about an 9 in hardness (10 being the bed I slept in while in China were it actually didn\u2019t bounce when you sat down on it- you just kinda smacked the mattress like sitting on a rock). If having a very hard bed is a deal-breaker for you- don\u2019t stay here. My grandfather\u2019s pull-out bed was much softer than the real beds. Because the apartment is very far from the street, noise was not a problem for us. It was very quiet. The maid service is OK. You get clean towels everyday, and they make the bed but that\u2019s it. No picking up trash or cleaning the shower or toilet or anything. The room was very, very dusty but clean otherwise. The rooms each had a mini-fridge (which was filled with mini-bar stuff, so no room for anything else), a hairdryer (typical hotel weak voltage- bring your own if you actually need to dry hair), a little flat screen TV, and all the typical stuff of a hotel room. No alarm clocks or wakeup calls, but my mom thinks that the flat screen TV may have had an alarm setting. Overall, a good hotel at a decent price (especially if you get the rooms you paid for!).

The only way they could have got their 3-star rating is through bribery! My experience: I saw this hotel on my company business travel website, when I called up to book I was given a much, much higher tariff than the one I was expecting. When I told them I was entitled to a special rate, they stated the one they had just quoted was indeed the \"special\" tariff, \"just for you\". So I used my company website to book at the lower price. Based on the photos on their website and the fact that it was 3-star, I expected a simple, unpretentious hotel. I do a lot of backpacking as well as business travel, so am used to a wide range of accommodation, but I was shocked to be shown to a tiny, smelly room which felt positively suffocating. I asked to see other rooms: they all looked dusty, old, unclean, with peeling wallpaper and a suffocating smell of damp and dust. I politely explained to the receptionist that I would be unable to spend the night there, and kindly asked to be given back my passport so I could leave. The receptionist seemed to take this as a personal affront, getting very agitated and going from bullying to mocking to mildly threatening, saying it was too late and I would have to stay there now that I had booked with them, that I would be unable to find another room in the whole of Rome, that I could not leave until the manager had been called, etc etc etc. I'm Italian but have lived abroad for so long that my accent may sound foreign to a Roman, however I am in no doubt that the guy's patronising attitude and language was also due to the fact that I'm female. At this point I stopped being kind and polite and raised my voice demanding my passport back, then just left. Luckily I knew another hotel 10 mins from there, a more expensive 4-star hotel, as it was past 11pm I decided to spend one night there and look for cheaper accommodation the next morning. I later learnt from Roman colleagues that Via Nazionale is not a very good area for hotels and were not surprised by my experience. Other details: to get to the Augustea you enter an anonymous-looking doorway which looks more like the entrance to a dodgy bar (or brothel); then you go up two flights of stairs covered in worn beige linoleum... definitely not 3-star standard.
