The first, out on Via Salaria became a private residence and so we booked for the Quatro Fontane and stayed there quite happily five times until they pulled a fast one on us. This was doubly needling as we had been warned on Venere reviews that this particular scam was not uncommon at this hotel. Needless to say we never went there again and instead chose the Alexandra on Via Veneto. Once again we were happy enough to stay there on four visits to the city. However we decided, not for any reasons of dissatisfaction, to try somewhere else a little nearer the centre. We chose the Hotel della Torre Argentina where we have just stayed for the fourth time. The hotel is spotless, the rooms are spacious and air conditioned. There is an attractive bar and a small, airy, light and elegant lounge with a selection of international newspapers. All rooms have Internet connection. The breakfast room can be unhesitatingly recommended, not only for its spaciousness but for the quality and range of food. There is a further added attraction to the Hotel della Torre Argentina for us and that is its situation. Not only are you but five minutes from Palazzo Venezia, Piazza Navona and the Fori but near to (on would be a better description) the Teatro di Pompey where one of the most important and far reaching events in European history took place. The nearby ruins have been excavated and consolidated and information boards surround the site allowing you to appreciate the scale of the complex. The area of the Teatro is huge but of course most has been built upon and the original ground level of the area has been raised considerably. However the breakfast room of the hotel is below modern floor level and there appears to be Roman work down there, both brick work, tufa blocks and pieces of decorative marble. This must be the only hotel in which I have stayed where I've photographed the brickwork! We visit Rome regularly and we can't really envisage staying anywhere else.

We were given a room on the second floor overlooking the alley to the left of the hotel. The room was very clean and tidy with a good size bathroom, although there was a slight \u2018drain\u2019 smell on occasion. We had no problem with noise during our stay. The continental breakfast was excellent with a good range of items. The best thing about the hotel is it\u2019s location, 25min walk from the Vatican and 20 min from the Colosseum. The worst thing is the centrally controlled air-con. On our first night, the weather was wet and humid which meant the room was too. We asked for the air-con to be turned on and were promised that it would be, but it wasn\u2019t. Fortunately, for the rest of the visit, the weather was dry and sunny so we did not require the air-con. Overall it\u2019s a good hotel with an excellent location to visit all the sights in Rome. How to get there Our flight was with easyJet to Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci di Fiumincino) airport. From there, take the Lombardi express train to the Stazione Termini which takes about 20 mins and should cost 14 Euro\u2019s each, one way. On leaving the train BEAR RIGHT and walk about 15 mins down Plat 20 ( I think) until you come to the main concourse and ticket area. Head towards the bus station and catch either the no 40 or the no 60, we got the no 40. You must buy your bus ticket before you board or you might have to pay a 60 Euro fine. We used the quick fares ticket machine and paid 4 euros each, however, if you find a Tobacconists, it should only be 1 euro each. You are supposed to verify your ticket on a machine on board the bus, but they are very crowded 24/7 so don\u2019t worry ( it states on the ticket that you have 45 mins to verify your ticket from boarding). The bus stop to return to the airport is directly outside the hotel front door, BUT the one you need to get off at on arrival is the stop where you have Temple ruins on your left ( Area Sacra) and a bookstore on your right with bright red signage and a road sign that says Largo di Torre Argentina. The hotel is on the corner opposite. Where to eat The restaurant next door to the hotel, Rossopomodoro, is good quality and reasonably priced, just right after a long journey. Taverna Antonina Recommended by another Della Torre visitor on this site, excellent food but expensive, near the Column of Victory. Vinallegro Recommended by our Angel\u2019s tour guide, good food and a very extensive wine list, the entire restaurant is covered in un-drunk bottles from floor to ceiling, located in Trastevere, off via Renella in a small Piazza. Angelino Ai Fori Our personal favourite. Good food and good prices, with a waiter that said \u2019Oh Yes\u2019 to everything that you said. Located at the junction between Via dei Fori Imperiali and Via Cavour, opposite the forum of Augusto. Taberna Patricii et Plebei Did not eat here, just drinks, but the restaurant has a fantastic ceiling, located near the Trevi fountain on Via del Lavatore(!) Il Delfino Not a restaurant, but a caf\u00e9. The cheapest we found in Rome for coffee, opposite the hotel! One to avoid Although we received excellent service in all the restaurants and cafes we went to, there is always one to spoil it. This one is the caf\u00e9 on the upper level of the Colosseum metro stop. Poor service, rude staff and expensive fare. And lastly We went on three tours with Angel Tours in Rome.

The old Rome area is so quaint and \u2018other worldly\u2019 feeling that a minor drawback is walking out of the hotel right onto busy Vittorio Emmanuel, but as soon as you go a block north or south you are in the atmosphere of Rome that is so unique. The location is great, so very close to Pantheon, Campo de Fiori (highly under-appreciated area by the way) and easily walkable to Vatican, Forum, Colloseum, Trevi Ftn and on and on. The people working there were extremely helpful and assisted us in dealing with Air France and our lost bags (we hate Air France, but that\u2019s another story altogether). They also were helpful in us getting a cab to get our rental car, restaurant reservations, directions on taking the bus, and on and on. It\u2019s always great to get good service, and they provided it! The room was a decent size, esp for the cost and phenomenal location. Clean and comfy and room to spread out our bags. The bathroom was surprisingly large and certainly larger then most hotels I\u2019ve seen in Europe/Italy. Slight drawback on sound coming from our neighbor (next door or below, not sure), but it was only when he was clearly shouting on the phone or had his tv blaring which wasn\u2019t too often. Breakfast \u2013 No, they didn\u2019t have a full, gluttonous spread like your average Courtyard Marriott or what most Americans are accustomed to back home. They had the standard Italian breakfast which can be good and satisfying (plus not overeat) of yogurt, fruit, rolls, coffee, etc. They also did a nice job in putting it in a large room so it felt spacious and comfortable, so many Italian hotels have the breakfast room as an after that and cram it anywhere. I would certainly stay here again, although next time in Rome I may try to get a place not on the main road and instead on a quaint square to really capture and enjoy that magical essence of Rome. But, should that prove cost or quality prohibitive I\u2019ll happily return here!", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, decent hotel\u201d", "Author": "bucfan66", "ReviewID": "UR49963109", "Content": "Location is great....central to town, very close to Piazza Navona.

The 5 of us get to the lobby the morning we were to leave and were told by an extremely unfriendly desk clerk that we could not get a cab because there was a taxi strike. We hadn't looked at a paper or TV news program in days, so we had no idea about the strike. The hotel easily could have informed guests departing that day that they needed to leave plenty of time to make other arrangements in the event of a strike. Strikes occur a lot in Italy, but the response of the clerk was unbelievable. He didn't care at all how we were to get to FCU in time for our flight that morning. He told us to go out to the square, maybe we could catch a ride there - knowing full well that every cab in Rome was striking. We went out with all of our bags into the street, and begged someone to tell us how to get to the airport. The striking cabbies told us what the clerk couldn't be bothered to share - we had to take a tram and make a train connection to get to the airport. We barely made our flight, but I know that many people were stranded.

Enough room for a table and chairs and a view of the back of the Pantheon, a small part of St. Peter's Basilica and the Vittorio Emmanuele monument. Despite being on a busy street, being on the 4th floor and the double glazing of the windows was more than enough to keep the room quiet. Our shower did not drain that well and the bottom would collect water as we showered. Our room was tastefully decorated, a little worn but comfortably European with lovely cove ceiling and wonderful lithographs of ancient Rome. And the refrigerator was nice to keep our wine in to drink later on our balcony. The elevator does stop one floor below the 4th but the one flight of stairs up to the 4th floor is wide and easily managed. Being pretty well prepared we required little assistance from the front staff, but when we arrived I was immediately given a fax I was waiting for, without having to ask about it, allowing me to finalize some plans. That was nice. The breakfast was typical European, sparse but fresh and adequate for those not looking for typical American \"grand-slam.\" The bus stop really is right outside the door and often many people standing there that you have to wade through to get to the door. Really only a problem when you were burdened with luggage. 5 minute walk to Pantheon, Piazza Navona and a taxi station 100 feet outside the door.

Walking distance to almost everything, (10 - 15 minutes to most sites) don't think I would attempt the Vatican unless you are very used to walking ALOT. Very good breakfast. They did not tend to replenish some of the breakfast items that they ran out of, and we had to ask for replenishments. They did it with hesitation. Although the location is good and buses are right at the front door, some might think this very convenient, it is to a point, but it is always very crowded around the front door of the hotel and sometimes slightly difficult to get into the front door of the hotel. Some people got peturbed that you asked them to move in order to just get into the front door; typical Roman attitude...! Overall we liked the hotel pretty good. We have stayed at other hotels in Rome on previous trips that I liked just a little better, but the price is good, especially for the location. If my other two favorites were not available, I would not hesitate to stay here again! Room 312 was really good for a family of 4 - it was like a little apartment with a cute little balcony - no view though! Good choice if you are doubting other places. Just a little note - there is a relatively new \"attracton\", which is a movie on the history of Rome, last 2750 years. Its just down the street from the Vittorio Emmanuelle II monument and on the Via del Corso, its called the Roman Time elevator and worth seeing early on in your trip. Lasts about 45 minutes.

Get up early have breakfast from 7am and visit the city before the crowds and heat build up and the city is invaded by all those tour guides with the brollies and flags. St Peters Basilica is a must and the view of the city from the top was worth those 320 difficult steps (after the lift!) Book for a visit to Vatican Museums - they have a website - the queues are enormous! The Pantheon can be seen from the hotel roof top and is a short stroll away - beautiful. The Roman Forum, Colosseum are fantastic - a lot of crowds around, again go early or around about lunchtime to get into the Colosseum (all the tours go for lunch). If you are feeling like another climb but a short walk, the views of the Colosseum and Forum and City from Palantine Hill are well worth the effort. The birth place of Rome.
