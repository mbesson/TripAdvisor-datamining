We were shown three rooms, one more dismal than the next, and --because we were prepaid and couldn't escape--we finally settled on the least objectionable and quietest. Still, the bathroom was filthy and its walls afflicted with a thick black mold, the wallpaper in the bedroom was pocked and peeling, the curtain on the back window torn, the coffee-colored and obscenely stained blanket full of cigarette holes, and the bedsprings--evidently from Dickensian times--creaked ominously. During the entire four nights we spent there, certainly a Guiness record in wanton masochism, the room was cleaned not even once, and the sheets changed only on the last day. When the temperature plunged at night, we turned on the prehistoric heater, only to be met with a blast of stinking air; evidently the mold had invaded its innards. We are seasoned tourists, and this grim and grubby facility (to say hotel would be a ridiculous exaggeration) was by far the worst we have ever experienced. Fellow travelers beware! P. S.

As soon as you walk into the room you notice the creative work of solving problems needed to be fixed. The really ancient window which looks like it's going to break any second if a bird touched it with its wing is therefore so dirty that you barely can look outside. Not a problem since the view outside is rather obstructed with an old and run-down balcony. Not to mention the modern way the window's incapability of closing and opening it was fixed by a subtle paper bag that cracks the window open a couple inches resisting extreme weather conditions and not letting in any warmth during night. The moldy, off-coming plaster on the ceiling was professionally fixed with sellotape and nicely re-designed by letting some of it dangling. The color of the gum stuck on the floor leading to the bathroom indicates a high number of guests it probably brought domestic bless and the last deep-cleaning was done before some of us were even born. First impression of the bathroom was quite okay. The in-built in the wall shower head is ultra-flexible due to its lacking attachment and some loose screws (I recommend wearing a helmet in the near future using this shower). No doubt this hotel plays a leading role in the fight of global warming and environment protection! For the fact there's no hot or even lukewarm water guests shower less frequently and most of all much shorter. Who needs warm water to shower?! For those of you who like to clean their feet once in a while this hotel holds a special invention for you in store. If you got too cold feet to take a shower there's water leaking from a little hole on the outside of the toilet accumulating in front of the sink. This 'Eau de Toilette' presents a perfect way of keeping your feet fresh and 'clean'. If you're planning on staying with company, I recommend using the night as an opportunity to talk about everything under the sun since you won't be getting any sleep in this rather uncomfortable bed ( I got better sleep by spending the night on the bare floor).

Booking the hotel on the internet we thought that we had made a good deal: Quite cheap hotel, nothing luxury but just ok for a three day trip to London and at least very well located. Getting to the hotel, it was everything but a good deal. First of all the whole hotel was smelling. We got there in the morning and had to leave our luggage downstairs. The smell almost made us fall down the stairs. Coming back to the hotel at night we had to find out that our room was not only small but freezing cold, walls and bed covers just dirty and above all there was not even a window that could be opened. Just imagine yourself how much fresh air this room must have seen in the years or probably decades since the house was built... When complaining to the staff and asking for another room we stepped into the next problem: The staff did hardly speak any English. Finally we were promised another room for the last of our three nights - but unfortunately staff forgot about that again... Needless to say that the bathroom was not even cleaned once and our towels were not even changed once during our three day stay. I was planning to have a nice Easter weekend at London with my girlfriend, this hotel really spoiled our trip! We would have changed the hotel after the first night but due to the fact that it was Easter weekend all places at reasonable pricing were completely booked. Only few rooms at really expensive hotels were left, we were very close to spend around two hundred pounds per night for a room at another hotel...

As it would appear to be in common ownership, I have no doubt that was the case. On arrival at the Ivanhoe Suite, I found it to be closed down. A notice on the door asked guests to phone an 020 number. After doing so, I was told to go to the Berkeley Court hotel where I would be checked in and would receive credit for the taxi fare over. How I wish I had refused this offer... It is truly dire. I should have been suspicious when I was asked to pay for the room before I even got to see it.

Although the hotel is newly furnished (a couple of years ago) I do not think the bathroom has ever been cleaned! I had to ask for the sheets to be replaced as there were hair on them and the new ones had stains as well! The staff was not helpful at all, I had to carry 2 suitcases myself to the 3rd floor room via very narrow and steep steps!

The hotel is situated at the top of oxford street less than 5 minute walk to the shops. The nearest tube station is marbel arch and is extremely useful to explore london!! The hotel itself is very basic and the staff are fine. One of our rooms was an okay size but the other was very small and after a days shopping it becomes increasingly smaller with the bags clothes etc....!!!

Our booking paperwork clearly stated that we had breakfast included, when we asked about the time breakfast was served we were told that the hotel had not served breakfast for the past two years! There was no milk available with the tea and coffee making facilities and when we requested some milk we were told that there was none available! We were woken at 6.30am both Saturday and Sunday morning by a very loud sqeeking noise coming from the bathroom. This noise prevented us from getting any further sleep omce it had started. We were informed that this noise was due to a fault with the boiler and someone was coming to fix it...however no one came to do this during our entire stay! And to top it all off there was no hot water in the hotel from waking on Saturday morning until we left on Sunday morning!! The hotel isn't overly clean either. The staff are not very helpful and the management were unsympathetic to our complaint, did not offer any apology and refused to offer any acceptable financial compensation for the terrible service we expereinced. A \u00c2\u00a310 'goodwill gesture' hardly covered two distrubed nights sleep and no hot water.
