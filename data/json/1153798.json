{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Florence Youth Hostel - the best hostel I have ever stayed I stayed in the Florence Youth Hostel for two nights in September 2008. The hostel has a great location. It is very near to the bus and train station as well as all the interesting and the must-see places in the town eg. The Duomo, Piazza della Signoria, Uffizi. The hostel has a very friendly and helpful staff. The hostel is small but nice and very clean. The snow-white linen and towels are changed every day. I stayed in a shared room. The room has 2 levels, one bunk bed and one single bed downstairs and two single beds upstairs. A clean ensuite bathroom with good working shower. No hair dryers.I have been travelling a lot and I mostly have been staying in hostels. The cleanliness is the most important factor to me. From all these hostels I have stayed so far the Florence Youth Hostel is by far the best one.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR526202704", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "coconut_island"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1153798-r22140732-Florence_Youth_Hostel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "1153798", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
