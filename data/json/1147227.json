{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Live in a dorm... I can't imagine staying in this apartment community as a hotel. Dogs crap and pee in the hallways/stairwells. Management picks up crap in about a day and lets the pee dry because, well, because. Some hallways smell pissy and some have put up air fresheners to try and mask the smell. Tenants steal furniture and paintings off the walls. There are beer bottles left in hallways every weekend.The power has gone out 5 times in the past year (4 were for 12+ hours). When the power goes out, one elevator is out of service for 2 weeks. Security is pitiful, doors and gates routinely open. Last month the fire alarm went off at 3am and they couldn't get it shut off for 2 hours!Walls are paper thin you can hear neighbors having sex, yappy-dogs barking, music, etc. Speaking of noise, units that are near Wycliff hear a lot of fire department sirens day/night as Wycliff is a major route to the hospital.Overall construction is cheap. It tries to look sleek and modern but you walk in hallways and feel soft spots in the flooring. I shudder to think what's under the carpet (besides pee stains that is).", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR257676083", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Adult44"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d1147227-r20965456-NATIONAL_AT_2929_WYCLIFF-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "1147227", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
