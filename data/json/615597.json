This family-owned hotel is like staying at a good friend's home. The rooms are clean, pool is well-maintained and the owners and staff are just wonderful people. Dan's advise was critical and 'right-on' for our show choices and dining experiences while we celebrated being with our family members from around the country. A charming, clean and safe place to stay! We will be back next year for our 2nd family reunion in Branson. We LOVED this place!! I give THE GREEN MOUNTAIN INN in Branson, Mo. 5 shining stars!

We didn't want to travel home in the dark & found this hotel had good ratings on Tripadvisor. So we took the chance. The A/C works. It has hot water. Water pressure is normal. There is absolutely nothing fancy about this place. This is a Mom & Pop hotel; meaning you get one sheet on the bed & the bedspread is also your blanket. If you need more bedding there is more in the closet. There are waffles, fruit, cereal, etc for breakfast but we woke up too late to experience that. There is a pool in the middle courtyard, which I must say I like that better than being right next to the road. They do offer smoking & non smoking rooms, I was worried I'd smell smoke in my room, but I didn't. They do not want pets, but if you have one, I think they make you pay a deposit up front. Again, I wasn't thrilled staying in a place with pets, but I was desparate to get off my feet.

We have stayed at various hotels and even though they were nice, the hotel staff was always rude. At Green Mountain Inn, this does not apply. The staff was wonderful from the moment we booked our room. My dad has Parkinson's and cannot get up and down stairs well. The staff were nice enough to make sure we got a first floor room. When we let them know we probably wouldn't be getting into town until late, they were very accommodating. They even called us on our way down there to make sure everything was okay and find out if we'd still make it down that night. The room was VERY clean. You could eat off the floor! We were very pleased. Dad enjoyed the easy chair, he spent a lot of time reading there while the girls went shopping. The pool area was clean and well maintained. The breakfast was great! We loved Sandy's waffles and were stuffed when we set out for our vacation adventures. We also got to enjoy the company of the owners, who chatted with us and other guests during breakfast.
