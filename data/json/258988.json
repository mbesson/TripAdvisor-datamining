The balcony was locked, and anytime you want it opened you have to call reception to come and open it, and then call again for them to come and lock it?! Not happy, especially as a smoker! So i mainly smoked in the bathroom with extractor fan on! Also i remember cleaner walking into my room and then leaving when they noticed me when i was sleeping early 2 mornings. The out door swimming pool was lovely, no complaints there. I had one dinner in the restraunt which i found ok, i think 8 euros for just pasta. The bottled water was awful, so i shopped down the road. Rooms were cleaned daily. The most exciting thing i found about this hotel was the roof. its on the topfloor, but if you want a nice view of Rome i reccomend a trip to the top. There are big noisy machines at the top, not really a place advertised to guests to see, but was a lovely moment to find it. There was also a mini bus owned by the hotel that takes you free of charge to a few metro stations, but its quite awkward times, and the hotel is well out of the way of everything, nowhere near colosseum or trevi fountain. I wouldnt stay here again but it could of been worse.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCheap and Clean\u201d", "Author": "Stultum", "ReviewID": "UR102737754", "Content": "Decent cheap hotel in a quite suburb.

Whatever the distance \"as the crow flies,\" do not choose this place for that reason. Between the traffic and the inability of any cab driver to locate this incredibly creepy \"hotel,\" we were dejected and exhausted by the time we arrived...and felt even worse when we rang the security bell and stepped inside. There is no service to speak of. The hotel is not really even superficially clean - and five minutes spent looking around reveals everything from grime around the fixtures on the bidet to tea stains in the sketchy kitchen area. Furthermore, even though we had to pay for three people (and specified one was an infant) we were given a twin bed for our baby. Useless. We spent our last night in Italy thinking how anxious we were to escape. Dark...dreary...and in a bad neighborhood. Just pick someplace else.

Hotel claims to have four stars but there is no bar or restaurant, the breakfast included was the sorriest I have ever seen (lukewarm apricot juice, tiny boxes of Nutella and jam, no butter, muesli but no milk (except for one morning), dry toast and machine instant coffee). No safety box in the rooms, no swimming pool (well, that we knew when we booked). Happy that we always locked all the suitcases when we left the rooms, since we had a theft of some cosmetics from the bathroom. Took ages to find the hotel, driving from Ciampino with only printed instructions from Google Maps, no SatNav or anything, had to stop three times to ask for directions. Fortunately my husband knows some Italian. On the plus side, free shuttlebus to the train station (not in the evening), shuttlebus driver was nice.

My brother picked us up at Ciampino Airport after darkness had fallen and if it wasn't for him having GPS / Sat Nav I don't know how we would have found this place, it is really in a rundown residential area, the amount of graffitti has to be seen to be believed. They have a real problem with the hot water, we were 4 adults together and the water lasts about 1 hot shower and 1 lukewarm shower and then it's cold until much later when it's reheated the same amount, when we complained about this (and my sister in law speaks fluent Italian) we were met with the following: it's impossible, we must have ran all the water away, why not shower in the afternoon when the hotel is quieter!! They just won't accept there is a problem and are not interested in your stay. The room itself is bearable except for the kitchen area, the cupboard fixtures are old and falling apart (see attached photo), we had to ask three times to provide the missing cups, glasses etc. (it was always just on it's way !!) but the beds & TV & bathroom are ok with the exception of the above water problem and broken toilet roll holder, fairly clean too. Reception very unhelpful with directions to get into town, just a curt \"get the bus round the corner\" type of thing. We got terrific help from a local lady in the street though who showed us the bus stop to get. The bus is maybe around 5 or 6 minutes to the train station, the train is then around 15 to 20 minutes to this train's terminus, you then get another bus (like we did) or get the Metro to the centre of Rome taking around another 10 minutes so it is a bit of a haul to get there and back. On the way into Rome we spotted a Chinese restaurant not far from the bus stop at the hotel and we ate there at the end of our night and it was very good and excellent value for money compared to the City Centre. There must be much better places to stay in better locations than this place and this is quite simply the worst stay I can remember having, go elsewhere.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here\u201d", "Author": "STJ705", "ReviewID": "UR7172027", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel one year ago and I am finally able to write about my experience.

There are no decent restaurants in the area and the neighborhood was somewhat sketchy - there was a pack of dogs that barked outside for many hours in the middle of the night.

And it is in the middle of nowhere, and we did not feel safe. Upon asking the front desk of where we could find dinner, we were advised to go to the local grocery store. Once seeing our room, which was again advertised as 4 stars but looked like a cheap college dorm room with tile floors, we immediately called hotels.com to complain. We left the hotel within the hour, and paid another 50 euros to get to the Marriott Courtyard that was actually located within the airport vicinity and was listed at 4 stars.

I was confused by the review not being close to central Rome. However, the map on the location site put it about 10-15 minute walk from the train station and about a 15 minute walk to the Colosseum. So I booked it. Getting to Rome found me located more that 12 miles (18-20km) from central Rome. I needed to take a train and a bus to get there. Needless to say, I cancelled my reservation which they accepted for the three nights I was within the 24 hour cancellation period. However, even though they deceived me with their map, did not cancel me out for the first night. I think because of their deceit, I should not have been charged for the first night. They disagreed. I am not very happy with their management. Why should I pay for their deceitfulness?
