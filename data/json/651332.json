We stayed here 3 years ago with our two kids and had a fantastic time. This time it was just my wife and I and the experience was the same. From the great welcome back when we arrived on our water taxi to suggestions for dinner and things to see....The Palazzo Stern is the place to stay. We had a room overlooking the Grand Canal and we enjoyed looking out the large windows and watching the boat traffic go past. It is always amazing to see how many boats go up and down the canal and the hotel is in a perfect location to view the activity and also close enough to walk or ferry to any location in Venice. Roberto is one of the owners and a delight to meet. He and his staff run a first class hotel and I would suggest to anyone going to Venice. We just love it there and will be back as both the hotel and the city are so special. You will not go wrong staying here....I promise you.

I asked in advance to be given a room with a baby cot. This was supplied, but it was the worst possible room for a couple with a child. The room was split on two levels with a steep staircase in the middle of the room. This presented a safety hazard and extremely dangerous for a young child (no stairgates, obviously). We were really exhausted after a long journey to Venice with a young child, and this was a huge disappointment. I dont understand how this wasn't thought out. I asked for a different room, and the one that we were given was very small to be able to fit a baby cot in (they had to remove some furniture to fit it in). We were told that as the hotel was fully booked, this was all they could offer for the night. I was told though that there was a chance that we could move to a bigger room but this could not be established until the following day. Very frustrating as obviously did not know if i could unpack or not. Really difficult again, with a young child and all the things I needed from the bags. The following day, we asked about moving to a different room, as we had not heard, and we were told that we were too late, as all the rooms had gone as we had not asked that morning, despite being told the day before that we would be informed about whether we would get a new room. The staff admitted that a note had been left out to them about it. Obviously a huge misunderstanding. After a long discussion with them about this (which did feel like we were pleading), we were eventually offered a new room, which was lovely. I just wished we had received this in the first place. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any other couples with infant children to be offered that room as otherwise i would be really worried about it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think it's room number 102 from memory. It's on the ground floor reception level. I emailed the hotel 12 days ago asking them to not offer this room to people with a young child, and they havent bothered to respond. I dont want you to be disappointed. If you wait until you arrive at the hotel to find out that you have this room, there's a huge chance that you wont be able to move rooms due to the hotel being heavily booked. For couples without families i also wouldnt recommend it as it is very dark and has a tiny window, with a terrible view. I would strongly advise you to find out what your room number is before you go. The rooms do vary alot. The best rooms are on the second and third levels. My husband and I travel alot and I have never before written a review on tripadvisor, but this experience has made me feel compelled to write one. You will enjoy your stay at the hotel - if you're lucky enough to have the right room. ps the two philopino waiting staff that we encountered were amazing - they worked really hard, were always courteous and just generally went out of their way.

We were not disappointed. It was our 25th anniversary and booked a junior suite for three nights to celebrate. We were a little late in booking and could probably have done better on the rate had we booked earlier. That said, the hotel did not disappoint. The accommodation was bed and breakfast with a bar service throughout the day and evening. Breakfast can be taken in-room at no extra charge but the selection is obviously better in the intimate dining room or terrace if the weather is nice. Dinner is not served in the hotel but if it were to be needed for any reason then the hotel make it clear that anything is possible. For our 25th anniversary, a complimentary bottle of chilled Prosecco was waiting in the room. The hotel is an old Doge palace and retains an historic feel. The rooms are typically Venetian in furnishing and the bathrooms well equipped (ours had a jacuzzi bath). I know you don't go to Venice to watch TV, but for the sake of completeness it should be noted that English speaking news channels are limited to CNN only. WIFI Internet is available at a cost in room, and a PC with web access is on the first floor library area. The hotel's location on the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro district is perfect for many reasons. First and foremost it is on the Grand Canal between Rialto and San Marco. It is one of few such hotels that has a front terrace at water level on which to sit and enjoy the weather and Venetian life. Next to the hotel is the Ca' Rezzonico waterbus stop with services every 10 minutes north and south on the Number 1 route. There is also a 50cent Traghetto Gondole ferry crossing here too, across the canal, to the San Marco side, where there is a waterbus stop for the Number 2 route. The Rialto bridge is four stops north and San Marco is 4 stops south. The Ponte Academia is in sight of the terrace and the Gallerie dell'Accademia is just behind the bridge. The area to the west of the hotel is much quieter (campo san barnaba) than many other areas of Venice, well served by eateries and cafes and provides a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of other parts of Venice. The hotel booked tickets for us to a concert of the Interpreti Veneziani in the Chiesa di San Vidal. This church was a beautiful setting for a recital of Vivaldi's Four Seasons by this talented ensemble. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip.

The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice of hot and cold foods and the staff were always willing to help. Although this hotel is on the opposite side of the Grand Canal to a lot of the major sights such as St Marks Square and the Doge's Palace the location was not a problem for us. There is a vaporetto stop on the number 1 line just outside the hotel and it is only short walk to the Accademia bridge so you can be on the other side very quickly.

The curtains and the drapes looked little old but it wasn't really a huge concern for us. Our room and bathroom were always very clean. What I loved most about our room is the the huge windows and the small balcony that opens up to the stunning view of the Grand Canal. We were able to enjoy the view any time in the day while enjoying a glass of champage (complimentary upon our arrival) or coffee (complimentary for the entire the duration of our stay). The experience was almost magical! Some people complained about the noises from the vaporetto stop early in the morning but I must say it didn't even bother us one bit. The hotel looks absolutely stunning from outside and is definitely one of the most beautiful palazzos along the canal. The interior of the hotel is just as equally gorgeous. The deco is elegant and the extensive use of Murano glasses, vases, interesting mosaics everywhere adds to the ambience and Venetian charm. The breakfast room is really beautiful as well. Being our first visit to Venice, we found the location of the hotel cannot be more perfect and it is very easy to get to from the Santa Lucia train station on vaporetto. The neighbourhood is quiet yet charming and lovely to walk around day and night. There are many great restaurants along Calle Lunga San Barnaba which is only down the street from the hotel. Ca Rezonico vaporetto stop being right next door makes getting around on vaporetto extremely convenient. We were particularly thankful to the front desk who recommended that we buy a 2 days vaporetto pass as we did end up taking the vaporetto almost to all of the main attractions along the Grand Canal as well as to out to the Lagoon on the other side of Venice which were in fact some of the most enjoyable experiences while in Venice. The staffs at Palazzo Stern, from the front desk to the bell porter to the breakfast room were always gracious, polite, and couldn't be more helpful. We requested hot water and espresso every evening and it was delivered to our room within 5 minutes and all were complimentary. The hotel also helped us with our dinner reservations at restaurants and responds to my emails were also very prompt. Breakfast was fantastic with lots of healthy choices such as whole meal bread, fresh fruit, yogurt and juices. You could even request them to cook your eggs. Wifi connection was very fast as well.

For example, adding a map of the Alilaguna and vaporetto lines would be helpful. We arrived early and were warmly greeted at the front door with fresh orange juice and coffee. Our room was beautiful, it had a small balcony that overlooked the canal. Our breakfast was served in our room by the very friendly bellboy (who made an excellent cappuccino and americano). As is typical throughout Italy, don't expect a huge American style breakfast! However, do expect fresh rolls and delicious coffee. The hotel also booked us a Murano glass factory tour. This tour was a lot of fun because a small boat picks you up at the hotel and brings you to the glass factory for free. It is important to note that the glass company will not drop you back off at your hotel for free; however, there is public transportation off of the island and it is very inexpensive and easy to use.

We had booked from booking.com and had got an incredible deal - as it turns out, infinitely better than we had ever expected. Their website tells you very clearly how to find them using the water bus system - we are extensive world travellers (my partner is Scottish and I am a New Zealander) and this was perhaps the easiest hotel to find with their instructions, EVER. Add to that the nightmare that Venice can be with all of its back alleyways (we had been to the city before), and you have an immediate peace of mind. From the outside, especially at night, the hotel is stunning. Upon entering, the gentleman at the front desk stopped us, sat us down on two chairs, and took our bags from us. We gave our name the reservation was under and he immediately knew exactly who we were, our room, etc. A valet appeared as if from nowhere, gave us a glass of juice each, took our suitcases, and disappeared once more. Our friend at the front desk produced a map, our paperwork, receipts, and discussed our interests and how we may enjoy Venice to the fullest extent based on what we liked. We were then shown to our room, which was STUNNING. we got a doube suite (room 305)- a double window opening onto a tiny balcony overlooking the grand canal, ensuite with bath/jacuzzi/shower, bidet, 20m square overall. on our pillows was a weather prediction for the following day, and the porter then gave us instructions on how to work everything (TV, Safe, Phone, etc). The Espresso machine in the closet wasn't working, but was pointed out to us first thing and we were told whenever we wanted an espresso to call reception and they would be straight up. A very small downside was the TV, it took about 90-120 seconds of warming up before turning on - never worked out how to remedy that, but when you're in Venice, why are you watching TV anyway? The room came installed with a integrate radio system next to the bed and the toilet as well, which is a nice touch. We had brought a bottle of wine with us which turned out to be a cork - so after a quick phonecall to reception a porter came up and even opened it for us! The breakfasts were exceptional - bacon and scrambled eggs for the English, cold meats for the Europeans, fresh fruit, yoghurt and museli for the vegans, and pastries for the French. Add into this coffees made to order and its a brilliant way to start the day. Whilst we were travelling in Venice we noticed a \"Venice tourist tax\" advertised in the water bus pontoons - but they didn't say what this consisted of. When we were checking out, we found out. We had paid by C/Card before we left on our trip, but on the last day, there was an extra 8 Euro charge per night which was the tax - I don't know if the amount is standard but its just something to be aware of! Overall - we had an amazing time. The staff were friendly, SO helpful, the furnishings are exquisite (have a look upstairs - we had a sneaky look and its the most incredible chapel-type area!). We simply can't fault it. It helps that we got an amazing deal, and it was winter, but we take our hat off to you. Thanks folks, it was amazing.

What a nice touch! The hotel staff is very attentive without being intrusive. The room was spacious, wonderfully appointed and kept spotless twice a day. Breakfast was excellent, as expected. Last year I made a comment about the bacon not being prepared according to the American taste (it wasn't crispy). I do not eat bacon but most American are fussy about it. I guess it's hard for non-American to understand that perfect point for bacon doneness. This year the bacon was perfect. It's a small detail, but it's the sum of the details, and their willingness to improve, that counts in the end. When I came back some ten days later, I arrived rather early and thought that I would have to wait for my room (I have requested the same room, if possible). Not only I got the same room, but it was ready by 10 am!! They apologized for not having the prosecco ready in my room. I said that I wasn't feeling too well, so I wasn't going to drink much alcohol, so the prosecco wasn't really necessary. When I came back later that day I found a huge platter of fruit wrapped in cellophane and a bottle of mineral water in the cooler and another note from management. Wow!

My mother (photo 37c) and me (photo 37d) stayed at the Stern 3 days at the end of November 2011, whilst waiting for the depart of our cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean. My mother sits on a wheel-chair and Signori Roberto, Alberto and the other extremely helpful hotel staff arranged for her speedy transfer by boat directly from the Marco Polo airport to the hotel pier by Sanitrans, a local company specialised in transportation of sick and disabled. In the otherwise for handicapped so inconvenient Venice, the Stern offers a vantage location with the Line 1 vaporetto (waterbus) sailing straight from the entrance to Venice to the Ca'Rezzonico station at the hotel door. Also from the hotel pier you may enjoy the traghetto (cross-over) of the Grand Canal to Palazzo Grassi and back by gondolone. Whereas a 40 minute tour by gondola will set you back 80 euros, the gondolone costs 0.50 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac one way - yes, you read right 0.50 not 50. In Venice there are 7 other traghetti across the Grand Canal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8 crossings for 4 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac. The Swiss millionaire Frau Stern decorated the late medieval structure of the hotel building with Venetian renaissance and other elements, blending them with exquisite taste (photos 34, 35, 36, 37). We hired a charming junior suite (photo 37b) with side-view on the Canal Grande (photo 38). You may enhance the hotel experience of an aristocratic mansion by visiting the larger Ca'Rezzonico palace museum, just one bridge away. The Palazzo Stern is situated in the Dorsoduro sestier, an authentic Venice neighbourhood, less overwhelmed by tourists but still in the heart of the city.

Perhaps breakfast tables could be cleared a bit faster but this is compensated by the following experience which seems to typify this place.

Palazzo Stern gives you this feeling with its extra ordinary interior, staircase and obviously the view from its terrace. Breakfast with awe and delicious croissants .. can one ask for more. Still: we came away with a few remarks and we still physically feel the hotel.. The reason: the mosquitos.. and a lot of them! We stayed four nights and every morning we were covered with bites, sometimes spending time in the bathroom during the night to stop the itching. We of course mentioned this to the staff and ask the room to be sprayed - but obviously without result. Than there was the bar service, or rather the lack of it. Coming home after a long day admiring the city we just wanted a glass of wine and enjoy the view. After a (long) while we were asked by a very unfriendly lady if we were staying at the hotel - which we were. Without the opportunity to ask two glasses of wine she disappeared to serve another table with 4 people to never return. A bit desperate we left to the room to get dressed for the evening concert, after which we thought we give the bar a second change. A grappa on the terrace at night is a romantic event, not? So we arrived at the terrace around 11 PM to be told the bar was closed; no more drinks. After some strong persuation we eventually got a glass of wine (still pretty expensive..) and finally enjoyed the quiet of the evening - and after that back to the mosquitos. Did we enjoy Venice? Of course! Is Palazzo Stern a good hotel? Of course .. but perfection lies in the detail and here we noticed a lack of it.

By far one of the most beautiful hotel rooms we have ever slept in. Everything was perfect, right down to the Murano glass chandelier, amazing view of the Grand Canal and the luxurious bath. It is very conveniently located, only steps from the Ca' Rezzonico vaporetto stop. The staff were all very helpful and gracious. Breakfast is tasty and very generous. If the weather is fine you can sit on the the terrace and watch the boats go by. Just a few things to note: If you are a light sleeper, the noise from the canal WILL wake you, if you aren't an early riser. It starts about seven am, and gets progressively more noisy. We didn't mind at all, I loved the boats and we were getting up anyway. But if you had a late night, you may wish for a room on the other side. The only real disappointment we had was that drinks in the bar were very expensive for what you received. It wasn't the price that was disappointing, Venice is not a budget city, and most 4 star places get a premium for drinks. The issue was how stingy they were when pouring. We're not big drinkers, but we don't like being shamelessly fleeced, either. That might explain why the bar/terrace was always empty in the evenings, despite the gorgeous location. If you want to sit there and enjoy an after dinner drink, I recommend having a coffee. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel. Just buy a bottle of cognac and enjoy it in your beautiful room.

Had I planned more in advance, however, I would have know that the local water bus stops at the hotel's doorstep (instead we paid the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 euro for a water taxi). If you are arriving in Venice by train, get on the water bus at the train station traveling east. For \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50, the water bus will take you to the Ca'Rezzonico stop, literally at the entrance to the Palazzo Stern. Something else I found out about the Palazzo Stern after we arrived that this hotel has had it's 15 minutes of Hollywood fame! Movie buffs may remember the Venice robbery scene from \"The Italian Job\"? Well, the Palazzo Stern is that building! The hotel was recently renovated - after the movie was filmed - but also has a history as an art gallery with the impressive architecture and murals to prove it. (Want another Hollywood tidbit? Just 20 steps from the hotel is the famous church from \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Arc\" where Harrison Ford smashes through the floor to find rats, fire, and a dead Crusader. Of course the church looks different on the inside, but if you're a fan of the movie than it's worth taking your picture in front of). The beauty of this hotel is undeniable. We stayed in the suite with the front balcony, seeable upon arrival. Popping corks of champagne into the Grand Canal was unforgettable! Knowing it was our honeymoon, staff sent us a bottle of champagne and a single rose upon our arrival. Rooms are perfectly clean and the staff are very helpful. Restaurants in the area are great (try Al Vecio Marangon, just around the corner - the food is amazing at a great price.) The Stern is close enough to San Marco's that you can walk to the square but it's far enough away that you can get away from the tourist chaos and retreat to the peacefulness and beauty of the hotel! If there is one warning I could suggest, it is to be weary of the hotel's suggestion for you to visit Murano. Staff told us we could use the hotel's boat to visit the island - this, of course, is a sales pitch. The driver will take you to one factory on the island where you will be heavily pressured into buying blown glass worth more than a years worth of tuition. If you're brave enough to endure the sales pitch, then a free ride to one of the cities tourist attractions may be worth it (like I said, it costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 to get around in a private taxi). However, if you're a meeker creature like me than it might be worth your while to avoid the uncomfortable situation. The Palazzo Stern was a highlight of our Italy trip and made our stay in Venice unforgettable. You will literally be surrounded by history from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed. From Hollywood stars, to famous historical characters (Casanova was born in the yellow building right across the canal), to the hotel itself; when you stay at the Stern you will literally be a part of history.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal, canada", "Title": "\u201cA gem, perfect as always, highly recommended\u201d", "Author": "cohenfamily", "ReviewID": "UR118209277", "Content": "My third time at the Palazzo Stern.

We also enjoyed cocktails and snacks every afternoon on the fabulous front patio area right on the grand canal. We ate breakfast on the patio every morning as well. The food was wonderful, with a large selection of hot and cold foods. Our children loved the breakfast at this hotel better than any other hotel we stayed in during our 3 weeks in Europe.

We paid 320 Euro per night, which included a breakfast that was nothing to write home about.

The side of the tub is so high, my husband (who is almost 6 feet) asked if there was step stool in the room to use to step into and out of the shower. One small slip getting in or out would definitely cause some damage. The vanity was lovely, however, almost no room to actually put anything you might use, like toothbrush, toothpaste and razor. The overhead shower had NO water pressure and if I had just used that it would have taken 2 hours to wash the shampoo out of my thick hair. The little side shower is a pain because you spend all your time trying not spray in the wrong direction as there is only 1/2 a shower door and the smallest misjudgement ends up soaking everything you on the vanity.

Both are outstanding. This was the first, but I hope not last, visit to Venice for my wife and myself. In all honesty she did the research and picked the hotel. She did very, very well. Until you walk the streets, alleys, bridges, and dead-ends it is hard to realize that location can matter so very much. Even hotels that seem near could have been a trek to reach. Not the Hotel Palazzo Stern. With a vaporetta stop next to the terrace on the Grand Canal the hotel was a breeze to get to day or night. I really felt for the people I would see hauling luggage up and down the streets and bridges of Venice. Breakfast was great. In fact, breakfast on the terrace or drinks there in the evening were two of the top treats of Venice for us. The American coffee tasted like Nescafe but the cappuccinos were divine and seemingly delivered by intuition every time I thought of one. Such intuition seems to be inherent in the staff. It was like everyone knew what you wanted or needed without being asked. Roberto had great suggestions for restaurants and was able to get last-minute reservations for us regardless of the popularity of the venue. (Actually, I think he could because everyone I met in the city knew him personally.) The only problem I had with the hotel was the wi-fi in our room was spotty and slow. I understand such is not the case throughout the hotel. It is a minor issue and I did report it so maybe if we are lucky enough to return and have the same room (502?) it will be corrected. We stayed in a small room overlooking a garden behind the hotel and an alley that is a small canal. It looked over rooftops as well and was a postcard in and of itself. The room was very comfortable and even though it was small we had a large, well-equipped bathroom.

Two items to be aware of, or for the Stern staff to address. First there is no air conditioning before the month of May. One evening our room was especially hot and I asked for assistance in figuring out the a/c controls. I was informed that there is no a/c and i should open a window. The problem with that is that we paid a premium to face the grand canal and the noise is a substantial issue if the windows are open and one would like to sleep. For the price we paid air conditioning should be available 365 days a year, this was somewhat ridiculous . The staff offered a free water taxi ride to Murano and we took them up on their offer. It should be noted that this is a one way trip and you are on your own to get back. When we arrived at the island we were dropped off directly in front of one particular glass making establishment. The staff of this establishment grabbed my family by the hand and led them into their store where the tour and selling began before I even was off the boat.

We stayed in Feb 2011 in the week prior to Carnivale, so got a fantastic deal on the room. We booked a suite, overlooking The Grand Canal. We booked direct via the hotel website and requested that if it were available we'd love the room with a balcony. Well not only did we get this room but we were also pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of complimentary Prosecco chilling in an ice bucket with a little note welcoming us to the hotel. We arrived at the airport after dark and so splurged on a private water taxi to the hotel, which has it's own landing stage. As the hotel is at the bottom end of The Grand Canal this meant we got to go right down most of the length of the Grand Canal, an exciting introduction to our trip! The staff met us on the landing stage, they just seemed to know a taxi had arrived and we were checked in, the hotel doesn't have a long reception desk, but a big antique desk at the foot of the stairs, we were welcomed, given a seat, and promptly served a complimentary drink while we checked in! The staff who checked us in, gave us maps, info and showed us our room. But none of this was in anyway pretentious, stuffy or over bearing, it was just nice! Just a note, the Google map on the Trip Advisor page places the hotel in slightly the wrong area, it is in fact right on The Grand Canal not further in, as the map would suggest. Location: The hotel is near to the less touristy but still popular areas of Venice in the Dorsudoro. This means it's next to some fantastic local restaurants and the bars and pubs the locals use, including the university crowd. Having said that the hotel is pretty much next to the main art museum The Acadamia. Its about 15 mins to walk an easy route over the Grand Canal and to the heart of St Mark's Square. There is also a vaparetto stop right next to the hotel, meaning you can jump on a Number 1 service up or down the Grand Canal, which will get you to St Marks Square in 10 mins, or the Rialto in about the same time. Room: We were lucky enough to have a suite, which will be the best rooms in the hotel. The room was enormous, with 2 double french doors onto a balcony overlooking the action on The Grand Canal. Despite the room being large it was always toasty warm, and had full temperature controls. The room had 2 small double beds, extra pillows etc. There was ample large wardrobes, drawers and a safe. The bathroom was lovely (although the sink is a bit impractical in terms of putting stuff around it) and we think the room and bathroom had underfloor heating. Our room unfortunately had a broken whirlpool bath so we told the reception manager who apologised, they were unable to fix it so offered us a complimentary use of the rooftop private jacuzzi! Which is normally 70 euros an hour, Obviously we were staying in the hotel and Venice at a quiet time, which may have meant they were not bothered about clock watching, but we could have stayed in the jacuzzi for ages, well over the hour. The views from here are lovely, and on a bright, cold winter day being in the tub was a real treat! Breakfast is served by the bar, and in summer they must use the Grand Canal terrace, there were ample choices, scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal, boiled eggs, croissants, yoghurt, patisserie items, fruit, cold meats, cheese, etc etc. All in all this hotel was top notch, the building is beautiful, the location great, it felt welcoming, warm and friendly.

The bathroom was gorgeous with a splendid Villeroy and Boch jacuzzi bathtub (perfect after a long day of getting lost in the charming streets of Venice) and our entire room was cleaned twice daily when we were out - i only managed to bump into the cleaner once in our room as i'd left my autobus pass there, very swift and immaculate service. The bed was spacious and extremely comfortable and the room was kept at a good temperature (with the temp gauge on the wall just to let you know). The closets were perfect, a sensor light, easy to use safe, slippers, coffee machine (refilled daily) and a good selection in the mini bar. A lovely little touch is the daily weather update on the pillow accompanied by a chocolate sweet everynight. One higlight was the breakfast, all you would need was there, we helped ourselves to perfectly cooked bacon and egg most mornings and also a cheeky slice of chocolate cake which I imagine is there for the more adventurous breakfast eaters! We couldn't believe how close the hotel was to the 'Ca Rezzonico autobus stop and would urge anyone travelling to buy a pass for it during their stay (however ours didn't get checked once but I imagine in summer this would be very different). The service was amazing, could compare it to a 5 star hotel with the staff doing everything they could to make our trip more comfortable (even providing an adaptor plug as we'd brough the wrong one... Oops). We booked the hot tub for one night among the roof tops, it was gorgeous and a bottle of Prosecco and glasses were waiting with candles around the tub itself, the staff didn't mind that we took a tiny bit longer than booked and didn't interrupt until we made a call downstairs to say we were out (there was a telephone just in case anything was needed).

I do not eat bacon, so its crispiness wasn't a problem for me, but my only complaint was that although breakfast starts at 7:30 the eggs were not ready until around 8. A very minor point. The staff was very attentive; they made recommendations for restaurants that were right on and helped me with my internet connection. There is a computer for guests but there is also free wi-fi.

First of all, the hotel is stunning. You will find yourself taking a lot of photos of the halls, stairway, mozaics and the Byzantine altar on the 3rd floor which was right outside our room. Really beautiful. We spent time just looking around the old beautifully remodeled palace. Our room was a suite with a view of the canal. The little hall before our door had pinpoint lights on the dark blue ceiling that looked like stars in the night sky. Little touches like this are all over the hotel. Our room was huge, comfy bed, gold tiles in a marble bathroom with a large jetted tub. The soap, shampoo, etc were top rate. The bed was large and very comfortable. The linens were clean and very nice. We had 2 windows that looked out on the Grande Canal. There was a round table with 2 chairs between the windows. Lots of storage for luggage, clothes. Murano glass chandeleir and pieces decorationg this truly lovely room. Breakfast was really good. In nice weather, it is eaten out on the patio which is directly on the canal with no walkway in front. The breakfast room is lovely, also. It has mozaics and plenty of gold tiles like in St. Mark's. The front desk help was not overly friendly, but they are helpful. Ask them for suggestions for restaurants that are not tourist restaurants. We ate at a few of their suggestions and they were good. I think the hotel was getting a restaurant soon, but it wasn't available when we were there. I don't think the internet is free, except in suites, and Italian internet is frustrating everywhere. You get timed out and have to sign in with long passwords all the time. Still, at least you can get it here and they have a computer that you can use.

The Dorsoduro neighborhood is fantastic. Mostly Italian locals walking the Calle especially during low season. The restaurants near Campo Barnaba and Campo Santa Margherita (a short walking distnace from the hotel) were very good and inexpensive for Venice. It is easy to take the Vaporetto (water bus) located just outside the hotel. We took a water taxi to the hotel from the airport because of the children. We paid 90 Euros each way. Venice was enchanting and inviting. My children were amazed by the way of Venetian life without automobiles and the history.

The hotel used to be a palace and the hall on our floor must have been a chapel one. It is decorated with beautiful mosaics. The breakfast buffet pleased the three of us. Service was very good. A special mention to the reception men, who were very helpful and made very good suggestions for our visits. Last but not least: a taxi boat can bring you at the foot of the hotel from the airport.

We were put in a room that was very hot and stuffy and from which the air conditioning did not appear to be working. When we enquired at reception, we were told that rooms did not have air conditioning (despite the hotel website advertising all rooms as having this) and that it was \"only a heater\". We were simply told to \"open a window\" if we were too hot (and with the room temp reading 25 degrees, we were!) - fair enough advice, but this of course resulted in mosquitos coming in. In addition to this, a generator situated at the top of our stairwell made loud noises at intervals all through the night. When we contacted reception about this we were told that they \"didn't know what we were talking about\", and nothing was done to rectify this. Overall, both of these factors led to 4 sleepless nights. Given the cost of the rooms in this hotel, we did not feel that that this represented good service or value for money. Even making a simple request of an extra pillow for our room took all day and 3 separate requests to reception, which gives an indication of the level of service. This was our first trip to Venice.

Nowehere in Venice comes cheap but the Stern offers serious five star luxury- the reason it is listed as a four star is because it only offers breakfast rather than lunch and dinner. The palace, once owned by an antique collector, has been lovingly and tastefully restored. It is light, spacious and with a beautiful balcony overlooking the Canal to take breakfast or an early evening drink.

We'd never been to Venice before and grabbed the opportunity for 24 hours of sightseeing before our tall ship (Star Clipper) cruise. We spent hours pouring over maps, reviews and of course, trip advisor, to try and understand Venice and figure out where we would like to stay for that one night - not too far from the sights but also within easy access of the port. We also didn't want to be in the middle of the mayhem, preferring a quieter option. We finally settled on the Palazzo Stern - it seemed to have all that we wanted - and we weren't disappointed. We took a water taxi from the airport - expensive but this must be the best way to see Venice for the first time and we felt that having already seen the view from the canal we didn't feel the need for an equally expensive gondola ride. The water taxi deposited us at the canalside entrance to the hotel and we were treated to a glass of juice in the bar whilst we waited to check in - there is only one check-in desk and another guest was being attended to. As soon as he was free we were checked in quickly and taken up in a small lift to our room which was on the top floor. As we were only staying the one night we hadn't bothered with the more expensive rooms overlooking the canal as we didn't intend to be in it very much and although the room was very nice it had no view at all - the windows were about 10 feet off the floor - the website mentions that standard rooms overlook the canal, internal garden or the rooftops - all we could see was the sky - it didn't bother us at all for the one night but if you were going to be staying for any length of time the lack of view might be an issue. The hotel has a nice terrace and we had a drink there before bed - and you can also have a very pleasant breakfast out there watching all the boats and activities on the Grand Canal. If you need to get to the port and would prefer to do it under your own steam then it is about a 15 minute walk even dragging a suitcase and is a simple route. Just to be clear however, the port I am talking about is the one that the ferries to Croatia go from and not the big cruise ship terminal which is a bit further away. Would we stay at this hotel again? Yes, absolutely, but would choose one of the more expensive rooms with a view over the Grand Canal.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA hidden gem!\u201d", "Author": "Mane", "ReviewID": "UR75321885", "Content": "Having extensively researched the hotels in Venice, we chose the Palazzo Stern. We booked the junior Grand Canal suite Room 405. PROS: SERVICE Prompt email communication prior to booking, and afterwards. It also appears to be one of the very few hotels that care for your opinion and respond to comments made by reviewers. On arrival we found the warmest welcome we have ever known from a hotel. Ludovico at the desk, is a star! He speaks good English, has an excellent sense of humour and a welcoming smile. He and the bell boy rushed to the greet us as our water taxi approached their porch. Led us by hand to the reception. Treated us like royalty. We were asked to to sit down with him at a table where check-in was done in a most elegant manner, and then he patiently answered our questions. Next, Ludovico personally escorted us to the room in a modern Otis elevator that was large enough to take six. He did not want to leave this task to a bell boy! Luggage followed later with the bellboy. And surprise surprise!... a bottle of cold Prosecco with 2 flute glasses and a welcome card awaited us in our room - what a great way to start a holiday. We popped the cork, filled our glasses and stepped out onto the balcony. Wow! What a view of the Grand canal. No noisy tourists anywhere despite being within 10 mins of most touristic activities! We stood there mesmerised listening to the water lapping at the banks whilst we sipped our drink. We spent hours just gazing at the boats move to and fro. We felt like celebrities as the tourists in their boats gazed at us enviously and took our pictures while we waved at them. The night time views over the canal (with its amazing water reflections) are to die for! ROOMS This is the largest room we have ever stayed in a hotel. It had very high ceilings, luxury venetian decor, & a giant chandlier (this place was once a palazzo and then carefully restored). There were 2 king sized beds, with 8 feet of free space at foot of bed! (despite our two suitcases perched on their racks). In addition, there were 2 pretty armchairs, coffee table, a giant dresser 8 feet long, bedside tables,and an extra table for your bits and pieces! A giant illuminated wardrobe with full length mirror stood against the wall. Most important for us were the luggage racks to support our 2 suitcases, a feature which is lacking in many hotels. In addition there were: -Large flat screen TV panel with Sat TV. -In room security safe. -Minibar (did not use it) - at check-out no ugly questions about mini bar usage either! Very polite indeed. -Coffee & tea maker with free coffee/ tea in room. -Air conditioning individually controllable, works perfectly, and is silent even with the 3 speed fan on. -Double glazed windows with totally noise free nights, despite being on the canal. No mosquitoes! And no foul odours from the canal (my son warned me Venice would stink in August). Looks like the city has sorted this problem finally. House keeping was immaculate and the hotel spotless. The bathroom was magnificisimo! Separate electronic heating controls to maintain bath temp constant. Hand shower, wall shower, biday, giant shaving mirror, hair dryer etc. Shampoo, soap, and half a dozen other little bottles! OTHER FEATURES: Free internet station on first floor with printer. Thank you! Large hotel terrace facing Grand Canal - great for breakfast and evening drinks. Full breakfast - bacon,scrambled eggs, boiled eggs (boiled to your required time), cold meats, toast, croissant, cereal, fruits, fruit juices, pastries, coffee etc. Breakfast can be had in the breakfast area, the terrace or in your room. Check out was efficient - took 5 minutes. LOCATION: The hotel is close enough to walk to all the attractions but also has these helpful additional features: -A private waterway access - water taxi takes you & your luggage right into hotel porch. No painful trekking with luggage through the streets and over bridges to find your hotel. -Vaporetto station next door. (get a vaporetto pass) -Traghetto station located in front of hotel, to cross over to the other side. -Gondola station is a mere 2 vaporetto stops away. -Three major museums nearby - Academia gallery, Ca rezzoniccio museum, and Peggy Guggenheim museum. -At least three good eating places within a 10 minute walk. Eating at St. Stefanos square restaurants is atmospheric. The walks in this area are quiet and peaceful and yet you are not far from anything. Thus, great rooms, great location, great views, no noise, a lovely terrace and full breakfast. What more can you ask for a perfect holiday? This hotel is thoroughly recommended. (The balcony suite is expensive but worth every penny...and you can get 20% off for a 4 day booking). CONS: The side of the bath is high and getting in may be difficult, if you have a knee or hip problem. A glass shelf is lacking above the sink in the bathroom to hold your personal toiletries. Should be easy to fix. Suggest you provide a rack in the lobby, to hold plenty of tourist information leaflets, for people to browse as in most hotels. This hotel is a hidden gem.

Here are a few points that would elevate the property to the top ten in Venice. I was in suite 405. Just lovely. There are many comments about this suite on line. The suite needs a few modifications. The bathtub is an accident waiting to happen. This can be corrected with the installation of two small hand rails, and perhaps a small safety step . The counter top is too small to display your items. This can be fixed with the installation of one or two glass shelves. There are not ample towel racks, so there is no place to hook your clothes while in the shower. There is no robe, so when you have come back from 8 hours of touring for an afternoon shower, and you are not ready to get dressed again, and want to take a picture of the rainbow over St. Marco, you have nothing to put on. The front desk staff is cordial when addressed, but if you do not address them, you are barely acknowledged. It would be so helpful as other reviewers have posted, to have a welcome sheet that lists some of the special things going on in Venice at the moment, such as the exhibitions, the potential fireworks and such. The web site could also offer some additional information. For instance just a sentence or two here and there of information. For instance. If one described how very easy it is to prepay for the water taxi to the hotel, and that you get a 10E discount for prebooking a return or to your ship....Or that the neighborhood just near by has a little supermarket, many pay phones,an internet cafe etc. The free internet now offered here is a HUGE bonus. With my lap top and skype We were able to make many hours of calls back to the states at either no charge or 2 cents per minute. This is a fantastic property.

You realize you made the right choice when the water taxi drops you off at the private landing of the hotel where you are met by hotel staff, after a georgeous ride down the Grand Canal. If that doesn't do for you, the warm welcome you receive when you are checking in and the beautiful surroundings should probably do the trick. It's as if one just stepped right into a fairy tale. The hotel is perfectly located between the Accademia bridge and the Rialto and right at the Ca' Rezzonico vaporetto stop. Which gives you tremendously easy access to everything, while at the same time, a short walk behind the hotel and you're in an actual neighborhood, with all the character of a real italian village. The rooms are huge (the standard room overlooking the Grand Canal is perfect with the views of a suite without the cost). You'll feel like a celebrity when the tourists on the vaporetto snap your picture when you look out windows. The rooms and baths are decorated just the way you'd want for a hotel in Venice, elegant and warm. Relax on the quiet front terrace enjoying a cool beverage after a long day of site seeing. You may just have it to yourself.

The first night we stayed in Room 501, a standard room on the third floor in the back of the hotel. The room size was adequate and decorated tastefully with fabrics and a Murano chandelier. The bathroom seemed large relative to the size of the bedroom and had a wonderful stall shower. The bed was quite comfortable, as I do not even remember sleeping on it. The photos I included should describe the room better than mere words can. But we had hoped for a room on the water. Fortunately, Francesco, who was so professional and helpful during our entire stay, was able to move us to Room 405 for the next three nights, the room with a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. This could be the best \"room with a view\" in all of Venice. If you sit out on the balcony, you will be the envy of all the tourists that pack the passing vaporettos as they snap your picture. The Palazzo has been so impeccably renovated that everyone feels compelled to photograph it. The luxurious room and the expansive view are such a perfect combination that you might think twice about ever leaving the hotel to explore all that Venice has to offer. For what could be better than this? If you have never been to Venice, a word about location. For most first-timers, the question is whether to stay close by St. Mark's or not. My preference is to find a hotel away from this crowded area but one close enough to easily go there whenever I want. However, I should note that my wife and I go to Venice fairly regularly, so I must confess that the compulsion to stay near St. Mark's has long given way to a desire to stay where one can savor the real Venice. So that is why we have so enjoyed our more recent visits to the Ca Sagredo in Cannaregio and now to the Palazzo Stern on Dorsoduro. Now there is another aspect to location, and that is ease of finding the hotel and ease of access to it. Unless you hire a private water taxi and have booked into a hotel that is both directly on the water and has its own dock, you will find yourself lugging your bags to get to your hotel. Of the ten or so hotels we have stayed at in Venice, the Palazzo Stern is about the easiest to find and to access. Just take the vaporetto line 1 and get off at the Ca' Rezzonico stop. Walk along the canal a few steps and the hotel is right there. The three or so steps up from the sidewalk to the hotel are the only obstacle of any sort you will experience in your journey. And that is nothing compared to the bridges you need to cross finding the Bauer or the Europa and Regina near St. Mark's. You really do not need a water taxi from the airport to come to Palazzo Stern. Furthermore, once at the hotel, there is a traghetto and a vaporetto hard by the hotel, the former to take you directly across the Grand Canal (to visit, for example, the Palazzo Grassi) and the latter to take you either toward the Rialto or toward St. Mark's. Our room was magnificent. It was very large by Venice standards, with columns and lovely wall fabrics and an eye-catching Murano chandelier. The beds were very comfortable. The recent renovation allowed for an adequate number of electric outlets to recharge phones and camera batteries. The room was air conditioned with its own controls and worked perfectly. In Room 405 the shower was in the bathtub which had quite high sides and was a bit difficult for me to get into and out of when using. Breakfast time was the highlight of each day, and this is true whether you are in a standard room or a junior suite. That's because breakfast takes place on a spacious (compared to other hotels' tiny boardwalks on the Grand Canal, if they have even that) terrace where one can relax and enjoy the activity on the Grand Canal. To enjoy the terrace as we did in May under clear blue skies makes the high season rate for that time of year more than worthwhile. The routine for breakfast is to help oneself to the extensive choices of the buffet laid out just inside the hotel, which offers everything including eggs, and take one's plates outside to the terrace where the waiter will ask your preference for coffee or tea. Later in the day one can take drinks out on the terrace. The hotel is not of sufficient size to run a restaurant; so no lunch or dinner is served there. But one can always sit down and enjoy the sights. The terrace is, indeed, one very special place. There are few comparable experiences in all of Venice. In sum, the accommodations are luxurious, the staff from the managers to the waiters are cheerful, professional, and helpful, all the rooms are glistening, the location is excellent, the prices are relatively reasonable for Venice,....well perhaps five stars out of five are not enough!", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely lovely\u201d", "Author": "Dotti05", "ReviewID": "UR67419031", "Content": "We have just returned from Venice and our stay at Hotel Palazzo Stern was marvelous.

If you want to feel the real Venice with authentic Venitians you absolutely have to avoid the San Marco area. Too crowdy. Dorsoduro in the area to stay and Palazzo Stern is in the middle of it, located right on the Grand Canal in a very calm street but very close to the vaporetto but also nice restaurants and bars. I can not see a better area for a journey in Venice. The Hotel itself: A fantastic real Venitian palazzo with a human size though. Beautiful, recently renovated with authentic old-fashioned but new venitian features. The service is professional, delicate and everybody seems nice and always willing to help... with a smile in addition. I had a Junior Suite with view on the Grand Canal (which I recommend). It was spacious (rare in Venice), calm, really lovely, with comfortable beds and the bathroom was the best I saw in Venice. Breakfast: simple but great. As it should be in that range of hotel (with good quality products). Conclusion: To be honest, Palazzo Stern is far much better than the Danieli, or the Bauer Palazzo and offer a much better location than the Ca'Sagredo. If you like luxury + bling-bling, then go to the Gritti Palace (a bit more expensive though) or maybe the Cipriani .

All the positive comments you can read on Trip Advisor about this charming place are true! Last December, after booking our cruise, we reserved a double standard room on the third floor, we were not disappointed. Every time we wrote by e-mail to the reception desk, we had an answer within the following hour. We arrived early on a Monday morning by water taxi from the Maritime station near Santa Lucia, we were immediately taken in charge. We had a nice full breakfast on the terrasse along the Grand canal. Our room of course was not ready, so we took a stroll to Campo Santo Stefano, had lunch next to the Fenice and at the very beginning of the afternoon were able to settlle in. Small, cosy room: double standard bed, closets on each side, mini fridge, huge modern bathroom with trendy shower unit, a safe box, slippers, murano fixture, two high windows, free internet, a beautiful view of Rio Malpaga and the garden in the back. It turned out to be not only comfortable but very quiet, sun in the afternoon until early evening and there is also an elevator. Turn down service in the evening with a candy on the pillow plus next day weather forecast. As other reviewers have mentionned, there are larger rooms in front with a view on the Grand canal. We never used the vaporetto all week. The weather each day was superb, we took long walks in different sestieres. We visited a few museums, the Correr, Academia, Guggenheim, churches, campos. (We had already spent one full day in Venice in May 2007). Do not miss the Squera di Trovaso nearby where gondolas are restored! We had opera tickets one evening for Don Giovanni at the Fenice, we easily walked back and forth. A nice choice of good restaurants all around and in the Campo Santo Stefano. Beautiful shops. The Palazzo is truly a gem and the terrasse where we had breakfast every morning, a good hearty breakfast , was fantastic, you can also sit there and day dream after your visits of the day or in the evening. In French, we would call this place an hotel de charme. A staff always ready to answer your needs and all your questions, speaking English and French. The quiet elegance of this Palazzo invites you to savor the \"douceur de vivre\" in Venice. I was a little scared to use the steps upon arriving by water taxi, feeling unsteady, Domenico helped me with an indulgent smile and made sure when we were to leave, again by water taxi, for the airport that I could embark safely and ask the driver to make sure I would disembark easily at Marco Polo. (Water taxi 95 euros for the airport, 60 euros for the train station, 80 euros from the Maritime station near Santa Lucia), vaporetto stop next to the Stern at Ca Rezzonico.) Venice is renowned to be expensive, but as far as we are concerned, our five nights stay at the Palazzo Stern was not more expensive than a standard room in Paris with the added value of being exquisite!!! And Dorsoduro is indeed very pleasant. And if you have tickets for an opera at La Fenice, the hotel is well located. A warm thank you to Domenico and colleagues..

Over 30 years we have managed to visit the city 19 times. We seldom stay at only one hotel; many times we have tried three different places on one trip! Such was the case this March, when I was curious to compare three new hotels that had recently opened on the Grand Canal. Since we are both in the design field, the architecture is very important to us, as well as the decor of the hotel. In my own words, \"If the room isn't good, the trip isn't good\". I had heard quite abit about the Stern from Trip Advisor, so I knew that it would be a good candidate. Making sure that we had a room on the canal, with a balcony seemed to be the right decision. We were not disappointed. Not only is the hotel a gem of architectural history, but the attention to detail and the superlative use of materials was amazing. The renovations were done with a great sensitivity to the original palazzo and its history. The materials used were first class- wonderful mosaics and Fortuny lighting. The location is great- do not be caring about the vaporetto station nearby, as the doors and windows are of such high quality that when closed, you will never hear a thing. Of course, we enjoy the sounds of Venice and always have a door ajar. The staff is professional, courteous, and very willing to please. When we needed a particular plug for a camera- they immediately went to the local hardware store and purchased one- and gave it to us when we left!

Our one request at any hotel is ice- I guess a more American necessity. We do appreciate a goodly amount, and again, the Stern was right on, with an immense bucket at any time.

The hotel is within walking distance from all the main tourist attractions and it is situated on a water bus stop. However there is no direct route from this to the airport. Our one complaint was that the man on the front desk told us to change stops at s.angelo and get onto the water bus route 2 for airport connections but after waiting at this stop for over forty minutes we had to get a water taxi to the airport and it left in a bit of a rush. I would recommend if you do not want to get a water taxi to the airport (which cost us 95euro), that you get the water bus from the Rialto which is not too long a walk from the hotel. Venice did experience some flooding while we were there but the hotel provided us with umbrellas and there was no fear of the hotel flooding.

I can highly recommend it. If you arrive on the Alilaguna waterbus from Maro Polo airport (13 e) this takes you into San Marco (Vallaresso) - as you come off the pontoon take a left and walk up to the vaporetto station a few metres away - you can either purchase a one-stop ticket for 6.50 euros or a travelcard which would cover you for 12/24/36 hours, etc (36hrs cost me 23e which was well worth it). Just make sure you validate the ticket before your first journey as there are inspectors that check your ticket and this can incur a 44e fine. You need the No. 1 vaporetto to Ca'Rezzonico - in the direction of Piazzale d. Roma. This journey then takes no more than 10 mins to the hotel. The hotel is just on the left as you come out of the vaporetto stn. Perfect! I was warmly greeted on arrival and the receptionist spoke good English - the hotel has 3 floors - my room was small and tastefully furnished with a fantastic Villeroy & Boch bathroom, free coffee machine, minibar, plasma screen (CNN/BBC in English) - the room was on the side canal (3rd floor) and quite quiet however if you are going to splurge out and pay a premium for a room on the Grand Canal then you can expect a bit of traffic noise - the Grand Canal is a very is busy 'street'! The hotel doesn't have a restaurant for dinner or lunch but breakfast was very acceptable with juice/ham/cheese/scrambled eggs/crispy bacon/croissants/yoghurt and a choice of Twinings tea. I had breakfast on my three mornings there out on the terrace -beautifully sunny but cold and wonderful to watch all the Grand Canal traffic going by! The Palazzo Stern is in a far better location than some of the other more expensive 5 star accommodations down at the bottom end of the Grand Canal like the Danieli/Metropole which do not have ground floor terraces actually overlooking the canal, as they open directly out onto the long promenade. Define attractions to visit are of course the Basilica in San Marco, Palazzo Ducale (next door to Basilica) - 12 euros, Rialto Bridge and the markets (mornings), do a circumnavigation of the Grand Canal on the No. 1 vaporetto and change to the No. 2 at Pizzale d. Roma and go towards San Marco - you can get off at San Basilio/Zattere (Duorsoduro) and walk along the long promenade for afternoon sunshine and then go on to San Giorgio to see the church where you can take a trip for 3 euros to the top of the belfrey and get a great view over to San Marco (cheaper than going to the top of the Campanile!). Eating is a minefield - just go with your sixth sense and hopefully you won't be disappointed!

But here is the kicker, the next morning upon checkout we were informed that they DID have our original suite and why didn't we ask for it? Huh?!! No kidding, that's what they said after we repeatedly went over with them that we had a confirmed reservation for a Junior Suite Grande Canal View and, if they did not have it, we should be credited for the difference in the cost of the rooms. They insisted that we would be provided with a similar room and no credit would be issued. The \"suite\" we were given instead was on the fifth floor, had one queen bed, and a non-pullout couch. I reminded the front desk agent that we had four people staying in our room. So what do we get?...a cot delivered to our room. This was our \"suite\". And although my 5 year old daughter slept on the cot, if we had wanted the \"camping\" experience, we would have stayed at one of our local campgrounds back in the States, not an $800 per night hotel in Venice. That said, where was our jacuzzi tub that I read so many other travelers commenting on? Our \"suite\" only had a shower, which was broken, AND there was a gapping hole in the wall...perhaps the \"extensive\" remodeling which took place three months prior to our stay was not quite finished in our \"suite\"? Now I would like to comment on our \"grand canal view\"? What was so grand about it?...it would have been grand if we had the neck of a giraffe and could hang out the window from our waist up to see around the corner. And that would have been ideal only if we had been able to open the window properly and someone hung onto our waist to prevent us from falling out! That said, thank goodness Venice is a magnificant city because it saved our feelings on our visit. After attempting to receive some sort of a credit (we were not looking for a refund), without any success, for the difference in our room category from the hotel staff and management, as well as hotels.com, triple check your reservation before you decide to stay in this hotel. If this is how they treat their guests who are rightfully upset for not getting what they pay for, then shame on them for carrying four stars. Feel free to try and defend your staff's behavior Mr. Management. I have read how any negative comments against your hotel are labeled as lies and misleading.

There is a troghetto right in front, and the Ca Rezonnico vaporetto stop is next door. We walked to Academia, Santa Margarita and all around Dordogne in 5 minutes...Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is perfect, and the food was wonderful.

As far as the front desk, I agree with one of the recent reviews. I felt that they werent very pleasant, but they were helpful when we requested it. Kind of felt that we were bothering them. Turns out that Andre Botelli was performing at St. Marks Square and I thought that was major news to tell your guests, but I guess they didnt think so. We found out that he performed at the square in the newspaperl. So I was disappointed that the staff did not bother to share this information to the guests.

We had a standard room, and it was huge and beautiful. My only criticism would be inadequate reading light. We had breakfast each morning on the terrace, situated along the Grand Canal, and a fabulous breakfast it was. LOVED the beautiful restoration of this old palace, sumptuous but on a human scale (not intimidating). The staff was very helpful and was able to get us dinner reservations at very popular restaurants (by the way, Osteria da Fiore stands up to the hype and is phenomenal). Also loved the fabulous location, in lovely Dorsoduro (out of the madness of St. Mark's) but with a Vaporetto stop outside our door, and a troghetto to take us across the canal as well. Nothing in Venice is cheap, so I say, if you're going there and want to splurge, the Hotel Palazzo Stern is a great value. You spend a lot, but you can easily imagine yourself back in the heyday of Venetian wealth and highly developed aesthetics.

We'd hoped that Venice would be warm-ish by April (which it was for 4 days out of 5) but without the huge hordes of tourists that come in the summer. We'd had a recommendation for the Palazzo Stern from a friend who stayed last year and also checked it out on Trip Advisor. The short story is that the Palazzo Stern met all our expectations, and then some! We caught a private water taxi from the airport which pulls up right outside the hotel. The staff took our bags, we had a short check-in and a brief tour of the hotel and then up to our room. We were in 405 on the second floor which has a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal - probably more expensive than most rooms there but we were on honeymoon. The architecture, design, room size, cleanliness and service were just great. Breakfast is served until 10.30am and is on a fantastic terrace in front of the hotel and right on the Grand Canal. Service to the room was excellent and we had many quite reasonably priced cappucino's and glasses of red wine delivered to the room. The staff don't make you sign for it and don't hang around for tips so it made the room service a great experience. There were no bath robes in the room but we asked for some and they were there in minutes. We also had a spa (with champagne of course) in their tub on the top floor. All in all the room and the service was top notch and I can't think of a thing to fault. The location was also great - right next to a vaporetto water taxi stop and in a lovely neighbourhood with lots of charming restaurants and shops and only 5-10 mins walk from some of the best art galleries and churches. Far better than around St Marks Square. Highly recommended for a honeymoon or romantic stay.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Palazzo Stern", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d651332-Reviews-Hotel_Palazzo_Stern-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$256 - $554*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Dorsoduro 2792-2794/A-2792/B</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30123</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "651332", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/89/de/71/hotel-palazzo-stern.jpg"}}
