Run by the same people that operate The Scarlet Hotel, The Saff pretty much uses the same formula of providing relatively low-cost stays but with a nice overall experience. It's well maintained, clean, new, somewhat stylish and has friendly staff. It's a boutique hotel, so facilities are minimal. It's also a converted heritage shop row, so the design and layout has had to make some compromises (like The Scarlet). This means that rooms are tiny, and bathrooms are the size of a shower cubicle, and footsteps are loud in the hallway. On both my stays, my room has faced the main road, which gets ridiculously noisy not only with the passing traffic and locals eating across the road, but with blaring music and some muppet talking on a microphone. Try asking for a room on the other side of the hotel. It may be quieter (I don't know).

There were two small windows in the bathroom. We found this room to be comfortable and just what we needed. There is a bar located next door that gets cranked up of a night 9p but we didn't hear any noise from the bar. The first morning that we were there we overslept because it was so quite.We had room 112. The beds were very comfortable and soft. I didn't like the pillows but that was a personal preface not something wrong with them. I just prefer a soft pillow and they were more firm. The rooms and bathroom was good size. We had a safe and fridge in the room. There was also wireless wifi in the room that worked great. The only complaint that my husband had was the king bed was actually 2 double beds put together. He thought it was strange to have \"Ricky and Lucy\" beds but I was fine with it because that meant I got my own covers! lol This is a new hotel. Some taxi drivers don't know where it is.

The MRT station Outram park (both for the purple and the green line) is within 5 min. walking distance. The second thing we liked was the room overall: we stayed in the standard room on the ground floor (no window). The hotel has been quite recently renovated and the decor was nice. Although the room was quite small, it was comfortable for our purposes: sleeping and having a shower. Separate shower cubicle so no showering over the toilet seat (which seem to be the case with many hotels of the same price range)! Good aircon as well.

The receptionist tonight was great, even when I rang directly and asked how to book and ensure I got a room with a window when booking through an online service to get it cheaper. Then even friendlier when I turned up, remembering my call. Check in was pleasant and fluid. My room is surely small, between 2 and 3 feet longer than the bed, and i guess twice it's width, I can imagine it being a squeeze for two people with lots of bags. My Bathroom is immaculate and I am tempted to take a few photos of some details I like for the carpenters doing my bathroom at home as I write... I like a room with a window simply as that claustrophobic feeling is not so nice, but in reality in this long skinny hotel, made from renovated row house/shops, the disadvantage of the window is it faces the street and the street noise is a bit annoying at times. I am hoping/presuming it will calm down a bit later. Double glazing the windows might well help with the street noise... No room service, no cafe, so no breaky included, though in reality I imagine they could do a deal with the food mall across the road and even just a jug for coffee would be nice I came here as a medical tourist, and in fact the hotel is a 5 min walk from the hotel and it's MRT station one direction and downtown china town in the other.

The carpets are nice \u2013 wall to wall rattan in the corridors and the rooms, and the doors to each room are brightly painted front doors from houses, which gives the hotel an interesting feel, slightly different to the cookie-cutter, standardized approach in larger establishments. Rooms are fairly small, but bigger than the previous hotel I stayed at in Singapore; you actually get a wardrobe here, and a bathroom where the toilet and the shower are separated by a glass door, rather than one spraying down on the other. Though the room is a decent size, the bed is still pretty small, but it was comfortable enough for a week\u2019s stay. On my own. You wouldn\u2019t get two people to sleep in that bed. You get free wifi (a bugbear of mine is how many hotels don\u2019t offer this) and a couple of free bottles of water every day as well. And if you\u2019re me, you get kept up every night by the karaoke joint downstairs. Every night, from ten until 1am, there were the dulcet tones of some woman massacreing various songs from the Nineties, and occasionally this tedium would be broken up by a man playing Radiohead on an acoustic guitar. Ineptly. I put up with this on the first night for an hour or so, then got dressed and went downstairs to complain. Nobody seemed to be on duty on the front desk and I went out to the street to look for the source of the noise\u2026 Only to be greeted with dead silence. Well, maybe there was a small dog playing with a piece of litter, but the street was dark and deserted. I felt a bit embarrassed. I walked to the nearby 7-11 and purchased a revolting chocolate bar, as if that was exactly why I\u2019d charged out onto the street at 10:30 on a Monday night. And then, not seeing signs of life, I returned to the hotel. I went back upstairs and as soon as I was in my room, the din ensued once more. This sequence repeated itself several times that night and for the rest of the week, until I feared for my sanity, both from sleep deprivation and from the nagging suspicion that the other guests in the hotel were conducting some week-long prank on me. I would have taken it up with the staff, but I never saw anyone apart from when I was sprinting out the door to get to the office. So: suitable if you\u2019re hellbent on being out on the lash until 1am so you miss the karaoke, or if you\u2019re down there singing your heart out, or if you\u2019re passed out drunk and sleep through it. (Tried that one night, didn\u2019t work for me.) Less suitable if you\u2019re in Singapore for work like I was, although if I could have found the time to be moved to a room on the 3rd floor, or not facing the street, then perhaps the phantasmal karaoke lounge would have wreaked less havoc with my sleep schedule.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201clet down by one member of staff\u201d", "Author": "boojeedoojee", "ReviewID": "UR118995543", "Content": "This nice enough hotel was the final location for our South East Asia tour, but due to one female member of staff our stay was not as enjoyable as it could have been.upon arrival this dour woman proceeded to treat us with contempt, possibly as we had back packs on and were both quite tired looking.

I actually checked into the Saff after spending a few days staying at the Marina Sands (I am pampered and used to large hotels thanks to my company but...) and wasn't hoping for much but for the price and all that comes with it, I am impressed. All in all I love the Saff and will definitely go there again when I go to Singapore for a holiday. I love it so much I decided to do a pocode for them.

My only downside from this hotel is that I didn\u2019t get a king or queen bed as well as the window, as this trip was also a romantic get away from me so this situation is not very ideal. Another plus thing from The Saff for me is that I actually missed my flight on the day I was supposed to go so I had to go the day after and The Saff was kind enough to waive the first night, for this I am very grateful. There was also a problem with the air conditioner on my last day of stay and apparently they were doing some repairing for the whole 1st fl and as a consequence my room was quite hot in the morning.

Last year we stayed in the (big) sister hotel \"The Scarlet\" and as we had a good experience there we decided to try The Saff. The Saff opened doors at the end of last year and at the time of booking there were no user reviews so we were in for a surprise. Our arrival was ok: for a minute we expected porter service considering the roomprice and the class of the hotel but there was none. The lady from reception helped us however, because she didn't want us to drag our suitcases by ourselves. A plus for her :-). Check-in went smoothly and we were brought to our room by another s(t)aff member. As soon as the door opened we were shocked by the size of our standard double room. While all the necessary things (tv, towels, tea and coffee making facilities, shampoo, hairdryer etc.) were there it was just too small; the bathroom was built in a cupboard. Guests with claustrophobia will definitely have a hard time. After we managed to fit our suitcases on the other side of the bed and one on the cupboard we could at least walk to the \"bathroom\". We went back to reception and asked for an upgrade but unfortunately the hotel was fully booked. As other hotels in Singapore were also fully booked (except the ones that are like S$1000/S$2000 a night or the ones that had a rating of \"terrible\") we tried to make the best of it. We managed to see a superior room later during the week which was a little bigger and it would have been more acceptable although even that room was small when you compare the room with similar rooms in Singapore. The room was very clean. The hotel is is new so here and there there is still some paintsmell but that did not bother us. You do get a big LCD-tv but with only five channels of which four are newschannels the value was limited to us. The experience with the reception varied: sometimes they did not pay attention at all (or where not there), other times in the middle of a conversation they would suddenly help other guests and now and then they were helpful and gave you their full attention as it should be. The rooms are nicely designed but the walls are thin. At one point we were woken up by other guests talking in the middle of the night. Streetnoise however was not hearable. The location of The Saff is excellent. It is a five minutes walk from the MRT station Outram Park and from there most of Singapore is reachable. As the hotel is in the middle of Chinatown there is always good food around, business and interesting things to do and places to see. The Saff has free Wifi around the hotel. The speed is quite reasonable: fast enough for checking email or surfing. All in all we think The Saff is a new hotel that needs to iron out a few details to make the whole experience better for guests. We do think that the photos on the website do not represent the (standard) rooms well enough and that is why we are disappointed. If we had to return to Singespore and choose a boutique hotel we would return to The Scarlet. If we had to stay in The Saff then we would book at least a superior double room but then again only if there would be a good deal otherwise it is overpriced.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA simple hotel but made my visit to Singapore truly pleasurable.\u201d", "Author": "enjoysingapore", "ReviewID": "UR92672128", "Content": "The Saff is an ideal hotel for the practical traveler.

The MRT stop was just a few mins away and just around the corner there is no shortage of great food and cafes. (Stay away from the food street -- big tourist trap!) By cab it was also easy to find because of the Indian temple nearby. Walk 5 mins and you get to the Pinnacle @ Duxton; walk 10 mins the Maxwell Center for chicken rice; 10 mins for Ang Siang Hill. The entire area is very cute and quaint. The decor is very Indian/SE Asian-inspired so the rooms are quite colorful and different from your standard business hotel. As for the rooms itself, they were considerably smaller than I expected. Since I stayed for about 5 days, two people + luggage cut down the amount of space we had to move around. The closet is also very tiny so not much room to put your clothes in there. Also, if you're big on bathrooms, the door to the bathroom looks like an antique closet with french doors. (I was half thinking I'd step into the \"closet\" and be wisked off to Narnia.) The doors don't close that well so for those that want their privacy, you may think twice. Sometimes I felt like I was staying in a small HK apt. than a hotel. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay. It was a great pick for a romantic rendezvous. The room was quiet and cleaned up quite nicely. The staff were also helpful. They didn't give us a late check out but did let us keep our luggage for a couple hours before our flight. I probably would stay at the hotel again if I came back with my honey but not alone.

I've been checking tripadvisor before booking and notice that the cheapest type has no window, so I booked a superior single room with window facing the street. First impression was not too bad, I mean after all they offer a good rate in the very good location... well considering the price that I pay for it, I can't complain. The room is very compact but ok, surprised a bit by the feather pillow, noisy ac, leaking bathroom wall (yes the photos shown here are so true!)... it's ok and worth it. plus it gives you free high speed internet, too (with cable) So I had been quite happy until the late evening came... and the nightmare started as it was saturday night! :) There is this crappy bar right next door (called the bini bini or something) with very loud live music until early morning (4.30 am) and countless \"boom boom pow\" playing every 15 minutes (maybe it was very popular at that time in singapore) until now I officially hate that song (sorry, BEP!). First I was hanging there in the room trying to sleep because I thought they would only be allowed until 2 am max. At 2.30, they were still very loud so finally I decided to walk around chinatown. As I was walking out the hotel I saw other guests who were staying at the surrounding hotels (1929 & g hotel), also walking around outside and didnt look happy at all, I saw one guy with his short and sandals carrying his novel trying to find a place to sit & read - obviously he couldn't sleep like me and hated the noise so much :) Finally after 4.30 the noises stopped. Luckily the weird evening was saved by the quiet sunday morning in chinatown. The breakfast served was cheering me up too with the congee, sausages, eggs, fried rice... a bit surprising breakfast if you compare it with the room condition. So final words, this could be nice, only that one crappy bar ruined the whole thing. Not recommended to stay there on Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights because these are the times when that crappy bar next door would have all-night live music. Not recommended also for people who are allergic to dust & humidity (dirty & humid & smelly carpet covering the entire building floor) Would I stay there again?

We had two windows with wooden shutters, only when I went to open them, found that they opened onto views of large airconditioning fans, which seemed to be working - just not in our room! There was no minibar - only an empty fridge that was barely cold. When we went to bed at night, all we could hear and feel through the bed was the rumbling fans from outside our windows.
