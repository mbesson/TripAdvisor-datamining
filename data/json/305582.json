Its close to all the main attractions, great to head off on walks around the city, bus routes are close by and the airport bus is literally five minutes round the corner - the easiest way to and from central Barcelona. Add the fact the hotel has a great level of accommodation, the staff we met were very friendly and helpful and our room had everything we could need including a super king bed. One example of the level of service is when checking out I was asked - rather than having to ask - if i wanted to leave my bags. Another Daniel knew we were extending our stay and had our daily cards - needed for the gym - ready and waiting for us. Our room looked over the 'courtyard' and was quiet. No net curtains won't be everyone's cup of tea and does mean the room can be like a dungeon to prevent being looked at when changing. The weather didn't allow us to use the roof top area yet it looks fun for when the sun shines. I like a gym to be available when I travel and this hotel's gym is one of the best - perhaps because its a commercial gym in its own right. Sadly you have to pay 7 euros to use the sauna and steam room - a first ever when using a gym in my experience and a mistake really when you are paying a high price for your hotel room. I know it says its a gay friendly hotel - get over that and you'll be fine. On our visit the guests were very diverse from retired couples to single men and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good hotel to sightsee Barcelona from. Breakfast is expensive as in all hotels and you'll find cheaper by stepping out of the door of the hotel - its the cost of convenience and can't be bothered to explore. We'll be going back in June.

Breakfast was served on non-cracked crockery, the juice jugs were new and unchipped (even though they were plastic) and the Spa allowed me to add the 7 euro charge to my room account (despite being told they were only doing it once as a favour - this pathetic ruling has GOT to stop !) Staff were extremely friendly and could not have been more helpful. HOWEVER, there is still a long way to go and Hotel management skills still need to be improved. I arrived for a 1 night stay, around 2.00pm, only to discover that the sun deck was being varnished and was therefore closed to guests. That immediately took out the only sunbathing area, the outdoor pool and the jacuzzi. I wasn't informed about this, neither on the booking website, nor by the Hotel staff upon check-in. I have complained before about the Spa area where 2 or 3 of the hydro jets never seem to work. On this visit 6 of the 7 jets were broken. The lovely receptionist apologised, explaining it was due to maintenance. B*llocks ! Will it take for all 7 to break before someone calls in a plumber ? And the cheek of it was, they still charged me the full 7 euros for use of the Spa ! Breakfast hasn't changed in that the hot option is just BAD...mini frankfurter sausages, fatty bacon and (still) brown scrambled egg. The cold breakfast option is good, but the 16 euro cover charge is still not worth the money. I am encouraged that many of the things I mentioned in my last review have been fixed, so hopefully Axel management will kindly take on board my remaining complaints in time for my next visit.

The last time we stayed was almost 6-years ago and the place has changed quite significantly with a number of the rooms being renovated. Prior to going I had read in other reviews on this site that standard \u201ccity rooms\u201d could be upgraded to premium ones for \u20ac40 a night so I emailed the hotel and asked for the upgrade which we were duly received. The room that we were given was one of the latest ones to be updated and was certainly very clean and modern. We particularly liked the shower, one wall of which is glass and open to the room itself (so perhaps only go as a couple, unless you\u2019re \u201cvery\u201d good friends). Our friends were staying in the standard city rooms so we were able to compare them to our own and whilst ours was more modern, particularly in the bathroom, it was not that much bigger than the standard room at all. Knowing that now I perhaps wouldn\u2019t bother with the upgrade, certainly not for \u20ac40 a night. The rest of the hotel is nice and there is a lovely roof terrace, although sadly not open in March. We used the spa, which is an additional \u20ac7 per person \u2013 this was very nice BUT why charge guests to use the spa? We\u2019ve stayed in plenty of 5* hotels that don\u2019t charge their guests and given what we were paying already this seemed a bit unfair. Breakfast is buffet style and if you have not added it to your reservation in advance it costs \u20ac16 per person. Finally don\u2019t book direct with the hotel, if you use Trivago or Hotels.com you will get a rate that\u2019s about 30%\u2013 50%.

The staff at the front desk were always very gracious. After our over-night flight we arrived around 9am and were accommodated to upgrade for an early check-in. The room we were in was an interior one on the second floor. The room was quiet, the bed very comfortable, the room was immaculate. The shower being in a big glass box took some getting used to at first but was a real pleasure for its roominess and the water was hot and plentiful. The bath amenities were always stocked. \"Decorative Style\" is very subjective. The room didn't reflect the beauty of Barcelona. It felt like were were in a big Godiva Chocolate Ballotine (minus the chocolates). We were two but there was only one chair and a small desk though there was plenty of floorspace in the room for another chair and a desk/table where the two of us could have sat together. And the open closet system was expansive but not practical. The location of the room made it lack light. If we stay there again we would ask for a room higher up and facing the street. We ate one breakfast at the hotel (15 Euros each) but found it lacking; the coffee tasted like what you get in a diner and the offerings, while fresh, weren't anything special.

The facilities that were previous included free and exclusive to guests on the roof are now a mixed public facility with swimwear police in the basement where paid spa and gym members are coming in from the street - past the dining room which is usually freezing because of the open door. Hotel guests feel extremely unwelcome - and have to pay - down there. The reception staff in the spa are very rude. The breakfast is very expensive and very poor - the hot items are badly / over cooked and the cold items looked exactly the same for the three mornings of our most recent visit stuck to the plates. The gimmicky metal wardrobes in the bedrooms have been the same for years but are not much use - the token glass sliding wardribe door in our room had vanished. The recently added minibar fridge will probably cook your netbook and other electronic gear because the room safe is directly above it - and they have scrapped the free chilled bottled water that used to be available on all the landings. This hotel actually has very few facilities yet you are paying as much as 5* straight hotels in the centre of Barcelona for a now non-existent gay ambience. The extended ground floor bar is cold, the music is too loud and the drinks prices are outrageous for perfunctory service. I think we have just about decided to stay elsewhere in future.

I liked the Axel the first time, but I love it now. Ricardo at the front desk was terrific. Coming from New York, our plane landed early morning and we arrived at the hotel before any rooms were available for check in. He secured our luggage, gave us the WIFI password to have an internet connection, and advised us to get something to eat, then relax at the rooftop pool deck, and that our room would be ready no later than 2pm. We wound up getting some sun and a very refreshing nap up on the pool deck, and when we checked on the room status around 3pm, Ricardo informed us that it was ready and he had upgraded our room to a higher category. We LOVED the room. It had obviously been recently renovated, had a super-comfortable king bed, and a fantastic view out onto the street and the beautiful spanish architecture of the area. The hotel and the room had every amenity one could need. The gym/spa is fantastic, the pool deck becomes a lounge at night and is the perfect place to have a drink or three. The only downside to this trip was the the hotel no longer provides complimentary bottled water on each floor. This was a nice touch, that I think should be reinstated. But there are convenience stores nearby and a 1.5 litre bottle of water is only 1.5 Euro. The Axel is perfectly located in Barcelona. It's just a short walk to the the subway (for quick runs around the city) or the RENFE lines (if you want to check out Sitges or other places in Spain).

There are many shops, cafes, restaurants and bars very close by, and it is only three blocks from the nearest metro stop. The main Placa Catalunya and La Ramblas are only a 10-15 minute walk away, and the area surrounding the hotel has numerous interesting buildings and places, so one is never short of compelling sites. There are fabulous views from the roof of the hotel. There can be fewer better locations in the city. Axel has the great virtue of not being unduly noisy. The streets surrounding the hotel are busy but once one is inside the hotel, one is genuinely insulated from the traffic and the activity of the streets. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the intersection of two streets, so I initially expected that it was going to be a very disturbed stay. Fortunately I was wrong. The room we had was small but well organised and well appointed, and both the room and the bathroom were immaculately clean. Facilities were modern; the bed was very comfortable; the shower was excellent; bathroom amenities were generous and more than sufficient; the wi-fi was fast and presented no problems; the airconditioning was good; the television worked well. The gym downstairs was well equipped. I have no complaints of any kind. Perhaps the greatest strength of the hotel, however, is its exceptional staff. I have stayed in places calling themselves a 'gay hotel' before, and often this has meant that one needs to tolerate second-rate service or facilities in the interests of supporting gay causes or gay businesses. (Axel is not exclusively gay, but through its marketing and publicity certainly probably attracts a fairly high proportion of gay guests. It advertises itself as 'hetero-friendly', and I have no doubt succeeds in that; I observed all guests being treated with great professionalism.) All too many gay businesses seem to regard they deserve support in spite of offering sub-standard facilities or service, and often overcharge for the privilege too. From the second of beginning the check-in process, I experienced nothing but highly professional, efficient and friendly service. The facilities of the hotel were well explained. The staff spoke good English (which I discovered was unusual in Spain). Room service was calm and speedy. I regretably had to cut our visit short as a friend in Barcelona was extremely offended that we were not staying privately in his apartment, so in the interests of harmonious friendship we decided to move for the second half of our visit. The change involved some negotiation, as our reservation had been made through a booking website rather than the hotel itself, and full payment for the original booking was made on arrival. The Axel staff assisted in contacting the original agents, completing the necessary paperwork, and organising everything. Within 24 hours of departure a refund on the nights initially booked but not used at very short notice was in my credit card account, with no charge or fee. I regard both the way in which this was handled as well as the fact that I was only charged for the nights we stayed as extraordinary service.

We were understandably happy to be starting our trip and were all smiles and Hi's, non were returned, a little pleasantry goes a long way. After what must have been 20 minutes or more were were given our key, no info on the hotel, breakfast, rooftop bar, offer of map, location advice etc only info on the spa facilities and treatments?

I explained to the Check in Clerk, (The same one who had dealt with us moments before) that the room stank of cigarette smoke, he said that 'the hotel is Non Smoking so...'

It seems this lack of attention has been noted by other TA reviewers and is brining this hotel down. I would not be moved to return unless I notice a reported change in what appears to be a Don't Care attitude. I must say that having had a really great experience on our previous visit the benchmark had been set high but if you are coming on a first visit Don't expect all 4 star rooms, Service or Assistance and compare the price to other NON Gay hotels and you will be making a fair comparison. The Axel is trading of its past glory. The prices have come down but I would be happy to have paid more and had our previous experience repeated. Also I noticed that the fridges filled with bottle water for guests have been removed and one of our towels was a bit thread bare, a few more symptoms maybe??

We were on the 2nd floor. Noise level was not bad with the doors closed given our proximity to the road. Really large bedroom (looks renovated since our last visit there) with a very swanky lobby. The pool/bar area on the roof was very nice and expanded since our last stay there. Location was also great and we walked everywhere, including to/from the Renfe Train stop. Wifi internet was accessible and fine for surfing, but too slow to accomodate use of Skype (even just audio) - either that or they were blocking VoIP. No problems with checkin/checkout. One of the nicest/largest hotel gyms we've ever visited (one tip: bring your own gym towel from your room to use in the gym; they don't tell you you have to bring your own, and the front desk of the gym might give you grief for trying to get one from them; the lady manning the gym desk was nice enough to make an exception and provide us with some gym towels to use). The mini-bottles of free water they used to provide (when we last stayed there years ago) were no longer offered. The elevators are CONFUSING there - there are multiple elevators in every hallway, and only particular elevators will go to the basement/gym, and particular ones will go to the roof/pool/bar. There were no markings however telling you which goes to which until you get into the elevator. Unfortunately there were several pretty huge negatives that will give us second thoughts about staying there next time. The two biggest ones were smell and cleanliness in our rooms. The room, when we entered, was SO heavily perfumed that we were literally choking. Imagine the perfume section of your local department store like Macys/Bloomingdales, and then amplify that 10fold. We are not kidding, it was so bad we opened up all the windows/doors for hours deciding that we'd prefer the smoggy air of the traffic below over the perfume. Surprisingly, the heavy perfume scent in our room did not go away and only decreased by about half with the windows opened - so we wonder if that scent was actually being pumped into the room from the vents? In any case, it smelled like someone had been smoking there and was trying to cover it up. The second big issue for us was cleanliness of the bathroom: there was mold around the bathtub and the ceiling tiles were similarly moldy. It was such a shame as the rest of the room was fairly clean, and the bathroom (all in white) would have otherwise been quite stunning. So, sadly, after this stay despite our typical preference for Axel hotels, the heavy room scent, moldy bathroom, and Skype-incapable wifi means we will most likely try a different hotel next time (maybe the W that we saw towards the water from the rooftop?).", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "united kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery descrete - underated\u201d", "Author": "imduk", "ReviewID": "UR115815147", "Content": "This hotel is advertised as a hetro friendly hotel - this shouldnt put you off - firstly the downside - Checkin - after 2 pm - can be a problem if you are on an early arival - however the hotel do store your bags - anyway now the good points - Reception - minimalistic in looks - service good and efficient Bedrooms - Stylish, comfortable - fantastic pillows - very clean - great flat screen TV's Roof top pool - on the small side but big enough - great sunbathing area a nd fantastic bar - not the cheapest but not expensive - remember its a hotel in a major city Parking - its Barcelona - if you can dont take a car - but if you have to there is a car park near bye \u00a325 euro for 24 hours The hotel rates it self as a 3 star - I stayed in 5 star hotels what are not as good as this hotel - opposite the hotel is a great tapas restaurant - reasonably priced but great food - Overall a very good hotel", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and service\u201d", "Author": "texasbrian", "ReviewID": "UR115772360", "Content": "This was an incredible place to have stayed while visiting Barcelona.

There was a lot of hype about the hotel both from the gay community and the hospitality industry. Everyone knows gay consumers are most difficult to please in hospitality, especially at 4 and 5 star hotels. The hotel has a beautiful classic facade, with impressive views at night, made even more dramatic as the building sits on a corner of an intersection. I returned to the Axel almost 5 years after my previous stay, having learned that the hotel underwent major renovations in 2010 and that some important improvements were made such as adding a gym and enlarging the SPA. I was pleased to discover the customer service level has greatly improved, especially Front Office, Kitchen (main restaurant) and Sky Bar. Housekeeping is as slow as it was during my last stay and after cleaning rooms have a strong choloride smell. I was not at all impressed with the renovation of the public spaces. In 2006, they were indeed fashionable, cutting edge and contemporary. Today, the lobby looks lackluster and the black tall plastic chairs with the black curtains hardly make the welcoming area quite cold, more resembling of an entrance to a night club. On the roof top, again the bar looks very dark and the wooden floors have been painted dark brown. What used to be a small swimming pool is today a very small plunge pool. As a central design point of the hotel. I was expecting owners to pay more attention to the roof top. As for the rooms, they are small, really small (as they used to). I thought the renovation would be a great opportunity to increase the size of some rooms, especially the ones facing the inner courtyard, which are so dark they barely have any natural light. The renovation in the rooms consisted mostly in changing the wallpaper, curtians and floors. All lighting is the same as it was in 2006 and so is TV, a rather small size LCD. Towels and bathrobes (therwise sold for 50 euro!) look used, many even torn and bathroom amenities are generic ones, with 100% artificial ingredients....in a gay hotel ! Many guests I have met during my previous stay and my current stay, said they opted for the hotel to enjoy the parties and networking with other guests. Unfortunately, there are no major improvements on this front either. Same weekly parties take place, week after week and unless people spend time in the Jacuzzi, there are no other major networking options. The hotel did implement AxelPeople, a sort of an ''inhouse facebook'' where guests are invited to create their own profile and network with each other. During my stay, I hardly saw 2 people online at a time, plus I would suppose some did not have their laptops or simply did not find it interesting. Concierge should do much more about promoting events which take place in the city - maybe send a daily calendar by email or a print version. I would suggest one major event per week, especially in highseason, instead of 3 or 4 events as they are doing now. Also, given the size of rooms, facilities, the hotel is overpriced ! (breakfast is never included). I booked a City room (standard room) and I was told I was given an upgrade to a Premier Room (slightly larger in size) but overlooking the inner courtyard. I wanted the same Premier Room category facing outwards, and I had to pay a premium for the upgrade.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cAxel losing it's appeal\u201d", "Author": "tjtraveller_11", "ReviewID": "UR115633225", "Content": "The Axel Hotel Barcelona has definitely lost what used to be a hip and friendly edge.

One the one hand, the building is very nice and the location is good. The rooms are also pretty decent, but (like most hotels) show signs of wear and tear. On the other hand, we could not help but feel that the gay aspect of the hotel was very oversold. We chose this hotel ONLY because it was marketed as a gay destination, but to our great disappointment, we discovered that it is not what it was described to be. The first day of our arrival, there was a party on the roof that we were told about at check-in. When we got to the roof, though, it was full of very young women and heterosexuals. The few gays who showed up with us felt markedly out of place. For the rest of our stay, we ran into more women and heterosexuals on the roof bar and in the hotel. The Axel markets itself as \"hetero-friendly,\" but based on our experiences, it would be more appropriate to call it \"gay friendly.\" I certainly don't think any hotel should close itself off entirely to any group of people and I'm not complaining that they let people other than gay men in (I'm not advocating discrimination!)--my issue is that I felt deceived by the way the hotel is marketed. Just don't go expecting an overly gay experience. One of our other major complaints is that the roof bar was hardly ever open! I can think of at least a half dozen times on our trip where I would have bought drinks, but couldn't because the bar was closed. Thus, we ended up spending our money elsewhere. It wasn't like we were there at odd times either--you'd think any hotel bar would be open at 6:00 PM! However, the bar apparently closes for several hours between the afternoon and evening shifts. It didn't matter to me whether the downstairs bar was open (it might have been)--I wanted to enjoy the roof deck and the views. If I wanted to have a drink in a dark corner, I could go anywhere else. It really makes no sense to me why the roof bar isn't open throughout the day. And speaking of the roof, can you guys make the outdoor hot tub warmer? The water was so cold on our last day that we couldn't even get in. On the rare occasions they were working, the bartenders were not particularly friendly or helpful, and they would often disappear for long periods of time, making it difficult to get a drink. Other staff could have used a lesson in customer service as well. The only really friendly employees were the maids. I should also note that the spa is beautiful, but is apparently never used. I was there for a few hours for a treatment and relaxation and didn't see a single other person. I'm not complaining about my time in the spa--it just seems like a waste that it's not utilized. Perhaps they should charge less for it? Lastly (as other reviewers have mentioned), the WiFi service was completely unreliable for our entire stay. We had to move around the room until we found a signal and stay put to keep a connection, but even then, we\u2019d lose it after a few minutes. Useless and not worth the price at all. In short, the Axel isn't a gay hotel--it's just gay-friendly. And if gay-friendly is what you're after, there are a ton of choices in Barcelona.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel close to centre and straight friendly\u201d", "Author": "tankerton1944", "ReviewID": "UR114899684", "Content": "Walking distance to Ramblas.

The hotel was expensive but as it was going to be the last two nights of our holiday we thought we could splash out. The hotel turned out to be a cross between an expensive knocking shop and a gay sauna. Certainly it was not designed for heteros or couples. It is where rich men go to meet other rich men for sex or spoil much younger men. Being simply a gay couple who had come to see Barcelona and use the hotel for accommodation was greeted with some surprise from fellow guests. The roof top pool is no more than a few inches deep and is somewhere to be seen by those relaxing on sun loungers rather than something to swim in.

The pool on the rooftop desk was closed as it was out of season when we stayed here in December 2010. We did try the breakfast one day at 16 EUROS. It was adequate but a bit overpriced for what was offered. It is a continental style buffet menu with fresh juices and fruit, scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, cheeses, cereals, yogurt, and a hot beverage of your choice. We did not try the restaurant in the hotel for dinner. There is a bar as well on the ground floor.

Hotel Image: The hotel slogan of \"hetro friendly\" is now just a brand image - the reality is that as a gay guy with partner i felt overwhelmed by the number of hetro families with children. Staying there: Generally clean comfortable and pleasant - everything the hotel used to be. However my advice is get down to breakfast early before the choice from the buffet rapidly diminishes! They also played loud pop music in the breakfast room which included lyrics containing a range of 4-letter swear words! Nice! Wellness Area: Parts of the the new 'wellness' area were (already) being repaired during my stay and were out of use. When open again, the Wellness area was relatively empty except for hetro couples. The wellness area is regularly monitored by staff to ensure everything is in order. Overall: The hotel continues to offer high standards and trend setting design.

No worries about the staff speaking English (although I used a few Catalan phases that seemed to go down well). We were immediately upgraded when we said it was out first visit (tip) into a very nice 'superior' room with a balcony. Some might say the street noise is audible a bit, but to be fair we hardly noticed it. There are smoking facilities on the second floor patio area and the bar downstairs was very nice with an outside (arch covered) smoking area as well. We also used the cafe across the road Lorenza (cheapest coffee 3 euros for two!!) and the staff were very friendly. We had breakfast in the hotel and it was just the same as any holiday hotel with hot and cold buffet, toast tea etc..(but a bit pricey, but I've paid the same/more in London 14-16 euros each.). Would I go back? yes. There are some hotels on and around the Ramblas, but I liked the stroll down into the Plazas (5-10 minutes) and I didn't feel as edgy as I did in the Ramblas area! I know the Ramblas is a people watcher area, but I wasn't sure the right people were watching me (be aware you will look like a tourist)! (nice to be a few blocks back). This time of year was quiet (good) and I forgot most of the shops close on a Sunday (good for them). Had a night in the Axel bar and it seemed to be popular with both gay men and gay women (which helped me enjoy it more). quite a few women coules staying thee at the same time from Manchester) Most of the people I met were only too pleased to help and didn't mind the fact I have virtually no Spanish (but if you can use French, that seemed to get me half way there). Like any city break a few days is not enough to to see everything, but we have used the tour bus (22 euros ish) in the past and it takes you to all the major attractions and you can hop on and off wherever you like. The Barcelona Card is pricey(not useable on the tour buses) and we used it this time and it paid for itself in reductions to the museums/art exhibitions/Metro and red public buses after a day (and you don't need to worry about buying tickets all the time). I read a few reviews before I went and I think they were mostly correct, but it tried to be plush and modern and I think it succeeds and for that you might have to pay a bit more than the lesser hotels. So in conclusion will I stay there again in September on the way back from Sitges..YES. PS(47 euro for 200 Malboro gold, might be just as well buying them at the airport now on the way back).

We had booked the room several months ago, and after seeing many advertisements for your hotel in gay magazines such as Tetu, here in France, as well as exploring the website, we were really looking forward to our stay. Exterior of the building: The building is not illuminated like on the website. We did not recognize the building at all. Check-in: With the exception of one person, reception staff was depressing and stoic. No \u201chello\u201d no \u201cwelcome\u201d, no \u201cthank you\u201d, and certainly no smiles. More like a funeral parlor staff than a hotel reception. We were also informed that our reservation was lost. Room 302: Complete disappointment, to the point that we wondered if we had checked into the wrong hotel! The room was dark and unwelcoming. View from the room is on the rooms across the courtyard, at less than 10 meters, and absolutely no sunlight. There is no sheer curtain, only a blackout curtain, which given the vis-\u00e0-vis, we had to keep closed all the time. The \u201cking size\u201d bed was two single beds pushed together, and the sheets did not even cover the entire mattress. We found the wall paper and room decoration to be very outdated. The lighting in the room really needs improvement. Neon lights that either all on or all off make the room cold and very unromantic. In the bathroom, the toilet does not stop running and there is mold in the joints in the shower. The day of check-in, the cleaning staff entered the room at 4pm without knocking while we were in bed. At night, impossible to sleep because of the music from the bar. Overall, we feel that the hotel was missing so many thing that would have made the 105\u20ac we spent on the room seem worth it. The rooms could be so much better designed and details would make it a much more romantic and enjoyable experience for a couple.

I stayed at Axel few years back and thought it was a reasonable hotel. Good location and nice roof terrace. I imagined that after the recent renovation it had become something special, but, unfortunately, not entirely true. They added one floor where the new pool terrace is situated. It's much better than before, both during the day and at the evenings (especially Wednesday-Sunday parties). Where the terrace was previously located one floor below, there are now 4 new suites, which have very large terraces (apart from room 701 which only has a small terrace). The terrace was fabulous (ours was the corner terrace) with sun loungers, nice dining area and cool lightening. If it wouldn\u2019t have been for the terrace, I don\u2019t think we would have stayed so long! The suite itself was nothing to write home about. Cheap furniture and decoration. Thought I had walked into an IKEA store. Floors of cheap light pine look-alike material. Furniture similar light pine material. No decorations, and already bit of wear and tear. Bed was ok, but pillows hard as stone. The hotel does not offer any alternative softer pillows. No blanket for the bead, only the bed sheets which became a problem. The floor-to-ceiling windows were obviously a great feature and the curtains effectively blocked out all the light in the morning (and no disturbance from the traffic). But they didn\u2019t block out the heat from the sun! So, around 10 in the morning the whole suite was boiling! The AC was by far effective enough. Some sort of remedy was to keep AC on coldest temperature during the night; with result we froze during the night due to lack of a blanket (only managed to get an old moldy blanket after the weekend). The bathroom was fine with a shower, bathtub and separate toilette, but the amenities were minuscule and there was no soap dish or anything else to place them in the shower. Most of the staff at the reception were really snobbish and not overwhelming enthusiastic. No help with the luggage. Concierge service? When? Think saw him most of the time during the evening parties on the terrace. The majority of the other staff was great and very friendly. Room service was good. Nice cocktails and food satisfactory, but nothing spectacular. The hotel had a great gym! Another stunning experience was on our final day. Our flight left in the evening. Since hotel wasn\u2019t full we asked to keep our room. It was free of charge until 2 pm but after that we would have to pay 50% of the daily room charge. We asked if we could take a shower in the gym before leaving and it was ok, for an Euro 25 charge per person. Or we could, free of charge (how generous!), use the open shower on terrace next to the pool, and change in the toilette!! Oh my God! To conclude: I\u2019m not sure the huge terrace in the suite can make up for the price the hotel is charging (in level with some 5 star hotels in the neighborhood).

Yes, the hotel has some things going for it ... but multiple little things became quite annoying ... such as 1) one very small bar of soap per room, slightly larger than a postage stamp, which is fewer and smaller than the two condom packages conveniently provided (had to ask for more soap, though I noticed condoms were replaced readily, without having to ask) 2) absence of any blankets or bedspreads (had to ask twice, before finally going downstairs to main desk to request one, which was provided reluctantly) 3) only two smallish size bath/shower towels per room (which were harder to come by than the large beach towels on the sun deck) 4) sporadic, infrequent availability of a concierge to make dinner reservations, even during the daytime 5) tacitly facilitated cruising areas... If you're looking for a gay experience, and can tolerate the attitude and inconsistent service and amenities ... this spot may satisfy please you. If you are not youngish and gay ... or if you're an experienced traveler who looking for something more than a trendy, glorified bath-house, skip the Axel ... and stay at one of the nicer hotels in Barcelona that understand how to satisfy and indulge a traveler.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cOn The Whole, Really Good\u201d", "Author": "KiwiWithWings80", "ReviewID": "UR77559605", "Content": "Aside from a checkin hiccup, we were very impressed.

I myself was one of the first - if not the actual first - guest to check into the hotel when they reopened on May 5th. Yes, construction was apparent and, yes, all hotel ammenities were not readily available (pool, bar, spa, etc.) but all of this was made very clear to me by Axel Hotel before my arrival at the hotel. That said, I don't think it's very fair to damn the hotel for the ongoing construction. Other reviews here may chose to, but I certainly won't. As for the hotel itself, I was very impressed. I spent a total of 6 nights at the hotel, the first of which was spent in a room a bit to close to an active construction site. I brought my concern to the hotel staff and was immediately upgraded to a street-view room with a balcony overlooking the beautiful city street. Was I happy? Of course I was. The room was spacious, clean, stylish, and very modern. I couldn't be happier... or so I thought. The next morning I had breakfast in Kitchen, the hotel's restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed with the spread - fresh rolls, meats, cheeses, cereals, yogurts, fruits, juices - you name it, they had it. (Breakfast was included in my package deal - I was charged in error a couple times, but I'm confident this will be rectified by Axel when I contact them.) Later in the day, I requested some ice in my room. A few minutes later one of the hotel's staff (Anthony I believe his name was - very nice young man) arrived with ice... and a complimentary bottle of champagne. Who can complain about this? Not me. On another occasion, I mentioned to the hotel staff that I would have liked to have used their gym had it been open. They quickly provided me with a free day pass to a nearby health club. I went and was very satisfied with the facility. Fast forward a few days later. I was having a conversation with Anton, a very nice young man working the front desk, and I had explained to him how my iPhone had been stolen from me while walking around Barcelona. Low and behold, he told me that an iPhone had been found at the hotel and, much to my surprise and gratitude, I had my much needed phone back in my possession. I could not have been more grateful. Overall the staff at this hotel was amazingly competent and hospitable. I was especially impressed with Ricardo and Anton who assisted and advised me on several occasions throughout my stay at Axel Hotel. I also had the pleasure of meeting the general manager - he, too, made made stay at Axel a very pleasant and memorable experience - despite the construction and lack of ammenities available. Would I return to Axel? Of course I would. Would I have liked to enjoy the rooftop bar, an elevator ride to my room, or a day at the spa while staying at the hotel? Well, yes, of course. But let me tell you, Axel did more that I ever expected to meet my needs while I was a guest at their facility.

I was persuaded by many of the reviews on here to book this hotel, and was greatly looking forward to my trip. Unfortunately for the first three days of my hard earned break I was booked into a four star hotel 20 minutes walk away from all the action. This was because their refurbishment works went over schedule. When I did finally check in to Axel the building works were still going on. It was like Fawlty Towers...Workmen (not the sexy type unfortunately) were banging everywhere. There was lots of noise and building dust. Lifts weren't working. Pool/spa area was off limits. Women were running around everywhere trying their best to hoover up. You get the picture. It was all a bit farcical. I was a disappointed bunny. A couple of other gripes...ordinarily you have to pay for internet access in your room. (I was generously let off). When will hotels get the fact that this is a huge irritant for people who are already paying a hefty amount for the privilege of being in the hotel. I just don't understand how hotels can charge for this simple service. C'mon guys - wake up and smell the coffee. The mitigating factor is that the staff were pretty helpful (especially the very cute lad who humps bags all over the pace - he should be a Colt model). I could see in the faces of the staff that they knew the hotel had opened too early. They were making the best of a bad situation. Although they were too professional to say, I think the blame for my poor experience lays with the managements for: a) not project managing the refit properly, b) greedily opening up shop even when the work wasn't finished. I mean, hello, do you think paying customers are stupid? It would have been nice to receive proper compensation for my inconvenience eg: a five star hotel would have been better than a four star, and an automatic upgrade to something fantastic on arrival in Axel would have been the least that could have been done. I have to say I could have got something much better in Barcelona for what I eventually paid. The overall impression I'm left with is of a rather amateurish business that doesn't deserve to charge the rates they do. To put things right shouldn't take much. A bit of leadership is all that's needed. You should also be aware, fellow traveller, that this is a city centre hotel, with all the accompanying car noise right outside your window to enjoy.

The hotel staff are very nice, very helpful and multilingual. But that is all the good news there is. The room -- at least mine -- was terribly inadequate, spartan to the extreme with the only good feature being the bed. It actually felt like a cheap sex hotel when in the room -- no place to sit down, no surfaces on which to put anything, a silly wardrobe, 2 uncomfortable plastic chairs, and a bathroom that when in the shower 3 cm of water ends up on the entire bathroom floor -- a severe safety hazard. The street noise is constant and loud. The head maid was very intrusive, never waiting more than 2 seconds before barging into the room -- very unwelcome and unprofessional. The breakfast is NOT worth the price. Go across the street to the little cafe for better food at 1/4 the price. The bar is ok, modern and trendy. The lobby nice.

Right from the moment my companion and I sauntered through the glass doors of the main entrance-which are enclosed in a beautifully appointed fa\u00e7ade, to the time we regrettably had to say our farewells, we were whisked away into a world of complete bliss at the hands of our hosts. The interior is quite welcoming\u2014a simple reception counter within a cozy lounge and acceptance/waiting area, and a restaurant (Kitchen by Axel) and bar (Underground by Axel) off to the right. The design is decidedly modern (trendy, yet nuanced with elegance \u2013 sort of W-esque), and the staff, who tend to be versatile in their disciplines (can sometimes be seen shuffling between bar and restaurant) couldn\u2019t be any more delightful. Rooms are located on floors 1-5 and suites on the 6th Fl and are mostly garden or street (with terrace) views. These are accessible by elevator\u2014or, for the more athletically inclined patron, a staircase is also at your disclosure. You\u2019d also be happy to learn that there\u2019s a pretty decent gym on the very top floor as well. For those who prefer to lounge on holiday\u2014or maybe opt for a little bit of wellness, Axel is equipped with SPA essentials\u2014Jacuzzi, steam and dry sauna and, a swimming pool on the roof deck. Though, don\u2019t expect to do laps here and, if you happen to be visiting in non-summer months (as I was) the water may be a little chilly as the pool isn\u2019t currently heated. Get online if you have your laptop w/ you by having wi-fi connection activated in your room (\u20ac6 for 24 hrs) or feel free to jump on one of the terminals located on the second floor\u2014gratis. Also, If you\u2019re dehydrated after a late night out (let\u2019s face it, you most likely will be after indulging in Barcelona\u2019s nightlife), fret not, Axel\u2019s got well stocked (with bottled water) refrigerators on each floor where you can help yourself to some H\u2082O for free. For the romantics, breakfast can be served in bed (place your order the night before) or if getting out of bed isn\u2019t too much of a bother [insert raucous laughter here], Kitchen serves breakfast (buffet style\u2014continental and hot for \u20ac16 per guest) till 11 AM daily. Overall, it\u2019s a very impressive and comfortable establishment for all \u2013 and very aptly and conveniently located. A point to note: Though one may immediately surmise (guilty as charged) that this is a gay hotel, all are welcome. Beyond the open reception, staff members can be seen donning T-shirts with the slogan, \u2018hetero friendly\u2019. Tip: Need more information on what to do/check-out while you\u2019re in Barcelona?

The staff were very approachable and knowledgeable of local restaurants and night life. They spoke wonderfully patient English to our broken Catalan/Spanish and were always willing to accommodate with suggestions, maps, and directions. The breakfast was a great way to start off your day and had manageable hours. The rooms were a nice size with a comfy bed. We were upgraded at no extra charge and so our bathroom was quite spacious. Everything was clean and well kept. There was a lock box in the room for valubles, a nice rack to hang clothes, and we had a lovely juliette balcony overlooking the street. We ordered internet for our room one day and had problems and the front desk immediately fixed it for us. The upstairs lounge/pool area was nice, although the jacuzzi was broken for a couple days while we were there (but again was fixed quickly). The clientele was generally a bit older than us (us being 26 and 29); I would say mid 30's to 40's and lots of north americans. Had a chuckle: rooms come with door signs reading \"Please make up room.\", \"Please Don't Disturb.\" or \"Please Disturb\" as well as complimentary water in a fridge down the hall, maps of local gay vendors and restaurants, condoms and lubricant. Don't get me wrong though, this did not come across as a shady hotel, just pleasantly cheeky. {:O) Some minor (and I mean minor) problems; there is contruction going on next door so that was a bit loud at times, but ear plugs are provided and I ended up not really using them since it was a minor disturbance. The upstairs lounge Sky Bar seemed nice and had a cool \"atmosphere\" being outside and open to the Barcelona sky, however, the drinks are rather expensive compared to other local bars. The decor in the room was very functional but a little lacking on the style and character, and the toiletries were a bit cheapish - only mention this cause airline lost my luggage. I was booked into a massage as a gift, and although the guy was nice, the massage was expensive and wasn't great, if I'm being brutally honest. And lastly, the internet station was slow and a bit unreliable, although very useful for planning the day! The hotel also provides a very up to date selection of night life flyers, some of which offer discounts on the entry fee to clubs. We were also given free entry to one rather expensive event from the front desk one evening. Overall, this was our first \"gay hotel\" experience and it was really excellent. The staff really made our stay fantastic. The hotel is right in the heart of the gaybourhood, as well as minutes from the metro.

All of the printed materials and discounts that come with staying at the Axel were a vast surprise. The local area around the hotel was very nice as well. There are many fun and quaint shops on the same street as the hotel, as well as very festive bars, and eateries! As a young traveler (25), I feel the Axel took care of all of my needs, and then some. As a Miami beach native, everyone brings music with them to the beach. An amenity that was very invaluable was the portable iPod speakers that you could loan at the front desk.

Its breakfast buffet is excellent (though there are several cafes within a block\u2019s walk, if you\u2019d like a simpler breakfast), while its dining room serves a very good dinner at a reasonable price. The roof terrace offers delightful views of Barcelona, as well as a bar (serving snacks at lunch and in the evening), dipping-pool, sauna and fitness room with more equipment than that found at larger hotels in Spain.

The location couldn't be better. The staff, for the most part, are curteous and friendly, at the front desk. The wait staff are another story, especially in the morning. They just seemed to want people to eat and leave. Aside from the great location, and the room, overall was great, but very very expensive (350 euros a night). There were some significant problems though, just be aware: 1. small issue, but issue non the less when you're paying 350 euros a night for a hotel. The first night, we realized that they had neglected to give us a blanket or duvet for our bed! I called and asked them to bring one up, quickly, as it was late, and the front counter person said that this would be difficult as there was no one to watch the desk. I explained that for what we're paying, he could perhaps call someone. He did, but delivered a duvet for a double bed, not a king size. The next day, we received the correct size duvet; 2. In the morning, they are not very good about replenishing the food in the buffet area. Additionally, there were constantly flies all over the breads and the fresh fruit...it really did make you want to skip eating; 3. Every morning, there was a problem getting hot water. Our last day there, it was impossible. We complained and they said that there were 5 rooms that so far reported it and they were working on it. 5 rooms! We were leaving within the hour, so couldn't wait for their resolution; 4. The most significant and irritating was when they opened the roof deck to the public. It was awful. I was trying to use the jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna to sweat out toxins, and here were all of these gawkers, taking photographs, pointing at myself and the two other people in the jacuzzi!!! And, there was no one supervising these people. It felt violating and invasive. And, when I went into the steam room, at one point, two men came in, who were NOT guests...fully dressed, and they were doing drugs just outside the steam room. I opened the steam door and caught them and asked what they were doing, and they lied and said that they couldn't get cell reception elsewhere...funny, they weren't holding mobile phones. Lastly, the straight folks were going into the only bathroom in that area, 2 and 3 at a time...also extremely suspicious. And, when I retreated because I had had enough, to my room just one floor below, there were people in the stairwell fooling around! I immediately called the front desk to complain. The man was very apologetic but said that there was nothing that he could do, that he was sorry but they couldn't really supervise people on the roof deck as they were understaffed!! The next day, I met with the manager, who couldn't have seemed more disinterested. I said that they should CLOSE OFF areas of the roof deck with signs indicating 'espacio de huesped, strictemente prohibido entrar'....(guest area, strictly prohibited to enter)...or something along those lines. This was a Wednesday night - open to the public, and just an awful experience. I loved our room and view and location...but service, excluding front desk and maid, were awful...just awful. I recommend Hotel Cram, one block away, and just beautiful. It's not a gay hotel, but for what we got at the Axel, who cares!?

By definition, the Axel Hotel's \"Hetero-friendly\" catchline leads you to expect a friendly, potentially quirky-flamboyant, yet sincere, well meaning lot. Hotel Axel proves that there still exist the pretentious who give no attention to your basic requirements whilst simultaneously have an air of entitlement to your hard earned cash paying their wages. On a basic level, it took over an hour and 3 phone calls to get the missing TV remote control to my room. Another call got the WiFi (very grudgingly) activated. There is no baggage assistance, which makes things rather sweaty on a 38 degree celsius day with over 30 kg of luggage. The rooftop area you see in the pictures is actually a rather creaky facade and not somewhere you'd willingly risk your travel insurance exploring. The lift is synchronised with Halley's Comet as when you push the button you typically wait 75-76 years for the lift to arrive. Then, when it comes time to bask in the air-conditioning and pretend it's 18 degrees, there are no covers for the beds (just very basic sheets) - I had to improvise and use the pool towels as a duvet cover. All of this makes me feel like a \"niche traveller\" who is getting taken for a ride on a donation train. Had the marketing been in-line with the experience I wouldn't have minded, but the hype leads you to expect something much better. Finally... The carparking... Please, don't bother using the \"Axel Carparking\". It's not their own service and it's about a block away from the hotel. I was abused by the carparking attendant for using the Axel-supplied parking voucher and they wouldn't release my car. I'm still struggling to reconcile the event and the logic involved. The resolution was to pay a 25 euro \"fine\", at which point I checked out of the Hotel. Although the carpark was in no part affiliated with the hotel, one does expect such an establishment to at least vet the services that they either endorse or sub-market. The best points are the location and the bar tender who knows how to make a good drink. I do recommend the cocktail menu as the accuracy of preparation and the method used are tip top. They have quite impressively inserted possibly one of spains best cocktail bars into their establishment. Please note, this is based purely on the QUALITY of the finished product.

We entered our room and I checked the bed for signs of bed bugs, as I do in every hotel we stay in, and found nothing on the mattress. Fortunately I looked up and saw that the top of the head board was covered in little black spots. This is the first sign of bed bugs! The black spots are actually the blood droppings of the bed bugs after they feed. I quickly told my partner not to touch anything! I proceeded to the other side of the bed and saw on top of the head board, just inside the crack, a huge bed bug just waiting. My partner proceeded to get the trash can liner from the bathroom and pushed the bed bug inside of it. He then killed it and we went down to the lobby to check out. We explained to the front desk that the head board was infested with bed bugs and we gave him the liner containing the bed bug and blood.

I don't know of any urban gay hotel that comes close to the Axel. I only wish there was a gay hotel this nice in New York, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, London, Rome, or any other major city. (This same company has opened an Axel Hotel in Buenos Aires and in Berlin; I have not visited either of those.) Most times gay hotels are a huge compromise. The Axel is sophisticated, modern, well-located, extremely clean, well-appointed, and a perfect choice. The only gay accommodations that might rival it are the best properties in Palm Springs and Fort Lauderdale, but they are not urban hotels and for a different purpose. I stayed at the Axel for five nights, April 4-9, 2009. My room (their most basic one) was plenty nice, the bed was great, the bathroom very nice. It had a king sized bed, and the space of the room was admittedly small, but since I was staying there alone, this was not a problem. It was no smaller than most city hotel rooms in Europe. If you had two people to a room, you might consider an upgrade to a more deluxe and larger room. The rooms are soundproof. The only noise you hear is coming from outside (some construction, which is completely beyond the control of the hotel, of course). The staff is great. They all speak English. (I am American and speak no Spanish or Catalan.) They are happy to give any kind of advice asked. They'll tell you about sightseeing or where the underwear party is that night or whatever. The restaurant is very good. I ate dinner there twice and found the food to be pretty sophisticated. The rooftop bar area is great. I can imagine that in warmer weather it would be a terrific hangout. The pool is lovely but small, but it's just for cooling off, not doing olympic sized laps, after all. There is a jacuzzi, a small but adequate gym, and a small sauna and steamroom. For a hotel this size, the amenities are unusually good in this regard. The wireless internet in the room was cheap by hotel standards (6 Euros a day), and was fast and worked well and reliably. (Not the case in many hotels, I have found.) If you are traveling without a laptop (I had a laptop with me), there is internet available for a charge in the room with a keyboard that works with the TV, and also a business center with internet available free of charge. I was told by the staff that 90% of the clientele is gay. I suppose some broadminded straight folks would stay there, maybe to be in a place where children are unlikely. The location is good, a 10 minute walk to La Rambla, and a shorter walk to the metro. I took the Aerobus from the airport and back to the airport, and it was a short walk each time to the bus. (Note that the drop off point from the airport is not the same as the pickup point. The hotel staff can explain this.) There are gay bars and shops very close to the hotel. This is definitely in the gay section of Barcelona, but the gay presence is a little more toned down than in Chelsea in NYC, or Boystown in Chicago.

I booked for three nights mid-week and despite paying a single rate was given a reasonably sized double room. The clinical whiteness of the room was a little overdone (the only relief afforded by the black slim-line TV) but everything was clean and in good working order. The bathroom had a decent 'monsoon' shower and separate hand held nozzle for all those hard to reach places. A free facility on offer was an i-pod docking station, which was much welcome as music CDs on the TV came at rather a hefty charge. The room service was done properly, although, oddly, one of the door hangers actually said Do Disturb. This being a gay-orientated establishment I wasn't terribly sure whether this was a typographical error or not! With regard to the Spa complex - I had this to myself. The gym is a little small and would only contain 3 people comfortably but are you really on holiday to have a work out? The sauna and steam are both fine and the jacuzzi delighful (though it would have been better shared with someone tactile but that's life). This being December I can only confirm that the plunge pool is at least more than ankle deep. I also booked a massage through the hotel and this was provided by a very professional Venezualan who was both handsome and friendly (so it can happen). I had a full hour for EUR70 but there were no extras - so you may find better value and possibly extras at one of the saunas where the going rate is in the region of EUR40/hr. I unfortunately was unable to research this matter as some kindly gentleman availed himself of my wallet and all its contents on the metro. This was from the inside zipped (albeit exposed) pocket of my overcoat. If you're going to BCN take and use a money belt. Don't be poorer but wiser after the event like me (sob!). The downside to the hotel, if there has to be one, is that my 5th floor room overlooked the front of the hotel. This may have had a nice view from the miniscule balcony (which vertigo prevented me from venturing onto) but it also meant lots of traffic noise. This being Spain, where every road is a race track, the noise did not abate at any time - day or night. Clearly the seal on the double glazed doors of this particular room needs replacing. If this is likely to concern you you may be best asking for a room at the back. On the upside the hotel is located fairly centrally to all the main sites and is also within walking distance of most of the gay establishments. I didn't sample the breakfast as a coffee and a croissant suffice for me but the lunchtime menu looked terrific value (i was usually having my croissant at about this time, however). Finally the A1 (Blue) Airport bus costs EUR4.05 for a single trip. Note that the only central boarding point is located outside El Corte Ingles in the Placa de Catalunya and the journey from there to the Airport took 40 minutes not the 20 minutes that I was advised by the hotel. Bear in mind that this may take longer in high season/at weekends especially if you live your life like the White Rabbit..........", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Does NOT Live up to Expectations\u201d", "Author": "wehodavid", "ReviewID": "UR21751871", "Content": "After staying a week in Madrid at the Intercontinental Hotel, I was really looking forward to visiting Barcelona for two days and staying at the Axel Hotel. This boutique hotel advertises itself as \"Hetero-Friendly\" and as such markets itself to the gay community. I arrived mid-afternoon with my roll-aboard bag and noticed the stairs inside the front door of the lobby. Hmmm. No ramp. Ok, so it's not exactly ADA compliant but, hey, we're in Spain not the U.S. So check- in goes quickly and I'm off to my room. I open the door and immediately smell the odor of mildew. Not good. I shut the door and call the front-desk. The hotel is booked and there are no other rooms. Hmmm. Ok, so I open the balcony doors. At least I can let in some fresh air. I check out the bathroom. The room itself is one open room divided by the glass-walled jacuzzi bathtub/shower. I notice the mold growing on the perforated ceiling of the bathroom. That's where that smell is coming from! So, I take a shower after my afternoon of travel and notice that there is a large pool of water on the bathroom floor afterward. It seems the short glass partition on the side of the tub isn't long enough to contain the water splashing out of the shower. So I throw a towel down to soak up the puddle. I begin to notice the little things at this point. Doors not aligned, screws missing, wallpaper peeling, dirty marks on the walls. It is apparent that this hotel USED to be quite modern and chic. However, it's showing it's age and isn't well kept. I checked out the rooftop Spa/Pool/Gym. The pool is tiny though I didn't select this hotel for that. The Gym is inadequate though again I didn't select this hotel for that either. I didn't get the chance to try the restaurant/bar since there were so many good restaurants in the area. The one thing this hotel has going for it is its location. It's an easy walk to the metro and many sites. One of the other annoyances is that to book this hotel, you must pre-pay for at least one night. This is far from industry-norm.

We used the reviews on tripadvisor in order to select this particular hotel, and were a bit concerned that the Axel might be a little too \"hip\" for our rather conservative/retiring tastes. It was not. We were also aware of previously expressed negative comments regarding service and quality of rooms. Again, at least in our experience, these criticisms seem unfounded. The staff were uniformly pleasant, efficient, and helpful, and our standard room on the 5th floor was in excellent shape, clean, and quite satisfactory. Our room faced the street-side, which is our preference, and did allow some street noise to enter the room, but it was not enough to be of concern to us. The room included both slippers and terry-cloth robes, as well as regularly replenished toiletries, towels, etc... The glassed-in shower was large, with beautiful Euro-style fixtures/hardware. And as mentioned in a few previous posts, the bed was unusually comfortable. On the downside there were not enough resting places for luggage: a folding luggage rack would have been helpful. We had to pay nightly for Wifi in our room (6 Euro per night), but the access speed was very quick (much faster than our home DSL uplink). We ate one night at the hotel's restaurant and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and friendly service. (We had the mushroom-cheese risotta and Argentine steak which were both delicious.) It surprises me that more people do not mention how nice the roof-top lounge area is with pool, hot-tub, exercise room (with treadmill, free-weights, weight-machine, etc...), sauna, steam room, and inviting lounging areas. A few quibbles here: the hot-tub is a bit small and shallow, and as mentioned elsewhere the pool is just for dipping - sufficient for cooling off after a nice sauna. One other unexpected surprise was the enjoyment we obtained from meeting with our fellow travellers at this hotel: a mixed, interesting, and congenial group, (this based on just a couple of communications we made). A few other pluses: our plumbing, air-conditioning, the elevator, were all in good working order; early wake-up call and taxi-arrangements to the airport - all without incident. (An aside regarding laundromats: the ones we were directed to were several long blocks away from the hotel and of only mediocre quality. If you are doing a multi-city trip as we did, it may be easier to get your self-service laundry done elsewhere.)

A refrigerator on each floor stocked with cold water for whenever you wanted. Two sets of bath amenities in the bathroom. Extra large and soft towels for both the bathroom and the pool.

The Axel is a hotel that is gay and straight friendly, but caters to a mainly gay clientele. As a same-sex married couple from Canada on our honeymoon, this hotel fit the bill! We booked a city-view room (see photo). The rooms were averaged sized and, while the floors and walls looked a little worn, everything was quite clean. The hotel provided slippers for the room which was nice. The in-room safe worked well. Towels and toiletries were changed daily. One minor gripe was the hair conditioner - all the amenities are packed into these Axel coloured cube bottles that are not squeezable. The green-coloured conditioner provided was of a less fluidic consistency which made it hard to get out of the bottle. Trying to get the conditioner out of the bottle in the shower often resulted in what looked as if the Green Giant had exploded in our bathroom. Didn't use the pool upstairs but saw some people enjoying the jacuzzi. Used the gym twice upstairs - it is open to the outside air and can get very hot, so I would recommend using it early in the morning or late in the evening if you want to use the gym. Otherwise, it is adequate by hotel standards. The complimentary bottles of water in the hallways were a plus. Like a previous poster stated, it's too bad they couldn't use larger bottles as we felt like we were being wasteful going through so many small bottles. We booked our hotel stay via their Discover Axel package (one of a number of packages online). We were welcomed to our room with complimentary glasses of champagne for each of us which was a nice touch. There was a great deal of confusion during our first night of checkin (we didn't get the official drink tickets to Zelta's Club and Zelta's club was unwilling to take a handwritten note that the front desk gave us to use instead, and the Bus Turistic card wasn't included). This was quickly remedied the next morning by the front desk who had an envelope ready for us with the missing contents (though it was too late for us to use the Zelta's Club drinks by then as we had already paid for them the previous night). Our package came with complimentary wine that was delivered to our room one night which was very nice. We also had a complementary dinner in our package at the hotel's El Comedor restaurant. They asked us what time we wanted it and so we arranged it for that first nigth that we arrived. When we arrived to the restaurant, we indicated to the busboy that we had a reservation and were seated down with full menu in front of us. Unfortunately as we were about to order, we clarified with them whether we really could order from the entire menu at which point they realized we were the package-included-dinner couple who they were expecting, and had to switch our menus to the more limited choice one. The dinner was ok but frankly nothing to write home about. It was followed by a dragshow that was funny, although would have been more-so had I understood any Spanish. Our package also included wifi access. Wifi speed was very fast. However, one thing to note is that, upon login with the given user/password for our room, the connection appeared to latch on only to that first connected computer. Even if we turned off the computer, the wifi signal for some reason wouldn't recognize any other electronic device (like another computer or PDA) - only the first device that connected to it. Any subsequent device that tried to connect received a 'you are already connected' message even though the original laptop was completely turned off. Strange! The wifi signal was fast enough to do VoIP phone calls back to North America which is a plus. The included buffet breakfast was probably the brightest spot of the hotel, surprisingly. There was a large variety of foods, including eggs, prosciutto, fresh juices - the menu varied slightly each day but we were very happy with the breakfast seletction and quality. In fact, it was probably the best breakfasts we had on our European honeymoon trip. Speaking of food, if you could go to only TWO places to eat that is walking distance of this place, our first and highest recommendation would be Paco Meralgo Restaurant at 171 C/Muntaner (about 7 or 8 blocks away). We were so enthralled with the tapas there that we went back AGAIN the very next day. Paco Meralgo has to be the best kept secret for tapas now in Barcelona without the hordes of tourists (especially if you go before 9pm), stealing the crown from what's becoming the tourist trap known as Cal Pep. Just do a search on Chowhound (where we found people praising Paco Meralgo). Second place one must go - Cacao Sampaka on 292 Consell de Cent just a couple of blocks from the hotel. Their Aztec hot chocolate is a MUST-try - the thickest best hot chocolate you'll ever eat with a spoon. One last note - our package came with a Bus Turistic card for the 2 full days of our stay. My spouse and I usually shun tourist buses and never imagined we'd use it. We usually look at passing tourist buses and shudder. But boy are we ever glad we had the tourbus passes this time around. It was SO worth it to have the bus turistic card as it allowed us onto the Bus Turistic network where we got on/off the bus and got to see so much of Barcelona that we otherwise wouldn't have. The audio guided tour during each segment of the bus journey was fun to listen to. In fact we didn't even need to use the subway once the entire stay in Barcelona as the 3 intertwining Bus Turistic paths were so convenient! The coincidental inclusion of the Bus Turistic pass (which I think is normally about 26-29euros each for a 2day pass) was well worth the package deal with Hotel Axel, even without the included dinner/wifi/wine. Checkout was a breeze. We never really did figure out what the 'free gift' that was part of our package was. We asked if it was the Axel ballcaps in our rooms (it certainly wasn't labelled as such) and the front desk just said 'yeah, sure' so we took the ballcaps. To this day we have no idea if that was what the 'free gift' was or maybe they just forgot. Certainly not a big deal for us. Overall, I'd defintiely stay at the Axel again. Central location, only a couple blocks from where the Aerobus picks us up and drops us off at Universitat (in fact it's one stop before the busy Catalunya stop, so if you take the aerobus, you'll be on and seated before the massive tourists get on at Catalunya who are forced to stand all the way to the airport). Also be sure to note where the Aerobus drops you off at Universitat because it's one of the few stops that isn't clearly marked with an Aerobus sign.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time!\u201d", "Author": "piboBelgium", "ReviewID": "UR16034403", "Content": "The axel is certainly not the place to stay if you're on a budget and it is true that it is a bit overpriced.

In hindsight we may have paid a little much for something that we realized wasn't what we were looking for - \"the scene\". On Wednesday night, our first night, parades of beautiful men - mostly locals - entered the hotel and went up to their Sky Bar - a beautiful bar overlooking the city. We had a drink up there and it was crowded and a beautiful view but perhaps we were just a little older (in our 40s) than most of the crowd. There was another event on another night which made accessing the elevator difficult (and it's a slow one) as we competed with the people going up and down to the bar. That was probably our biggest complaint about the place as it wants to be more than just a hotel - but also a bar - and part of the Barcelona gay scene. And if that's what you want, the hotel is perfect. Otherwise we thought the hotel was good. The room was a bit small and storage space a little difficult. The bathroom didn't allow for much counter space. Some of these things are expected for older European hotels but this is a newer hotel with very contemporary features. The staff was always friendly and attentive and one of them gave us an excellent restaurant tip - La Flauta - for tapas. The free water on every floor was a great perk and the value of that cannot be discounted in the summer when a small bottle of water as you walk around the city will cost you 3 Euros.

Quite amusing actually. Nonetheless, the staff treated them well, as far as I could tell. Still, the hotel is definitely designed for a the gay traveler on holiday. It is not set up for business travelers, but provides a comfortable bed in a convenient part of town. (WiFi was relatively inexpensive though -- 6 euros for 24 hours.

The double, city-view room had a nice balcony, but otherwise was small and lacking in storage and surfaces on which to put things. The wire-rack storage system (shown in room photos on the web site) is clearly a cost-saving measure and lacking in functionality. There were few surfaces on which to put things, such as a glass of water, a wallet, coins, etc. Also on the negative side, they say the rooms are \"sound proof,\" and indeed the windows are effective at blocking street noise. However, every small sound from the corridor seems to be amplified by the hallway and is loudly transmitted through the door to the room. We stayed one night a second time a week later in a \"Superior Room\", which had a beautiful stained glass-enclosed balcony. Lovely to look at, but not well integrated into the room. In fact, the entire \"Superior\" room was poorly laid out and had a poorly designed bathroom. (Very poor feng shui!)

Our experience was nothing short of phenomenal. The hotel lies in the heart of the trendy Eixample district within easy walking distance of numerous shops, restaurants, gay clubs, and the famed Las Ramblas area. Upon entering the Axel\u2019s lobby, you immediately take note of the ultra modern contemporary d\u00e9cor. Being more of a traditionalist, I often find the contemporary style to be rather cold and impersonal, but the Axel hotel has executed this style in a manner that is both warm and inviting. The hotel staff were consistently courteous, always accommodating, and spoke better English than my high school literature teacher. I was a bit concerned initially at the lack of a dedicated concierge, but the boys at the front desk filled this role with competence and aplomb. Whether it was restaurant reservations or sight-seeing information, they always delivered. The accommodations, while not breathtakingly spectacular, were certainly adequate for the price range. My partner, a first time traveler to Europe, was taken aback by the small room, but I found it to be par for the course in light of previous trips. As previously mentioned, the closet space was abysmal. The bed, however, was among the comfiest of any hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed at. Amenities abound at the Axel hotel. David, the hunky bartender, will serve you the cocktail of your choice in the smoke-free lobby bar where you can people watch and get to know the other guests. Feel lost without you computer? No worries - the second floor has a business center complete with internet access. There is also a fantastic roof-top bar, sadly closed in the off season, called Sky Lounge. Also on the roof you will find a small, but lovely, pool and spa as well as a fitness center/gym. Okay gay travelers, a word of caution. You worldly types who frequent gay oriented establishments will not be shocked to learn that the pool area can become a little crusie after hours. So, if you\u2019re a conservative queen with fragile sensibilities, you may want to refrain from taking a late night dip. The hotel does not market itself as clothing optional, but there is no shortage of men sporting nothing more than a gold chain around the pool come sundown.

The location is pretty good although Barcelona can be a little confusing as the area the hotel is in has no real outstanding feature to guide you and all the intersections are theses little squares and the buildings that surround them are all a very similar achitectural style. It is a gay hotel and the staff is very helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them.", "Date": "October 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay\u201d", "Author": "Club_Marin", "ReviewID": "UR5888894", "Content": "We stayed at the Axel for three nights, our stay was very comfortable, the staff extremely helpful in english and in french.

Also, there was free internet, another plus. The rooms are very clean and stylish. Only a couple of minuses: There were no wash cloths in the bathroom and no alarm clocks.

First, the staff was, across the board, all excellent. From the patient front desk staff who all spoke English and had excellent knowledge of the city, to the wait staff that was super friendly to the housekeeping staff that kept our room in perfect shape for the entire stay. We had a third floor room on the street. We never had a problem with noise either from the street or from the hotel itself. It\u2019s quiet enough to get a great night\u2019s sleep and the optional black-out shade was a bonus for when we stayed out late and wanted some extra shut-eye. We also loved the rooftop deck. It\u2019s a great place for hanging out and enjoying the sun and the plentiful eye candy. Yes, the pool is super tiny and not deep at all. But, it was still nice to jump in and cool off when laying out. The Jacuzzi is clean and nice, as are the steam room and sauna. Again, the service in the Sky Bar is excellent and the drinks yummy. The free Internet was really helpful and the free bottled water saved lots of money. Finally, the location of the hotel is great. It's 2 short blocks to the Universitat Metro station (with a good Starbuck's on the way). It's also just 5 blocks to Passeig de Gracia and restaurant / shopping paradise. It's right in the middle of the gay neighborhood so you don't have to go far for gay bars, clubs and restaurants.

Although the hotel was booked through the weekend, he followed up and on the next night stopped us in the lobby to let us know he'd secured our room for the balance of the trip. It IS a pretty decent place. When we first arrived we were a bit put off by the rather spartan rooms and linoleum floors. The bed was nice however, and we had a room overlooking the street with french doors. The bathroom worked well enough, although the floor flooded with every shower because the shower \"door\" only closes across 2/3rds of the opening. The baseboards were pretty dirty, but all in all we thought the place was decently clean. Nicely located, just a few blocks from Las Ramblas -- about a 15 minute walk. The hotel was pretty empty on Monday, but by Wednesday things started to pick up and by Thursday and Friday it was full. Nice roof bar, pool and weight room with a sauna and steam. Complimentary computers on the mezzanine level. We checked out a few other hotels in the area while we were there, and decided that all in all this was a nice place for the money.

We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again. The staff of the Axel were all charming and very helpful. We made several email requests before we even left Australia, following from which the night desk staff made restaurant bookings for us, checked availability of theatre tickets, and were always happy to go the extra mile. This standard of service continued throughout our stay, from desk and service staff alike. We were delayed in Madrid, and did not arrive in Barcelona until midnight. Nonetheless, a quick call to the hotel meant our room was held for us, and the desk staff promptly checked us in upon arrival. We had a superior room on the fifth floor overlooking the street. The overall air of the hotel is smart, and the decor in the reception and public areas restrainedly trendy. There's even a clothes shop attached to the foyer, if your taste runs to expensive designer label gay eurotrash clothing. The room was quite large for a European hotel room, with nice minimalist decor and lots of storage space in the room. The air conditioning was very effective. The king sized bed was perhaps the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, with very soft sheets, huge pillows and a warm quilt. The bathroom was quite large, with a very good shower, huge towels and lots of shelf space. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were spotlessly clean, and were cleaned carefully every day, no matter what time we left for the day. The laundry service was effective and very prompt, even given the huge pile of washing we dumped on them after two weeks travelling. The free water, in fridges in the hallways, doesn't sound like a major thing, but in the heat of a Barcelona summer, it saved us a lot of money every day, given the amount of water we were drinking to survive. We ordered breakfast in our room one day, and it was very nice, with great pastries and coffee. Our room had a lovely view of the bustle outside in the square. While there was lots of traffic and noise, even late at night (as you would expect in the centre of a big city), the room was well soundproofed, and we weren't at all disturbed. It even kept out the noise of the thousands of fireworks that were being let off for the Feast of St John, the night we arrived. The bar and pool area on the roof was nice, if a little too crowded with aging Germans in lycra. The hotel is quite cruisy, especially on the weekend, with the odd patron roaming around in a bathrobe, although \"flirtatious\" is perhaps a better term. We certainly didn't see any inappropriate or overtly sexual behaviour (as has been described in other reviews) at the hotel, or indeed much that I would not have been happy for my mother to see. (Although we did see some things in nightclubs that would have turned her hair white.) The hotel is an easy 5 to 10 minute walk to two Metro stations (Passieg de Gracia and Universitat) on two major Metro lines, so it is convenient to everywhere you might want to go in Barcelona. The area is charming, with some very good restaurants, shops and lots of gay bars and clubs within two blocks of the hotel. All in all a wonderful experience. One note: When you are in Barcelona, make sure to make a dinner booking at Espai Sucre. This wonderful restaurant is owned by a \"disciple\" of Ferran Adria (the \"world's best chef\"), and serves mainly desserts. While there are a few savoury dishes available to start, the focus of the restaurant is the dessert degustation. The staff are lovely, and the food is amazing. We had the five course degustation with matching wines, and it was one of the most wonderful culinary experiences I have ever had. While you would imagine that five desserts (and coffee and petit fours) might be way too much, the menu is designed that all of the courses are very different, and build in flavour, complexity and sweetness, and are perfectly matched to the wines. The food is complex, but inspired. I would travel back to Barcelona just to spend the day at Sagrada Familia, and then have dinner at Espai Sucre.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cHigh on style - Low on Quality\u201d", "Author": "Adambe", "ReviewID": "UR5422997", "Content": "IMy partner and I stayed at the Axel a couple of years ago.

This would have been ok if they had at least extended an apology. However, all the staff seemed to do was swish around looking stylish and treating the guests as an irritation.

Us: 2 lipstick girls from the states, well travelled, mostly 5 star but will consider upscale gay establishments such as we did with the Axel. Love our gay brothers and accustomed to and tolerant of certain boyish behaviors. Situation: We arrive at the Axel and are met with the most foul smell (think sewer) which seems to permeate the entire hotel. The lobby is faux stylish and dirty. Our only hope is for at least a decent room. No chance there. As we head to our room, stepping off the elevator, I feel as though we have entered a bath house. Men in the hall with small towels around their waists, see us and scurry to their rooms and doors shut. I begin to realize that I am in big trouble w/ my partner now! The room itself continues the feel of dirt and grime. The floor is dirty and the bath tub has the most disgusting mold. I cannot believe how this property has come to be ranked the top gay hotel in the world. Oh well, we decide to make the best of it and head off to check out the neighborhood. While it doesn't qualify as a gay ghetto, there are far better locations in Eixample including those with better lighting and much better dining. So after tuckering ourselves out away from the Axel, we decide to return to the hotel and head to the roof top. BIG MISTAKE. Apparently, the rooftop at night is j/o time for the boys of the Axel. Not only were we made to feel incredibly uncomfortable as we raced for the elevator to get away but one of the men was actually quite rude in the elevator. Needless to say, this was not the place for us (or any women in our opinion). The next morning we began our task of finding more appropriate accomodations, ending up at the Majestic Hotel (a five star hotel in the nicer part of Eixample). Our room at the Majestic was gorgeous with a terrace overlooking Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, and only 50 more Euro per night than the Axel. We had a blast at this hotel as the gang from America's Next Top Model were also staying there and those boys were much more well-mannered. Bottom Line (no pun intended, really): I've read the reviews from others who claim that this hotel is het-friendly and a place \"you can bring Mom & Dad\" but beware if Mom decides to take a hike up to the roof top after dark.

I found this to be an outrageous practice, but of course, who wants to arrive in a foreign city and start looking for a new hotel? What did we get for 240 euros? An adequate room with no view whatsoever (the \"patio view\" is another deception: the patio is a concrete pad at the bottom of the light court, and not a patio at all), and decent, but not overwhelming, amenities. In fairness, I will say that the rooftop pool and gym are very nice, albeit not as well kept as they could be. All in all, I would say that this is a 3 star hotel charging 5 star rates.
