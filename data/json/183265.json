We are from the USA. As we crossed into Canada our GPS stopped working, as did our phones. We were not expecting this! We depended on these items to get us where we were going! Hence, we were stressed trying to figure out where we were going. Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a nice man at the counter who switched his French channel to English very quickly. I must say, that the entire time we were in Montreal we were impressed at how everyone spoke both French and English. Not one person was annoyed at switching over to English....very kind people! Parking was $17 a day. Good price for a downtown location. I would not park on the streets in this area and was happy to have my van parked safely under the hotel. When we got to our room we were pleased with the size. We were in room 315. Window had a huge crack in it. Dog barking in room next door....I think owners were out to dinner, but dog was quiet later. We were on a busy street and during the night you could hear people yelling in the streets, sirens whipping down the street and traffic. It didn't bother us really, and my kids slept through it. If this type of action bothers you, ask for a quieter location. The air conditioner was loud. No breakfast was served, which surprised me being a Choice Hotel. So we bought muffins and had coffee in the room. As far as location....great! Twenty feet cross the street was a grocery store and pharmacy. Subway restaurant around corner. Tons of places to eat. Go out front door of hotel, take a right and walk down the hill. Two blocks down is the Metro/underground city. Walk about a half mile and there's another Metro location. Walk a mile in total and you are right down where all the action is! Basilique Notre-Dame, beautiful! Went at 4:00 PM and organist was rehersing, closes at 5:00 PM, last people in at 4:30 PM. Adults $5, kids $4. Around the corner from the Basilique was the Montreal Science Centre....went about 6:00 PM...it's open until 9:00 PM. This was about $34 for a family of four. Great time to go because all the little kids were gone, not crowded. Our boys, ages 11 & 12 loved the Science Centre.....and the Basilique Notre Dame for that matter. Okay, my husband and I loved the science center too! Walked around Old Montreal after that....gift shops and lots of restaurants. Very happening place! Then we walked back up to the hotel....it's about a mile up hill....kids were tired and slept well. We went to LaRonde (Six Flags) while there. Easy to get to from hotel. (But traffic is tough in Montreal, be prepared and avoid the bridges during rush hour, you sit in traffic for an hour.) We used our season passes from home for LaRonde, so that was a no cost activity....well except for parking raking us for $20 at LaRonde. Another thing we did was drive up to Mount Royal Park and St. Joseph's du Mont Royal. It was a couple of miles away. At the park we stopped and took pictures, no cost to park. Then we went to St. Joseph's, $5 to park, but free to enter St. Joseph's. Another beautiful place. So, in conclusion, the location of this hotel was perfect. We used Choice points to pay for the room....we only paid for parking and tips for house keeping. If I was to visit this area again I would stay at this hotel. It smelled so clean and was the perfect location for my family. We are pretty simple people. Everyone at the front desk was friendly and spoke English. My laptop worked well. Coffee in lobby. Elevators were speedy. Nice place to stay. I hope you found this review helpful!

Everything is clean, but it just looked worn. I suppose it just looks like a budget hotel, which is what most people would call it. The staff was very pleasant and courteous. Check-in and check-out was easy and there were no major problems. The one major complaint was that the bed was like a concrete slab. Get in slowly or you might hurt yourself. Surprisingly, I got two decent nights' sleep but I guess I was just exhausted enough by the time my head hit the pillow. The other thing which we didn't have to deal with much, is that there's a crane that parks right outside for construction. We stayed during a weekend so we only saw it Monday morning. I would imagine it's worse if you stay during the week and they're working all day starting in the early morning.

The room was ok, location very handy about halfway between Mont Royal and Old City. Parking was very expensive (and more on this later). On one night a small gang of street bums was parked on the curb outside, but this was a problem around Montreal. Price I paid was neither cheap nor expensive, although boosted by parking fee. On my stay, the parking garage was to close after a couple of nights, so I asked for recommendations on where to park the car instead. The parking station 2 blocks away was less than half the price on the weekends, so after 1 night in the hotel parking we left at 10am to do touristing things then returned after 6pm to take advantage of the after 6pm rates and cheap weekend parking. Over the weekend we discovered free on street parking two streets over, so then used that. At checkout I handed in my parking voucher and was told I would have to pay for every night until their garage was shut up because I hadn't handed it in earlier. Apparently you were meant to return the voucher when you stopped using the parking. I was never told this, even when asking about other parking options. I said not acceptable, and they finally agreed to waive the parking fees if I could provide evidence I had parked in the parking garage. I eventually found my ticket stub and presented it to them. Now they insisted I pay for an extra day as their parking only allowed up to midday and the garage stub showed 6.15pm as time ofd entry. I again said that this was unacceptable and that we had left at 10am. After more heated argument, they agreed to charge me only half a day. Still further argument and they agreed to waive the fee if they could keep the ticket stub. By this stage I was quite annoyed - I have never had such an experience in any hotel anywhere, and we do quite a bit of travelling. This cast a bit of a pall over a stay which had otherwise been fine. Just to round it all off, a charge of $3.95 later appeared on my credit card. I emailed the hotel and got lots of bouncing email replys, so wasn't sure whether anyone had got the message. So I emailed Choice head office and miraculously everything was suddenly fixed. Apparently the charge was for a large bottle of water that was in the room and we had used, which we had not as we carry our own bottles to fill from the tap. This was refunded with no great apology or other recompense, so after exchange rates I am probably still out of pocket a dollar :-) But the bad taste of the experience remains.

Also a Provigo is across the street so very convenient however there was no fridge or microwave in my room. No free pc to use but there is free wireless internet access. The charge for the pc was I think $3 for 20 minutes. You can go across the street to the 24 hour internet cafe which charged $4 for 1 hour.

After finding our way to the hotel, everything from there on was perfect. As Choice Privilege members, we did inquire about our complimentary upgrade. They had upgraded rooms available but we would not be able to have close rooms. An employee escorted us to view the rooms to decide if we wanted to upgrade and be apart, or keep the original rooms and be connecting. The upgrade rooms were a tiny bit larger, but did not offer much else except a mini fridge, so we chose to stay in our lower grade rooms. The hotel is RIGHT across the street from a grocery store that is open late, where you can purchase some alcohol, snacks, breakfast foods, etc, if you want to save on some money. We did dine in the adjoining restaurant in the hotel. The food was good, but the waitress appeared fairly absent minded.. forgetting plenty of our requests. Our room also had floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the street which was nice to watch the hustle and bustle (and people watch the shoppers in the grocery store). The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main streets for shopping, and there are a multitude of restaurants once you step outside. There is a daily fee for secured parking in the underground parking lot. The front desk staff were very helpful, from the moment we inquired about viewing both room types before deciding whether to upgrade, right up until we checked out. One of the girls at the front desk (I really wish I could remember her name) was great. As we didn't know much about Montreal, we wanted to experience a bit of the nightlife but weren't sure were to head. She let us know what clubs would be busy on what evenings, and even called a friend of hers that was dj'ing at one of the clubs to get us placed on the guestlist and some complimentary drinks. On our last evening, after a heavy night of drinking we did not end up checking out to nearly 1:30 p.m, and no one called our room to kick us out! :) Unfortunately, I cannot say if the price was worth our stay as we had a Quality Inn Employee discount (which means we had a very cheap rate), but I am pretty confident that it would be worth the full price (even if the hotel was terrible, I would pay it for the location only!)

It's also a 10 minute walk from St. Laurent (\"The Main\"), one of the most ultra-hip and exciting streets in the city. It sits on the edge of downtown but is closer to The Plateau, the artistic district of Montreal. (Great inexpensive restaurants and bars in the area, including some restaurants where you can bring your own wine!) It is also less than a 5 minute walk from Jeanne Mance (ever seen photos of the iron staircases in Montreal? Chances are they were taken on Jeanne Mance street.). 2) The hotel is directly across the street from Provigo, a well-stocked and clean grocery store (check out their pastry section!). It was WONDERFUL (and inexpensive) to zip across the street and pick up provisions for the weekend. 3) The only problem I encountered was that the movie channels would not work when I arrived. Rachelle at the front desk went above and beyond to try to get them to work again Friday evening and continued to follow up with me throughout the weekend to get them functional. 4) The restaurant was closed while I was there, but there is a local restaurant (Alto - pick up a menu in the lobby) who will deliver as late as 5:00 a.m.!!! Good food, quick delivery. I highly recommend their pizza. 5) I found the front desk staff to be accommodating, warm, and very helpful. They went above and beyond to ensure I had a good stay.

The neighborhood is a mix of downtown businesses and student housing. On Sherbrooke, which is only 1/2 a block away, it's all businesses and posh hotels. On Ave du Parc, it's a mixture of convenient stores, restaurants, outdoor cafes, and a supermarket. The hotel is also within walking distance of the Metro and St. Laurent where a lot of Montreal nightlife takes place. The point is if McGill students managed to live through 4 years of their education living in this neighborhood, you'll be OK for a few days.", "Date": "September 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cQuality is Adequate\u201d", "Author": "bman13", "ReviewID": "UR3802899", "Content": "Me and a few friends just returned from a weekend stint at this hotel. As said before this hotel is a 3 star. You get what you pay for. It provides you with the basics. A Room with A.C., adequate beds, trademark flat hotel pillows, and maid service. It is a great hotel because of its location. Close to Supermarket, Liquor Store, and the club scene and night life is all within walking distance. As said before last year I stayed at the Delta nearby on President Kennedy and that is a cut above but that is a 4 star and well you pay more. It's around $15 or so per day for parking in the garage. We just parked it when we arrived and took it out when we left. Close by to everything. We were on a floor with an ice machine. If you are in need for ice like we were it does the job but if you are looking for a large amount of ice in a short amount of time it may do the job but not real quick. Maid on the last day since we didnt ask for maid service sort of yelled/informed us about how \"NOT TO OPEN THE WATER\" she was saying not to open the bottle of water in the room that is on the table and just replace it with tap water and how she would know. Found that okay a little weird cause who is going to drink a medium size bottle of water that is $3.50? All in all no real complaints. When we requested more towels we got them. Front Desk when going in and out were friendly. If you plan on staying in the hotel for a while during the day when your not out then the hotel doesnt really have time consuming things. It is simply put ADEQUATE for people that just need a place to stay that will give you a place to sleep (in smoking and non-smoking) and any of the other basics. If you lookin for more its going to cost you more.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "memphis,TN", "Title": "\u201cLocation,location,location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3734268", "Content": "I had a good deal in hotwire,it just us$45/night(tax not included) we booked the hotel for 5 nights,what can ask for this price in the downtown.The room is fine,the front desk is quite helpful.but the most important thing is the location,you can walk to metro for less than 5 min(but I can't imagine in the winter),the bus stop just the corner(check for the time ,30min in non-rush hour)if you want to the old montreal/chinatown, either bus or walk is fine ,it a straight road.Easy to access anywhere like shopping,sightseeing... There's supermarket across the street,very convenient,not only the supermarket,a bakery,couples of resturant,Cara is the place we went twice,try the breakfast, the crepe filled with lot of fruit,dip with nutella,very great. I saw some beggars beg for money along the streets,I experienced a beggar came to me for the money when I walked from the metro to hotel.And one night we saw a man slept at the front door of the hotel,few people looking at him,the staff of hotel came out and ask something ,then she returned to the hotel,it seems this happen before(a woman walking along and said he just faking always)So i advised girls to be watched out when you have to go out at night. One more thing,you have to pay $10/day for the high speed internet,really expensive,and when we called the service desk ask about the service detail,she gave us wrong information,the service should be from noon to noon,but the one one the phone said its from midnight to midnight,so be careful.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven, CT", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good price.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2150791", "Content": "My friends and I spent a few nights in this hotel and were pleasantly surprised.

Close to the local subway which I found so easy to navigate. Private Garage asures safe parking. Great resturaunt called Mango's adjacent to the hotel located on the main floor. ( they serve a great breakfast) and keep a well stocked bar. The Front Desk was an excellent help, always happy to make dinner reservations for us and never being off when recamending a place to eat or visit. The rooms were clean & quaint, the bathroom is a bit small but definetly sufficent, the tub was deep enough for me to soak my 6 foot 240 pound frame which is nice after a day off treking around the city. Right accross the street is a full service grocery store(great for the budget concious) or if you just need something you forgot to pack. Considering I paid less then $300 for a 4 night stay I would recamend this hotel and may even stay there again. It would have been nice to have a few more amenities (like a pool) but hey I was there to see the city not lounge around a hotel.", "Date": "June 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cCresent Street NIGHTLIFE!!
