The hotel is conveniently located next to the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital campus. Of course, it's in a bad part of town, but you expect most major hospitals to be in these urban settings. Either way, I felt safe in the hotel as there were many travellers staying overnight to be taken by shuttle to the Port for cruises ($5 fee). There are also complementary shuttle services to the hospital and airport; however, you must reserve in advance as the seats fill up fast! I actually rented a car and parked in the gated parking garage with room key access for $13/night (in & out privileges included). My room was facing the highway, which was audible, but I'm used to sleeping in big cities and blocking out the noise. If you are sound sensitive or a light sleeper, I recommend bringing earplugs or trying to get a room on the other side of the hotel. Otherwise, the room was okay. I had two queen beds and a sofa. I checked the sheets of the first bed and noticed that there was a red-brown stain about 2 inches in diameter on the mattress cover that I could see through the fitted sheet. So, I chose to sleep in bed #2, which had no stains. The sheets smelled of Febreze and were clean. There were some stains on the green carpet, but this is expected as there is a high turnover of guests that bring food in their rooms and accidently spill their coffee, etc. The bathroom was clean (towels, sink), although the tub did have some trace black grime on the bottom were the grip pattern is located. You usually should wear your shower sandals/shoes in public baths anyway and you'll be fine. The shower head was fabulous--the water pressure was strong and had good hot water but you can choose to have a cold shower as Miami is hot and humid! (And don't worry--the air conditioner is good and can handle the humidity.) The toilet is clean and in a separate room from the shower, equipped with a small sink, too. If you are sensitive to smell, you can just catch a slight whiff of septic backup/sewage, but you don't smell this when you shut the door and go back to your bed. Breakfast was like any other continental buffet services--lots to choose from and certainly not gourmet but quick and easy for those of you on the go. What I liked best about this hotel was the 2 guest computers (+ a printer) that you can use for internet access (15 minute courtesy limit, but if no one is around, you can use it for longer--the page does refresh every 15 minutes though, for security purposes, and restarts Internet explorer). Unfortunately, the Internet explorer on these computers is version 6, which is not compatible with many sites. You can check your flight status, email or facebook account without any problem. I recommend you not use your credit card unless you have to as there is no menu function to erase cookies, files, etc. The internet program says \"secure\" because it claims to erase your information after each 15 minute session, but you can still see the website history in the address bar. This hotel is good for its location and for a one to two nights stay. If you need long term stationing because of the nearby hospital, it's good for that too as it appears that this hotel is one of the better in the area for that necessity. I must mention that even at the discounted rate of $109 + tax from the University of Miami, it is a little pricey for what you get. Essentially, you're paying for the convenience of location.

I do a lot of research on hotels before I decide on a place to stay. I had initially chosen another hotel for our pre/post cruise stay, but saw this one on tripadvisor and decided to make a last minute change. I am so glad I did! The hotel is so clean, and when I say clean, I mean clean. Upon entering hotel rooms, yes I am a freak, I look under mattresses/pictures for evidence of bed bugs, corners of showers for mold, and for cockroaches. All I found was a tiny bit of mold in the shower which is to be expected. The mattress was so comfortable, I think I slept better at this hotel than I do at my own home, I only wish I would have remembered what brand it was. The breakfast was complimentary and it was excellent. They had a variety of foods to choose from. The shuttle service was also a plus. We were picked up at the airport in a timely fashion after our flight. We also used it to go to the Port of Miami. The first night we stayed, I didn't realized we had to \"reserve\" the shuttle for our afternoon transport to the Port, so when we went to down to the main desk that morning, the shuttle service was fully booked. The lady at the desk had us wait for Luis (I think he was the manager of the shuttle service) and he so kindly fit us in and took us to the Port. He was very kind and treated us very nicely. He also gave us some good advice on the way to the Port in regards to safety on our cruise. We also relaxed outside by the pool. I didn't actually use the pool, so I don't know how the water was, but the only negative thing was that it was a little loud with emergency sirens/traffic and we even heard chickens outside by the pool.

There were no surprises. Many of the comments I read were right on, so i was not disappointed in the least. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. The room are very spacious, new and clean with very comfortable beds. The pool is a bit small but was perfect size to refresh yourself or get some sun. The hotel is not located in a tourist area so there is not much to do in the neighborhood. University Sports Bar is located within walking distance for a quick sandwich or drinks. Even though the neighborhood looked a little run down I never felt unsafe and really never noticed the traffic noise. If you have a longer stay a car would be useful even though parking is a bit high at $13.00 a night. The free hot breakfast was great in the morning with many options. They do provide a free shuttle from Miami International Airport, just call the hotel when you arrive. They also provide shuttle service to Bayside Marketplace at scheduled times. This is a great place to spend a day shopping or to catch lunch or dinner. Shuttle service was also provided to the Port of Miami for a $5.00 charge per person.

The subsequent five nights I switched to a king room which overlooked a busy highway which was some what noisy, with bright lights. The room was smaller than the double queen room, which had a huge walk in closet, but the work area in the king room was nicer. Both had the same bathroom layout - two separate rooms, one with vanity and large shower, the other with commode and small corner sink. The amenities were also better than expected. The hot breakfast buffet was adequate, there was a restaurant (slow service and limited menu) and a bar, a very good exercise room, small pool which needed cleaning. The desk staff were always pleasant and helpful. Be aware that parking is at an additional fee, which wasn't surprising as I live in Chicago. They have a market for a quick snack, which I wish had more choices as there are very few choices in the area for dining, and late hospital hours requires more choices.

We had not eaten dinner yet, so we were starving and was looking forward to checking in to our hotel room and getting a bite to eat and a cocktail. Well, there was nothing around and the neighborhood obviously was not safe, because when we asked the person at the front desk if there was a restaurant nearby that we could possibly walk to, she said that she would not advise us to walk. So with that, no dinner for us:( Secondly once we got up into our room, we realized that we were in a handicap room. I think that it is really nice to have rooms to accommodate our handicap citizens, however, we are not handicap and the bathroom floor had drains all over, because the same floors that you were suppose to shower on was the same floor that you walk on. I was not pleased and asked for a room switch and the lady at the front desk advised me that there were no more rooms available with a king bed and that we would have to take a room with two doubles. Well we did not want that, so we decided to stay until I saw a roach and then another one....YIKES! By this time, I was totally grossed out, hungry and disgusted. Despite the fact that we did not want to sleep in separate beds, I was not about to sleep in a room with roaches, so we opted to get the room switched to a room with two double beds. Well after all of that and having to lug our luggage to another floor, I definitely needed at least a cocktail, so I went down to the front desk and asked for a cab to take us to the nearest convenient store so that we could at least get some snacks and a cold beer. Well, even though the shuttle services were closed by then, the lady at the front desk was nice enough to ask the driver to drive us to the nearest convenient store which was a gas station right up the rode. SO, we were able to get water, snacks, cold beer and advil :) to get us through the night. That was very nice of her:) We finally got to sleep and woke up early to check out the continental breakfast which was horrible, but a nice thing to have there, I guess.

We were kind of apprehensive about the place as it had mixed reviews. But when we got there we were very pleased to find that it was immaculate. We paid $169.00 plus tax for a room with 2 Queen beds, a sofa with a pullout bed, a giant plasma screen HDTV, a nice shower with vanity mirror and a separate room with a toilet and sink, plus a microwave, fridge, iHome, Wired/Wireless internet access, a laundry room, 24 hour access to the gym, and parking which was like $13. This was all on the day of!! The service here is spectacular, the front desk is always there to answer the phone and do whatever you need and with a positive polite attitude no matter how busy they are. They have a general store in the lobby to buy food and drinks and pretty much whatever you would need on your travels. And don't let me forget about the Continental Breakfast! I've worked at a few hotels and have stayed in many but this breakfast was one of the best ive seen. Everything is fresh and they dont just have bagels and danishes, they have a waffle maker and omelletes, and fresh juices and yogurts too as well as fresh fruit. The stylings of the building are also aestetically pleasing, all modern finishings so it looks new and clean. We had a freind staying at the JW Marriot in a Presidential Suite and we were shocked when we walked into his room to find that our room was bigger and nicer than his!! The only negative thing about this place is the location. It is kind of in an impoverished location in Miami so you might be hesistant to walk in the wrong direction at night but the hotel itself doesnt look scary or rundown at all it is beautiful and there is a gated 5 level parking garage so you feel very safe staying here. We went to a music festival in South Beach and the problem is that none of the taxi drivers would take us back to our hotel because they didnt want to get stuck in traffic or beacause they didnt know where it was. This was very frustrating but I think that if our music event of over 50,000 people wasnt flooding the streets this wouldnt be much of a problem. We would love to stay here again and probably will next year. Kudos to the Springhill Suites Marriot!", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlantic Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cCruise goer's stop, NOT a business hotel, understaffed restaurant\u201d", "Author": "fay711", "ReviewID": "UR54926736", "Content": "I had a meeting a local hospital and chose to stay for the first time at this hotel because of the proximity. I am a platium member at Marriott and have been increasingly unhappy with the facilities. There are no suites at this hotel, all the rooms are the same. This hotel has free shuttle service to the local cruise port and was full of the sterotypical cruise goer. It was extrememly loud. Also the first room I checked into was not fully clean. The carpet hadn't been vaccumed and there were bits of plastic and paper all over the floor, so they moved us to another room. The restaurant had 4 people total working, including the kitchen. I placed an order and an hour later it finally came out. Multiple other tables received their food before me that had ordered afterwards. I heard plenty of aplogies, which didn't lessen my irritation. Long story short, this is not a business friendly hotel.
