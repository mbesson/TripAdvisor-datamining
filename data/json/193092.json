I guess the first, although not the most important, thing is its central location \u2013 an easy 5 minute stroll from Marble Arch tube station and close to many of London\u2019s attractions and theatres. Next, the building itself: on our first visit about 18 months ago it was undergoing renovation. This has now been completed and although the main structure is obviously old, once inside the d\u00e9cor is modern and tasteful with an air of quiet opulence. The public areas and the bedrooms are immaculately clean and in the bathroom we appreciated hot water without the long wait you get in some older buildings. The air conditioning is unobtrusive and, with a room to the rear of the hotel, we were able to open the sash window without too much traffic noise. The only small complaint is that because the hotel is a conversion from a private house some rooms are rather undersized and in No 405 it was impossible to sit comfortably on the dressing table chair as the bed was too close. But, Hey! Who cares \u2013 we just sat on the bed to use the mirror. We had afternoon tea on our first day as we had arranged to meet some family there. Our recommendation is to order one portion for every two people \u2013 any more and you\u2019ll be asking for a doggy bag. Similarly breakfast provides enough volume and variety to keep you going all day. Regretfully our schedules have never allowed time to visit either of the restaurants for dinner but we hope to do so on a future stay. We did, however, have a bar meal on our first night and this did not disappoint. Now to the most important element of any hotel stay \u2013 the staff. The welcome is warm, cheerful and efficient; the domestic staff are similarly cheerful and professional as are the bartenders and waiters/waitresses. We reckon a good hotel keeps its staff and we recognised many of the faces from our previous visit. More importantly, the faces recognised us and their warm greetings and attentive service made us feel so at home. On our second and last night we saw The Wizard of Oz \u2013 a magical experience \u2013 and our whole visit was made magical by our stay at the Mostyn. There is now no other hotel for us when we visit London.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "romney arsh", "Title": "\u201cHappy of Hythe\u201d", "Author": "tidemarks_9", "ReviewID": "UR125435067", "Content": "Have just booked a break at this hotel and am really amazed at the service and help I received from the Reservations man, Nihal, Can't wait to get there.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "south tyneside england", "Title": "\u201cLovely handy hotel\u201d", "Author": "stonker", "ReviewID": "UR124922404", "Content": "I spent 2 nights here in october 2011 half term with my teenage son.

The bedrooms,one twin room for daughter and son room 118, large room, twin beds, compact en-suite. Our room, next door room number 119 - a tiny 11 ft x 9ft. Take into account a comfy 5ft bed, with a desk and chair at the end gave around 2 ft to get past to a very small ensuite with shower over bath and no room whatsoever to put even a toiletries bag. Now I understand it is London and space is a premium but this was taking the Michael, believe me. I couldn't even take a photo to put on here as it was so small! Air con / heating system, no instructions at all in both rooms. Room was either very hot or cold, no inbetween, kids room only blew cold air. Now take into account in our room, a large sash window, very poor double glazing, a delivery wagon every morning at roughly 2.45 am banging, crashing trolleys on and off the wagon deliverying and collecting linen and towels to the Thistle Hotel opposite for an hour each morning, then you realise you are going to have an interrupted sleep. Sort out the glazing and make this a single room. Big disappointment, wrote a note on the first morning addressed to Duty Manager and / or yours truly James Jude but nobody replied whilst we where staying, still no response despite Receptionist making notes and assuring us someone would be in touch within 48 hours, been home a week now and not heard from anyone? I am sure James Jude will reply on here to this ? Anyway, Hotel itself is well decorated and clean, including the bedrooms. Staff were fine and helpful. Bottled water is in each bedroom as they advise not to drink the tapwater in the bathrooms. There is also a fridge in each bedroom to keep your drinks chilled and a little ice cube tray. Location is great, we tried Golden Dragon chinese restaurant in China Town as recommended by the Concierge and would recommend that. Would not go back unless guaranteed a decent size room with triple glazed windows.

I picked this hotel because of the location and the accomodation on offer but mainly because they did a special offer at about 60% of the advertsied room rate. Breakfast was extra but this was very good and reasonable value. The hotel accomodation is superb and it looks like there has been a major refurbishment recently as the rooms are decorated, furnished and equippped to a very high standard. Only one minor issue with the TV but apart from that for a one night stay with this was perfect for me.

Again ample supply of tea and coffee also hot chocolate and biscuits in the room with bottled water. Bed very comfortable like sleeping in a marshmallow. only stayed over night but could easily have stayed longer. Nice size room. Literally a road away from Oxford st so an ideal place to stay for shopping. We were in the basement by the road so there was a little noise from the traffic above but nothing major and apart from the usual closing of doors from other hotel users there was no other noise. The down side is that there is no parking but across the rd is a car park where you can park for 24hrs (maybe longer) which was ideal. Cost of car park was \u00c2\u00a336 for 24hrs. A bit pricey but because of location we could just walk everywhere. So parked up and left the car until it was time to leave. English Breakfast expensive at \u00c2\u00a319 each although i believe your key card gives you a 15% discount but still expensive. There are other options for breakfast that are less expensive.

The hot selection of the breakfast was nice. The cold selection could use a little improvement. Tasty croissants, but the cheese and sliced fruits looked like leftovers from yesterday. At check out, the consierge made our day. He used a scale and told us exactely how far we were from the airlines weight limit. Then he stored our luggage and gave us good advice on how to get to the airport and when we should go there to arrive in time. Two minor negativities: The wifi didn't work very well in our room, but it was possible to connect by cable so we survived, and the bedside lamps were not really useful as reading light.

The breakfast was one of the best I have sampled in a hotel. There was a good selection of cereals, fruit and continental items. There is also the option for cooked items, such as boiled eggs, scrambled eggs on toast, but the option I chose both mornings was the fully cooked English breakfast, cooked fresh when ordered, it was totally yummy and a must for a full day ahead! The restaurant where breakfast is served in is of a nice size, not too big, and clean with a nice ambiance. The times for breakfast during our stay, which was during a weekend were very thoughtful and considerate.

On arrival we confirmed that we had been given a quiet room, which we were told we had. We went through to find that we had a ground floor room right next to the main entrance which was on the main road directly opposite the taxi rank and smoking area for the Thistle Hotel, the noise was unbelievable as at that moment there was a bus load of noisy tourists decanting right under the window!! The window was completely obscured bar top 6\" so no 'view'. So requested room change immediately and were put into another ground floor room described as 'overlooking the courtyard'. This was better as at least it was not onto the main road, but still obscured windows and it later became evident that we had an external staircase just outside with continuous crashing and banging of doors and other items going on through out the day and night, staff in and out of the restaurant door below all the time, irritating beyond belief!! The room was clean and well maintained, but was claustrophobic due to the lack of natural light and let down further by a very inconvenient and dangerous step across the room that led to more than one trip when the lights were out. Really we should have demanded a room to the standard expected, it seems that 'Executive' as now now described is third class whereas their new 'Club' is the real 4* Mostyn Hotel that was sold in the description. The restaurant service was excellent whilst the duty manager was present and this genleman was a real asset to the hotel, personable and helpful in every way, unfortunately as soon as he was on his day off, it all fell to pieces! Slow and unattentive service, shambolic clearing of tables and failure to deliver the correct meals as they had 'run out of basics'!! We were presented with one piece of bacon that looked like it had been rescued from the bin, cold, burnt baked beans and half a mushroom with a chunk missing, not very impressive. At this point we had waited over 45 minutes for this, and breakfast service still had an hour to run so heaven alone knows what others following us were presented with!! A complaint to the duty manager that evening lead to the restaurant manager apologising profusely the following day and everything back to slick and efficient, it is a shame that staff cannot be trusted to maintain the high standard that this poor unfortunate expects when he is not there. There is also an issue in that everything is a charged extra, ice cost \u00c2\u00a34-00, (free in most places we have visited!) lose the plastic room swipe card, \u00c2\u00a35-00, \u00c2\u00a310-00 to use the business centre and so on!! Staff do not have access to the internet so not possible to get them to do online check in for customers for airlines and print boarding cards. Lack of an important service! Free WiFi has to be renewed daily and was slow in the room we were located in, inconvenient. Maybe we were unlucky, but this was not what was expected from a 4* hotel, very expensive for a very mediocre experience, basically we felt ripped off as this was paid for from our own rather than a deep corporate pocket. The price has since escalated from when we booked 3 months ago and \u00c2\u00a31660 for the same stay can only be described as exorbitant!!

This month I stayed for 3 nights, after checking-in I was provided with a room on the 4th floor - the TV did not work so I called reception, however, while waiting for the hotel employee to take a look at the TV, I noticed a dead insect directly on top of the bed, a closer inspection and a phone search brought up a picture of a bed bug identical in every way to this insect. I informed the employee about the bed bug, which he confirmed it was, he promised to show it to the hotel manager right away. At this point I was thinking of leaving the hotel altogether, however, I decided to stay and was instead provided with a room on the 2nd floor - I additionally requested to speak to the manager about my concerns about the bed bug, however, the was not available. The duration of my stay was satisfactory, every day the room was not cleaned properly i.e. bathroom glasses not cleaned properly, bed not properly made (sheet just pulled over), used tea cups still left in the same position from the day before. At no point during my stay did the manager seek me out to apologise for the inconvenience, disruption and bad experience I had. It was only after I had checked out of the hotel did I receive a call from the Assistant Manager apologising for the problems I experienced, however, adamantly denying that I had ever seen a bed bug at the hotel, this conversation was one-sided and at not point did I feel that the apology was sincere - I was not offered any discount or any other incentive to return to this hotel again. For what its worth I will not be staying at this hotel ever again and neither will any of my other family members who also stay here when in London. This hotel recently upgraded to a 4 star, including its prices, however, it needs to improve its standards of room cleaning and customer care.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money (if you can get a good deal!)\u201d", "Author": "MisterE_Hudds", "ReviewID": "UR98654486", "Content": "We booked this hotel direct with Best Western and got a really good deal - half price on both an Executive Family and Executive Double room. The family room was huge compared to all the other rooms we have stopped in in London, however, the double room was quite small (but adequate). Both rooms were really well furnished and comfortable. The family room had a very large king size bed and a sofa bed for the young one. This was not made up when we arrived, but a quick call to reception put that right. The bathroom was very light and modern with a rain-head shower and nice bath. The only annoying thing was the speaker that played sound from the TV. This was very loud and the volume could not be altered. In the end I removed the white lead from the back of the TV and this did the trick!! One tip I would give is to request a room that is not on the road side. My parents had a room that overlooked Portman Street and the traffic noise all through the night was really bad. This is probably due to the fact that there are roadworks on Oxford Street and the buses are diverted down Portman Street. The reception and bar area are very clean and tidy and the staff couldn't be more helpful. However, I wouldn't recommed room service - everything seemed to have a \u00c2\u00a34 delivery charge (including tap water and a glass of ice). We did not have breakfast in the hotel due to the price, so we ate breakfast in the nearby Weatherspoons before heading into town. The hotel is situated very near Marble Arch tube station which is handy should you wish to just use the Central Line. However, if you want to go anywhere other than the Oxford Street corridor you will have to change. Another little tip - don't automatically head towards the city to change tubes. If you go west and change at Notting Hill Gate for the District or Circle Lines it will be a lot quieter and you will probably get to where you need to go quicker. Marble Arch also seems to be where the buses converge, so consider taking a bus instead of tube, particularly if heading to Kensington/Hammersmith way. All in all, I would definitely go back to this hotel.
