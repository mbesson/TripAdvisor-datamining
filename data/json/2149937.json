The rooms were clean, decent size, and had all the functional items you would require. Lounge on 4th floor was good with 2 flat TV's several options for complimentary coffee, reading materials, and 2 internet stations. The gym next door also looked decent for a boutique hotel and usable. No restaurant but not a problem as there are several coffee shops, bakeries, groceries all nearby. If you want something western we found a very good Pizzeria called Jacomax a few streets down,which looked to run by an Italian couple and very authentic. Another Italian called Amante was on the same street and was pretty decent. We had an event at the four seasons next to the IFC mall and was convenient to walk or taxi which was only (25 HKD) Took a day trip to Macau and the ferry terminal was also in walking distance.

Hotel staff is so-so, does not really service with a smile. Could be friendlier towards Asians. Location was strategic as MTR Sheung Wan Station is just steps away. Tip: If you're coming from the airport, take the Airport Express MTR, stop at Hong Kong Station. Walk to Central Station and take the MTR to Sheung Wan Station. Once at Sheung Wan Station, go to Huiller Street Exit. Upon exit, turn left whereby you'll stop at a traffic light. Cross the small street, walk straight till you reach the next junction.

A short walk brought us to the Shun Tak Centre across the road where one can catch the ferry to Macau.

The small front desk is manned by some efficient staff who could smile more:( The front desk has a bad design and the staff are often hidden behind the high counter. So they seldom noticed our comings and goings... Room: A good size, so much so mu husband could practise his putting! The bed was comfortable and though we had a street-view room, we could barely hear the noise because of the double windows.

These days with our own company, we look for hotels that offer all the things we're used to but at a way different price level. I would have to say that for the money, I don't think you can beat The Bauhinia Hotel in Central - and we've stayed at quite a few hotels around this price-range in Hong Kong to compare. The location is fab - almost next to an MTR station (Sheung Wan station) which is a stop from Central. It's very close (less than 5 mins cab) to to the airport express train stop. Getting a cab in this area is easy and the cab can stop right outside the hotel (which is not always the case with boutique hotels in odd locations in HK). The hotel building is actually apartments but the lower floors have been converted into a hotel very tastefully. There really isn't much of a lobby, more like the sort of desk you'd see in an apartment building but once into the hotel itself, it's perfect. The rooms are a reasonable size and quite new which makes it nice. The bathroom is small and almost no space on the bench next to the sink for items, but that is really the only downside with the room. It has all the conveniences you require, ie amenities, iron and ironing board, hair-dryer, safe, etc. Whilst they don't really have a restaurant, we were offered access to the breakfast buffet free. It's a simple breakfast but fine for us - it consists of cereal options, pastries, eggs, yogurt, coffee, and juice. What I really liked was the room did actually have enough space to fit two people. Although it is on Connaught Rd, it has double glazing and much more quiet than most HK hotels I've been in and I heard nothing from any other room which means they got the soundproofing right - which is rare in some of these boutique hotels. Nearby the hotel are a plethora of inexpensive dining options. We walked up to the Hollywood Road area a few times for something more upmarket and that was only about 10 mins. I would definitely book this hotel again. Well done guys - you got things right! There are a lot of boutique hotels in Hong Kong that don't quite get the essential elements right, but this one does! One final thing - I accidentally left some clothes in a drawer when checking out. A day later I received an email from Reception to let me know of this. Fortunately I was passing back through Hong Kong so called in to pick up items a few days later!
