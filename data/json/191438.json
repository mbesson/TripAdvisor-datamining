The king size room was adequate, this is where the 5 star rating comes into question, the air conditioning control is questionable and the facilities of both the room and bathroom are no better than any average hotel, nevertheless clean and comfortable. Our room was on the second floor facing the inside courtyard so it was peaceful with not much of a view, If you want a view you are offered an upgrade on arrival of 40 euros a night ( I was offered this on line prior to travel at 20 euros a night). I suggest enjoying the view at breakfast.

During the day the choices in the EL are some sweets and coffee but it is still a nice place to relax after visiting the beautifull area around the hotel and enjoying all great shops such as\" franconia\" on friedrichstrasse ;the fitness is also great and very clean ; the pool gets a bit crowded sometimes but if you have he time a lomilomi massage is a must do experience so we usually splurge on a 95 minutes delightful experience... Eveningservice in the EL is great with soup, sandwiches, cheeseplate and 2 hot choices which changes every night so even during our 6 or 7 day stays we rarely get the same hot choices twice making this a fantasticexec. lounge and certainly one of the best you can enjoy in Europe leaving US Hilton EL far, far behind as even the sparkling wines, beer and other alcoholic drinks are free and all guests pour their own shots so it is easy to see several bottles of good quality booze getting emptied AND replaced by a new one on a short evening ;).

It's conveniently located in a fairly quiet neighborhood, directly across from the Deutsche Dom and within a 10 to 15 minute walk to most of Berlins historical and cultural attractions. There is plenty of mid to high range shopping and a variety of restaurants for every pocket book and taste in the area. Directly outside the main entrance is the Stadmitte U-Bahn station for the U2 line which can conveniently take you to most other Berlins neighborhoods. The rooms were fairly standard in size compared to other properties and those on the front of the hotel offer spectacular views of the Deutsche Dom. The breakfast buffet they offer is extensive, varied and very filling and delicious. Here's what I found not so good about the hotel. The bathrooms were on the small size with a tub along with a hand held shower that didn't provide much water pressure and the toiletries were of minimal size as well. They charge 22.00 euro for WiFi or internet access. They also charge 12.50 euro for access to the Wellness area in their health club, while pool access is complimentary. I would consider the hotel a very good first class property, not a deluxe one. The reason is mainly due to the service provided by the hotel staff. For the most part, it was polite and efficient, but you had to ask them.

When we checked in and I asked about breakfast, without batting an eyelid the clerk immediately replied, \"It's not in the room rate.\" I triumphantly whipped out my printed receipt, showed her and she had to relent! It didn't make me feel especially welcome, and I felt that at worst one or two of the clerks lauded the hotel's luxury reputation in a slightly intimidating way. Don't let that put you off, however: this is a really good, well located hotel with a heavenly breakfast. The room was a good quality standard business-like arrangement: warn, clean, quiet, secure with decent facilities, even if the colour scheme was rather muted. Happily, unlike many continental hotels, they have tea-making facilities in the rooms. On the down side, the room internet is cable-based and not WIFI; I think they have it but charge extra. Also make sure that you read the bottom of the back of the mini-bar menu before you use the mini-bar itself. It explains that if you open the door and toy with anything in there for a few seconds like a coke can or chocolate bar, the item will be charged to your hotel bill - whether you consume it or not... Is this computerized efficiency gone mad? Unfortunately our room was also rather dry and we had to keep drinking juice and water. When we found the busy breakfast room - on the first floor - the choice was absolutely fabulous with good quality food including smoked salmon, fresh watermelon juice and classy gauze tea bags (!). It was self-service but really excellent, attentive staff were on hand. Only on the last day did we have a problem, as our rather formal check-in clerk had not put our room number on the list (again I was again told, \"It's not in the room rate\"). Nevertheless I have to say that the breakfast remains a total stand-out. The hotel is ideally located, right on the Stadtmitte U-bahn station, next to some lovely old buildings and luxurious shopping opportunities. My girlfriend tried the spa and said to watch out for the mixed nude sauna, as staff were not always on hand to explain things!

Unfortunately the service on this hotel is not Hilton-standard. First time I was there I needed something to eat at 05:30 AM (was up preparing a meeting) - I called room service but they just said \"The chefs are preparing the breakfast right now so we can\u00b4t help you\". This despite that they claim to have 24/7 room service. The next day they apologized and gave me discount on my previous room service orders. A few weeks later I gave the hotel a new shot (chasing my honors diamond status for 2012), this time I arrived on a Sunday and I needed help washing my suite for a meeting the next afternoon. I called housekeeping\u2026 and got the answer \u201cWe do not do laundry on Sundays so we can\u00b4t help you\u201d. Maybe for people who do not travel frequently on business this sounds OK, but for me who depends on good service to cope with my schedule \u2013 this is a disaster. I choose Hilton and 5 star hotels just to get this kind of service. I this is the first time I run into a 5 star Hilton that do not offer laundry on weekends. Other things worth mentioning: The pool area is just average (no whirlpool for example) and the standard rooms and executive rooms are small for Hilton-standards (It\u00b4s OK if you upgrade to a Studio). To summarize, I do not get how this hotel can have 5 stars, its maximum a 4 star hotel. It\u2019s not bad in any way, but compared to other 5 star Hiltons (I can mention for example Copenhagen, Warsaw and Prague) it\u2019s not playing in the same league.

Each time when we would come back, we always chose a different hotel \u2013 we ended up staying in 3 hotels: Hilton Berlin on Gendarmenmarkt, Leonardo Royal Hotel Berlin and PLUS Hotel Berlin. I will post reviews of each hotel separately. This one is about Hilton Berlin. If you care about the location and your trips is centered around trips to the Museumsinsel, Reichstag, memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe or Gem\u00e4ldegalerie (not much further), then this place is for you. It is so centrally located to all those sites that you would not need to use any transportation. First positive (aside from the location). The view is spectacular. If you\u2019re paying for breakfast, try to wake up as early as possible and get a table right by the window \u2013 you will be looking at the Berliner Dom. Our room was great, very spacious with a nice size bathroom. If you want to stay in this hotel, try to reserve through the hotel website and request a room overlooking the square. We had a view of the building across the road, nothing special. The gym (included) is nice and unlike many European hotel gyms, it has free weights. The hotel\u2019s second level (called bel-etage) has a nice bar, with live piano at night \u2013 it was great to sit there and have a drink while listening to the music. The stuff is great. There is a restaurant on premises, but we haven\u2019t tried it. Now negative. Being in the prime location, it can be very expensive. Basically everything in the hotel comes at additional cost. The breakfast is 28 Euro; (though it was very good). The internet was not free and very expensive (22-26 euro, depending on how you intend to use it). The gym was free (and open 24 hrs) but in order to use sauna/steam room you have to pay. The pool (no extra charge) was cold every time we tried to use it. They have a lot of meetings and conferences a this Hilton and sometimes, during the day you might get a feeling in the lobby that you are at a conference center, with all the signs and print outs.

All of the staff were very friendly and courteous. The location is the best it could possibly be, all the best sites are close and easy to get to. You can get to the hotel from the HBF train station by S-bahn and U-bahn. You only need the short trip ticket (1.40 Euro's for use for 3 stops or less) to get from the HBF train station to the hotel.There is a U-bahn entrance 30 yards outside the Hilton's door. It is on line 6 and to get to the entrance/exit from the INSIDE of the line 6 U-bahn you go the exit OPPOSITE Mohrenstrasse street (look for signs in the U-bahn station 6) The short trip ticket will also take you to many of the best sites in Berlin if you plan well. The Breakfast Restaurant and the Executive lounge have some of the sweetest young Ladies on the planet working there. They do everything to make you feel welcome and give great service. The Breakfast buffet is very nice and has a great selection. Interestingly enough they do not understand how to make an American style Omelet, however what they make is tasty. The hors d'oeuvres in the Executive lounge are as good as any lounge we have been in, and the soup (that changes every night) is AWESOME. My wife wanted the recipe of one of the soups and the sweet young Lady (Juliana) who was serving us went back and ask the chef. He was kind enough to write down the ingredients for her. This lounge has a very pleasant atmosphere. The room we had was an Executive room and is a little small by comparison, however in general well designed. The room was completely fine in our opinion and cleaned very well every day. The previous complaints about the desk can be solve by taking the chair out from behind it and pushing the desk to the wall (it will move) then put the chair on the outside.The complaint about the closet door is legitimate, why they did not put a sliding door on it is a mystery. The only real disappointment (and this is really reaching to find something to complain about) had to do with the concierge, however I found out latter it was due to a personnel issue. I went to the concierge to ask some questions about the U-bahn. I had already looked up on line and had some knowledge of it. The person at the desk gave me the biggest line of S*** imaginable. I found out latter I was talking to one of the bell Boys playing concierge. If I had listen to him our trip would have been impacted. I latter saw they have several real concierge's that speak intelligently. So not a issue.(as long as you do not get a bell boy) We will definitely stay here again, a very nice hotel at a fair price.

To our delight (it was an overnight plane trip) our room was ready and waiting for us and the check-in process took only the time to sign the pre-filled form and receiving our key cards. The room looked exactly like the one advertised (it was a King room). The bed was comfortable, it had a long desk with plenty of electrical outlets (always a plus). The bathroom was not very big but it was adequate and clean. There was a water kettle with cups, coffee packets, tea bags, and everything you need to make a warm drink. The room also contained an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer. Our reservation included breakfast and it was served in the first floor in a room with a great view of the cathedral opposite the hotel. The breakfast selection was excellent and there was also an omelet station with a chef who can make your choice of omelets.

The executive rooms have access to the lounge on the ground floor where breakfast and snacks and evening cocktails are served. Worth paying the extra for this in my opinion as the main restaurant for breakfast is huge and a bit of a scrum when the hotel is busy in particular and breakfast is not cheap. The lounge breakfast is of course slightly limited but more than adequate with a couple of hot dishes available and a much more peaceful place to relax in in the morning. The evening cocktails and snacks are also included and a good selection of alcoholic drinks thrown in. Many people seem to use this instead of going out for dinner!

A key is needed for activation The hotel interior is elegant in a contemporary style and has probably been renovated recently The room was lovely , of adequate size with a beautiful view on Gendarmenmarkt square Plenty of mirrors, space to hang clothes and shelves, iron board and tea and coffee making facilities The bathroom is a little small but perfectly equipped The bed is heavenly as should be in a Hilton and we slept like babies Aircon is perfect , not noisy and easily managed Unfortunaltely there is no space for your personal items in the fridge. The ice dispenser is kind of hidden in a closet on the corridor close to the elevators, ice bucket is provided in the room. The breakfast spread is the usual with a nice german touch (sausages, wide choice of bread, cheesecake and crumbles ). Scrambled eggs are a disaster but the egg station is really good Gluten free cereals are available The breakfast room has beautiful view over Gendarmenmarkt The Hilton has a sausage place on Gendarmenmarkt called Dom curry which offers sausages and beer for a regular price (same as others in berlin) The fitness room is well equiped (free weights, 2 treadmills, 1 eliptical machine, 1 runner machine, 1 rowing machine and more ...) and the attendant provides water with a slice of orange . water is also available from the dispenser There is a small indoor pool . The location is perfection. One can walk to most sites (Postdammerplatz, check point Charlie, Brandebourg gate, Reichstag, Museum island, Alexanderplatz ) in less than 20 minutes We spend a day in Postdam which is a lovely place and also enjoyed a day in the zoo , really worth the visit . The neues museum is enchanting for the collections but also for the building which is ordinary from outside but amazing from the inside, beautiful renovation. book on the web to avoid lines and select the 10 am spot to get in at opening time , head straight for the nefertiti head , one flight of stairs up , then right and right . like the joconde in the louvre , the room fills quickly with hordes of tourist trying to take pictures and robbing you of the most emotional moment of the visit.

THIS IS NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL. At their best days it might be four stars otherwise I would rate it to be a 3\u00bd star hotel. The internet policy at this hotel sucks. Having booked a suite with access to the \"executive\" lounge area the homepage stated \"free internet access\". The \"free\" access turned out to be three desktops with internet access and these were frequently occupied. There was no free access beyond these three desktops. We then paid the ridiculous amount of 17\u20ac ! for 24 hrs access. However Hilton has no control of the access; the voucher did not work when trying to connect a pc and a smart phone, in this day and age families should be expected to have more than one device and even though we complained twice and got new vouchers it never got to work. The staff was not interested in the problem they were only interested in collecting the money. In a city where just about every coffee shop and even ice-bar has free (really free!!) internet access it is a complete scandal that a so called 5-star hotel charges a ridiculous amount of money for internet access even when booking an \"executive\" room and furthermore it doesn't work properly like it should. Not knowing the lounge we had booked additional \"normal\" breakfast. After the first day we discovered that the breakfast in the lounge was enough so I tried (with 24 hrs warning) to cancel the breakfast for the remaining days. I was told that the rate was \"breakfast included\" so it could not be changed, even though I know I booked it separately. And when we checked out the bill clearly stated room rate and breakfast rate as separate amounts so of course they could have cancelled the breakfast if they wanted to. Furthermore they discussed this at the desk in German talking about us clearly not knowing that I actually do speak German and could understand what they were saying. This is not the way a real classy hotel treat their guests. If we ever get the chance to visit the absolutely beautiful city of Berlin again we will definitely not stay at this hotel.

Get the train to Friedrichstr from the airport and then the u-bahn to the hotel (the hotel stop is Stadtmitte). Journey is around 30minutes. 2. When you arrive at the Airport get the Welcome Card - I got a 5 -day pass and it gets you unlimited travel and the discounts on almost EVERY attraction. The discounts are usually at least 25% off. You will save a lot of moey doing this. BUT, MAKE SURE YOUR WELCOME CARD TAKES IN BAND ZONE C (THERE IS ZONE A,B,C) AS THE JOURNEY TO/FROM THE AIRPORT IS IN BAND C AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A TICKET YOU WILL BE FINED 40EURO. The welcome card is around 33euro for 5 days. 3.. Remeber to get your welcome card stamped before you use transport for the first time. Look for a red machine at the station!! Don't forget or might get fine! Great city, Checkpoint charlie 5-10minute walk down the road and close to everything.

The facade of the building is a bit socialist, fitting for it's location in former east Berlin, but the interiors are kept in the standard Hilton class. The reception is spacious and on some nights live piano music is played. POSITIVE ASPECTS The location, with many famous sights (such as Brandenburger Tor, Unter den Linden, Alexanderplatz, Checkpoint Charlie, the egyptian museum and the city's concert hall) within walking distance. For everything else, the metro is at disposal and the nearest station is conveniently located outside the hotel entrance. The guestrooms are furbished in darker colours with a slight business feel, but not lacking any comfort. The breakfast hall offers a fantastic view towards Gendarmenmarkt and as expected, the variety and quality of the food is high. The hotel's wellness area includes an indoor swimming pool, sauna, various massage packages and a fitness room. NEGATIVE ASPECTS The lower room categories are facing the backside gardens, which unfortunately are run down and less pleasant. The price for WiFi in the rooms are beyond their worth. Parking spaces around the hotel seem scarse. PUBLIC TRANSPORT The Berlin metro, or U-Bahn as it is called, is a well connected network that takes you to any location in the city in no time. The nearest station is located right outside the hotel entrance, where the lines U2 and U6 operate. CONCLUSION Wether on business or holiday, this hotel is equipped and ready to serve.

Used the 24hr gym which was well equipped but could get quite busy because it was not very big ,also the indoor pool was very nice but again not very big. Hotel is in a great location right across the road from Stadtmitte U bahn U2 line. Takes less than 1hr from Schonefeld Airport taking the RE7 line from the airport to Alexanderplatz then the U2 line to Stadtmitte. Can be difficult purchasing a ticket at the airport and platform information is very poor. Hotel is convenient to most tourist attractions with Checkpoint Charlie just round the corner and others a short stroll. If you purchase a day ticket for all zones ABC it costs 6.80 euro and you can use all U&S bahn trains,buses and trams,remember to validate your ticket. Word of warning the Reichstag dome as been closed to visitors since November 2010 due to the threat of terror attack but you can enter if you purchase tickets in advance. Sachsenhausen concentration camp is well worth a visit and its free, it takes about 1hr on the S1 line to Oranienburg then about a 20 min walk to the camp,this station is in zone C. Our great trip was slightly spoiled by the pompous miserable staff the Hilton hotel employs at the check in desk. On our last morning we were checking out early before the buffet breakfast restaurant opened so paid the 4.50 euro charge to have it in our room. It turned up late and there was only 1 breakfast and it was to late to get another so we had to rush it down. When we checked out we complained there was only 1 breakfast and the reply was,well you did'nt pay for it,to which i replied,we actually did because it was in the price of the hotel room especially when they charge 26 euros for a American breakfast.

It was a leisure trip with specific priorities to see the Hitler Memorabilia special exhibition at the National Historic Museum and to visit the Cecilionhof Palace museum and hotel in Potsdam, the site of the 1945 Stalin/Churchill/Truman meeting at the end of the war in Europe. Both of our special objectives were met. We had stayed at this hotel in 2002 and were pleased to see the results of an extensive investment in upgrading the property since then. The hotel is nearly perfectly placed near Checkpoint Charlie, the Unter den Linden, Brandenburg gate, Museum Island, etc. Almost everything of visitor interest is walking distance and what is not is accessible from directly outside the front door of the hotel into the metro system which will take you anywhere in the Berlin region efficiently and inexpensively. The Executive Lounge in this hotel is superior, with friendly and efficient service, an excellent complimentary full breakfast, snacks and tea throughout the day and also complimentary cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in the evening hours. It is a great oasis during breaks in the action during the day. Computers with high speed internet access (and printers) are available in the Exec Lounge at no charge. Get the \"Welcome Berlin\" card for a reasonable fee and use public transportation and get discounts at most venues in town....it's a great value. The rooms are newly remodeled on the executive floor, very modern, chic and perfectly functional in every respect. Maid service is quick and efficient. An extremely valuable feature of this hotel is the Concierge Desk, which is continuously manned by an extremely knowledgeable and engaging crew of experienced English speaking men (I didn't see a woman there during our stay). They were extremely helpful with shopping, restaurant and other information. If you have noticed the word \"efficient\" recurring here rather frequently....well there is a good reason for that. Everything about this property works and every request is cheerfully and promptly satisfied. We were able to get all of our shopping and touring objectives met....not to mention some extraordinary Italian cuisine nearby at the Concierge's suggestion.....in total comfort and at a reasonable cost. I would add that being in Berlin mid winter was a treat....we knew it would be cold.....we dressed accordingly, and like the indigenous folks the weather didn't slow us down a bit. In fact a beautiful solitary walk in the snowy woods in Potsdam on a quiet early afternoon just before lunch was a memorable moment in the whole trip.

We had breakfast there each day and afternoon sweets and/or evening snacks and libations several times. The lounge was very well run, starting with the email I received asking about my arrival time. I requested 11 am and the room was ready when we arrived at 11. All our questions were answered and the staff was efficient and helpful. The room was nice, newly renovated, and fairly spacious. We had a view over the courtyard and in spite of being near the elevator it was quiet in the room. One late afternoon and a Saturday morning were interrupted by construction noise that sounded as if it were in the room with us. Fortunately, it did not last long. We really liked the little snap out spotlights over the bed so one of us could read while the other slept. The bathroom was adequate and everything worked quite well. The tub has a high side and I was glad there was a grab bar to hang on to. There was plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The best part of the hotel, and it is all good, is the location.

Also, Germans seem to be a grim lot with nary a smile except when they're drunk off their b in the brewhouses. I sensed a low level of racism or at least suspicion from many of them as I am asian. Also, no one seems to go out and enjoy nights out. We were there on a Thursday night and there were no parts of the town where it seemed like people gathered to meet up with friends and have dinner or a drink. Very strange indeed.

Hilton bought the almost finished building site and turned into their flagship venue in Berlin. At least the tried to. The raw material they took over from the socialist planners did not allow for a lot of creative realisation. The hotel has two (terrible) back yards around which many (most?) of the rooms are arranged. The ceilings are too low to make you feel comfortable, and the very American style is quite misplaced (but then, did US chains ever care?). Some years ago, I stayed on the exclusive Executive floor, which did not feel special, and last time they booked me into the newly renovated 5th floor, and again, it felt more like a standard, OK kind-of accommodation. The rooms are too small to make any good impression, and the air condition worked poorly (in the newly renovated room!). Breakfast became quite good over the years, with a lot of freshly made dishes and a super view on Gendarmenmarkt. In any case, the location is the biggest plus of Hilton Berlin.

When noise continued, I called reception and requested that someone come up to my room. Within 5 minutes, someone was at my room, and when she heard the noise, she immediately went down to the area of the noise and within minutes, the annoying sounds ceased. The other thing that I liked was the location of the hotel and the fact that the metro stop is virtually in front of the hotel.

The lobby is huge and nice; at the front desk were many employees, so we could check-in right away. Because of my Diamond HHonors status we were given an upgrade to an executive room at the 6th and upper floor. The room was of a proper size with good quality furniture in light colors, a nice bed, an easy chair with side table and a working desk with chair. There was a minibar and coffee/tea facilities. Our room was on the site of the Gendarmen Markt and the view was fantastic! The bathroom was sufficient and clean. The lounge is on the same floor and has also a nice view. They have excellent coffee from a good coffee machine, a wide variety in select tea bags and all kinds of soft drinks all day. In the afternoon they serve tarts and cookies, in the evening many hot and cold items, all very tasty and a different selection the two evenings we were here, together with an assortment of drinks. There is a computer available for free Internet. We had a rate including breakfast; we used this in the buffet restaurant. They have an amazingly wide variety in items and a cook to make eggs in a station as part of the buffet. It was superb in every way. What we saw of the breakfast in the lounge was also very good. We had dinner once in the Mark Brandenburg restaurant and it was delicious and reasonable prized, the latter is very special for a restaurant in a hotel. Service was somewhat less, however. The location couldn\u2019t be better; we could easily walk to many highlights of the city. There is a metro entrance just in front and we took the metro several times. We had Opera tickets and it was very comfortable to use this line to go to the Deutsche Oper at the other end of the city. Within 20 minutes we were from the exit at the hotel at the entrance of the Opera House, using just one metro line. Being at the Gendarmen Markt and so close to the Concert Hall gave us another advantage. We wanted to attend a concert, but that was sold out on the website of the Concert Hall. On the day of the performance I went to the ticket box at opening time and could buy two tickets!

So a comparison may be in order. They are seven minutes walk away from each other - Checkpoint Charlie to the Gendarmenmarkt. Both are excellent central places to stay with convenient U2 and U6 S-Bahn at hand. Halfway between the hotels lies a good and well-stocked supermarket (Kaisers at north side Friedrichstrasse 60). The Mercure was a very welcoming hotel (and my warmest thanks to Liese and her colleagues for making it so). I had an internal room onto the treed rectangular courtyard; very quiet, with a pleasant balcony. The move to employ an Italian architect of note to design this hotel has certainly paid off: this was one of the most memorable hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, so beautifully thought out, spacious, relaxing, and just totally right in every respect. And unlike the usual cramped shower, the wet room was all a shower space should be. But the Mercure chain does need to think hard about not providing what is now taken for granted: bath-towels (necessary after an evening shower), toiletries (of which no shampoo, nothing), and bottles of mineral water. And the old TVs, which need upgrading, detract from the overall experience. I cannot comment on the food as I did not pay for breakfast, and cannot say that I found anywhere handy for it. As already mentioned in these Trip Reports, the computer at the ready in the foyer in a dedicated area was great to use and invaluable. To summarise: a great hotel in which to feel at home. The Berlin Hilton was similarly welcoming, and my warm thanks to Marieka and Rebecca for making my arrival and departure so pleasant. This hotel has a great setting onto the square, the perfect place to sit in the evening. I had breakfast in the hotel: attractive room (one area looks through onto the Square) with attentive and pleasant service; the food offered a wide, if not inspired, choice and made a satisfactory start to the day. Rooms can often mean a quite long walk. Compact and well-designed, I again had a quiet room looking onto a central courtyard with vegetable beds and glasshouses growing food for the hotel. Good modern bathroom with a proper bath, well equipped with toiletries and bathrobes. But not a room to linger in and read like the Mercure. The lack of a computer for general use has already been mentioned by others: this is a serious omission for travellers today (we don't all have laptops with us!). To sum up: better location than the Mercure but with a less enjoyable room. To eat: I ate several times at each of the following: Lungomare trattoria bar (Spaghetti puttanesca - excellent); Malatesta caffe ristorante (Pappadelle al funghi - excellent); Maothai aka Sisaket thai restaurant Mauerstrasse 76 (good lunch offers, overpriced in the evenings and empty). The two Italian are between the Mercure and the Hilton and reasonably priced. Guidebooks: if you take no other get Berlin (Everyman MapGuides) from Amazon. Brilliant!

It's an underground stop and so it does not destrop the ambience of the Gendarmenmarkt (plaza in front of the hotel). Two sets of elevators manage the movement of guests and it never seemed crowded to us. There is a huge breakfast dining area as well, so there was never a wait for our buffet breakfast. We'd pre-paid the room and included breakfast for a very good, low rate. The room was large for European standards, comfy mattress (twin beds here, but there are other options), two fluffy pillows, great AC, lots of hot water and pressure. We asked for a quite room, away from the elevators and were accommodated. We slept peacefully and it was quiet! The staff went out of their way to personalize the hotel with friendliness. Rooms were cleaned efficiently and new towels were hung. The sheets were changed each day. The breakfast was hot and cold, with many choices. One could order eggs made to order at a station, and the line moved quickly. The hotel was within easy walking distance of all the major sites. Checkpoint Charlie was about 4 blocks, German History Museum 5 blocks, Potsdamer Platz perhaps 8 blocks. It never took us longer than 20 minutes to reach any of these sites. We took the subway once or twice, but Berlin is a great walking city. There were many people here on business, so the business center was often busy.

It was great value but I went for an Executive room which gave access to the Executive Lounge - strongly recommended. From Tegel airport to the hotel by taxi was 20 euros and took about 30 minutes. The location of the hotel is superb, right on Gendenmarkt with its lovely buildings and plenty of places to sit down in the evening for a drink and a meal. It is very easy to walk to most places from the hotel but we took out a Zone A and B pass most days which gave us unlimited transport (trains/buses/trams) as far as Wanasee which was 30 minutes away. Tickets can be bought from the machines at the station outside the hotel and there is an English translation if you press the button with the flags on. To go to Potsdam you will also need Zone C included but unlimited travel for one day for zones ABC was only 6 euros 50 which is good value and very convenient if you are tired and just want to get on a bus or tram for a ride outside the city.. The entrance to the hotel is grand and a pianist entertained at night. The bar looked rather unatmospheric so we decided to sit at the cafes in the square for a late evening drink as it was so warm. We were disappointed with the room as it seemed rather small but after moving some furniture around it seemed bigger and was OK. The air conditioning was efficient but I would have preferred a window that opened wider rather than the Health and Safety limiter which meant it only opened 6 inches. We faced the inner courtyard so there was no view but it was very quiet at night which was an advantage. Decor was fine, the bathroom was modern and the whole room was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and there were adequate provisions such as shower gel. There was a complimentary bottle of water each day and all in all it served the purpose. The Executive Lounge is worth every penny so I would certainly recommend paying the little extra for that facility. Breakfast could be taken in the Lounge or in the restaurant on the first floor whch we did every day. Breakfast was first class with everything you could want from yoghurts and various fruits to cold meats and cheeses, delicious breads, cakes which seemed popular but not for us at breakfast time, a selection of smoked fish and tomatoes, cucumber, olives etc, a hot selection of sausages, tomatoes, hash browns, baked beans, scrambled egg etc. There was also an omelette station or fried eggs. We requested poached eggs from the waiter on several occasions and they were freshly cooked. On Saturday and Sunday there is the inclusion of sparkling wine which was very popular with many guests, us included. Breakfast is served until 10.30am and 11am at week-ends. The Executive Lounge breakfast was far more modest but you could avoid the crowds there is you prefer. I liked the fact that I could go for a coffee at 7am when it opened and read the papers or go on the internet that was provided free in the Lounge, great for printing off boarding passes etc. Soft drinks, fruit and crisps etc are available all day as was bottled beer (Becks and Stella). In the afternoon cakes appeared and from 6pm until 8.30pm there were unlimited canapes of varying but good quality. Alcohol such as wine, sparkling wine, spirits etc were available in the Exec Lounge from 6pm until 11pm - a great facility. The staff of the hotel were in the main charming and attentive and overall went out of their way to ensure a pleasant stay. If we returned to Berlin I would go for the Hilton in preference to other hotels but if you can, as I have said previously, go for the Executive package. A few other bits and pieces of things we would recommend in Berlin. Make Fat Tire Bike Tours one of your first excursions. We did the Berlin City Tour the day after we arrived and for 20 euros it was great value. Even for a 60 year old, biking around Berlin and seeing all the sites was an easy experience. We also went to the Reichstag at 8pm in the evening. The queues were still there but shorter than in the day and it is free to go to the top and see the views. It is an easy walk to Checkpoint Charlie from the hotel. The Sony Centre at Potsdamer Plaz (two U metro stops from the hotel) is buzzy at night and worth experiencing to see how Berlin has rebuilt itself. All in all, we had a great trip to Berlin, enhanced by the facilities at the Hilton and I would have no hesitation in recommending it as a classy but not over the top hotel at a good price and with excellent service.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cI wonder why Hilton Berlin still has 5 star rating\u201d", "Author": "kobri", "ReviewID": "UR36544029", "Content": "Let me say, usually I stay in Concorde hotel Berlin, which is a new 5 star moddle in Charlottenburg.

Well Hilton is a pretty old hotel (build 1992) and you can see it , and smell it immediately. The rooms were very clean, and everything was on the right place, but dull and worn out. There was a very specific smell in the room, and absolutely disgusting smell in the bathroom. Something like smell of old toilet and water pipes. You could see that the bathroom doors were in a poor condition because of humidity. The noise isolation was also not good enough, you could hear the traffic noise outside, and more irritating, every noise from the corridor. The staff seemed to be also worn out, since we haven't seen a lot of smile. We didn't have breakfast, since it was pretty overpriced, and you can get plenty of cheap and good breakfast just one step outside the hotel. My conclusion, the only one good thing about this hotel is location. It could be a good deal if you have some points to spend, because the regular Hilton rate is pretty expensive.

Instead we walked down the street to a bakery and had terrific pastries and coffee for about 10 euros for all four of us. (The Einstein Coffee place across the street from the hotel is more expensive, so make sure you go out the front of the hotel and head to your right until the street ends, which is where the bakery is located.) One thing I would definitely recommend to those visiting Berlin is to take the walking tour. The two best companies are Original Berlin Walks and Inside Tours. The other \"free\" tours do not have dedicated guides, and the walking tour we took with Original Berlin Walks cost us 12 euros per adult and our kids were free. My husband and I both said it was the best 24 euros we spent. The tours usually run around 3-1/2 hours in length and give so much information that you would not otherwise get.

So it was very easy to get around. We took the taxi from the airport & only took 15 minutes from door to door (no traffic jam) & cost just 17 Euro. The staff in the hotel is curtious but quite formal. I guess it is really a business hotel & tend to cater for older clientels. However they are very helpful & also very secure. You must have a room key to operate the lift so we generally feel very safe. The hotel over see the two grand churches & also the famous square infront of the National Theatre. So in the evening its quite well lite & very romantic walking along the deserted square. However, a word of warning, the church bells start rining on Sunday from 8am onward, and goes on & on (at least for half hour!) So if you were (like us) out late on Saturday night, you're get a shock early on Sunday morning for the 'wake-up' call. But that's the only time we noticed the bells, best not stay here over Saturday night if you want a lay-in. They are have a good size swimming pool & small gym. Both are very clean & modern. The pool particular are always busy, but I went only in afternoon period, may be its quieter in morning / off peak time. The gym is open 24 hours, but you have to pay for the sauna & steam room. The sauna also allow mixed nudist use, so we didn't try it out. Overall this is a good choise if you want a base to explore the city centre. From the hotel you can walk almost everywhere easily.

We were upgraded through HHonors to a corner junior suiite - 4096 - which offered close-up views of the beautiful French and German cathedrals in Gendarmenmarkt. The suite was approx. 8m x 7m and comprised an entrance hall, a lovely sitting room with three floor-to-ceiling windows, a sofa and 2 armchairs, a huge LCD tv and a business desk etc. An opulent double-handbasin, black granite with white tiled bathroom provided all the amenities and a nicely-proportioned bedroom with another LCD tv with lots of wardrobe space and drawers.

We had Christmas dinner in the Mark Brandenburg Restaurant, the food was good, however the service was a bit offhand at times, super at others. The we had a room on the 3rd floor and our friends were on the 5th floor. Both our rooms were a good hike from the lifts, while there seemed plenty of vacant rooms closer to the lifts. The rooms were clean and well presented. I think the d\u00e9cor was a little dowdy and not very modern. However this is just my personal taste. We asked to be in a non smoking room, however the halls in our floor had a very distinctive smell of smoke, which wasn\u2019t very pleasant in the morning for us non smokers! My only major issue I had with hotel was an issue with our towels. We had hung up our towels to re- use in the evening (as suggested by the hotel if we wanted to reuse our towels). However we found that they had been relocated when they had made up the room and my sister and I had no idea who\u2019s towel was who\u2019s.

We chose to stay at the Hilton, since we were able to cash in some of his award points for two free nights, making it a great deal for us. The Hilton is located in Mitte (the center of Berlin) and was within walking distance of most of the sights we wanted to visit (i.e. the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, the Fernsehturm or TV Tower and the Pergamon Museum). The hotel is rather conveniently located right next to the U-bahn stop Stadtmitte, so getting to other areas of the city was very easy. We were also pleased to find that the hotel was adjacent to the Gendarmenmarkt and not far from the Opernpalais and Alexanderplatz, since all three locations hosted lovely Christmas markets. Our room in the Hilton was on the fifth floor, facing the interior courtyard. This didn't provide us with a great view, but it was very quiet. The room was not very big by American standards but it was large by European standards. It was nicely furnished, though it didn't really seem up to a five-star rating. The room had a king size bed with two twin-size comforters (typical for Germany), a desk and desk chair, an armchair, a nightstand, a dresser, a large flat screen tv, a small minibar and a small closet. The bathroom was very nice (it may have been recently remodeled, as it seemed nicer than the rest of the room), with a shower/tub, a toilet, a sink with lots of counter space to put your toiletries and heated mirrors that didn't fog up during showers. One of my only complaints about the room was the lack of a thermostat. There was a dial on the wall that you could use to turn the heat up and a fan on, but we could never get the room to be much cooler without opening the windows. Even with the dial set to its lowest setting and the fan off, my travel clock said the room was still 74 degrees. The hotel is large, with a beautiful and spacious lobby area and several restaurants and bars. We ate at the Mark Brandenburg Restaurant on Christmas Eve, and the food was excellent. It was a fixed 4-course menu, but we enjoyed every course. The restaurant was large, but it had a nice elegant but cozy atmosphere. The breakfast buffet was very expensive (24 Euros per person), but it was quite hearty with lots of options. We ate a big breakfast there every day, and it kept us full through dinner-time. The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and courteous. Every single person we spoke with (from reception to housekeeping) was incredibly nice and happy to help us with anything we needed. I'm not sure that the hotel merits its five-star rating, but I would recommend it to a friend and/or stay there again if I could find a good deal.

There were two large closets on of which had shelves and a safe, the other had room for hanging clothes. There were slippers and robes available although the robes had definitely seen better days. There was a queen size bed with soft bedding and pillows. The room also had an arm chair and a desk. The room had a mini-bar which I did not like because it was one that charged you whenever an item was moved. The room and the whole hotel were very cleaned and well maintained (much different from many of the other Hiltons I have stayed in). The staff at the front desk was very polite and helpful.

We have been to the restaurant Mark Brandenburg twice, good service and quality, though not outstanding. And we have been to Trader Vic's on Christmas Eve. It started with a waitress that did not listen to our ordering. It continued with only one starter (we shared) instead of two. We ordered white wine by the glass and had to insist on two other staff to have it (while the hot starter was waiting at our table). One of the main dishes was not cooked to order. The table was not set correctly (which should be in such a place) and the red wine was out of sight, as well. We did complain and after that the restaurant manager got involved and ameliorated the situation. But the restaurant experience was already spoiled.

We weren't expecting to spend much time in the hotel but we did want to have a view of the Dom from our bedroom and wanted to be high off the street to minimise traffic noise. A room on the Executive floor offered this. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel and its' staff and so... Four years later we were lured back to Berlin by the opera and there was real no decision making involved in choosing a hotel.The famous Adlon is historic and was considered for a moment but the location is too busy with sightseers. We had no dislikes regarding the Hilton and were in fact looking forward to staying there again. We arrived at 6pm after a spirited drive from Frankfurt. A valet parked the car-there is a fee for parking in the attached garage which I think was 17E a day, while we went straight to the 6th floor check-in. This takes place in the cosy Club room where breakfast, afternoon and evening snacks are served. Drinks-spirits, wines, beer and sodas are complimentary and after a 350 mile drive I needed one (or two).The young women who staff the Club are real ambassadors for the hotel-friendly efficent and super-industrious. The hotel room is not huge but we don't have parties or practice our golf swings in them. They are tastefully decorated with lots of wooden furniture and comfy beds with duvets. Extra pillows were ordered as were extra hangers and they appeared within minutes as did our luggage. The windows are ingenious and open in two different planes so one can lean out and get some fresh air or puff on a cigarette. Outside the window was Berlin! It had hardly seemed to matter on our first visit as we were there for the opera and the city was almost immaterial but having seen it once and warmed to it, massive construction notwithstanding, we were excited to see more of it and revisit places that had been so pleasurable before (Spreewald and Sans Souci come to mind) I had kept the rental car for day trips outside the city as the countryside around Berlin is peaceful and easy on the eye. You can rent a car from Sixt in the hotel. I use Hertz booked in the USA. For exploring the city though it makes little sense to drive and have the hassle of finding parking. The U Bahn at Stadtmitte station in front of the hotel is the way to go-it's fast and cheap and easy to find your way around. Trains are safe and clean. Like every hotel I stay in there are parts of it I don't get time to visit and parts of it I might camp out in. Spa? What spa? However the bar area in the lobby is a great place to people-watch while having a cold beer or a tasty snack. Service is attentive and the quality of the food is exceptional for a bar area although the menu is short. The spaghetti a la carbonara had me licking the plate but I don't think anyone noticed. At night this bar has a small jazz combo with vocalist but the volume level doesn't impede conversation unless you ask for a table next to the drummer. It is not a hang out for people under 40. If you are from the USA don't expect to be tipping like you do back home. This ain't New York. I have seen criticism of the concierge in these reviews but I have no cause to compalin as they were always helpful and efficient. If someone gives you good or bad service it is good to identify them to management so their behaviour can be rewarded or corrected. They arranged a great city tour for us and helped us with directions and reccommendations. They are kept constantly busy. There is a handy little gift shop in one corner of the lobby where one can buy snacks and drinks for the room if you are mini-bar shy like me. I haul my beers and wine from a supermarket a block away. Next to that shop in the corner of the lobby is a cafeteria where you can load up a tray full of hot German food for way less than 10E including beer and dessert. Great value if you are pressed for time and just need to refuel for more sightseeing. As mentioned in many reviews the Gendarmenmarkt area is well served by good restaurants- Aigner, Lutter and Wegner etc but the food and service in the Mark Brandenburger just off the Hilton lobby is hard to beat. Both Aigner and Lutter waitstaff show visible disappointment when you don't order a bottle of wine and both are tight rooms where the noise level registers DIN on the scale. Brandenburger is a civilised Oasis in comparison and the view of the German Dom at night reminds you that you are in that very special city called Berlin. In summary-the Hilton is a large, busy city hotel. I consider it very well run from my two visits there. The rooms may not be spectacular or huge but they are tastefully appointed and everything performs its' function. Huge bathrooms can be found in Las Vegas. A few words spoken in German will get you even friendlier service. No one on staff was ever less than helpful despite their workload. Room service was prompt and tasty but there are many dining options just outside your door and in clement weather (Easter onwards) many restaurants around the square set up tables in the plaza. Much of your sightseeing can be done on foot from the Hilton. If you like museums or tour boat rides there is hardly any city better equipped to indulge you than Berlin. There are airplane rides in vintage aircraft and seaplane tours if you want to see Berlin's vast sprawl from the air. I can't wait to go back as there is so much to still to be scratched off my list!

We chose it because of the Hilton brand and also the central location of the hotel. The hotel itself is nice and modern. It has all the facilities you would expect from a large hotel chain like the Hilton. Rooms are of a good size and bathrooms are well-equipped (Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries). Our room had a view of the Gendarmenmarkt. It is located in a somewhat quiet part of town and apart from Checkpoint Charlie, you have to take a U-Bahn or bus to get anywhere (unless you're a keen walker). The U-Bahn station is right outside the hotel though, so not a problem. Service however was poor. We arrived at 12pm and were told that our Executive Room wouldn't be ready till 1. That was fine, as their earliest stated check-in time is 2, so we were invited to chill in the Executive Lounge and they offered to look after our luggage until then. Trouble was, the room wasn't ready at 1, or at 2. The staff at the Executive Lounge (when the desk was manned - rare) were unfriendly and a bit difficult. OK, we had to wait. But they cleared away the snacks in the Executive Lounge at 12 and didn't bring out any fresh ones. Then at 2.30 the room was ready, but the luggage got lost in their system and we had to wait another 2 hours for that. So we lost an afternoon of sight-seeing which was a shame. We were supposed to get free water every day and a free newspaper; that never happened. When we complained on check-out, the receptionist unhelpfully said \"well what do you want me to do about it?\" Not the sort of service you'd expect from the Hilton. We complained to the manager, who offered to take a miserly 10 euros off the total bill - they needn't have bothered.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Recommended\u201d", "Author": "Crinkly", "ReviewID": "UR5519570", "Content": "Hilton Berlin - Mohrenstrasse - great location, friendly staff, check in a bit of a shambles , arrived early and had to wait a while - not a big deal , nice bar - have a drink and chill while you are waiting!.

The bathroom was sparklingly clean and had everything you could need. The complimentary slippers, robe and rubber duck were a nice touch. We found the staff at reception very pleasant and helpful although the concierge was a bit grumpy. The location is fabulous for sightseeing, you step out of the hotel to face the Deustcher Dom, the square has lovely cafes and restaurants, the U-Bahn is right nearby and the open top bus tour stops a few feet away. We had booked on line through the Hilton Website and had opted for room only, on arrival we were told about the 22 euro breakfast but opted to walk to a lovely nearby cafe and sat outside to enjoy an excellent breakfast for 7 euros. On Sunday we returned for the brunch buffet which I believe is a tradition with Berliners and cost 9 Euros plus drinks- excellent and an experience in itself.

But the best is the clubroom. There are comfortable seats and sofas in a nice quiet atmosphere. High-quality breakfast is served (included in room rate) as well as cakes, pastries, sandwiches and all kinds of drinks (soft drinks, sparkling wine, white and red wine, liqueurs, spirits) at no extra costs. You may save a whole meal this way or get appetizers. After all, paying for the Executive floor may be an economical decision.

The hotel is well place in the city, with a U-Bahn station right outside the door; this makes everywhere very easily accessible.

Our room was clean and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice. The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate! The swimming pool and gym were both excellent, although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna... Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service. The hotel restaurants looked nice, but we did not try them. Probably my main criticism with the hotel is it's size - the hotel is very big and somewhat impersonal. Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out.
