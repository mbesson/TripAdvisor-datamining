The bathroom is awful, mildew and falling apart. We came back to the room after a long days journey in a hot and muggy rome to find that the hot water heater was broken and we could not shower. We were given no compensation for this. When I went down to inquire about it the staff member blew it off as if it was no concern. I asked it they had bottled water for guest. He replied that they had both flat and gas available for the guest in such an overly generous way I thought that the water was complimentary...it was not! They did take it off the bill though. Worst for last: The beds are so old that we were sinking in the middle. They pushed two singles together for our 4 night stay which was a nightmare...I am a creature of habit with certain things and falling asleep with the heavy arm of my handsome beloved over me is an absolute must...we could not get comfortable at all!!!!The beds sagged at different areas and even when we did try our best to snuggle, the beds moved apart. The staff was nice, but not enough to way out the other conditions. The wi-fi was free but someone was always on the house computer and we didn't cart ours on our trip. The breakfast was the same everyday. Although I have an understanding that breakfast is not a big meal for Italians, I also have an understanding that it could have been vast improved. The rolls were stale, the packaged cookies and wafers low quality, the coffee the worst you could possibly imagine (and I have had incredible Italian coffee), boxed corn flakes and warm milk galore...a total carb/sugar breakfast guaranteed to have your blood sugar crashing, head ache pounding, dehydrated start to your journey in history thick Rome where you just might have wanted to start out nourished, well slept, and comfortably bathed. I did actually take photos of the mold in the bathroom, but I can't get them to load up and we decided I should just go ahead and get our reviews posted.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Price\u201d", "Author": "aviator44", "ReviewID": "UR120182293", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Igea for 1 night at both the beginning and end of a tour we booked to see Northern Italy. Rome being very expensive, this was affordable and very clean within walking distance to all sights. 3 min. from Termini Station it was very convenient. The staff was very helpful in providing a map and directing us to our sightseeing. They were generous in allowing us to take a bagged breakfast since our tour was leaving earlier than the breakfast room opened. They even kept our extra baggage for no extra fee while we took our 5 day tour. Please note that if you're traveling in Europe and expecting the same star rating for hotels there as you would in North America you are being unfair in your expectations. This hotel is old, elevator is small and beds are both small and basic (NOT a Shertaton pillowtop mattress by any means) but it is what you need to accept for a hotel in Europe. Paying double what you would for the same hotel in North America is to expected. Having said that, I would consider this hotel cleaner than almost all the Holiday Inns or Comfort Inns I've ever stayed at. They had free use of the computer and WIFI in the lobby. If you were to compare this hotel to any of the others in the area, you would be hardpressed to find anything cheaper that is as good as this one.

But there are 100s of other hotels in that neighbourhood so there is an option to try alternatives The breakfast was not satisfactory may be because I don't like hard breads. room was clean but not at all upto the mark. The main problem is the structure of the hotel building. This is an early 19th century house converted into hotel and my room was very small. May be I am not familiar with normal rates of rome hotels, but I dont think such a hotel deserves 60Euro/night. The overall apperance of the hotel, its unstructured small lobby, tiny clumsy lift was sufficient to reduce half of my excitment about this trip. The person who was handing the breakfast room and the odd hour reception is somewhat rude and occationally misbehaved. The wifi access zone only covers the tiny lounge. not connectable from room.

We booked at short notice (2 weeks) and it was the best value and highest rated hotel available in a central location. The hotel is located in the streets around the main Termini station. Its not the nicest neighborhood, but we never felt unsafe at night. If you come from Fiumicino its only a 5 minute walk from the station so you can check in straight away. All the main sites in the city can be easily reached on foot in under 30 mins, apart from the Vatican which we took the metro to (but we wish we had walked as it makes the tube seem fun). There are a host of very good restaurants in the area, most seem better value than the ones in the central areas and the food was excellent. Our room was basic, but clean and comfortable. The overall decor was very strange, like something out of the 70's (so i've been told, i'm only 25) but it was all in good condition. There was a/c but it wasn't needed. The beds were firm but luckily we both prefer it that way. The only gripe was that the double was just two singles done up separately, and they drift apart from each other on the tiled floor. The bathroom was (very) small but perfectly functional. The room was very quiet, and the only real thing wrong was the fact the TV didn't work, but we weren't in Rome to watch Italian TV! The hotel is very smart and clean. There is free internet in the lobby and the staff are English speaking, friendly and helpful. There was a simple breakfast included, which consisted of 'tea', coffee and a selection of pastries. It was basic and not to our personal taste, but you get what you pay for and it makes getting out to explore the city much more pleasant. In conclusion, this is not a luxury hotel by any means, but if you want a comfortable and convenient base to explore the city and don't want to blow the budget then I would highly recommend it. Rome is a fascinating city, even for someone like myself with no interest in Art or Religion. We got very unlucky with the weather, with almost constant heavy rain. Must sees are the Colosseum, Pantheon, Palatino and obviously the Vatican. It is a very expensive city however (and Im from London), so be prepared to spend.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "derby", "Title": "\u201cnice room, nice staff, close to train station\u201d", "Author": "knpderby", "ReviewID": "UR114579710", "Content": "rome is very expensive so don't expect much for your money - while we paid more here than any other city we visited in Italy, it was nice and very central. breakfast was in the price and was a nice continental. would recommend if you don't have loads of money to spend on hotel.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cPretty Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "Tashahd", "ReviewID": "UR113059421", "Content": "The staff here was very kind, and the service was very helpful.

The hotel is located near the station, making it a good base for getting around - despite not being in the heart of all the action, the Colloseo is 10-15 mins walk away, and the historic centre slightly further. If you are willing to walk (or use the Metro (we only used it to get to St. Peters for our early morning tour)) it is a good base.

The shutters do make it completely black should you wish to close them. The room is small, but very clean, and you'll spend so little time in it it doesn't matter. The beds are very firm and very small and as with most continental hotels we were given 2 beds pushed together as oppose to a double. The lift is something from the 70s, which stops at every mid level, so you do need to carry luggage (not that we had much), up/down a flight of stairs. Breakfast was poor, cornflakes, bread and coissants, as well as juice and coffee, but you'd expect some fruit/ continental meats for it to be worth going!
