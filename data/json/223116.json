I like Drury's midrange style, which puts it a step above a motel but still affordable. It's good for budget business travel.

The staff was generally quite pleasant and helpful. The room keys are wireless, which is easier and probably more reliable than inserted card keys. Location was reasonably close to both the French Quarter and the convention center, though neither is an easy walk in muggy weather. Another plus: Rouse's market, which is a lot like Whole Foods, is about a block away. I wasn't so happy with the cleanliness of the room. Here's the main thing: One day, the cleaning person didn't finish the bathroom, and left dirty towels on the floor. It was as if they left in the middle of the job. It was a very irritating thing to come back to after a long day of work, when I wanted to take a shower. I called the front desk and the problem was fixed in less than an hour, but was very inconvenient. Also, the desk had food stains, and there was a strong smell of hair oil in the room.

Got 2nd floor(building has 9 floors) literally right next to where they are building that parking garage. Checkin-in: Was quick and painless. Pointed out my room request and was told there was nothing else available. To be honest, they were very nice and the customer service was good Room: 213. Double bed room with fridge/microwave. Room was clean. Bathroom was small but accomodating. But as we found out at 830am Saturday morning when the jackhammers or whatever they were started off we were WAY too close to the construction. Every morning except for Sunday we heard all kind of noise from the construction. I dont believe they should be booking folks in these rooms and if they do how about some warning about this??? Just a hey you are going to be near the construction would be nice. Most places 830am is not that late but in New Orleans, guests are sleeping at this time. It got so we would go take naps by the pool or have to wait til late evening to catch up on some sleep. Breakfast/happy hour: I've stayed at other Drurys where these services were pretty decent. We showed up for happy at 550pm(starts at 530) to lukewarm hotdogs and cold mac and cheese and hey we're out of this(tequila, wine for happy hour). Breakfast was lukewarm to cold biscuits, icky powdered eggs, and inedible sausage. I'm not expecting the Ritz but food shouldn't be cold. I've experienced much better at other Drury hotels. Please take notes from the Drury Plaza San Antonio(see review) We totally skipped it after the second day and went to Daisy Dukes(budget restaurant) for breakfast. Only thing that was good was the veggies on the evening snacks. Shame Pool: Was decent when folks didn't allow their kids to do cannonballs and such in the pool and 3 yr olds weren't in the jacuzzi. Location: I thought was good. I've stayed directly in the quarter and I prefer modern hotels/amenities so I was not happy at my last location(see review). It was barely a 4 block walk and there you are on Bourbon St. Recommend/return: Maybe but only if the construction is done or I can at least get a room away from it and I would not waste time with the happy hour/breakfast.

We were each given coupons for 3 free drinks for each night of our stay and directed to the serving area. What a pleasant surprise. There was a nice selection of beer, wine and basic mixed drinks and the appetizers were substantial enough to count for dinner (stuffed baked potatoes, cheese, etc). Breakfast the next morning was similarly fulfilling -- scrambled eggs, waffles, fruit, biscuit & gravy, yogurt). Moreover, the place was immaculate. Note that I've given a 5 rating for the restaurant, but there isn't a restaurant on the premises per se. My rating is for where the drinks and food are served in the the mornings and evenings. All of the staff were friendly and helpful (although some could use a little more training about attractions and galleries on nearby Julia Street). The hotel is in an ideal location - easy to the quarter, waterfront, and warehouse districts. The parking is a bit tight but the valets did an excellent job getting cars to people or helping flag down cabs as needed (we were there during a VERY busy weekend with multiple events going on, but never had to wait more than a few minutes for service from the valets). The rooftop pool was sparkling clean. It is too bad there aren't any umbrellas on the roof, but given the brisk breezes that kick up, their absence is understandable. if you wait until later in the afternoon the shadow from the neighboring building provides sufficient shade to escape the sun. I attribute the high quality of service, cleanliness of all parts of the hotel (including stairwells), and overall feel of the place to the hands on approach of the general manager, Slade Stratman. I don't think I've ever been to a hotel where the general manager was not only so visible but responsive to every request.

And I am so glad I took that advice! We stay for 6 nights and felt like we were at home. We had a two room suite and while the layout was a bit wonky (a wall jutted out preventing the door from happening completely.) it was very roomy. The towels and linens were good quality and clean. We did use the pull out sofa, which wasn't any where near being comfortable, but then what pull out ever is? The king size bed though was glorious. Yes, I sneaked a peek at the mattress and it was clean. They use light colored bedspreads instead of the dark busy ones you're afraid to touch. The free hot breakfasts were terrific. Scrambled eggs, sausages, french toast, hot waffles along with other 'continental' offerings. And the 5:30 kick back made lunch the only meal we needed to go out and find. Which given the hotel's proximity to Canal and Bourbon Streets a non-issue. The rooftop pool was small, but generally clean. Although there were a few loose tiles on the side, one actually fell off the week we were there. But we weren't there for the swimming so I didn't take off for that. The staff were great, even with a rambunctious 3 year old and a temperamental 8 year old coming and going. The front desk staff always greeted us and were very helpful. I did use the laundry room and one of the dryers was out of commission, and the vending machine was out of soap, but the deck clerk gave me some free of charge. Overall a great introduction to a chain of Inns that I've since stayed at a few more times on the trip home. Definitely will stay again.

The location was excellent, positioned about 15 minutes stroll from the French Quarter, The River Walk, and Harrah's Casino . With a trolley bus stop right across the road. The Drury Inn has a 3 free drink card feature, Where free fast food and the drinks are served at around 5 - 7 p.m. And free soda machine all day. Yes you do have have to use room card to use elevators. Sounds like a pain but keeps out the ones that don't belong. Breakfast was adequate had waffles, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, Bran, yogurt & more. The parking is $25/day valet parking charge. While the car is parked off lot about 1 block away, if you want something out of car you will have to wait for them to walk to your car and drive it back to the hotel to get it out. Or have them get it and carry back. This is due to hotel expansion work on parking garage - but this will be temporary about a year or more I think there just starting. Everyone in New Orleans charges for parking due to space some charge more. We walked along the board walk for a while then headed up towards Bourbon St stopped at THE MARKET CAFE 3 draft beers and a 1 soda = $22.00. They do have glasses of White or Red wine from $28.00 to $41.00 a glass.Took tour form hotel to see the, Garden District - Cemeteries - 9 nth ward - St Charles Ave Homes $44.00 cost... I have never been here before and was not to impressed with the smells that comes from under the streets like sewer gas. Bring lots of money $6- $7 for a beer at places. And signs on doors if you enter you must buy a drink, or to use restroom. Harrah's lowest limit on black jack is $15.00 way to much for fun play for some.

Myself, husband and baby daughter. This hotel isn't posh. There are no frills. It's a decent place to keep your stuff while you explore the city - that's it. Well, that's what it was for us anyway. While we were there, there was a large group of kids staying there as well. There were at least 30 kids. It was some sort of sports team, aged from about 7 - 10. They were LOUD. They ran, they played ball in the entrance way and they ruined the pool for us. Now, understand. I am not anti kid. I have 4 of my own and I know how kids are. But some of these kids were just out of hand. I know it isn't the hotel's fault, but the atmosphere of the hotel seemed to be accepting of all the yelling and running. Also, **someone** pulled the fire alarm twice one night and the entire hotel had to be evacuated and the fire dept. had to clear the place while we all stood out in the parking lot. NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT! The room we stayed in was 522. It is a 2 room suite. It was spacious and the carpet was new looking, but the bathroom was not as clean as it should have been. There was mildew in the shower, stray hairs *yuck*, and the jacuzzi tub had seen better days. This is probably a good place to stay for someone who had hungry kids and needs to cut costs though. Because there is a free breakfast in the morning, and snacks and drinks at 5:30pm. The food is just food. It isn't good, but kids don't usually care. There is also free popcorn and sodas from 3pm-10pm. This hotel is pet friendly. I think that's gross, but some people seem to enjoy it. Another downer was that there seemed to only be about 3 luggage carriers in the entire hotel - which you have to load and move yourself. No help from anyone there. I can't say too many good things about my experience here. The valet guys were nice. But that's about it. I wouldn't stay here again unless I was bringing all of my kids and the dog and I didn't have the money to stay anywhere else. Oh, one more thing. It's almost impossible to catch a cab at that hotel.

Pros -Decent rooftop pool and hot tub, if not a bit small. -Right next to the Carondelet(St Charles) street car line so this was a bonus. -Not far, maybe 4 blocks to Bourbon St. or to Canal St. street car line to take you to the French Market, Jackson Square or RiverWalk. -Breakfast and the evening Kickback are nice touches that add value. -Room was acceptable except for the cons below. -I liked the lobby, thought it was classy. -Front desk was pleasant and helpful. -Bed was very comfy. -Wi-Fi was good. Cons -Mold in the bedroom closet ceiling. Don't they check for this kind of thing? -The lighting is not good, at least in my room it wasn't -View from the one small window was terrible. Just an observation. Room 518 so you know. -The room was odd shaped, so tons of wasted space. -Big Con! Beware! This hotel is being renovated! I don't have a problem with that so much as the parking set-up is atrocious because of it. The valets are in constant confusion and never know for sure if your car is coming until it shows up.

This is a great place and value for couples, families with kids, or pet owners!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Excellent Breakfast & KickBack meals, Professional Staff\u201d", "Author": "DaveRamseySays", "ReviewID": "UR126451385", "Content": "We had one unfortunate experience during our one night stay that is described below in the email that I sent to the general manager, Slade Stratman, on 3/21/12. I paid $225 plus taxes for our one night stay in a room with two double beds (way too small), but was changed to a room with a king and a fold out bed in the living room. I don't feel I was over charged for the room, but I would have liked to have paid a little less. The location of the hotel is excellent. \"I am writing to make you aware of an unfortunate issue with our one night stay in your hotel. This was also the first time that any of us had stayed in a Drury Inn. First let me begin by saying that your staff members were professional, experienced, courteous and pleasant. I hope that they are recognized for their service to their employer and guests, and that the hotel continues to employ similarly enthusiastic individuals. A young man who was the valet upon our arrival was polite and helpful when we arrived at the parking lot. I can't recall his name, but I understand that he and Kristen at the front desk are friends, and she will recall about whom I am speaking. Unfortunately upon our departure, a tall dark haired young man who was the valet at that time handed us our car key, accepted the gratuity and then departed into the hotel leaving the three of us ladies (two seniors and myself) to put all of our luggage into the trunk ourselves... Upon check in and check out, Kristen at the front desk was efficient and courteous despite the tremendous guest traffic and constantly ringing telephone. Immediately after arriving in our room we realized that it would not comfortably accommodate us, and I returned to the front desk whereupon I was attended by Leah who immediately acknowledged me and assisted with a satisfactory room change. Later that evening when I called for more pillows and blankets, Leah immediately brought them upstairs which was appreciated because it was already late in the evening and my mother in law was ready for bed. In the past at other hotels, I've waited as long as a few hours to receive additional linens although they were needed immediately. As an aside, the mattress on the foldout bed in room 818 really needs to be replaced. It was quite thin and uncomfortable and for this reason we requested more blankets and sheets to add as padding. It would have been great if an egg carton mattress pad had been available instead of attempting to use sheets and blankets to make the mattress more comfortable. The next day when we encountered the issue that I will discuss below, I was assisted by Jamie. When I explained the situation to her, she assured me that she would address the matter not only with housekeeping, but also escalate the matter to management. As we left the hotel for the day, I felt confident that she would do so. During our brief time in your hotel, we did encounter the housekeeper responsible for our room, Leovina, multiple times in the hallway as she cleaned other rooms. Each time she greeted us and smiled. Finally, we were surprised and pleased with the complimentary breakfast and kickback refreshments. The early breakfast allowed us to maximize our short time in our first visit to New Orleans. As to the issue at hand, the subject of this email provides the basic complaint. As I was getting into bed for the evening, I noticed a piece of trash on the floor immediately beneath the corner of the bed, but dismissed it as a receipt that I might have dropped earlier in the day. I decided I would pick it up in the morning when I canvassed the room before checkout. In the morning, my mother picked it up with her bare hands and realized that it was a used Trojan Condom wrapper. Of course, my mother was alarmed and disgusted, as was my mother in law and myself. I immediately called the front desk whereupon I spoke with Jamie. Upon checking out, Jamie informed me that she had indeed discussed the matter with management and that our stay would be complimentary. She also asked me to send you this email in order to facilitate the reversal of the charge on my credit card. I look forward to your reply.\"", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Creek, NY", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "Silvercreeker", "ReviewID": "UR126436085", "Content": "This is the most elegant Drury Inn we have stayed in, with beautiful decor in the common areas.

On average I paid 137 per night for our 2 room suite - pretty good for New Orleans. The room wasn't that great on presentation though - carpets not real clean and everything else just ok. Staff & service - not bad. The free breakfast is best described as \"you get what you pay for\" but get there early or you won't have a seat. There were many foreigners and elderly in groups for some reason during our stay which made some of the lines for drinks and breakfast extra long. The 5:30 kickback is good for the free alcoholic drinks which was by far the best perk Drury had to offer. The elevators were acting up the entire time we were there and eventually they shut one down while we were there. Location - again not bad but not great. It's quite a walk into french quarter. It's almost 1 mile to cafe du monde and jackson square...about a 1/4 mile to the edge of quarter on Canal st. The walk wasn't dangerous but we did walk by a couple street sleepers on the way back one night(this was at 8pm mind you) - again not terrible but could be better. You pay $25/night for parking and then they have valet that goes about 20 feet to get your car....seems like an unnecessary addition.

The front desk and breakfast/dinner buffet employees were all very friendly and helpful. They stored my bags upon checkout for a few hours so I could go do more sightseeing until time for my outbound train to leave. The very friendly lady at the front desk retrieved my bags and offered to get me a taxi when I came back. (This was appreciated, but I already had one waiting out front that I'd taken back from the Quarter and the French Market after losing all track of time *easy to do!* and realizing I wasn't going to have time to walk back to the hotel and then get to the station if I didn't cab it, LOL!) The free breakfast was really good and not skimpy; biscuits and gravy, sausage and eggs, donuts, etc. The free evening cocktail hour includes 3 drinks along with a very good and tasty selection of the kinds of snacks you'd have while watching a ballgame: nachos, hot wings, chicken tenders, etc, along with baked potatoes and salad, so you really could have just this for dinner if you wanted. This was all also really good. Obviously both were a good way to save time and money. The rooftop pool and hottub are heated and looked very clean and inviting, although I never did get around to using them. (Went up there one night to get a few pictures of the skyline - you take the elevator to 9, then take the one all the way down on the left on up to 10 to go outside.) I don't currently have a laptop, although they did offer free Wifi. They have two desktops and a printer in the lobby, and these were very handy for getting and printing google map directions for my little self-guided walking tour of the Quarter, as well as checking emails, etc. The streetcars are both historic and very handy. (If you pay cash each time you ride you have to have correct change.) The best deal is to buy an all day or multi-day \"Jazzy Pass\" which is good for unlimited rides on all three streetcar lines (Canal, Riverfront, and St. Charles) as well as the local buses. You can do this with correct change onboard, or from a machine at the stop at Canal and Carondelet. The St. Charles streetcar stops directly beside the hotel on Carondelet (you can wait at the bus shelter across Carondelet). This one runs \"inbound,\" and you can ride it about four blocks to Canal. At that point just get off and cross Canal, because this is where Carondelet turns into Bourbon St! I did just that and had no problems, and honestly I think walking the four or so blocks down Carondelet to get over to Bourbon would have been OK too even at night, although the streetcar is just neat, and handy if you want to save a little walking before you hit Bourbon. The streetcar coming back from Canal runs on its namesake St. Charles, and you just get off at Poydras and walk one block up that street back to the hotel. For a good way to spend part of an afternoon, also be sure to ride the streetcar out to the Garden District. Google Map the Garden District Bookstore, I forget which street you get off at but you can easily figure it out, I did. The bookstore is an awesome place to visit lots of signed books by famous local and regional authors. (I got a signed hardback of \"The Help\" - yay me, lol!) It is only about a block from the streetcar stop, and in the midst of many beautiful homes, and is also close to Lafayette Cemetery which is fascinating to walk through. I'm totally in love with New Orleans after one visit! Walking along the Riverwalk, through Jackson Square, and through the French Quarter early in the morning as the city is waking up is also something you don't want to miss. I also recommend the Steamboat Natchez, great food and a really good way to see the city from the perspective of the river, including the levee that broke after Katrina, the Lower Ninth Ward, and the site of the Battle of New Orleans. Again, the Drury was a great place to stay for the money. I will visit New Orleans again, and will definitely stay at the Drury when I do. One last thing: I arrived and departed by train, and I highly recommend riding Amtrak's modern version of the famous \"City of New Orleans\" if you want a very relaxed experience that allows you to meet fascinating fellow travelers and watch America roll by, including great views of Lake Pontchartrain and the swamps between NOLA and Hammond.

We didn't have to go out for dinner. There was also 3 free drinks each which we didn't use up but made for a relaxing way to end the day before going to the room. There was free popcorn and pop and best of all \" Guest can make up to one hour of domestic long distance calls per day with no access charges or per-minute fees.\" That meant no roaming fees to call home and what other hotel offers that ? Free WIFI made it easier to plan our day and a shuttle right outside the door if needed.

We had picked the Drury Inn due to other cc members recommending the place, plus they offered free hot food, drinks, soda, popcorn and hot breakfast. We figured you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat that deal! We managed to get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cruise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal they offered and the room was only $93.49 plus tax. Upon arriving at this place, I thought wow, this is really nice. Everything is done up in marble and chandeliers everywhere. Very nice! We made it to our room, wow again. Very nice. Once again, marble bathroom from floor to ceiling, elegantly decorated in the room (I thought at least for the price) and a really nice high dresser that had doors that opened up with drawers behind them, a microwave and a small refrigerator. The night stands were nice wood and also the tops were marble. Great place for the price. We went up to the roof to see the swimming pool and hot tub on the roof\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6um, not so great that day. Although the water was clear, the bottom was dirty (and not dirty like stuff in it, more like green film dirty and needed vacuumed). Needless to say, we did not swim or get in the hot tub after seeing this. Prior to checking out, I went up there to take some pictures and there were several people up there sun bathing, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they actually got into the water. (We also managed to catch the whale tail of a Carnival ship in port from up there as well). After checking in and getting situated in our room, we took off on foot to explore the city. Beautiful place with a lot going on. I guess they were having a sea food fest while we were there. There was a lot of live entertainment going on. We walked down to the Riverfront, encountered a real train (which scared the heebie jeebies outta my 3 year old) and multiple trolleys. We stopped to take pictures at Jackson Square (the castle, horse carriage rides, fountains) and strolled along the streets looking at all of the arts being sold by the vendors. There were tons of people posing (really still) for long periods of time, dressed up weird ways, and looking like a statue. Every once in a while one would move and scare someone passing by. Hilarious! Of course, they wanted tips. We made it to Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Monde and had their beignets. I was having trouble understanding our waitress (and obviously she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand me either because she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring us the right order). For $2.49 (I think it was) you get 3 small beignets LOADED with powdered sugar. Everyone raved how great these were, but to me, they are the same thing as what you get at any fair from the vendors (funnel cakes), however, I found the beignets to not be as good as a funnel cake. Ours were a little harder than what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m use to and the amount of powdered sugar they loaded on it made you a white sticky mess. The people there didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too friendly, but the place was so busy it was VERY hard to even find a seat. When going inside to use the restroom, it was in this small cubby hole in the back in the SMALL kitchen area and there was a line. The workers were rude and kept telling people to move, bumping into everyone and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to say excuse me or anything. At one point they took the door and slammed it shut leaving some inside waiting on the restroom and others standing along a wall waiting. If they thought this made more room, they completely misjudged that because now there were more people moving around due to having to move out of the way for the door to open every time. We caught the street car back to our street that the hotel was on and decided to catch the free hot food (Kickers Meal) the hotel was offering. We did not think it was bad at all, not gourmet food, but definitely something you can make a meal out of and be satisfied. If it was bad food, you sure wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to tell by how many people were there eating that night. It was crazy. They offered you 3 free alcoholic drinks, per person\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and they WERE STRONG! Whew! They had hot dogs, mac and cheese, nacho bar, baked potato (with fixings), veggies and dip, salads, snacks, popcorn, and a soda fountain for drinks. We went back up to the room, visited with our 9/11 roll call online for a while chatting, then went to bed. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep too well though. I thought it was the excitement of the cruise the next day, but felt like I was scratching all night. Well, when we woke in the morning, we found out why. Our room was infested with red biting ants!! There were hundreds of them forming a line across the threshold from the bathroom to the sink area. Upon a little more inspection, we found lines of them going up the night stands and onto the bed. WOW! I immediately went down to let the front desk know about the room. These people were more than kind about it and very apologetic as well. They offered let me do all of my laundry there (which we did not have time for that prior to leaving, so I just made sure I shook everything out hoping we would not take any hitch hikers with us), they offered to get us a cab to the airport and pay (which we met a very nice guy on our roll call the night before and he stopped and gave us a ride) and THEY FULLY REFUNDED MY ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE ROOM! Wow, now that was service! They told us to stay as long as we would like, however, we wanted out of that room because we were being bitten and ended up just coming down to the lobby to wait for our ride. I was not at all expecting any of this and just wanted to inform them of the situation, but they went above and beyond and we would definitely stay with them again. I forgot to mention the free hot breakfast (eggs, sausage, biscuits/gravy etc.). It was pretty good as well. Definitely editable and filled us up prior to getting on the ship. They also had the regular cold food too (bagels, toast, muffins, cereal and so on).", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "ShirleyTManchester", "ReviewID": "UR119468668", "Content": "Really can't find fault with this hotel, the location was perfect, breakfast plentiful and always hot, not keen on disposable plates etc but that was the only fault, the 5.30 kickback really went down well free wine, beer or cocktails.

We went back this year to attend the Satchmo Summerfest, a four day tribute to all things Louis Armstrong. We decided to stay at the Drury Inn again because it is well-located (close to the St. Charles street car line and the French Quarter) and such a good value. My only complaint about this stay was at check in. I had called the Drury to state that we would be arriving on a late flight. When we got to the hotel, there was a busload of people coming in as an \"overflow\" from another, overbooked hotel. The beleaguered woman behind the front desk did not bother to check and see that I am a Drury Gold Key member and had made a reservation weeks ago. She kept saying that we were \"overflow\" and I kept telling her no, we weren't. She gave us a room which we found to have most of the lights burnt out, which I could have put up with until the next day, but the room reeked of cigarette smoke. As I have asthma, and only book nonsmoking rooms, that was unacceptable. I called downstairs from the room and got a second clerk who again continued to insist we were \"overflow\" but agreed to switch us to a much better room. On the other hand, the next day we dealt with Renauldo, who was extremely helpful with a little emergency as well as directions, making reservations for us, etc. He also made a mean spicy Bloody Mary which I enjoyed at the 5:30 Kickback. The little extras are what make the Drury so special. A good breakfast is free (eggs, french toast, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, sausage, fruit, cereal, yogurt, etc.) I don't know what coffee they use but I really enjoy it. Each room has its own microwave and refrigerator, so I was able to bring my son's breakfast upstairs for him (like he'd get up at 10 to eat downstairs, ha) and heat it up. Free soda and popcorn for snack time. Free Kickback happy hour at night which included 3 free alcoholic beverages, food such as hot dogs, chili, salad, baked potatoes. . .We would go to Kickback and snack, then go out to a late dinner. The rooftop pool and jacuzzi were clean and open fairly late. No spa. The \"fitness center\" was small but since we walk all over, we didn't need a stationary bike to get exercise. I did notice that there were two families who brought their dogs along with them, so if you have allergies, you might make a note to request a room that remains pet-free.

We felt safe walking to and from the French Quarter at night too. The included breakfast was good but crowded so expect to wait for an available table. The afternoon snacks were okay. Nothing special and they tended to ran out of somethings the one night we tried the food. The popcorn and free soda were an added bonus when we returned late afternoon and needed a snack. The front desk staff were kind and helpful. Arranged a shared cab for us to the port. And somehow the cab we arranged for our early morning transfer back to the airport didn't arrive on time and the desk person went out and flagged one down for us.

This hotel is decent for the price, except that during \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special events\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they charge $28 dollars per night for parking, which is a bit much in my opinion. The 5:30pm \"kickback\" had terrible food - one night I couldn't tell if they were serving chicken fingers or fish sticks. The breakfast in the morning was OK. And it was nice having access to free sodas/water all the time. Pool was nice, although small. Rooftop had a nice view of the business district though. Nice location. Trolley stops right out front, and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go (including Bourbon street, French Quarter, the river, etc) - never moved the car. Next time I think I want to stay in the French Quarter though - much more going on, much busier, shopping, etc. I left this hotel very unsatisfied because of the Drury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor customer service and inefficiency. The front desk clerks at this hotel are unhelpful, impolite, disorganized, and rude. Upon check in, my friends and I paid our bill (in full) on three separate cards. However, by the time all was said and done, my credit card was double charged, and my two friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit cards were double charged as well. We tried to fix this issue when we received our bill, and noticed the bogus charges. This was around 3 a.m. when we were about to get in bed. There was only one woman working the desk, who flat out denied that there was a mistake at all. Are you serious? We asked to speak with a manager, but the woman claimed there was no manager available (anyone familiar with hotels knows that there is always a manager available). I believe the manager was in the back room, but refused to come out. Instead, the woman put the assistant manager on the phone, Jacque Boutte, who was condescending and rude to my friend and I via telephone; Jacque refused to admit there was a mistake as well. We gave up until the next morning when we could talk to Jacque in person. During check out the next morning, we asked to speak with Jacque about the bogus charges on our bill. Again, he was condescending, rude, sarcastic, and indifferent to the situation. He did not apologize or explain what happened and why we were triple charged for our stay. Eventually, he agreed to credit/refund my credit card. However, upon returning home, I checked my bank account to see that there was NO refund on my card, and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6get this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there was YET ANOTHER charge to my credit card for the full amount of the hotel stay! Ridiculous right? Even more ridiculous\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I called the hotel and they denied charging me again. I actually had to fax them my credit card statement to \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdprove\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lying! After I faxed my card statement, there was (again) no apology for the Drury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes. Jacque (assistant manager) kept claiming that he talked with my bank, and had authorized a refund to my card for the Drury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes. However, I have yet to receive a refund.

The free hot breakfast had many options -- french toast, scrambled eggs, waffles, biscuits, gravy, sausage, hot and cold cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, toast, bagels, muffins, donuts. Coffee, tea and several juices and milk. Everything was fresh and in ample supply. The 5:30 Kickback dinner was nice, especially for the kids who may not want to eat Cajun food. Food was plentiful. Hot dogs, nachos, refried beans, taco beef, chicken nuggets, baked potatoes, salad bar. 3 free adult beverages a day for each adult. Full bar -- mixed drinks, beer, wine. Fresh popped popcorn was available every afternoon and the coffee urns and soda fountains were always open. All of the employees were friendly and helpful. A little thing that Drury did right that most hotels get wrong is they actually gave us one towel for each person.

No way it can be beaten. My wife and I were here for New Years 2010. I had wanted to stay in the Quarter, but the prices were sky high and we are by no means rich. I picked the Drury for our 3 nights stay. The prices averaged out to $175 a night if I remember correctly, a huge discount from the $250 or so average of everywhere else. To start to hotel is beautiful. The lobby exudes southern charm as does the wonderfully front desk staff (one of the employees spent 15 minutes calling various restaurants to find us some crawfish - it wasn't in season yet and was hard to come by). The happy hour food/drink and the breakfast were great. The food was plentiful and pretty good. Don't tell anyone but we actually brought some up to our rooms for late night snack (we had a fridge). The room was great. We had a larger room with huge floor to ceiling windows and the ceiling was very high. We actually had a great view of some nasty thunderstorms that rolled through one morning. Great stuff. The walk to the quarter was a snap - 3 blocks or so. Easy trolley access also. The only negative I can think of is that they were having some fire alarm problems while we were there (went off three times, once in the middle of the night which was annoying, but I'm sure that's been fixed by now). All in all, if you don't want to get ripped off in the quarter, don't want to be surrounded by the lovely, filthy debauchery of bourbon street, want good free food, a friendly staff, access to transportation to other parts of the city, and on and on and on, stay in the Drury.

Our frig kept things cold but we really shouldn't have bought any drinks or snacks because the hotel offers them for FREE! Every night from 5:30-7pm they offer a great variety of of hot snax and three free alcoholic beverages (including things like Margaritas and blood Marys as well as white, red and zinfandel wines and Bud light beer).

It's like New Years Eve in Times Square every night. It was so nice to come back to the Drury and get out of the chaos of Bourbon street. Let me mention a few things I didn't see in the other reviews that you may find helpful. First, the hotel is very close to the AT&T building next door.( The Drury WAS the old telephone building until they expanded and moved next door-This accounts for the 15 foot ceiling in the Hotel. The phone company needed them to house their large equipment) The rooms that face the new AT&T building have no view at all. The hotel web offers a choice of \"street view\" for a little extra money. I advise unless money is very tight to get the street view or you will be dissapointed. Also, you are blocks away from many of the best restaurants in the country, Commanders Palace, Emerils, Arnauds, Restaurant August etc. Don't tank on the bar snaks at the Hotel.

The hotel was conveniently located to the French Quarter, only a short 4-block walk. You can also walk to Jackson Square and the Cafe Du Monde from the hotel - that is about a 7-block walk. The location of the hotel was perfect. The hotel itself was nice and clean. We opted for a 2-room suite. We were assigned Room 622. We read bad reviews about Room 222 being noisy due to its proximity to the laundry. We did not experience any issues with our room. I will say that the walls seem rather thin and you are able to hear conversations and noise coming from the adjacent rooms. However, this was not a problem for me - and I am a light sleeper. The other negative comment I have about the hotel is the poor quality of the sleeper sofa. The hotel really needs to upgrade the mattresses on the sleeper sofas. Expect to get a backache if you sleep in a sleeper sofa. They have a very nice complementary breakfast complete with scrambled eggs, sausages, french toast, waffles, fruits, toast, muffins, cereals, coffee and juice. You need not venture out of the hotel to have a very nice breakfast - except for the obligatory venture to Cafe Du Monde! They also have a very nice brunch at 5:30 p.m. The offerings vary, but the days we stayed there they offered hot dogs, chicken fingers, chicken wings, meatballs, chips, nachos, and soft drinks. The hotel is truly pet friendly, and they do not charge anything extra for the pets!! That is truly rare to see. Lastly, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.

Steer clear of Room 222\u201d", "Author": "Vauban", "ReviewID": "UR88584028", "Content": "I was very excited by this hotel. The website looked great and the reviews on Tripadvisor were all excellent. But after a four night stay over the Thanksgiving weekend I am genuinely sorry to say that I was disappointed by my stay, and wouldn't stay there again. But first the positives: - A room that could accommodate five people. Not to be sneezed at, and always tricky for a family of two adults with three children. The room was a good size, and had two queen beds and a sofa bed. - The hotel looked modern, with tasteful furnishings and was (generally) very clean. - A good price, at least for some of the nights. On the Thursday and Sunday nights, the rooms were priced at $120. A good bargain. On the Friday and Saturday nights, it was an extra 100 bucks - which made the stay much pricier. - Location wasn't bad at all. A ten minute fast walk to the French Quarter or down to the riverfront. And right by the St. Charles streetcar. - Good freebies. The 5.30 Kickback was good - some nice food and drinks (but spirits were dispensed out of a soda fountain device, which was a bit weird; and the drinks were very small.) And breakfast was pretty good - the same every day, but a reasonable selection. So why was I unhappy? - The room (room 222) was dark and uninviting. There were no windows in the bedroom at all - and the lightswitch on the other side of the room. Not helpful. - The room was airless. Neither of the two windows in the living room area could be opened - not even a fraction. So the air was stale. And the view? The room vverlooked the trash bins, and nothing else! - The noise was terrible. The room was next to the hotel laundrette, which was self-operated and open 24/7. And when someone was using the machine, you sure knew about it. Being awoken at 1am by the sound of someone doing their laundry was not great: why couldn't they restrict the operating hours? - But worst of all was the bed. I'm usually not so fussed. But this bed mattress was so soft, it was uncomfortable to sleep in. Both my wife and I left with painful backs, the beds were so unsupportive. In a modern hotel, why were they so bad? - And there were just a number of small niggly things through our stay that made me wonder how well serviced the hotel really was: At bathtime we were realised the room was short of a few towels, so rang down to housekeeping. We were told we had to come down to reception and collect the towels ourselves: never had that happen before. At the drinks reception in the evening, all the beer was off: no explanation as to why. When the ice machine on our floor didn't work, I went up a floor to discover that theirs didn't work either. None of these a major issue of course, but they all contributed to a sense that this was a hotel not really on top of its game. - And the charge for parking was very expensive. We got stung for a premium rate on the Sunday night because of some jazz festival in town. Well I can tell you that Sunday night was quiet in New Orleans, and the car park was empty. So I'm not sure what justified the $28 charge for one night's parking! So all in all a disappointing experience. Some positives for sure, but for us it was the dark and smelly room; loud noises from the adjacent laundrette; and a really uncomfortable bed that defined the experience.

If the lines are long (and I suspect they ususally are) and you'd like all 3, you can request them at once.

Never heard of Drury Inn but after reading all the positive reviews, decided to give them a try. The hotel web site didn't have a king room available but I was able to book one from travelocity.

You won't get much of a view from any of the rooms since there's only 9 floors, but you can get a decent view from the roof pool level (pool and hot tub were very well kept by the way). Parking was $19 a night (pretty cheap compared to other hotels). No valet service but the secure, private parking lot is adjacent to the hotel. Leave your car there and use public transportation if at all possible. Parking is very expensive everywhere you go but street cars, buses, taxis are just a few steps from the hotel and cheap. We were a little worried about the neighborhood after driving through a shady area off of I-10, but the area is safe and we were comfortable walking home from Bourbon St well after 12 PM. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They were able to answer all our questions and had great advice on restaraunts and other places. The free breakfast was fresh and the 5:30 kickback drinks and food is awesome. You won't get top shelf booze or steak but the price is right and it's a great way to start off a night in the French Quarter (about 4 blocks away, easy walk).

The microwave and fridge came in handy and my husband loved the flat screen. The bathroom was roomy and the sink was outside, which was good. My husband thought the towels were thin and small and we were surprised when they did not have lotion as a toiletry. No conditioner either, just shampoo with conditioner. Staff was friendly and helpful. They have a computer area that you may use to quickly check your email and print boarding passes. The pool is on the rooftop, but in the blazing NOLA sun, there are no chairs with umbrellas. The breakfast came in handy, but it is the exact same thing everyday. I just wish they had bacon at least 2 out of 6 days. The 5:30 kickback was nice. You are guaranteed hot dogs every night and another meat like meatballs or chicken strips on random days.

Free soda and popcorn from 3-10 was great for a quick snack. Out Drury's door and to the right is Cardolet street. The St. Charles street car stops here and goes straight to Bourbon or walk down Cardolet and it turns into Bourbon when you cross over Canal. About a 10 minute walk. Dixie Gyros(Cardolet) had good, cheap, homecooked food and Mothers (Poydras) is the best if you can stand the line.

The stay left me non-plussed... a grand \"so-what\" in the expanding universe of hoteldom. The hotel is located on Poydras, a fairly busy traffic street in the downtown area. It is about a 10 minute walk to Canal St. The Drury is in an older building a little off the tourist beaten track. On arrival I was slightly delayed as the front desk was vacant. The lobby was littered with the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning for early check-in, the wretched refuse of airport lore. Most were families... noisy rug rats scattered across the lobby, slobbering over the popcorn machine, swilling down Coke and Dr Pepper to fuel the irrepressible din. Luckily, I took the room less occupied by, and that made all the difference. Clean and quiet up on the 6th floor. A moderately sized, bright and airy room with 14 foot ceilings a comfortable bed and a 32\" flat-screen upon which to watch the Masters (golf as opposed to literary this time) provided a nice place to hide out from work. The shower was forceful enough and hot water seemed not to be a problem even at peak use time. Temperature control in the room was excellent. Better than most hotels and that led to a good night's sleep. While there is a paucity of commercial and eating establishments in the immediate area, there is a decent convenience store about a block away for snacks and fluid. On departure, again nobody was at the front desk, so as there was no problem with the under-door bill in the room, I just left.

I highly recommend this hotel for a trip to NOLA! We got a good rate, and when you add the \"value\" of the evening drinks and snacks as well as the breakfast, it's a steal. Each guest receives a card for up to three alcoholic drinks in the evening (5:30 - 7 when we were there, not sure if that is always the time frame), which includes beer, wine, and mixed drinks. The food offered was great - salad, veggies, dip, nachos, baked potatoes, chicken wings, egg rolls, chips, pretzels, and cheese sauce for the nachos and potatoes. It was enough for a light supper. Breakfast was the usual offerings, including waffles, eggs, sausage, etc. And there was popcorn and soda available until I think 10:00 at night. The service at the front desk was very welcoming and helpful, and the lobby is pretty. The room was well-appointed, and the wireless internet worked great. I am assuming the building was something else before the Drury, because the ceilings in the rooms are incredibly high, not something that would be built these days!

Unfortunately, the hot tub was not operating when we were there.

Besides the complimentary breakfast and hot and cold snacks and drinks in the evening (5:30 to 7 pm), they also have complimentary coffee and tea all day and complimentary soda and popcorn in the evening until 10 pm. The food is basic with nutritious options. We were very pleasantly surprised by the location. It is a few short blocks to the French quarter and the immediate surroundings are quite lovely and well-lighted. Almost directly across the street is the Le Pavilion Hotel, a white limestone gem of a building, and nearby, too, are the W Hotel and the International House. The Drury is located on the corner of Poydras and Carrollton streets. As we arrrived, we looked up and saw the green trolley car of the St. Charles line (which travels on Carrollton St. on part of its return). That afternoon, we boarded it on St. Charles St., one block away, and rode uptown beyond the Audubon Park. The trolley continues another 20 minutes or so. We got off just beyond the Audubon Park and re-boarded another trolley headed back to the hotel. Another time, we would plan to get off at one of beautiful neighborhoods and explore the area on foot. The homes are magnificent. We passed by some stunning blocks of mansions, handsome college campuses (Loyola and Tulane) and also some residential and commercial areas that were much less attractive. Be advised that the trolley runs into the early morning hours and the noise can carry upstairs to some of the hotel rooms. We discovered that our first night because we had a corner room with great views from where we could see the trolley. They have many rooms facing an interior space which must be very quiet. However, we chose the same corner room on a lower floor for our last night because we loved the views and the noise was infrequent, especially late at night. The rooftop pool, while small, is a great pleasure. It is heated so you can use it year round. At night, you can see several illuminated domes and handsome buildings. There is also a hot tub next to the pool. Probably the best surprise was the closeness of many fine restaurants, including Luke, Herbsaint, Trattoria Leonardo, and Mother's. Luke and Mother's serve three meals a day. Our first night, we had a pizza at nearby Reginelli's, which was excellent. (Reginelli's is located in at least 2 or 3 other places in New Orleans.) We looked in at Stanley! which faces Jackson Square (it's at the right when facing St. Louis Cathedral). It looks like a great place to stop for a snack any time of day or a light meal.

There was always a large group of us and other groups in the lobby, and we were allowed to gather there which was great. The evening reception did not have the hot food that was shown on the website, but the snacks were adequate, and nice to have cocktails at the hotel before going out for the evening. Someone else mentioned that there was a long line and only 1 person working on NYE, but the other 2 nights we were there , there was 2, so I think it was more a matter of someone not showing up for work, plus the hotel was sold out, due to the Sugar Bowl. Never had to wait long on an elevator, and the halls were surprisingly quiet for a sold out hotel at New Years. Parking was $15/night with in and out privileges which is probably lower than most hotels in the area. There is a trolley stop, which we did not use, outside of the hotel. The hotel is just about 5 easy walking blocks to the mouth of bourbon street, an easy walk to Riverwalk area and the Harrah's casino, although that walk is not very populated with people and would not recommend it at night. Superdome is on the same street about 4 block easy walk. Only advice is to please be aware of you surroundings, and walk in groups, as a couple in our group were mugged while by themselves at night. One unknowingly got his ATM card taken, and another, someone reached into his pocket for money. I would recommend the hotel, and stay there again if there for the same purpose.

I feel like New Orleans has an unjustified bad rep - we met some of the nicest people we have ever met in our lives in New Orleans!). The staff were all very friendly, and once again Jamie at the front desk was wonderful and even gave us some tips on places to go and advice about taking public transit.

'08, it was #1 on Tripadvisor. We stayed there one (1) night and liked it so much, we stayed a 2nd night on our return trip home. I am going to combine 2 visits into 1 review. RESERVATIONS: Made my first reservation by phone and the young lady who helped us was very sweet, advising me to check the internet 1 month prior to our visit to see if there were any specials being offered. Being that I did not solicit a discount, I was quite surprised that she made this suggestion. I did check back prior to our departure and found the room to be $10 less. We didn't know if we would be spending the night in New Orleans on our return trip. However, we loved the Drury Inn so much, we decided to stay there before catching our flight home. I made the 2nd reservation over the internet. Drury Inn has an esaver rate that is non-refundable, but runs $10 less than a refundable reservation. CHECK-IN: The first time we checked in, we were greeted by a very nice young man who was extremely friendly and helpful. He couldn't do enough for us. He explained how breakfast worked, snack time, etc. While some could find his helpfulness a bit overwhelming, we found him quite charming. Check-in was a breeze. The 2nd time we checked in, the young lady who helped us was curtious, but not much more. We had the impression that she didn't really want to be at work. (But, she was never rude.) The process wasn't nearly as pleasant an experience as the first check-in. However, unlike our first visit, we had a rental car with us and without us asking, the clerk waived the parking fee. (I believe it's $10 a day.) ROOMS: Our first room was FABULOUS. Spacious, clean, comfortable, quiet. Very comfortable beds. The bathroom was fairly large. There was the standard amenities, soaps, shampoos, t.v., refrigerator, blow dryer, etc. Unfortunately, the free internet wasn't working and we gave up on it. (Had some business we needed to take care of, but used our smart phone instead.) Our 2nd visit was very different. Our room was located on floor 8, which is the highest floor where rooms are located. The room was smaller and the beds were not nearly as comfortable. The mattresses seemed older. The beds were double beds, though I and my family were sure we had 2 queen beds previously. Also, there was a banging noise that started at midnight and continued until 7:00 a.m. in the morning. We did not get a restful night's sleep. We are fairly certain the noise was caused by the pipes in the wall. Also, the refrigerator made a leaking noise all night long. Since we arrived quite late in the evening, by the time we realized the problems, we were just too tired to asked to be moved. FOOD: Drury offers snacks in the evening that are quite good. Nachos, pop corn, soda and even alcoholic beverages. All of it being included in the price of the room. Though we don't drink alcohol, we saw that each person received a card that the attendant marked when the guest ordered alcohol. I believe each guest was entitled to 2 alcoholic beverages. All else was unlimited. Breakfast is also included with the room. I am rarely impressed with the \"free\" breakfast items hotels provide, but honestly, why should a hotel offer anything at all? Drury's breakfast was a cut above the chain hotels like Holiday Inn Express, etc. There were make-your-own waffles, eggs, bisquits, gravy, sausage on one visit, bacon on the other. Cereal, yogurt, apples, bananas, oj, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and a few other items. Very satisfactory. OVERALL: We did not use the pool or gym. We did use the washer and dryer. For the size of the hotel, I was surprised that there was only 1 washer and 1 dryer. And they are located adjacent to rooms, which could be quite noisy. Our 2 visits were quite different from one another. We will be passing through New Orleans again and I'm not certain if we will stay at the Drury. It's in a \"nicer\" part of New Orleans (is there such thing as a \"nice\" part of N.O.?) but I think (not sure) we might try to find a more consistent hotel.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jackson, ms", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC\u201d", "Author": "freddy0527", "ReviewID": "UR31422504", "Content": "Wonderful hotel and staff, amenities were great, all the little \"extras\" were fantastic, hot breakfast was restaurant quality.

The hotel was within walking distance of both the Convention Center AND the French Quarter, though it was easy enough to hop on the Carondelet street car to Canal Street or the St. Charles street car to head toward the garden district for only $1.25 each way! All the extras you get at the Drury aren't listed, so I'll list the ones I can remember here: free wi-fi, free local calls, an hour of free long distance per day, free cocktails & snacks from 5 until 7 each night (not top shelf liquors, but if you stick to beer it's a fine offering), and free hot breakfast every morning (eggs, biscuits, sausage, french toast, fruit, cereals, pastries, bagels, etc. - not too shabby). I would definitely stay here again - the other added bonus is that it's far enough away from the French Quarter that you can actually sleep at night but not so far that it's a pain to get there when you want to have some fun!

Front desk guy has a plunger and a plastic bag, comes in an plunges the toilet. Clears the paper. Says he's not supposed to plunge toilets. Leaves us with wet towels (and used toilet water) behind the toilet. Fortunately, the room is not level, so all the water stays mostly behind the toilet. Housekeeping gone, so fortunately, we still had two clean towels for a.m. and the detritus is not near our feet. Next day, some towels replaced, and housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom and skimpy on towels. Second day, housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom. Third day I notice that a little piece of plastic wrapping that I had binding some brochures in my suitcase was still laying on the floor in the bedroom. Shower has not great water pressure but is nice and roomy too. Hair dryer was awful. One day we were still in the room when housekeeping came, and when we came back in the early evening our room was not done. A call to front desk and our room was cleaned (with the leftover spray bottle in the bathroom) by time we got back from dinner. So, it's clean but some staff are a little forgetful. I was not bothered by the issues, it's a quirky little hotel. With a quirky staff...very laid back and quite fun! What did bother me, though, was one day I went down for breakfast. A youth bus group had been there the night before and they devestated the free breakfast bar. By 7:30 a.m. (the breakfast is open until 9 or so), most of the hot food was gone, and the server said they were done for the day. Huh? Otherwise, the breakfast bar was nice, all the usual stuff.

This is one of the few hotels that I can not find a single negative thing to say. The location is convenient to the French Quarter but just far enough away to be peaceful and offer on-site parking for a modest fee. I was immediately impressed with the beauty of the lobby and friendliness of the front desk employees. This friendliness was indicative of every employee we encountered. How wonderful to be greeted by smiling faces each morning at breakfast. Also, the security measures are terrific. If entering through a door other than the main entrance a guest room card must be used. Also, a card is required to utilize the elevators that access the guest rooms. The same is true of the parking area. The guest room was of ample size and was spotless with a fresh non-perfume type fragrance. The king-size bed was amazingly comfortable along with the abundance of soft pillows! Each room has a microwave and refrigerator, which we didn't utilize because of the wonderful reception each evening in the lobby that offers 3 alcoholic beverages per guest and an assortment of munchies. Also, free coffee, soft drinks and popcorn are available throughout the day and evening. As if this isn't enough, the free hot breakfast buffet each morning offers a wide variety of foods including yogurt, fresh fruit, rolls, cereal, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, toast, bagels, and orange and apple juice. After checking out and returning to Ohio, I discovered I was missing my new prescription eyeglasses. This dampened the trip somewhat, until I logged online tonight to find a customer survey from Drury Inns. I completed it and mentioned, in the comment section, if someone found my glasses and returned them I would consider my visit over the top. In less than an hour I received an email from the manager saying the glasses were located and would be shipped to me the following day. Wow! I was stunned and delighted. This is the tops in Customer Service and you can bet I will seek out Drury Inns anywhere else I may travel. I definitely have been spoiled!

The room was large with high ceilings and very clean, which is always most important to me. The room included two double beds, a desk with desk chair, a recliner, a tv, table, microwave, and fridge! The bathroom was quite large as well. The best thing - free internet in the rooms! I wish more hotels offered this. There's also a computer in the lobby with a printer, which is really handy for printing boarding passes, etc. All the extras at the Drury Inn are really what makes this hotel. I already mentioned the free internet. The free breakfast was also really good - waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, muffins, biscuits and gravy, french toast, cereal, and more! And the food was really good. The nightly reception with free drinks (alcoholic -3 per person each night- and non - unlimited) and snacks (chips, salsa, and cheese dip) was also really nice. It's amazing that the Drury offers so many free extras, when the room rates are already so low! There was only one small piece of my stay that was less than perfect. When I got to my room, the toilet was stopped up. I stopped at the front desk on my way out and asked them to have someone fix it (there wasn't a plunger in the room or I'd have done it myself). The woman said she'd take care of it. When I returned a few hours later, it still wasn't fixed. So I called the front desk again. About an hour and a half later, a maintenance guy finally showed up to fix it. The man was very kind and apologetic. But I shouldn't have had to wait 7 hours to use the toilet in my room. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The lobby and room were very nice, but it's the location and all the extras that will bring me back to the Drury Inn.

The evening cocktail hour (and a half) was very pleasant with free drinks, chips, cheese & salsa and fresh popcorn. What floored me most was the obvious exceptional management: as I was waiting to check in for all of thirty seconds, a young man rushed across the lobby to ask if he could help in any way. When I mentioned that I was just checking in, he stated that he was a maintainance person but would immediately find the receptionist. That's a dedicated employee with a great work ethic, and also a statement about management. The Drury was exceptional across the board.

This hotel just made us feel so comfortable that we never really mind leaving important belongings inside the hotel while we walked around everywhere. The parking lot is so well-lighted so that we did not worry about our vehicle during the night. Considering the location of Drury Inn in Poydras Street, one will expect to pay such a substantial amount for that stay but the rate that we paid -$89.99 plus tax and $13.00 parking fee is really a bargain. The pool on the rooftop is so perfect. Anybody who comes to visit the pool on the rooftop will surely want to take a dip into the pool. In addition to that, breakfast is really so good especially the Belgian Waffle which is freshly cooked (because you are actually the one doing the cooking on the waffle maker). My daughter really enjoyed doing that. It was actually another friend who endorsed Drury Inn to us and now its my turn to endorse Drury Inn to whoever wants to visit New Orleans and I would say that it is really A Must Place to Stay.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonita Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat find in New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "Travel Agent Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR3649043", "Content": "I am a travel agent and thus stay in many hotels each year. This one is a winner in its category and price range. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had a corner room that had a living room, dressing area, bath and bedroom, with plenty of windows all around. The perks that Drury offers add to the value. The free breakfast is bountiful and far superior to most offered free at hotels. The free afternoon snacks and drinks are a fun way to wind down before going out on the town at night. The adjacent parking is also free, and that is a serious cost savings in a large city. We didn't find the walk to the French Quarter to be too long, and it is very direct - right down the hotel's street is Bourbon Street. Besides, the hotel is nicely located for both the French Quarter and the action along the Riverwalk. If I were writing directly to the management, I would make a couple of suggestions for improvement. The available guest laundry is a great idea but offers just one machine for the whole hotel. We had to keep running back and forth from our room to try and find the machine available for use. And, it was hard for us to find someplace to sit to eat breakfast because groups of people just sat around at the tables (there aren't that many of them) chatting and reading after finishing. This is more rude on the guest's part than it is the fault of Drury. However, there must be some way to politely suggest that people vacate the tables when finished. All-in-all, a successful hotel with useful and friendly perks. If you remember the low price for your room, the value becomes even more apparent.", "Date": "July 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3599089", "Content": "We stayed at the Drury Inn for 4 nights.

In addition to the low cost, there is free breakfast and snacks and drinks in the afternoon, and there is a free parking lot adjacent to the hotel.

We live in New York and are accostomed to walking everywhere, so we thought we would not mind. Late at night, however, the business district is deserted, so we opted to take cabs. The cost of the cabs was not an issue, given the money we saved by staying here, but we wished we had stayed in a hotel closer to the Quarter so we could stop by quickly in the afternoon or change between touring the historical sites during the day and going out at night. We never wanted to walk all the way to the business district and back. Also, we never got up in time for the breakfast and were not around to enjoy the free afternoon cocktails.

Anywhere else in New Orleans is at least $25-$30 (plus you have to tip the valet) and you do not have access to your car once you turn it over to the Hotels.

Only thing I didn't like was room faced the building next door and was a little dark. If you want a view and more light spring for the city view rooms. Very nicely furnished lobby. Staff was friendly and helpful with tourist questions. Hotel is right on the trolley line to the Garden District. Get on right on Poydras toward Canal and stay on it when it swings aroung and goes up St. Charles Ave. Better way to get a seat when it's crowded. THis location was walkable to everywhere including the Riverfront. Ate at Commander's Palace for lunch, they have regular sized 25 cent Martinis at lunch. Also ate a NOLA's, very, very good but like most of New Orleans' better restaurants, it was pricey but worth it for the food and the excellent service.
