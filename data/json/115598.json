It is actually the 4th hotel I have tried in Mission Valley (obviously the others did not leave enough of an impression to return) and next time I am in San Diego and need to stay in MV this will be my choice. The location of the Doubletree in MV is great because it is easy to get to the shopping areas or nearby places you would tend to go - liked that the trolley is just steps from the hotel and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance if necessary. Mission Valley is centrally located if you want to do all that SD has to offer - it is just lacking in character which is why I like downtown. But we rarely spend time in our room and it is literally 5 minutes to Hillcrest, 10 minutes to the zoo and downtown, 10 minutes to the beaches and easy to navigate and never traffic....so you can't go wrong in that regard. I believe it was recently renovated and so everything is new and clean. I liked the style and decor of the room and it was actually spacious - more so than similar hotels in the area. The bed was super comfortable and the staff was professional, helpful and friendly. I definitely cringe at the parking fee and internet charge - but that is the standard in SD - so I have gotten used to it. The parking garage is attached and space was never an issue. I actually received an email with the option to upgrade to a business plan which gave me parking and internet for 70% less than if I paid the standard hotel rate - so that ended up being a bonus. The only odd thing that happened was the room did not come with a refrigerator so we had some food from a restaurant in a to go box from breakfast to have for snack later.....when we returned it was gone (assuming maid service tossed or ate it) but the empty wine bottles and paper grocery bags were still there. Is there a special way to communicate what is to not be thrown away? Usually if I do not want something I put it in the trash or next to it. These boxes were on the desk with other personal belongings. Not a big deal....just kind of weird. The only negative is that the bathroom walls did seem thin - could hear the people in the next room - but not their voices. Mostly just the plumbing noises....but they were suprisingly loud at times. The sliding bathroom door is a nice feature decoratively speaking - but not really functional as far as privacy - but those were both things that as a guest did not bother me, but could others.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cYUMMY Cookies\u201d", "Author": "FemmeFrancaise", "ReviewID": "UR126423311", "Content": "I thought it had excellent customer service, front desk, housekeeping were excellent.

Although the hotel is not located in the downtown area (it is located at the end of a dead-end street, with a shopping area just nearby), it is perfectly located to reach all interesting destinations. The reason for this is the Trolley station that is just across the street! The San Diego Trolley (green line here) can bring you to downtown in a short time, and also leads to numerous other places (even to the border with Mexico) and attractions. The Trolley is very convenient, runs every 15 minutes, and day pass is only 5 dollars (you can buy them from machines in every station). To summarize: a good hotel, and because of the trolley nearby also in a perfect location. Interesting tip: the hotel has a shuttle service to the airport, which runs every hour (on the hour).

The DoubleTree is only 15 minutes from the airport rental car site, so it's an easy option for those needing to work in downtown as well. Our room was large enough for two, it had adequate closet space and dresser/storage space for two, and the king sized bed was comfortable. The only small qualm is that there isn't much counter space around the bathroom sink to accommodate two people. Instead, I used one of the two shelves that held the clean towels and shampoo/conditioner (consolidated them into one shelf) and my wife took the entire space around the sink for her stuff, so it worked out OK. Rooms have a medium sized flat screen LG HD TV, a couple of HBO channels and the usual variety of HD local/national stations as well. The hotel area was always clean, the indoor and outdoor pools were spotless and the exercise facility seemed adequate. There is ample parking, but it's not free--the good news is that your room key gets you into/out of the garage so it's easy to come and go at will. We found the staff in the lobby/desk were all very helpful and pleasant to deal with in terms of directions and suggestions. The three elevators worked fairly quickly so there wasn't a lot of waiting around. Our room was booked to include the buffet breakfast, which was OK. There were scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon/sausage, various pastries, yogurt, breads, cereals, etc., but nothing really outstanding or bad. They would also prepare eggs to order or prepare an omelet as part of the buffet offering.

I booked through a convention's site and my room was paid for in advance. There were some issues upon check-in about what was included with my reservation and it was handled poorly. I was assured that everything was in order, but later the night I checked in a very curt voice mail was left by the check-in staffer, who was also a member of the hotel management, saying the issue was my problem and that I should take it up with the convention folks. I had a print-out of my confirmed reservation that showed the add-on in question, but I did not get what I paid for; it would have been so easy for the DT to fix the problem. At check-out a different hotel manager admitted the hotel's mistake, although no one bothered to correct it during the six days I was there. They did take off parking fees to make up for the misunderstanding -- that was a good thing. Other problems with the property: ridiculously slow Internet service (and there's a $12 per day charge for it), but I was told at check-out that they are hoping to have this upgraded by the end of August 2011. I had to change rooms the first night as the room I was initially given abutted the elevator shaft and every time someone pushed the call button I could hear the elevator going up and down. The second room was very quiet (#1012). I found hairs on most of the towels I pulled off the shelf -- not mine (wrong color). Here's the good: turn-down service with the always popular DT cookies is terrific. The trolley stops right across the street and there are plenty of restaurants and other businesses close by -- great location if you don't need to be downtown or by the beach. (A cab ride downtown without traffic will run you $20 with tip.) I had room service twice and both times the food was excellent.

Starting with the maid service and ending with the hotel's unpreparedness for power outages, this hotel was a big disappointment with guest services and comfort. Maid service is very slow, shoddy and confrontational. Yes, a maid had the audacity to make me--the paying guest--wrong for expecting my room to be cleaned and made up by 4p, despite having left my room at 9a; I was gone for almost 7 hours, but when I returned at 3:30p, my room hadn't been touched. This happened on 2 consecutive days. The second time, I contacted a maid who was servicing a room down the hall from mine and inquired if she knew why my room wasn't done. She was custom-service oriented and immediately got on her radio to ask the maid in charge of my room to clean it. This helpful maid then proceeded to admit to me that my maid forgot to clean my room, however, when my maid showed up less than 2 minutes later, she proceeded to justify her actions as to why she'd skipped over my room (apologizing in-between excuses), making me the bad guy for not calling hospitality to request immediate maid service upon leaving my room at 9a. I explained to her that I thought being gone over 6 hours was plenty of time to assure a tidy room upon my return but this maid kept putting it back on me. This is not proper hospitality! Especially for a guest who is paying $138 a night. Secondly, she and whoever cleaned my room when I checked in the first day either needs a good pair of glasses or they just have not developed attention to detail: upon entering my room for the first time, I found hairs in the bathtub drain and hairs around the toilet. I'll just leave it at that, but it would be interesting to hear what that maid has as an excuse as to why she didn't clean the bathroom floor or the tub. Justify that! The biggest faux pas this Doubletree committed was losing its Internet connection--for 2 days. As a business traveler, this was unacceptable. Calling the front desk yielded an answer that tipped me off that this hotel is not prepared for power outages or brown outs. It seems that with the extremely humid and hot weather San Diego was experiencing while I was there (90% humidity & 93 degrees), a brownout had occurred that knocked the hotel off the Internet and no one could bring it back. I was told by the front desk that if I had an iPhone, I could use that instead. How fortunate for me (not!). Again, poor guest services and a bad (sarcastic) solution for $138 a night. The air conditioning in the hotel was also affected by this brownout. Air conditioning was intermittent the 3.5 days I was a guest. I was on the 9th floor and the hallways, elevators and common areas were suffocating! At one point, my room had no air, but I was able to open the sliding door, though it was hardly fresh: my balcony overlooked the freeway and the open door invited the hot, humid air with the 100+ decibel freeway noise into the room. Only two elevators of the three available worked at any given time. Wait times were average. The rooms have just been redecorated and are very pleasing--contemporary and well-appointed with big screen monitors and a nice selection of channels. The front desk was always courteous and this and the newly decorated rooms are why I am giving the Doubletree Mission Valley a 2.

I received a call from the desk about a hour after settling in telling me that they were going to comp us the cost of parking to again apologize for our having to wait. About 1/2 hour later, we got a knock on the door, and it was a maid handing out hot cookies... Honestly, by that time, I was really tired and that seemed like an intrusion, but I took the gesture as it was given, but I would suggest to management to just skip that part and give them as check out thank you's.

Although we had read on line about the renovations taking place at the hotel that were ongoing, we were not prepared for the extent of the disruption this caused during our stay. Although I was not as annoyed by the constant tapping, drilling, etc. as my wife and daughter, I couldn't understand why we were assigned rooms so close to the renovations; the work went on by the way, in double shifts, seven days a week so there was no escaping the noise unless you were out of the hotel. We didn't complain initially as we thought the noise would abate but in fact, the workers got closer by the day and the noise was pretty much non stop. When we did complain, the management offered to change our rooms but I personally was too ensconced to go to the trouble, especially not knowing for sure if another area of the hotel would in fact be quieter. The front desk comped the four of us for breakfast the next day which would have cost us $68 for the buffet ( which was excellent). We had a slow drain problem which took two days to rectify and in compensation we were comped dinner at the hotel which was again a real savings to us and again was excellent. In addition, the management gave us another free breakfast for two, a free night's stay toward a future booking and a twenty percent off any other stay at a DoubleTree. We also were offered an unlimited number of their delicious warm chocolate chip cookies. Despite the problems, the rooms were large, clean and comfortable and we've stayed in supposedly newly refurbished hotels that weren't as comfortable or nicely appointed as ours.

As I need to be in the Mission Valley area, naturally I choose hotels there. Somebody else might prefer a different area. It is not convenient to downtown San Diego or Balboa Park. It *is* convenient to Sea World, La Jolla, and the enormous Fashion Valley Mall. The traditional reason for others to stay in Mission Valley is the enormous number of hotel choices. Every chain is represented, some with multiple properties. Somebody is always running a sale so if budget is an issue this is the area to stay. Having tried a lot of others and having stayed at the Doubletree around a dozen times, I'd say it's the best choice in the area. The rooms are spacious. Having an outdoor heated pool is a big plus because San Diego nights can get cold any time of the year. After a hard day, I enjoy just floating in it and looking at the stars. The fitness center is excellent. Parking and internet can get expensive. Staff is responsive--at one time the hotel made a serious mistake in preparing for an event that I had arranged and it was difficult to find a solution. Management adopted a can-do attitude without any excuses. Assuming that you have decided to stay in Mission Valley, this is IMHO the best possible location, largely because it is one of the very few places where a car is optional. It is right across the street from the trolley stop, which can take you downtown. It is located at the end of the Hazard Center Shopping Mall, so there are several good restaurants (and a supermarket) within a 5-minute walk, and even better restaurants if you're willing to walk twice that far. The hotel also has an adequate restaurant. The executive lounge is nothing to get excited over. The caveats: 1) This is *not* the Doubletree Club, which is nearby. I do not recommend the Doubletree Club. 2) There have been an unusual number of bogus items on the bill presented at checkout. This included one time when the room rate was $50 higher than my written confirmation from Hilton. More commonly I find charges made by other guests and inadvertently posted to my room. Maybe a coincidence, but be on guard. 3) Prices at this property seem to fluctuate more than at others in the area. If you're quoted what seems to be a very high price, probably it is. Remember that you have unlimited hotel choices nearby. This property is worth a premium in my view, but I wouldn't pay $100 more a night for it.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHotel not bad - but location not great for young couple\u201d", "Author": "Marydublin54", "ReviewID": "UR93538585", "Content": "We stayed here on our honeymoon in jan 2011, I must say that I was a little disappointed we did not get a better room even though we were on honeymoon, but apart from the location I cannot fault the quality of the hotel.

This is a good alternative in the $150-$190 range, and is on a trolley/train stop, so you don't absolutely require a car. You can walk to a movie theater in 2 minutes, and grocery stores are a 5-10 minute walk. This hotel has a very good fitness facility. Many \"business\" hotels have small fitness rooms with 2-3 pieces of equipment with one piece often broken. This facility is large with free weights, weight machines and at least 10 cardio-theater machines. There is also an indoor pool, outdoor pool, and outdoor hottub. My stay was for two weeks, and I was very happy to find that the hotel had a single washer and dryer ($1.50 each). I generally choose a king-bed room because I find they have more open floor space, and that seemed to be the case here. My king room was large, with a comfortable desk, hotel-issue loveseat, dresser, etc. As a Hilton gold member, I was able to use the Hilton Honors lounge, but was not that impressed. The breakfast was simple and adequate, but you're not really sitting at tables and chairs, but club-type chairs. However, they have a selection of newspapers. The evening reception is also average, and there is a charge for beer and wine. The lobby bar/restaurant, and breakfast restaurant are better than average, perfectly pleasant. One drawback is the for-fee internet, which is more than $13/day. What is the point of that? It's not the fastest internet anyway. If you must, you can use the internet in the business center. My advice is to ask for a room that faces the trolley, which is slightly more free of freeway noise. Rooms with pool view seem to be regarded as premium rooms, but they are not worth it, facing the freeways also and the constant din of that noise.

I was disappointed that the room had no refrigerator, corrected when the hotel delivered one for a $30.00 fee. The Club had decent but not exceptional breakfast food and the selection of appetizers and alcoholic beverages was below the norm for similar hotels. More disappointing was that the club is closed Friday evening and Saturday and Sunday. They do provide vouchers for one appetizer in the downstairs bar each of those nights and a continental breakfast each morning, which I admit is a reasonable alternative. But if you like to grab some items, eat casually without waiter service (which I do) and take food back to your room, this is not possible. The valet parking was also quite below acceptable standards. They do have a valet parking stand at the entrance. However, the valet doubles as the bellman and never once in 9 chances came out, even when he could see a car arrive from his bell stand. Each time we had to bring in our keys and several times there was no one to take them. We didn't eat at the restaurants, but the bar service was slow but decent.

Although we like to sleep with the windows open, that was not an option at this hotel because the noise was intolerable. Whatever investment they've made to allow them to call this hotel \"chic\" was obviously in the lobby. The room we had (could they ALL be this bad?) was small and the bathroom was below Motel 6 quality with VERY low ceiling and chipped paint throughout. The \"old school\" small TV was also worse than most mediocre hotels have nowadays. As a Diamond member I asked for a room upgrade and I was assured that I was given a \"very nice room.\" One can only assume (hope?) that the desk clerk was lying because if this was one of their \"very nice\" rooms, I can't imagine what the others are like. I suppose if you like \"convenience\" as some other reviewers have noted, this might fit the bill....depending on if you like the convenience of being by an \"anywhere in America\" shopping mall. But San Diego is a relatively small city and easy to get around.....what extra convenience is there to be right on TWO interstates that makes this worthwhile? Food in the bar was also mediocre.

NEUTRAL: -Be aware that Parking is an extra charge, as it is at most of the hotels in this area.

The hotel has adapted a CARE culture and seems to be genuine in their commitment to making their guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stay pleasurable. However, the staff who received us upon check-in seemed to have had a bad day - we were left to wait for 5 minutes before we were entertained (he was on the phone), didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apologize for keeping us wait, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to utter welcoming words, and the check in itself was slow. This normally doesn't concern me a great deal but it was 9:30pm when we arrived in the hotel and our 11-month old baby was already sleeping after a long 8-hour car ride from Williams, Arizona. All we needed was to get the hotel key quick and deal with the payment etc afterwards. (She woke up eventually at the lobby while waiting). Also, upon check-in, guests are supposed to receive freshly baked chocolate chip cookie as a symbol of their warm hospitality but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that either. Not that it matters really. But the gesture would have been appreciated. I had been a hotel desk receptionist in my younger years so I understand the importance of customer service to a certain degree and I must say I was disappointed when we checked in because after all, first impression lasts.

Their concierge and bell desk are just about the best I've seen anywhere - always willing to help and with great local information. We were 8 people in 2 rooms and were driving a 12 passenger van, we stayed 4 days. They not only found a place to park it for us (it wouldnt fit in their underground garage) but they even honoured our free parking deal which was really meant for a standard car or SUV.

You can tell at some point in time these rooms were updated, probably not that long ago but it was only to mask what was hidden underneath. The obvious was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popcorn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ceiling. The minute you see any hotel with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popcorn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ceiling will probably mean there will be some short-comings.. ie: cheap d\u00c3\u00a9cor, old fixtures like bathtub drains or under the sink plumbing, dirty tile grout, old doors, peeling wallpaper, rusting walls, no microwave, no fridge and old TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instead of newer flat screens, (tubes are so 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s!). This place had all of the above. Now let me say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad hotel, just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much as far as luxury or cleanliness. Its basically a hotel that had gone through a very decent upgrade, minus a couple of things but has gone through the mills since then. I think that its just as if this hotel goes through so many occupants that it just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another example: The have 2 gas fire pits out near the outdoor pool. The fire pit spits out 3 fires through fire rings and lava rocks. Well on one of the fire pits only 2 of the 3 fire rings were working. Upon further inspection the next morning in day light I took noticed that the third fire ring that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working was so beyond rusted it had brittled away. So this means it has not been replaced for quite some time. Two pools are better than one! Now they got that right, to include allowing you to swim in the indoor one 24/7. The outdoor pool is very spacious and little one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will have a grand time floating around the 3 \u00c2\u00bd foot deep side of the pool while all the rowdy teenagers put each other on their shoulders and wrestle on the 5 foot side. On the other hand the jacuzzi is super small. Its max capacity is 6. Seems kind of odd when you have two sizeable pools and everyone keeps sneaking up to the jacuzzi to check if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an open spot to warm up from the cool May California breeze. It has a decent hotel gym and a nice sauna. The food is ok. Window Lounge had a small but hearty menu. Be sure to get the breakfast package when staying because I can see Applebees right across the way getting old every morning. At least with the breakfast package you can mix up your omelet to your liking every day. Speaking of Applebees, its not a far walk from the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten bad reviews on other sites but if you know what you want it is a decent choice for food to go at pool side. The All American Grill is also next to the hotel and serves great food but can be a bit loud especially if a games going on. Go Lakers! As mentioned by previous reviewers this place is in a great location! Literally walk and shop! Well for me, my favorite was Yogurtland. For my wife, Barnes and Noble and of course\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Starbucks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mexican, Japanese, Fast food and a grocery store within walking distance. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a movie theater within yards and a trolley station across the street that will take you just about all directions in San Diego.

We arrived early and the from desk gave us a few options if we wanted to check in early. For us it dident matter so we took a 3rd floor room and we were happy. At night I can understand peoples complaints about the freeway (our windows were open the entire time we were there) but the noise really wasent that bad at all, and as forthright trolly noise couldent hear it go by at night. (trolly service ends at midnight). Since we disent opt to rent a car we payed 14$ for a 4 day trolly pass which also covers transit. We went to seaworld (can be accessed by bus) or around a 18$ cab ride from the hotel, we also went to th zoo and it ended up being a 19$ cab ride there. So great location to both of these places. We took the trolly then bus to mission beach which was about a 15 min ride. Fashion valley mall is worth checking out when our staying there it's the next stop on the trolly from the hotel. All in all great hotel, great service and it's worth talking to the guys who grab cars and call taxis they know alot about places around the area. I shouldent also mention they allowed us to check out an hour later, but I'm sure that depended on how full the hotel was.

Every time we stepped foot back into the hotel or were off for a day of fun, Mark always said hello and called me by my name which was impressive. He was very professional. The hotel is very conveniently located close to the trolley and shopping and restaurants were very close.

We had the breakfast buffet which came with an additional price of room, but very reasonable and it was delicious, service in the dining room excellent as well.

The hotel itself is situated in sprawly Mission Valley, sandwiched between two large malls and adjacent to a shopping center. We were hoping for something a bit more walkable, although it is nice to be just across the street from the trolley which can take you to nicer places with better restaurant choices. The nearby restaurant choices are limited to chains: denny's, applebee's, Joe's crab shack, \"all-american grill\", quizno's, and more if you head across the freeway to Fashion Valley Mall. We did so on foot, at our own risk, luckily were sidewalks but not many crosswalks so it was a bit hairy. The mall is literally less than half a mile away but like I said, it's not a very walkable area. The hotel is surrounded by busy boulevards and highways so freeway noise is noticeable, but to be expected in that area. Our room was advertised as a \"deluxe balcony\". This was perhaps the greatest disappointment. The balcony did not even have enough room to pull a chair out on, useful only for a smoking fix, although you're technically probably only supposed to do that in smoking rooms. The king bed was very comfy and good pillows too. Parking was a bit confusing, we accidentally came in the back way and so we drove through the shopping center and parked underground. The hotel website had advertised that parking was $18/day. I think if you entered the garage the front way maybe that was true, but the paid parking is easy to circumvent, lots of street and shopping center parking. The pool area is very nice and private with good tree cover, but not too much to get in the way of tanning. Would be a good place for kids. There is also an indoor spa that I did not go in but looked nice and seemed to be working. There are two large firepits outside by the pool adjacent to the bar, which would be a good place to hang out and have a drink, however the drinks at the bar \"Windows\" were outrageously priced. An amber ale was $6.25 and a Coors light was $5.75. Ridiculous. A 4-6pm happy hour brings those prices down, but only by a bit. We dined in the restaurant for breakfast, they had a $19 buffet, we went ala carte instead, which was decent, though pricey. Service was friendly, but slow and they seemed understaffed considering it was a Chargers game and they should have expected to be busy. They give you a warm cookie when you check in and one at turn down service. A nice touch. I would stay here again, but only if they keep the price of the room low. I would also bring my own alcohol. The rooms were clean and nice but in need of updating, which according to a vague sign in the lobby, it seemed like they were contemplating.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas", "Title": "\u201cONE OF THE BEST HOTELS\u201d", "Author": "kansas1111", "ReviewID": "UR47971705", "Content": "This hotel was so clean and very modern.

They were sold out and the original room that I was supposed to get was already given to someone else. He comped us breakfast that next morning. I don't normally do the breakfasts for two reasons: they aren't healthy or good. I have on my profile that I want the reward points. So since that was given to us, we went upstairs to the breakfast on the executive floor just for some decaf and bananas for the road. There were eggs but that was it. The fruit platter was empty. There was a bagel on a platter and there was no decaf. When you pumped the coffee container grounds spit out at you. I took my cup downstairs when I checked out and was told someone would bring us two cups of decaf from the gift shop. Well after waiting my husband went to the gift shop and the woman behind the counter told him he could pump his two complimentary cups. What a waste of time both days. I didn't sleep well from the people getting off the elevator and going down the hallway talking. I made a complaint and got a really unsincere apology from Mark.

The hotel shuttle picked us up at the airport for free and $10 back. We spent a day at Sea World, and one day touring the US Midway and the harbor. On the negative side--the hotel is near a very busy and loud highway. The hotel also boasts that it is next to a 3-story shopping plaza within walking distance, the Hazard Center. It is very close, but most of the businesses have closed down. There's a few cafe's and 3 resaurants, and a movie theater. If you're two women wanting to shop, this is not the place.

I was a little worried about the location being further from the sites but it turned out perfect for us. My children (3 and 6) loved riding the train into downtown and Old Town for our sightseeing. We bought a multiday pass for the MTS and used the trains to get everywhere. Due to our HHonors status we were given access to the executive floor. The service was wonderful here. We met the kindest lady who managed this room and looked after us each morning for breakfast. She even offered to bring us coupons for Legoland that she had at home. After our day at the zoo the children were too exhausted to drag to a restaurant and we made our dinner out of the snacks at evening reception. This is not something I would normally do (we love to eat out), but it was the perfect solution for us that night. We also experienced outstanding service from the front desk. Upon our arrival at the airport, we called the Doubletree to request the free airport shuttle. We were told it would be 40 minutes before they could pick us up, so we should just take a cab and they would pay for it. Of course the cab driver said he would not wait for the hotel to pay. So as my husband was getting our bags and handing over our credit card to pay for the cab I walked inside to be met by the bellman who was waiting specifically for us. When I told him my husband was paying he literally ran outside and stopped the cab driver from taking my husband's card. What could have been a very bad first impression of the hotel turned out to be an excellent first impression. By the way, while the shuttle is free from the airport to the hotel, when you are needing transportation back to the airport it is $10 a person. Our children were free though. We swam in both pools (indoor and outdoor) used the exercise facilities and the hot tub. The gym was quite busy when we were there. Our only complaint would be the internet service. There was no free connection in the room and a charge to use the business center computers. My husband took his lap top to the lobby one night to take advantage of the free wifi in the lobby and found that even down there getting a connection was a problem.

Nearby are all your conveniences if you're on a business trip: two supermarkets, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, post office, several restaurants (though we drove into the city for dinner at the fabulous Bertrand at Mister A's) etc. Seaworld is closeby, and so are many other attractions. Parking is not a problem here. OK, you don't get a San Diego Bay view, but everything else is here so you save money by skipping the view. The manager's reception on the executive level and breakfast in the morning are very well done and attended by a very helpful and friendly hostess who will give you directions, tips for what to do in the city and more.

TRANSPORTATION The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle from the airport to the hotel. I was told to call the front desk upon arrival to the airport since it takes about 15-30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive. Since the hotel was sold out (due to the conference) the shuttle was very slow. I ended up waiting for an hour for the shuttle. There were others who were waiting but were given a voucher to be used on a taxi to get to the hotel. The trolley stop is about half a block across the street from the hotel. We went to the Gaslamp district (a must see in the evening! Most stores are open til 8pm) for dinner. We had to transfer twice and thankfully had other tourists with us who knew how to get there....otherwise, it might save you the hassle of transfers by taking a taxi. Roundtrip trolley ride cost us each $5. The trolleys only run every half hour in the evenings, so it ended up taking us about 1.5 hours to get back to the hotel (which should normally take about 30 minutes!) Looking back at it, if we had more than 2 people, taking a taxi might've been more time/cost effective. CHECK IN Check in was easy and went smoothly. You get a warm chocolate chip cookie (that was DELICIOUS!!) at the front desk. (you can get them anytime and as many as you'd like). I was staying with a roommate who had put both of our names on the room so that I could check in without her being there. Someone else was checking in the same time I was and didn't do this...she had to contact the roommate and it took her a while to get a hold of her. So be sure to have all names on the room if you're checking in separately. AMMENITIES The gym was recently remodeled and VERY NICE! The equipment was very high quality (precor) and each of the eliptical machines, stationary bicycles and treadmills had their own individual tvs. There's also a large flat screen tv. There's exercise balls, stretchy cords, medicine balls and lots of free weights as well as a weight machine. There's benches and a crunch helper machine. This was the best-stocked gym that I've ever seen in a hotel. The pool and hot tub looked nice although I didn't go in. There's 2 outdoor fire pits that are lit in the evenings. These were nice to sit by (nice furniture too) as the evenings are pretty balmy. Our conference used the large ballroom and most of the individual rooms. The large ballroom was beautiful and very bright. The individual rooms were a little small for some of the workshops and slightly claustraphobic-feeling as there's not windows. The hotel itself was very nice and clean. Service was pretty helpful and friendly overall. FOOD There's a bar and lounge area. My roommate ate their pizza at the bar and she said it was about $9 for a personal vegetarian pizza that tasted pretty fresh. There's also a restaurant-- it looked like they have an omelet bar on weekends. We didn't eat here since we had conference food. The conference food was okay.....nothing to write home about. But I did notice staff replenishing food very quickly. Service was very good and attentive. The hotel is very conveniently located near several restaurants within walking distance. If you walk up the stairs in the lobby, you'll find a little strip mall-like series of shops. There's an educators store, a sports bar, applebees (i think), barne's and noble and some other stores. There's also a movie theater. There's a small cafe that's open for breakfast and lunch. Metrazzano cafe? They have good wraps and sandwiches and some interesting iced teas.

The rooms were practically identical, with the only exception being that we had a plant in our room. And our bathroom was much smaller, which didn't make sense to me. The upstairs breakfast / hospitality area was included with our executive-level (and more expensive) room. This was the first time we paid a higher price for the executive floor, so we made a point to check out the breakfast. It was OK, but the space was warm and cramped. It reminded me of most hotels in Europe, as far as being very cramped in space and somewhat intimate with all of your fellow guests. The main hostess was militant and overbearing. And to our horror (ha ha), forced some other guests to hug her when they said that they were leaving that day. We then took our leave rather quickly and went down for breakfast in the main restaurant. I would not pay for executive level rooms again. But the hotel itself was fine and the location was great, and was right across the street from the Trolley Stop, which is a GREAT convenience.

We went down to San Diego after having spent four nights at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Santa Monica. The hotel in Santa Monica was great, so we were looking forward to staying in this hotel, and we were not disappointed. We had booked an executive room (these are on floors10 and 11 and you need your key card to access these floors from the lift). Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The Doubletree beds are VERY comfortable. The bathroom has complimentary toiletries. Guests in executive rooms get complimentary continental breakfast on the 11th floor, which includes choice of juice, cereals, toast, bagels, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, pastries, cakes, tea and coffee. The hotel is conveniently located right by a trolley stop. A trip into downtown San Diego takes about 30 minutes. The Fashion Valley mall is one stop away on the trolley. We bought a three day pass for the trolley (which can also be used on buses) which was great value. We were in San Diego to go to the Charger vs. Raiders football game and the trolley goes from outside the hotel right to the stadium in only 10 minutes or so.

It is extremely overpriced for what you get. I had an 8th floor room facing Interstate 8. Good luck getting any sleep. Shame on you Doubletree, how can you justify charging top dollar for a room on the freeway side? You should provide earplugs for guests that are subjected to this horrendous noise. In addition, apparently their restaurant never got the word that there was an issue with serving fresh spinach. I completely lost my desire to finish my meal. When this was pointed out to the server, the cost of the meal was removed from my bill. The service in the bar was extremely poor. There is no other choice for dinner.

We had a bit of traffic noise, though only a very minor inconvenience. but our room faced the pool --I think rooms facing the numerous freeways around the hotel might have more of a traffic noise problem.

It was just that clean, well kept and impressive. The Bed was big and super comfortable. The room was large and spacious! The Swimming pools were super fun. The hot tub was the smallest I have ever seen-but hey, it is great the hotel has a large indoor pool. The Fitness room was Clean and large. There is an outdoor fireplace at night. The shopping area is FANTASTIC! The hotel is surrounded by upscale malls, shopping centers and every store and food court you can imagine. There is a Neiman and Saks! The beach is a nine minute drive. The hotel is not too far from Sea World, but you of course, you need a car. Only complaints: (1) Not enough Cable channels. No Disney channel for our kids. (2) The hot cookies have nuts and oats inside. (3) The old man at the concierge must be a volunteer. He was old and impatient and unprofessional.
