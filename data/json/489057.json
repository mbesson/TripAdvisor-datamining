Our stay was wonderful and the only thing to fault is the price of drinks in the hotel - extremely expensive. Some people have commented that it is dark inside and seen this as a negative - the way I would describe it is boutique a hotel with calm ambience and sometimes the muted tones were a pleasant contrast to the brilliant sun outside! The staff are superb, extremely helpful, well mannered and quick to help you with any query. When we arrived, they knew we were on honeymoon and immediately briefed us on places to visit, best ways to travel and how to get there. Our room was not quite ready but our bags were taken care of straight away and we were free to sit on the roof terrace or go off and explore. Our room was lovely, number 207 which overlooked the street but was by no means noisy. Great a/c, lovely jacuzzi bath (but don't overfill or doesn't work - safety feature we discovered) spacious and immaculate. There were lovely added extras in the bathroom and on our first night we received a complimentary bottle of champagne and hand made chocolates to celebrate our recent wedding - nice touch. Barcelona is amazing, I'm not big on cities but it was chic but friendly. The tapas bars are fantastic and the sights all around to see. I'd reccommend the hop on and off tour buses that run on the red, blue and green routes, you just get on and off as you wish and they run every 2 or 3 minutes it seemed. Even in hot August, we rarely had to wait more than 10 minutes at the most because it was so busy. Make sure that you visit the Sagrada Familia and try to go in, it's worth it. My other half also loved Camp Nou but it's not cheap! Parc Guell is lovely but a steep climb so not the best in boiling hot weather and the Olympic Stadium is worth a visit. We had no problems going down Las Ramblas with regards to pick pocketing but just take care and be sure to visit the Boqueria - it's the food market and great to wander around. Anyway, if you are going to Barcelona, be sure to check out Cataluna restaurant and stay at Casa Fuster, I would not hestitate to do so again. Thanks you to them and their staff.

When we arrived, the check in wasn't as smooth as it should have been, in my opinion. We arrived in the afternoon - about 14.30ish, and were told that our room wasn't ready yet. Ok, no big deal, and we were asked to wait 10 minutes, and we'd be checked in while we waited. However, after doing all the check in business, and then waiting for about 15 mins, I was approached by another member of staff asking me for my passport and credit card. Again. I explained that this was already done, but for some reason it wasn't done properly and all had to be done again. Very annoying for a 5* premises to not be able to check you in properly first go. The room was nicely decorated, but our view was of an adjacent building, so the curtains remained closed throughout our 2-day visit. The room was very nicely decorated, but quite small - although probably not smaller than you'd expect for a lot of city-centre hotels. Now, I tend to hold any hotel claiming a 5* status to a very high standard, and I must say that the hotel room - for this reason - wasn't as clean as I might have liked it. Overall, it was good, and the bathroom was scrupulously clean, however there was an ipod-dock/radio provided in the vanity area [which I really liked!] but it looked like it had NEVER been dusted. There was a thick layer of dust along the radio, behind it, and along the back of the vanity area, under the information books. Not good enough for a 5* in my opinion. Also, the cables at the back of the tv were very visible and leading down to one of those connection and power hole-thingies in the floor. However, due to the tangle of cables, the cover couldn't be put back properly over the hole in the floor and the overall result was that it looked really messy. Personally, I didn't like the layout of the bathroom - that it's more part of the room than a separate room of its own [it just has a frosted glass sliding door to separate] - it felt like it lacked a bit of the privacy one likes in a bathroom - and the shower practically flooded the whole area the first time I turned it on. Tip to the staff - if you know that the shower will flood the bathroom if the shower head is left pointing towards the shower doors [as opposed to the wall], then don't leave the shower-head that way for your guests to use! Breakfast was as you'd expect. Nothing really good or really bad - although it wasn't until we had gotten to the room that I'd realised that despite TWO check-ins, neither receptionist had told us when and where breakfast was served. Again, not good enough for 5* service. The roof terrace is lovely, and has a beautiful view down along the avenue to the ocean, but if you're expecting to be able to swim in the pool - don't. It's more of a leg dipper than a pool - I'd guess it only measures about 4m by 2m. Plus, the one morning we did decide to spend by the pool, we had to go find our own towels and cushions for the sunbeds as [even though it was after 10am, nothing had been laid out up there yet]. Overall, I think it lacked a bit of what you expect when you pay for a 5*. I probably wouldn't be bothered staying here again on my next trip to Barcelona - but I will say that they did a great job on the wedding I attended: the service and the food were excellent. It's unfortunate that this didn't spill over into the other areas and services provided by this hotel.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mugla, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cChic Hotel in Chic Neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "mervenadir", "ReviewID": "UR117980164", "Content": "The staff was exceptionally helpful, especially the reception.

We found a very good deal on a online booking website and were excited to stay at this luxury hotel. When we first arrived it was quite early in the morning and our room was not available \u2013 the hotel clerk explained that he would send us an SMS as soon as the room was ready, by 6pm no SMS. We got to our \u2018Superior Room\u2019 and right away noticed a thick coating of dusk on every surface, as well as broken drawers in the dresser that were sticking right out into the room, as well as a blood stain or something of that nature on the lamp, not a great first impression. We also noticed that the shower leaked onto the floor when the water was turned on, making it a bit treacherous. We did however, comment on the fact that it was not a king bed as requested but two twin beds, the gentleman that brought our bags said that he would have housekeeping make the bed into 1, which was done for us right away. We found some of the front desk staff to be extremely nice and accommodating but did have a bad experience with one gentleman who seemed to not care that we were spending money at his place of employ. Not impressed. We asked for the best route to the beach and were barked at by him and told to take a certain line of the metro. We tried to find that line at the closest station but realized that it was quite a trek and were better off to take the bus (buy your ticket at a station \u2013 2 days for 11 Euro instead of 17 at the tourist centre). The pool was also ridiculous \u2013 any smaller and it would be a puddle. The second day of our stay we returned in the evening to change for dinner and noticed that our room was open, we brought this to the attention of the front desk and they did not seem to be too worried about it. I am thankful that nothing was missing as I don\u2019t believe the hotel would have been too helpful in replacing any missing items. We were extremely unimpressed by the hotel, perhaps it was due to us booking on a discount website? If so, then the hotel should remove itself from that service so that no other tourists have to deal with this problem.

The facade is amazing, it used to be a family home and the interiors are very well decorated, kind of modern, classic and decadent Barcelona style at the same time. My room was small but cozy and well appointed with a fantastic carrara marble bathroom with a tub and a bidet (kudos for the bidet!) and great lighting. The closets are spacious so you will find ample room for shoes and dresses. There are a few reasons why I didn't give them five starts instead of four: 1. They do not have a very disciplined cleaning methodology. This is strange: the carpeting in my room was stained and looked pretty tired, it needed a major clean with strong white spirit. When I first arrived there was an open pack of crisps on the dressing table. I put on my bathrobe which looked impeccable and discovered a pair of pearl earrings in the pockets. Those pockets are not protected so I was baffled to think how a bathrobe that had undergone the strain of machine wash could keep a pair of earrings safely. 2. A very strange cleaning lady: Our cleaning lady came in to open the beds in the evening while my mother and I were naked in the bathroom getting ready. The music in our room was booming so it was evident the room was occupied. She came in without asking whether she could come in or not and proceeded to open the beds. This was such an imposition, they should try and come in when people are not naked and strolling around. I wonder whether Straus-Kahn's cleaning lady was as impertinent. 3. Their pillows are a disaster. You will notice that I am very picky with pillows. These were too big and uncomfortable. I called to get a pillow menu and the guy forgot my request. Casa Fuster is a five star hotel GL (grand luxury) so I find it very strange that they have polyester filling in their pillows instead of down. 4. I ordered room service (huevos estrellados with chips), but they weren't real huevos estrellados. This happens to me a lot in great hotels, their cuisine just isn't as good as what you can get out there at an average restaurant. I have to say that the food was beautifully presented over starched cotton carpets though. All in all great value five star hotel, but they should work a bit harder to keep the GL status, as it is really a gem of a hotel!", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat location lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "jimstravels", "ReviewID": "UR114536080", "Content": "Just returned from a four day stay in Barcelona.

We stayed in room 501 and it didn't disappoint. The room was ample size, spotless and the icing on the cake was a direct view of Sagrada Familia from our large window. The bed was HUGE. Beautiful quality furniture with Gaudi influence, luxurious velvet drapes and a large luxury bathroom with power shower and large bath. We had two sets of bath robes and slippers in our room and a lovely seating area too. There was ambient lighting, air conditioning and a lovely library filled with beautiful books on Barcelona. The hotel provided us with complimentary maps and a tour guide. We booked the tour bus tickets at the recpetion desk and also booked into the hotel restaurant for Sun eve.

At that time we had been awake for more than 30 hours, we told the desk staff that there was no way we could wait for another room, we were not treated with respect, and this was definitely not the service or accommodation that was expected from a five star hotel. I don't think there was ever a room available for us, and sending us off several times was disrespectful and humiliating , we were offered no apology and no solution. At 7:00 am the next morning the construction began again, thank goodness we left on a tour shortly after. The key to the room never worked and someone had to let us in several times, I have a feeling this room wasn't used in a long time. The room was obviously in need of renovation as the carpet in the entry way had holes and was very worn and stained. The bathroom had rust around the tub area, definitely not the standards of a \"five star hotel\". To sum it up, my husband and I are retired professionals; we have stayed in many five star hotels for business and leisure. It is hard to believe that a hotel with this reputation could treat clients with such disrespect and offer a substandard room that no one could have slept in due to the construction noise. Construction happens, but the real issue is the way we were treated, telling us to come back in six hours, than two hours and then again and still not finding a solution. We never heard from the desk or management again, no one apologized or attempted to relocate us. Casa Fuster is definitely NOT a five star hotel, and the rate we paid which included a substandard breakfast was incongruous.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cA true leading hotel in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Its_Scandinavian", "ReviewID": "UR85371186", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights together with my family and we had a true pleasant stay.

The location is perfect, in a nice and quiet area even if you are in the absolute city center. Several good restaurants and bars around the corner, we had a wonderful dinner at the Moo Restaurant. We never had dinner at the hotel, the restaurant was looking a little bit desolated. Bar Viene is a perfect spot and great service.

The bits they don't quite get right are (i) service - it was all very well meaning and friendly, but it didn't have that layer of refined professionalism that you expect at this level (ii) as they are in a protected building, there are some odd twists and turns in the building and in the rooms e.g. the entrance foyer is comparatively small and underwhelming (iii) the food in the restaurant whilst beautifully presented and served, was not up to much - too much style over substance (iv) the hotel was almost empty when we were there so the atmosphere felt a bit chilly..... that's often the case in places like this, but it was noticeable here.

This extra charge, more than many hotels charge for a whole room plus breakfast, didn't even include breakfast! The breakfast was expensive, good though not top rate. It suffers from being in the basement. This is an interesting Modernist room but it is still a basement and correspondingly gloomy. One day they had the breakfast on the ground floor because of some special event in the basement. This was far better, though the lovely head waiter still apologised that it wasn't sunny. The food is good but I've had better. The staff are terrifically keen and friendly. Some of them made a point of remembering my surname. There were plenty of friendly greetings. It was always easy to catch their attention if we required anything. But when I asked the concierge whether 9 year old children travel free on the Metro, he admitted he didn't know and guessed that they did. I think he should have gone and found out, particularly as his guess was wrong. Children over 4 have to cost the same as adults on the Metro. Our room had a lovely view down the Passeig de Gracia. This made a lot of difference to our enjoyment. I would say the hotel is well placed but a little out of things. Without the lovely view, we'd have felt a bit cut off. The bathroom was terrific: better than I've had in any other City hotel and only equalled by one or two country hotels with space to do something interesting. It was very big with a door to separate the bath and toilet from the rest, of required. The fittings were excellent and the design had successful Modernist touches. The bed was good. We didn't sleep too well though because the air conditioning was quite noisy and kept switching off and on in the night, waking us up. With the air conditioning off, the room became unpleasantly hot in the night even though the weather was cool. The interior decoration is a bit boring but luxurious and in very good condition. The building itself is a rightly celebrated example of Modernist architecture. The restaurant was almost empty on two out of the three evenings we went there.

We didn't eat in the restaurant (apart from breakfast, where, shockingly for Spain, they knew how to fry an egg) but am told it's very good. The bar is wonderful with live jazz on a thursday. The pool on the roof is very small, a plunge pool really, but there's lots of room to stretch out. There is a snack bar and gym also on the roof.

This being our first time abroad without our two young children we decided to stay in a 5* hotel and treat ourselves but this is not a 5* hotel in the true meaning of 5*. The hotel is located about 20 minute walk to The Ramblas and is at the top of the \u2018posh shops\u2019 parade so not quite as central as some but certainly easy to walk to main locations from. The building itself is architecturally beautiful. We had a standard room and didn\u2019t get a room with a view (we\u2019d booked through Monarch and got a good rate so maybe this was why). The room (416) was very small and very dark- adequate but small, and certainly not 5*. Bathrooms are nice with huge, fluffy towels but the shower is over the bath and is extremely high to climb into. I couldn\u2019t believe that for the price we\u2019d paid there wasn\u2019t any kettle or cups in the room \u2013 only refreshments were the expensive mini bar. The bar is lovely and the seating in the bar area palatial. The door staff, porters etc, were friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool hardly warrants being called a pool as I thought it was a water feature and certainly you couldn\u2019t\u2019 swim in it! It was unmanned at this time of year so you could only stand on the rooftop terrace and look down the Passeig de Gracia. As an aside, we had a lovely meal at Torres on Passeig de Gracia. Breakfast was not 5* really. Although there was something for everyone, including gluten free rice cakes, the English breakfast was awful. Scrambled egg that you could stand a spoon in and sausage on a bed of white beans! Have an omelette instead and wait 15 minutes is my recommendation! Sadly, this is not a 5 star hotel. The pool, fitness centre, sauna and rooftop bars are small and barely worth having. I would rate it a 4 star with some charm.

My Catalan friend who made the booking, made the reservations staff aware of the purpose of our trip and asked if they could make some small gesture for us. They agreed, but did absolutely nothing at all. Very poor PR on their part. The location is fantastic. The building itself is architectually striking. The bar is beautiful and the door staff, porters etc, were very friendly and helpful. We took a standard room and sadly, there was nothing five star about it. Such a disappointment. Very small. An attic room really. Very dated decor. Dark brown walls. Dark brown curtains. Badly stained floor carpet. Stained bed cover which I had to ask house-keeping to remove. The air-conditioning only worked whilst we were in the room. As soon as we left, it turned off because we had taken the key with us.

Maybe it's simply that Barcelona is the most magical city in Europe, but driving up Gracia in a taxi and seeing the building for the first time must rank as one of my favorite hotel arrivals of all time. My initial observations were overwhelmingly positive. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and I enjoyed bantering with the young receptionist who checked us in. First impressions of our junior suite were also great. The room had been renovated and had new wood floors (they were Pergo, actually, but not the smelly carpet mentioned in some reviews). The bathroom was huge and the walk in shower was elegantly designed. They had set up my daughter's bed in the living room. It was going very well indeed. We began to unpack, however, and immediately I noticed the room was a little warm. This was understandable as it was hot outside and you need to leave your key in the door to activate the electricity. I turned the AC to a low setting and popped open a celebratory water from the minibar. Then the phone rang. Apparently there was a problem with my credit card. I went downstairs and discovered that they had attempted to put a hold on my card for double the total of 5 days in a junior suite. The charge had been denied by Amex. I did think this was a little strange, but I gave them another card and went back upstairs to see how the room was cooling off. It wasn't. Now it was my turn to call. Apparently they were having problems with the hotel AC. Rest assured, they said, it would cool down in a couple of hours. We left to explore a little and find some tapas. The young receptionist, Borje I think, suggested a place up the street. We walked out of the hotel and it was obvious from just the first few minutes that Barcelona is an awesome town. The people are cool, the streets exciting and vibrant, and the suggested restaurant was filled with happy locales who were more than willing to translate the Catalan off the menu chalked above the bar. But when we got back to the room it was hotter. I called down again and heard what would become a familiar refrain. The building is old and charming. Don't worry, they said, it just takes time. Meanwhile they brought up a fan. Now this would have been a suitable solution if the fan had actually worked. Alas, it's oscillating function was kaput and we were forced to aim the air in one direction. Not a big problem, but we had two rooms. Oh well. (And the blackout curtain in the living room didn't fully close and had to be fastened shut with a safety pin to keep the street light from shining directly on my daughter's bed. She wound up sleeping with her mother anyway, so I was kept awake by heat and light. I lived.) I won't bore you with a longer narrative of the AC saga. Suffice it to say I spent several hours over three days trying to get it fixed. The technician came up at midnight on day two, got on a ladder, moved a ceiling partition, made some phantom adjustment and pronounced us good to go. Just wait a few hours, he said. At this point I knew every employee of the hotel and it was clear that the AC was permanently broken in our room, always had been, and that it would never be fixed. For over $500 a night this seemed a tad absurd. Why not just tell me the truth and move my room. Finally this is what happened. We were transfered one room over to a large suite with great AC and a sauna in the bathroom! Unfortunately the placement of the sauna had necessitated a smaller shower and bath combo with perhaps the least safe bathing entrance I have ever seen in a hotel. The edge of the bath was too high to climb in comfortably. Anyone with a knee injury, or maybe on the older side, or a child, would need help getting in and out. And the shower flooded the room... Again I could go on indefinitely with little problems and oddities. Both our rooms were nicely refurbished, but if you looked closely you could tell that the finishings were cheap and that corners had obviously been cut. Knobs fell off, the safe worked and then didn't, the TV failed, the internet cut out, and if you didn't leave your key in the room the electricity stayed off and the room was hot. So every time we returned a member of the staff had to accompany us. Despite all this I sort of loved the hotel. It smelled good. The rooftop was nice (pool is a joke, of course). The lobby cafe is stunning. The location is the best in Barcelona. Maybe if I had liked Barcelona less I would have been more aggravated by the comedy of errors that defined my stay at Casa Fuster. But the place is cool (in style, not temperature), and while I wouldn't stay there again, I'm glad I did once.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201calmost perfect!\u201d", "Author": "guccilady", "ReviewID": "UR32832292", "Content": "Great location excellent staff carpets a bit soiled and bath tub leaked but over all stay was excellent", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat roof top terrace!\u201d", "Author": "Euroshopper", "ReviewID": "UR30261578", "Content": "The best part of the hotel is the rooftop terrace!!

The pool, fitness centre, sauna and rooftop bars are token efforts. I would rate it a 4 star with some charm but sadly that charm was lacking during our visit. A major disappointment was that the Roof Bar was shut despite the great weather. This meant guests wishing to use the sun loungers or miniscule pool had to raid their mini-bars. There was no waiter service. The Fuster already has limited 5* facilities and to have one of the few they have unavailable is unacceptable in a true 5* establishment. Compare this to the Majestic Hotel just down the street where we also stayed this trip and which had a full menu and bar service around their (generally superior) rooftop pool. The AC in our room did not work. This is irksome in itself but what is unacceptable in this case is that we informed reception clearly explaining that it was NOT simply a case of the AC not having sufficient time to cool the room down as we had had it on all night. Despite this they appeared to have done nothing other than use our key (which was therefore not available to us when we returned from sightseeing for the day) to keep the room electrics on all day. Compare this to our stay in both the Majestic and a 3* hotel in Girona where the AC worked faultlessly. During our 4 night stay we had the turn-down service on 1 night. This despite the fact that we were absent from the room well before 8pm each evening. Not good - especially when compared to the Majestic who always turned down our bed. We also requested the conciege to purchase 2 tckets for a concert. He rang us 40 minutes later saying we would have to call at the theatre in person to get the tickets! Now we thought the whole point of a conciege was that they could do this sort of thing - and indeed this has been the case in London, Sienna, Budapest, Paris and many other places we have made such a request. Note it is not that they were NOT available - only that he could not apparently get them! This is unacceptable for a 5* city center hotel. As far as we are concerned he should have organised to have had them collected / delivered to the hotel for us. That would have been 5* service comnpatable to other european hotels. My partner and I also prebooked a 100Euro jazz dinner in the hotel on checking in so we would have an easy 1st night. This Jazz Evening was generally poor value both in terms of music and cuisine but what really disappointed us was the table we were allocated which was directly in front of the room entrance and 2m from it. It was a shocking location for a dinner and looked very much like an afterthought placement. We asked if we could be moved elsewhere, this request was completely ignored and it was only when we got up after waiting 10 minutes saying we refused to pay 100 Euros for such a table that we were hurriedly found an alternative. This point neatly summarises both the hotel's general lack of care towards guests and the less than stella service. I requested a front facing room a week in advance but despite this we were not allocated one. Now this may be because we were \"only\" a standard double but it was still a disappointment and our distinct impression was that rooms were simply allocated on arrival since we were briefly offered an alternative on check-in when it appeared our room was not ready and no mention of the preference was made. Compare this with the Majestic who allocated us a very nice front facing room that was ready 2 hours before \"official\" check-in time. A few further minor nggles, the bathroom was dated and showing its age including cracked electrical switches. I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that getting out of the over-bath shower was potentially dangerous as access was limited by the shower screen and marble bath top. There is very little hanging space in wardrobes and no drawers. The minibar was poorly stocked and fridge rusty/ unhygeinic. The internet TV is virtually unusable as it does not resize the page to the TV screen resolution. The TV did not show all channels - Sky News was frozen during our stay. The bed was 2 singles rather than a true double - common in many european hotels but again bettered by the Majestic. The slideout bedside table on one side was unusable being wobbly with broken handle. The room was generally small but the bathroom a good size. All these are small points but not conducive to a 5* experience. On the positive side? Well the hotel is in a good position for those wanting a nice area away from the major tourist haunts and walkable to both the the Gaudi Park and Sagrada. We walk a lot so found it central to all major sites including as far down as the port. The Gracia district behind / around the hotel has a much more \"local\" feel with some nice bars etc. Check out Verdi Street and nearby plazas for example. So in conclusion, a very disappointing stay where limited facilities and resources were further undermined by poor service. We are sad to say we would not recommend ths hotel and for our next stay in BCN will seek out an alternative 5*.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Inverness", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel..relaxed atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Will_HInverness", "ReviewID": "UR28636646", "Content": "Booked through a cruise package this hotel was a real surprise and great start to our honeymoon.

Second, the internet-on-tv, which had a fast connection, froze one day. We asked the hotel to fix while we were out - they didnt but when we got back someone did come up and fix it. My credit card didn't accept their hold charge so they allowed me to call US credit card company and problem got resolved in ten - fifteen minutes. We ate breakfast one day which was very nice but a little pricey considering options on the street (about $60 US for two of us). One minor quibble. They hang up bathrobes on a rack next to the shower which makes it difficult to close or open the shower doors - we had to move them each day to take a shower.

The Building: Excellent and in a good location. The Room. Comfortable and well furnished. Public Areas: Well furnished if a little gloomy, due to 'atmospheric' lighting. The Problems: We retired early (10.30pm) after along day travelling to meet our cruise. We were woken by the dreaded mobile phone being used at full throttle by a memberof staff in the corridor outside our room. Resolved this by getting out of bed and remonstrating. We were next woken at about 3.am by revellers returning to the hotel. Repoteted this to reception 3 times before action was finally taken. Breakfast: is a joke for a 5 star hotel. It is now taken in the dining room and the 'hot' section is not kept hot, althogh the cold section has a decent variety. Another problem here is that the meal is taken on low (cabaret drink type) tables making for an uncomfotable experience. En suite: This is my main gripe, the bath/shower is now very old fashioned and looking very tired. I am sure that when it was first built it was at the edge etc. But now it is out of date, in my view a little dangerous to step out of the quite high sided bath after a shower requires more a lot more care than it should (I slipped, and my balance, weight posture is very good).

All staff were fluent in english as well as other languages. The doorman even greeted us by name when we went out for dinner (amazing since we never gave him our names)! When we requested to have a 7:00am taxi night before we departed (which can be difficult in Barcelona as there is sometimes up to a two hour wait for Taxis), they had two of them right on time - waiting for us (about 30 Euros from the hotel to the airport and visa versa) This hotel, while not being on La Rambla, is in a perfect location. It is only a few hundred meters to many architectural landmarks - yet is not on a busy street. Walk out the doors and you can immediately shop for Gucci bags or Valentino dresses (Yea, right! - but it is nice to window shop - as they are truly beautiful garmets). is only a 20 minute romantic stroll along outdoor cafe's, bakeries, eateries and shops to reach La Rambla. The food from their resturant was fantastic, however the breakfast buffet was probably the best I have ever experienced. Imported cheeses, specialty hams, sausages, breads, coffees - even specialty diet foods (low fat preserves, crackers, cereals), etc., or you could just have a normal cooked to order meal such as an omlet.

The Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo is a five star hotel. Hotel Casa Fuster is not a five star hotel. There are three areas that make this hotel less comfortable than a Marriott. First, the design. We had a Junior Suite. There is a lttle extra room, but no curtain between the sitting area and the bed. I dragged a chair into the hallway to read while my husband was sleeping. Where do they expect you to put your clothes? There is no armoire. There are no dresser drawers. There is a very small closet that wasn't tall enough to hang even my shortest dress. It is filed with extra pilows and blankets and the totally uncomfortable hemp robes. I had a hanging bag that I attached to closet door, then had to stand on a chair to access. The rest of my clothes had to remain folded on top of a suitcase. They could have put a dresser where the totally unnecessary second television is jammed next to the bed. Exactly how were we supposed to watch the large and expensive main television? In front of the main television is a HUGE, heavy three foot round unmovable table. I stubbed my toe on it several times, but could not move it more than an inch or two. Others have mentioned the archaic keying system. There is only one key so my husband and I could not explore on our own without elaborate plans about who would be in the room and awake. That key is necessary to turn on the electricity. That means your room will be VERY warm when you return, since the air conditioning will be off the entire time you are gone, Don't expect any electrical outlets in the bathroom. I ended up curling my hair on my knees against the tall wall mirror in the bedroom. Yes, there is internet access in the room, but it took me three days to find the plug hidden behind the desk. And you better have taken your own ethernet cord. There are no instructions that access exists or how to use it in any of their literature. I spent an uncomfortable time using their reception area WiFi, because there are no sofas or tables in the lobby. just some beautiful wooden chairs. The second fault is the lack of maintenance. Three times we had to return to the front desk because our key failed to work in our door. The bathtub was a deep whirlpool tub, but the OFF switch and the volume adjustments did not work. You got a rather ineffectual splashing if the water was over two or three inches. Our room contained a permanently on lamp right near the bed. The only way to turn it off was to pull the plug. The room was so dark that you will need to get on your knees and plug in the lamp again when you are awake. The third fault is the unprepared concierge. We wanted to buy a Barcelona Card (free Metro and buses, discounts to museums) and even had a picture of it to show them. They tried to tell us where to buy a Bus Touristique card (a sad transportation system with lines an hour long even in October). They totally underestimated the time to walk to Sagrada Familia and the direction to take. They always seemed surprised that our key didn't work. They must know their system is flawed. I do want to say a few nice things about the hotel also. The bed and linens were very nice. The room was relatively quiet, if you didn't mind the children screaming in the playground next door during the day. The location was perfect for exploring the Eixample, the neighborhood with the most Gaudi buildings, and was very convenient to the Metro and several bus lines. And the best part was the hotel restaurant, Galaxo. We ate there because we were too tired to go elsewhere, but we should have gone there prepared for a feast.

We stayed at the Casa Fuster for three nights April 25-April 28 2008. We had a bit of a lesson in supply and demand as the weekend we were there was the same as the F1 race in Barcelona and so room rates were higher across the entire city. And so it is\u2026.Anyway we are middle class folks but like to stay in quite nice hotels when we travel (and don\u2019t mnd paying for it), but I think you\u2019ll find some fairly practical comments relative to the hotel and its amenities. The hotel is optimally located at the top of Passeig de Gracia. One simply cannot beat the great shopping up and down Passeig de Gracia. It was a 5 minute walk to the Casa Mila, our first tourist stop one morning and a Bus Turistic stop as well. As someone else noted its about 10 mins give or take to Placa de Catalunya. There are some very nice restaurants within 2 minutes of Casa Fuster including Fernandez (where we dined one day for lunch) and El Toc de Gracia (where we dined for dinner \u2013 the hotel recommended the place). Cervesseria Cataluna was a 10 minute walk and a great dinner one evening as well. Hotel Majestic is in an even better location a bit further down Passeig de Gracia but I cant comment intelligently on that institution as we never set foot in there. We arrived at 1 PM on a Friday and were immediately checked-in. We had a reservation for a standard room and we were given Room 412 facing Passeig de Gracia with a decent view and a very small balcony. Because of the building\u2019s historic landmark status, the rooms were not allowed to be expanded at all and thus space is definitely at a premium. In the standard room we had to move the chaise over a few feet just to open the balcony door, then slide our way through the balcony if we wanted to catch some fresh air. Having stated that its not as if the balcony is truly intended for spending significant amounts of time out there. We had to step around our suitcases just to get in and out of bed. If there is a next time we would definitely pay for a larger room. The bed was a true double and very comfortable, the pillows plush. There was a small desk and a flat screen TV just above the minibar. The closet was large enough and we managed just fine. The bathroom was very nicely done in marble and complete with bidet and his and her toiletries. We were religious about using the room safe and had absolutely no issues with any lost belongings or anything of the sort. As a matter of fact I will state that Casa Fuster provided an overwhelming feeling of safety relative to the Las Ramblas area etc. You could just feel you were in a better neighborhood and the staff acted accordingly. We tipped the maid one morning and noticed a difference in the level and timing of service (room cleaning and turn down) the next day \u2013 not sure if there is anything to that or not, just an observation. One gripe \u2013 the hotel claimed to have an iron (I checked before we left the US) in the room \u2013 not true. We arrived to find no iron in the hotel room (much to my fiance\u2019s dismay!) and as with many luxurious European hotels, the hotel would not furnish one. Instead the hotel offered to press any item of clothing through its Laundry/Press service. The hotel charges 10 Euros to press one pair of pants, as an example. This is what one would expect for a high end hotel and so we do not mean to be talking out of both sides of our mouths \u2013 just thought there should be an iron when advertised as such. In retrospect it turns out that the Travelocity website noted the Casa Fuster provided an iron, not the hotel website itself. The rooftop terrace was very nice \u2013 we enjoyed a drink or two up there one pleasant afternoon and soaked up some 70 degree sun while admiring the view. As with most hotel pools in Barcelona \u2013 the rooftop pool did not impress at all \u2013 it is a tiny footpool by American standards. We then walked over and fell asleep for an hour or so in the lounge recliners on the roof. Very relaxing. If you are into exercising/working out, please don\u2019t be too misled by Casa Fuster\u2019s boasting of an exercise room. We are talking about one treadmill, one bike and a bench with no weights. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the treadmill did its job just fine and there is a flatscreen TV in the small fitness room to boot. However there wasnt much equipment is all and had there been someone else wanting to exercise at the same time I wouldn\u2019t have been altogether pleased. The sauna is a tiny room just off the exercise room. By far and away the most admirable trait of the Casa Fuster was its staff and service. The staff was absolutely fantastic, especially when compared to the Hotel 1898 (where we stayed for the next three nights). You leave your key when you depart the hotel (you should see the size of these things, remarkable :) and the staff will do their best to accommodate any request one has. The services provided to us ranged from: recommending casual, local restaurants as well as booking restaurant reservations at places like Arola et al, changing money at the front desk, providing information on local attractions such as Bus Turistic, Montsterrat, printing out the train schedules for us, booking a rental car, you name it really. On our last day there the staff held our luggage for 4 hours while we shopped and prior to our departure for Hotel 1898. Hailing a taxi was no problem through the equivalent of their bellboys and even the lowest ranking staff member truly seemed to be informed and happy to assist. I guess that is the point \u2013 many hotels offer such services but the folks here seemed to do it with a smile. Again I make these statements in comparison to the Hotel 1898, which was much more of a \u2018we provide some info, you do the rest yourself\u201d type of feeling. Would we stay again? We probably would. For the feeling of a fantastically constructed 5-star hotel and the service it provides. there is no mistaking the architecture and history. However, I would likely first explore other properties like Hotel Majestic or Claris (acknowledging Claris is a step below Fuster).

The architecture and design is cool, Catalan and classy.Soem will say too dark, but we thought it atmospheric. The room was small but beautiful.The bathroom was remarkably large, but with no bidet and a shower along the side of the bath, it was not well thought through.The freebies were the best we have ever had in any hotel.

This is an expensive place, and we were in what was called a standard room. The room itself was quite adequate in size and decor, and comparable to any standard room of a five star hotel; there was no significant view out of the back of the hotel. But the lobby area and other common space were first class, and I can only imagine what some of the expensive rooms looking out on the street might be like. The breakfast, served in the windowless basement, was unusual for its variety and quality, although the space was a bit strange. The people who worked at the hotel were warm and hospitable. The hotel is very centrally located, and is only several blocks from the Casa Mila--one of Gaudi's most famous buildings. And the Diagonal Metro station is only a block away, so access to the subway system is convenient. This is an upscale neighborhood, and we very much enjoyed our stay.

Food can be found in the streets behind the hotel, Gracia neighbourhood. Very authentic with far fewer tourists than Las Ramblas or El Barrio Gotico. The building is gorgeous and not too far from 2 of Gaudi's most famous buildings. The rooftop bar and plunge pool are beautiful at sunset. Great place to relax with a drink after an afternoon about town. The rooms are nice, maybe a bit small for the price but quite modern and elegant.

The location is good, at the top of the Passeig de Gracia about a 20 minute walk from the main hub at Catalunya Square - if you don't window shop at the exorbitant designer shops and stop at every bit of magnificent Gaudi architecture along the way. The hotel building is impressive inside and out and the attention to detail admirable. The high ceiling and cool ambience of reception, the amazing decor of the cafe bar with a view down Passeig de Gracia. The roof terrace has a similarly impressive viewpoint of the street and much of the rest of the city. The pool is small, but it would have been rude not to try it! We stayed in a Junior Suite, which was wonderful. I can't compare it to the other rooms, but the bed was huge and comfortable, the bathroom vast and well equipped and a nicely furnished lounge leading onto a small balcony, ideal for winding down after visiting the city. We ate one night in the restaurant and considering the quality of the food, the relaxing mood and pampering received, the price was not too bad, just over 100 Euros, three courses and a bottle of wine. No complaints from me. The service was excellent all the way through the hotel, from door man to reception, cleaners, bar staff etc everybody was friendly and extremely helpful. I couldn't have asked more. I struggle to think of any negatives. If pushed, we came back to the hotel at 10 one evening and ordered drinks for the roof terrace, but were told it was too late. A minor quibble, but the rest of the experience was pretty near perfect.

As a Leaders Club Access member I booked a standard room via Leading Hotels (269,64 Euro tax included, without breakfast). At time of booking it was the most expensive Leading Hotel of all four Leading Hotels in Barcelona for that night. I arrived at 1.30pm. One doorman and two bellboys were on duty but talking with each other. I had to carry the luggage about 10m from the street to the hotel entrance on my own (at the entrance a bellboy asked for help). At reception there was no room available, so I did eat a club sandwich in the meantime. One hour later room 520 was ready, I got the key at reception but no guidance to the room. The room was one of the smallest I stayed for a long time, the last on the corridor at the backside of the hotel with no sights. According to the floor plan the room was one of the smallest on the fifth floor. Beside of the definetely not given room upgrade there was no welcome card, no welcome gift or fruits in the room, what is unusual for Leaders Club members. The key fob was very big and heavy (400g?) and one had to unlock the electricity system. with this key. Very annoying: the air condition stops working when you leave and you return into a heated room (32 degrees Celsius that day!). The in the directory mentioned remote controlled lighting wasn\u00b4t available and not necessary because you nearly could reache everything in the room without leaving the bed. There also were two small cupboard of maybe 40cm and a maximum length of one meter, no chance to hang trousers or to store a bit mor than three suits. The plastic hangers were fixed like in four star hotels. Beside two notepads there was no paper or envelopes available and any clock was missing, too (not even in the TV or telephone display). The bathroom was of good size, but without seperate shower stall what is unusual for newer Leading Hotels. When the bellboy with the luggage arrived I complained about the misssing clock (I don\u00b4t have one on my own and forgot my mobile phone), the small room and asked if there are no welcome amenities which are part of the Leaders Club programm. 20 minutes later a bottle of Cava with choclates was brought to the room (without any card but verv nice arranged) the clock was announced to be delivered. After five hours I asked for the clock. The new receptionist didn\u00b4t know about this request and told me that they could buy one for me by charging the costs to my room! Finally they delivered an alarm clock free of charge. Turn down was done correctly with a free bottle of mineral water, shoe shine wasn\u00b4t done overnight, a paper was not given in the morning either. A concierge is missing. All request have to be made at reception which makes you feel uncomfortable because other guests have to wait when they want to check in or to collect the room keys (due to the size and weight most guest leave the keys at reception). All in all not a dramatic stay but not what you normally expect when staying at a Leading Hotel (...\"luxury sets them apart - Leading Hotels brings them together\"). Everything but the rate was mediocre and cannot satisfy guests who often stay in upscaled properties - and pay 400 USD a year for a Leaders Club Access Membership with lots of promissed advantages. So I rate this hotel with two Tripadvisor-stars: \"Okay, but some problems.\"", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin, ireland", "Title": "\u201cclassy hotel\u201d", "Author": "pips28", "ReviewID": "UR8736895", "Content": "Classy hotel, in a classy part of barcelona, near to all the sights, a bit of a walk to las ramblas so a bit further away from the party scene. very helpful staff, rooms very tastefully decorated with nice bathrooms. turn down service and a pillow menu! some of the rooms do differ considerably in size though, maybe ask for a larger room,, also the rooftop pool is only really aplunge pool but the rooftop is lovley to sit out and have a few relaxing drinks. breakfast very expensive!", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Casa Fuster Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d489057-Reviews-Casa_Fuster_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$251 - $456*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Passeig de Gracia 132</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "489057", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3a/cc/3accdcb7f561d3d90c80833015ef6d437large.jpg"}}
