Uggh. Our original hotel was located in the very convenient and desireable Sultanhamet area of Istanbul, and they let us know just a few days prior to our departure that our new hotel, the Amethyst, would be over two miles away from the historic sights of Sultanhamet. I have no complaints about the Amethyst, though it's a different story for Virgin Vacations! The hotel itself is lovely...clean and modern, with a friendly and efficient staff. I especially recommend the hammam and gorgeous grotto-like swimming pool. I'm a huge fan of Turkish massages, and had two unforgettable ones by a masseuse named Vienna. I highly recommend her, even if you aren't staying at the Amethyst! The downside of the Amethyst is that it's located in a down-scale commercial area, with few restaurants nearby and no tourist sights for miles. Unfortunately, we did not feel especially safe walking in this area at night, even from the nearby Aksary tram station. Be prepared to take a taxi at US$10-$30 per ride into the historic Sultanhamet area of town. Again, I loved the Amethyst...if only it could be dropped into a different neighborhood.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cComfortably 4 star\u201d", "Author": "artyone1", "ReviewID": "UR118963309", "Content": "Having stayed in a supposed 4 start in Turkey before, and having to book this hotel last minute, I wasn't expecting much. How pleasantly wrong I was. The Amethyst is a really comfortable, well equipped hotel just 10 minutes walk from the Grand Bazaar,and maybe a further 15 mins to the Blue Mosque and other main sites in Sultanahmed. A very good and cheap tram line is just 2 minutes away in Aksaray, so again a well placed hotel. It's a quiet hotel, just off a main road, but right in the hearty of the hustle and bustle of street life in Istanbul, with its street traders, shops, cafes and restaurants. The reception staff speak good English and are ever helpful. There is also free wifi. For breakfast there is a very decent set of choices and we didn't have to wait during any of the 4 mornings we stayed. I would deifnitely stay there again on a return trip to this truly unforgettable city. The only downside is the poor exchange rate at reception. This is not a probem since you can shop for money elsewhere,but be aware that if you haven't paid in advance you will proabbly be paying in the local currency.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLoved our stay at Ameythyst Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ranaimad", "ReviewID": "UR113283230", "Content": "Were a family of four (two adults and two children), and we were given a beautiful family room, which it exceeded our expectations.

We arrived at midnight only to be told that our booking not confirmed and that we should find another hotel! Not a great start! The hotel reservation staff did not inform us that the rooms are not available until we arrived at their doorstep! However, the manager and all other members of the staff were very courteous and helpful, and they somehow managed to give us a room. They were also extremely apologetic and even offered us tea/coffe while the room was being prepared for us. The front desk staff was very friendly, warm and helpful. In particular, the man at the reception called Mehmet who went out of his way to help us with anything we needed. The hotel is in a very good location and is only 10 mins away from the main attractions. When we checked out at 3 am, the staff packed breakfast for me and my wife for our onward journey even though our package did not include breakfast. There may be many other similar hotels in town, but whats makes Amethyst special is the friendly and helpful staff.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Amethyst Hotel Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2100663-Reviews-Amethyst_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$131 - $280*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mesihpasa Mah., Aksaray Cad., No: 6</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Laleli, Fatih</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2100663", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e0/4a/9a/amethtyst-hotel.jpg"}}
