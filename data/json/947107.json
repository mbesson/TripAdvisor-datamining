This hotel is situated just off Kurfurstendamm, one of the main roads into the city centre. It is approximately a 30 minute walk to Berlin Zoo and 10 minutes to the nearest Metro Station (Adenaureplatz, Line U7). The Europa City is a typical European style establishment, offering fairly basic facilities. However the staff are affable and obliging, conversing in good English. The rooms have particularly high ceilings and are relatively spacious with comfortable beds and decent bathrooms. Furnishings are of a respectable standard. Breakfast is ok with three hot choices that partially rotate every morning, as well as rolls, bread, meats, cheeses and various yogurts and fruits. It is well insulated and quiet at night. There is a lift but it has a small capacity and is rather claustrophobic. Overall if you require a fairly central base with good access to the public transportation system this will tick the boxes.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lampertheim, Germany", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "marmitchy", "ReviewID": "UR122529125", "Content": "We liked this hotel very much. It was very clean, plenty of space to move around, big wardrobe, comfortable bed, free wii-fi with fast connections, location is between 2 ubahn and a bus stop right in front of the hotel. The front desk people were all nice and are very willing to help their guests most of the time. Breakfast was plenty with hot and cold meat selections. We stayed at the hotel during new years eve and they place bottles of wine in the room which was a lovely gesture. Restaurants are plenty around the area. The shopping center K'damm is about 4 minutes on foot. The area is not crowded, quiet at night. The bathroom is adequately sized no toiletries though, but has hair dryer, shaving mirror.

Go to the Gemaldegalerie Art Gallery after u-bahn to Potsdamer Platz station (15 mins walk) 2800 paintings of world top artists. 13 - 18 century.

Plan well ahead. Best months for weather April and May. Europa Hotel needs some upgrading no lounge or bar but just as others say totally adequate as you don't spend much time in the hotel. Breakfast is the normal self service buffet and ok. Just watch for booked in student groups. 40 Italians who were no problem and kept to themselves quietly. BUT 30 German youths/ young men with a few girls came in Friday night at 10.50. Banging and crashing into doors, bursting into rooms and screaming and shouting. Went on to 3.30 a/m Police called twice but never turned up. Night Porter could not control them as they were spread in 10 rooms on three floors. Just the usual drunks - think it clever. Do not let this put you off from booking this hotel. Location is superb. For all days meals - I just had evening meals. Go for 20 min walk to Meinekestrasse 4 for Gasthaus Krombach. German cooking. Berliner Specialties. Friendly waiters. Superb food Huge portions and real value and not expensive. Green lighted name in the window. Very busy Friday evenings.

A decent, clean hotel in general with a spacious room and bathroom. There is nothing extravagant but for someone who wants a nice shower in the morning followed by a good breakfast before you go to work (or site seeing) and a clean bed for a good sleep at night, this is a hotel that 'does what it says on the tin' and at a very good value for money. WiFi in the rooms does not work but the hotel people may go out of their way to help if you are at the lobby. One night I had to work till 2 o'clock in the morning and the kept their breakfast room lights on for me, offered me several times (free) coffee and generally were very helpful. The receptionists were not always smiling (which may be cultural) but were very very efficient and helpful. I was impressed with their taxi system. When a guest asks for a taxi they press a button and the taxi is there in less than 3 minutes! Breakfast is rich and with a good choice. The hotel is well located between two underground stations (different lines) giving you some good alternatives to travel around the city. I was surprised with comments read here about the location. The hotel is located only a few hundred meters away from the Mecca of shopaholics: the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, known locally as the Ku'damm, one of the most famous avenues in Berlin with all the fashion designer shops that one can imagine. Final point, the elevator can become quite tricky especially in the rush hour of the morning 08.30-09.00. It is small and very slow and if people are leaving all together you may have to wait for quite some time for it. Bottomline: If you want to spend a few days in a decent hotel near the centre of Berlin at a very reasonable cost and you are not asking for glamour, this is the one for you!", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rehovot, Israel", "Title": "\u201cnice stay but not in a very interesting area\u201d", "Author": "nogag", "ReviewID": "UR76951296", "Content": "The room was very nice, clean and roomy, and clearly was renewed lately. it has no fridge and no safety-deposit box and that was frustrating.
