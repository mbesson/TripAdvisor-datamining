About 15-20mins. On arrival we were offered a choice of room sizes and we were given a room on the 7th floor over looking the main street and square which was nice. The room itself had a huge bed, tv, safe, minibar, bath/shower and usual bathroom kit and a small balcony. We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel itself is quite dark and moody which I love, the bar was nice and modern in the main downstairs area but please be aware that to order drinks you have to ask at reception for the waiter - I don't know where he is when he doesn't stay at the bar. Drinks are very well priced compared to in town centre. The rooftop pool is lovely...to look at!! We went to go for a swim but it was freezing so couldn't get in the whole 4 days. I can only imagine in the summer time it is just so relaxing to be in it over looking the square. Location was brill - across the road in front of the towers was the underground and was so easy to use. The stop for the tour buses is also close to here - the tour bus is the best way to get around everywhere and can hop on and off. There is a shopping centre directly beside the hotel which is very handy. To top the whole trip off, my husband to be proposed on the balcony of the hotel!!! he tried at other times through the trip to no avail : ) Note: do not eat at the chinese buffett (come out the front door and turning right) we both got food poisoning as food wasn't even warm never mind hot.

A fabulous boutique hotel, located next to a big mall with a metro station, and about 15-20mins walk from the rail station. Room was spacious, and it was very nicely and neatly designed. There was a little balcony that overlooks the street. Bed was huge and comfortable, the tv is quite small though, but wifi connection was smooth and fuss-free. Bathroom is clean and big. There is a pool at the roof, overlooking the entire area, looks very inviting, but it was winter, too cold for a dip! The hotel is in close proximity to many attractions like National Palace of Barcelona, and as we love exploring on foot, we walked to the Port Vell, Barceloneta beach from B-Hotel. That took us probably about 30-40 mins of strolling.. There was also a decent chinese restaurant located about 8-10 mins walk away from the hotel. The mall has a huge supermarket that can fulfill all your needs if you run out of supplies. Overall a very comfortable and pleasant stay in a fabulous location!

The room was beautiful and modern with an incredibly comfortable and spacious bed, that was clean and surpassed all expectations, especially the bath! The staff were immensely welcoming and friendly, coping well with our broken spanish and strong english accents. And as for the breakfast, that was lovely, clean and all fresh, with a huge variety - we only had the breakfast for one morning, but did not struggle to find other eateries around the area. Unfortunately we visited in February so there were no pool visits for us, however despite the pool being small, the view and whole terrace was stunning, being on the roof we could see a lot of the city, as well as the mountains, and i imagine this would be bliss in the summer. Oh, and visit the Hard Rock Cafe! This was our first experience of the HRC's and it was brilliant, a pleasingly priced menu, once your food has arrived - the best meal i have ever eaten!

As you can see from my attached photo, the mirror was cracked in our room, which is actually the door to the bathroom. I think this was a basic design fault as the door was a sliding door and slammed easily. Also, we had an internal room, which just had a view of other rooms and the courtyard. However, I thought the hotel was fantastic. I really don't understand how people can complain about the location, the hotel is at Plaza Espanya which is a good 20-25 min walk to the Rambla but a 6 minute metro journey. But it is very close to Montjuic as well. The hotel itself was immaculately clean and on our first day we noticed an out of place and broke tile which was fixed by the next day (without even reporting it). I read in previous reviews that the the bathroom window overlooking the room was inconvenient, well, there is a very effective electronic blind and besides that, it is pretty entertaining! The roof terrace and pool was the absolute icing on the cake and whilst it is overlooked by the shopping centre now occupying the bullring, it still offers amazing views and I imagine would be great for mid afternoon dips in the hot Barca summers.

The bar area to the right is another matter. You have to go to reception and they call the bar man from upstairs, who is also responsible for room service, the conference rooms and other duties. We regularly waited 15 mins for the barman to come to the bar. He would then serve us one drink and disappear and we would wait again. Because we there on business, there was quite often 10-12 of us waiting for the barman, on many occasions we just gave up. The rooms were great, modern and quirky with flat screen TV,glass bathrooms looking into the bedroom and an innovative lighting system. breakfast was varied and very good. Room service was nothing short of appalling. I waited 45 mins to receive tepid tinned soup and a half cooked cheap microwave pizza that made me violently ill. This was all delivered of course by the Barman! I called room service and complained about the meal and left it outside my door and told them I was not going to pay. On checking out of the hotel they tried to bill me for the meal and said that room service had put a note on the system to say i had eaten the meal.

It was my first time in Barcelona, so I did a lot of research online.

Neddless to say that there are thousand good hotels in Barcelona, so do your research, but B Hotel was on top of my list. We were not disapointed, I can tell you. B Hotel is situated on situated opposite Plaza Espanya (which is almost the heart of the city), you have all the Metro lines within 2 minute walking (tip buy T-10, ten metro tickets, Metro is clean and safe) from where you can reach basically and place of interest in 10 minutes. To get to the hotel take a shutle bus from the airport terminal (I think it goes every 10 minutes, but check), its a nice 15 minutes drive, and it's the first stop, then you have to cross the street and walk 2 minutes towards the center and it will cost you 5 Euro, taxi will cost about 35 Euro. Hotel is located in a safe neubourhood, we walked at night, and it looked very safe. Hotel itself is a modern building. We were greated by a very friendly receptionist, who offered to tell us anything we wanted to know about his city, he took out a map, and showed us everything we wanted to know, and gave detailed instructions on getting there.

We stayed on 4th floor in one of the delux rooms which was on the main road. The room had a modern feel it and contemporary design. Very 'masculine' as my girlfriend described it. The rooms are large with a huge bed which i believe is a king size. On the top floor is the infinity pool with a lovely view of the La Plaza Espa\u00f1a de Barcelona. The room was perfect for us during our first stay. The only down side was the noise of the cars on the main road. But to be honest it didn't stop me from getting a good nights sleep. The hotel staff were always very polite and helpful. We would definitely stay again! Aside from the hotel being really good the location is perfect.The metro stop, Espanya is 1 minute walk from the hotel. 3/4 stops down takes you near Las Ramblas or you can walk 30 minutes. Also if you are planning to go to Montserrat the train leaves from here for 16 euro return. The magic fountain/olympic villiage is just up the road and there is also one of the biggest cinemas in Europe(some films in English) near Urgell which is 2 stops down. The metro system is well designed, very easy to navigate around and always on time!! With regards to restaurantes near the hotel we tried several of them. Our favourite was Pura Brasa which is next door. They do a variety of different types of food. I loved the steak, 20 inch ribs and the seared burger! Calamari was was also excellent.

We were in BCN to attend the Food and wine show, Barcelona Degusta. The hotel was ideally located opposite the main show hall (La Fira), which was perfect for us. We got on the Aerobus from the airport 5.30\u20ac and got off at the first stop, Placa Espanya. The hotel is two minutes (or three/four depending on the traffic!) from the bus stop. Check-in was smooth, we had been allocated an internal room on the 7th floor (no street view but less noise), as I had requested a peaceful room. We were happy with the room. The large window looks out over the roof tops and straight at the flats surrounding the hotel, we weren't fussed about the view anyway. Room has some funky lighting, that takes a while to figure out, but we got the hang of it. The bed was big and comfy and the room was clean. The bathroom was also clean, shame the marble has such staining, but it's unavoidable. The bath is slippery, would benefit from a slip mat or something similar. There is a static shower screen, which can make for turning on the shower a tad of a stretch, and its unfortunate that water has seeped in between the two panes of glass, again a design fault. All in all though the room and bathroom were clean and comfy, perfect for what we needed. We slept well, and even though the room was off the street and 7 floors up, you could still hear and feel the rumble of the metro as it passed under the hotel. This is not an oddity with BCN hotels located near to the metro, so again, this didn't bother us. The hotel has a lovely roof top terrace, and an infinity pool, both looking at the Placa Espanya and beyond, I should imagine it is quite a place to relax early evening in the summer. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, as we prefer to go to La Boqueria off Las Ramblas to have fresh fruit and smoothies. The reception staff were polite and on checkout offered to look after our bags for the day. We took them up on that and our bags were locked in a room off the main reception. Or flight wasn't until the evening so we actually returned to the hotel with (cough) a few extra bags and added them to the ones they were already holding, very useful. The hotel is a minute walk to the nearest metro, 3 stops and you are in Placa Cataluyna. It is also next door to a shopping centre, which was formally the bull fighting arena. On the roof top of this building are restaurants, affording the diner a great view of placa espanya and the palace. We watched the sunset with a glass of vino and some tapas, a great way to finish our trip. The bus back to the airport is just in front of this shopping centre, and we were at the airport within 10 mins, perfect.

Let me start by saying if I could give this hotel a 4.5 I would. We paid $145 a night and got good value for our money. The location of this hotel is fantastic. Less than 5 minutes from the Espanya station which will get you anywhere you want to go. It is also a 5 minute (7 euro) cab ride from Sants Station. The airport bus drops off just down the street, there is a shopping mall right next door and the Magic Fountain is a 5 minute walk away. The rooftop was a major factor in deciding to stay at this hotel and it did not disappoint. Amazing pool, amazing view and we never had a problem getting a lounger. The bar wasn't open, but you simply had to pick up a phone and call down and your drink would come up within minutes. We spent at least an hour up there every afternoon. The only slight drawbacks of the rooftop were the observation deck on top of the mall next door (felt like everyone was watching and taking pictures of us), and the fact that even though it was really hot out, the water was freezing! The room was great. The decor was very modern and minimalist which we loved and the bed was very comfortable. There was plenty of closest space. The only comments I would make on the room are: 1) The bathtub did not look very clean. The caulking in between the tub and the tile was a little dirty, and the glass partition had a strange film inside the glass which I am assuming is from the condensation. Fine for a shower, but if you want a bath it was a little sketchy. 2) The hairdryer was built in and the cord was too short which made it a little difficult to dry your hair. 3) The \"couch\" they had in the room was kind of pointless as it was very hard and uncomfortable. It was however a good place to store our suitcases. All in all we had a great time and really enjoyed this hotel.

I've been coming to Barcelona for years and have stayed all over the neighborhood, but a newish boutique hotel and some decent prices pushed me to try it. Lobby: it's got a few couches, a bar area (I never saw customers or a bartender), and a single computer for internet use. The lobby staff was helpful when needed, but otherwise somewhat absent (ie no bartender...ever...) Pool: awesome infinity pool on the roof, not heated (thus freezing even on a hot summer afternoon). You can arrange for a massage up there at reasonable prices (I never got around to this), or phone down and they send up a waiter for snacks and beers at the rooftop bar. Not enough chairs to go around, but I suppose this is a problem at hotel pools the world over. Pool towels could be acquired at reception, were large and of decent quality. Nicest part of the roof was going up there late at night, with the whole plaza lit up below you. Have a drink and enjoy the views...perfect. Room: I booked the standard room, which had a hard but comfortable king-size bed. Floor to ceiling glass windows look out on the Plaza, though they seem to be well-glazed and noise was not an issue (despite fairly heavy traffic 24/7). All the usual amenities were in place (safe, minibar, glass shower). The light switches were a bit complicated (yes, a light can be complicated to turn on) but gave the whole place a futuristic feel and a lot of fun to be in. Hotel wi-fi was s.l.o.w. and skype was blocked, which was just annoying. Overall a pretty decent hotel. If you're on vacation then the perfect base, away from the madness of the Ramblas, and within walking distance of great restaurants (don't eat anywhere touristy in the Plaza, please!

SERVICE: Generally good, but a couple of the ladies at the front desk need to go back to hospitality school. I never saw them smile in the 11 days I was there, and approaching them for assistance seemed like an imposition. NEIGHBOURHOOD: Lots of restaurants next door, many with outdoor seating.

Having stayed in Barcelona several times this hotel has a central location at a reasonable price via internet searches. The room was large and looks like it has had a make over recently. The make over is sadly where the issues start. Each room has a lighting system which is had to decode, resulting in the main lights being switched on to access the bedside lights rather than using them independently. After using the shower we noticed a large puddle in the bedroom dripping on to a cable from one of the bedside lights. Looking at where the drips where coming from we could see that the hotel had previously tried to tape the leak up rather than sealing the bathroom. Our real surprise happened at 5.15am when a huge crash woke us up. The crash happened to be the radiator in the bathroom falling off the wall bringing the electrical cables with it. The radiator had been glued to the wall rather than being screwed as any normal person would do. You could also see other marks where it had been previously glued but must had fallen off. I went straight to reception to report the incident and was advised that they would look at it tomorrow. The receptionist saw no issues with using the bathroom even though I showed him photos of the exposed electrical wires below the sink. I demanding another room so that we could use the bathroom without fear of electrocution. I said that I wanted to talk to the manager when we check out. When we checked out, no one on reception was aware of the incident and our messages had not been passed on. We were advised that we could not talk to the manager. We then left our bags to continue to enjoy the city and said that we wanted to talk to the manager upon our return. Upon returning, a new team on the front desk were unaware of our issues and again we could not talk to a manager. Eventually someone came out to inform us that 'these things happen and we should expect this type of thing!' Remarks which left us speechless.

However, this was not the case when we were there. I also have a hard time believing the staff acted the way he described. Everyone we came across on the staff was courteous and professional (If there was such a disastrous smell taking over a floor of a hotel, is it odd that only one guest complained?) With that out of the way......The B Hotel has more of a modern feel to it with minimalist features and decorations. Rooms/Bathrooms are a good size. Everything is pretty clean, but I did notice someone on our floor smoking as she walked in between rooms. You may want to double check if they have smoking rooms available. Had I known this up front, I would not have stayed here. I think this was just a dodgy person who had no idea she was in a non smoking hotel. Roofdeck pool definitely a nice feature. We stayed facing the back courtyard, which was great as we could not hear anything outside. However, we did hear alot of door shutting in the halls during the night and early in the morning which got on my nerves. The location was a bit further away from the old part of town, where inevitably everyone touring Barcelona will think they want to be. However, it's a pretty good spot when considering Barcelona as a whole given the access to the L1 and L3 (Red and Green) lines just a 2 minute walk away. The breakfast at the hotel is a disaster, so stay away. For coffee and a pastry (Cafe y pasta) go across the street to one of the little restaurants. It is cheap and good. I didn't really love the hotel, but would consider staying here again given the rate was good. Remember, you're in Barcelona. Find a hotel that is comfortable, clean and safe so you can sleep well. Other than that, who cares. Spend every second you have exploring the city. It is amazing.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cGreat peripheral location, quiet, big rooms, just don't stay on Floor 4 (service a bit lacking)!\u201d", "Author": "Dragon l", "ReviewID": "UR118466281", "Content": "Just in case you don't read further, I'm going to put my biggest caveat up front and then follow with many more positive things. The 4th floor is a disaster. At first, it had no electricity. Yet, they refused to change our room. \"We'll fix it.\" They did. Ok, I'm happy. Then, the room started getting REALLY stinky... we thought it was a spray the maid was using. Until, the next day at 1am, we came home and it had clarified into full sewer feces scent, so overpowering my nose hairs felt singed. Would they switch our room? NO! \"Open the window,\" he said. So I made him come to the room to smell it. \"That's a city smell,\" he says. Around the world, including India etc., never have I stewed in such a pungent fecal smell. After an hour of heated demands, we were moved for one night (by now it was 3am) to a hotel across the city (and I had to fight to get them to pay for it) until a new room could be made up the next day. I was exhuasted and FURIOUS. Why not just take care of the problem immediately instead of arguing for an hour and telling me to open a window to sleep? That room was pure toxin and I was extremely concerned for my health. That being said, one very very bad and infuriating evening did not overcome my overall happiness with the hotel. It was worn around the edges -- lots of mold in the shower, shower sprayed everywhere, the tiny piece of soap they gave would last about 5 minutes (forewarning to bring your own), lobby smells like cigar smoke, furniture/rugs worn, and the rooms and hallways are VERY DARK. The hallways being dark seems to be common everywhere in Europe, so I wasn't concerned. However, I had no idea what I looked like for 5 days because I couldn't see a thing in our bathroom. However, the rooms are BIG for Europe and so was the bathroom, even with the standard room. You have lots of buttons by the bed to turn on all sets of lights and everything was designed to be really cool (albeit quite nonfunctional). There are blinders between the bathroom and the bed, which is divided by glass, so you do have to be quite comfortable with your roommate because there isn't total privacy, even with the blinders shut. This also sucks if your roommate had to get up in the middle of the night because the light will wake you up, even with blinders shut. The hotel itself, once you are in your room, was silent and that was wonderful. In the hallway, you could hear every sound in every room, but somehow that big door shut it all out. The rooftop pool was fun to go to -- it's small and shallow, but I loved it. A late afternoon cocktail and a nap on the sofa at the pool and life was good. Just know that the pool is quite a spectacle from the roof of the mall next door and there will be dozens of people at the mall watching you in your swimwear. There is a restaurant directly across the alley (not the Tapas place though) that was really good, but everything nearby shuts down at midnight. So this isn't the location for a night owl. But the rooftop pool is open til midnight and it's really nice to catch one last nightcap up there. The bottom floor of the mall next door (which used to be a bull fighting arena and still looks like one!) has a grocery and lots of restaurants and you have everything at your fingertips, including the subway connected to it. It's about a 15-20 minute walk over to Las ramblas, or a hot 10 minute subway ride. About 8-10 Euro for a cab from the Ramblas area or Harbor. Also nearby is the magic fountain of Montjuic, an easy walk and must-see when the light show is happening one night. You could also watch from the mall roof, but would miss the music. Being farther from Ramblas was a double-edged sword - I like the peace and quiet, but every day had to schlep back and forth in the subway or a cab to all the fun areas. Overall, I have it a 4-star even with all my problems listed above because in comparison to all the other hotels we stayed at in 3 countries and in Barcelona, it was the quietest, most comfortable (but for the smell of fecal sewage on Floor 4), spacious place we found on our trip, particularly compared to the other prices in Barc. I'd stay there again... just not on the floor with the noxious odor.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel and great value!\u201d", "Author": "EuroUSA1960", "ReviewID": "UR118325920", "Content": "We stayed at the B-Hotel for four nights this past August and all three couples were very impressed with the rooms, locations and helpful staff.

Based entirely on the reviews on Tripadvisor I booked this one and we were all very pleased we did. Having followed the advice of another reviewer, we took the number 1 bus from the airport at a bargain 1.46 Euro each, got off at the Plaza de Espanya (it shows the next stop on a scrolling display in the bus and look out for the two massive columns in the square - you can't miss them). The hotel is clean and welcoming and, since we were early, would have allowed us to dump our bags and go off for the day. Fortunately, one of our three rooms was ready so we dropped all the luggage and wondered what we'd do next. We are the world's worst sightseers and everyone had told us that Barcelona was a city for sightseeing so we knew we had to do something. I asked at reception what they suggested we do. We were tired as we had had a 3am start so really didn't want to amble along pretending we were enjoying ourselves. They suggested the open top tour bus. I initially thought 'how touristy' but, once I had got over the fact that that was exactly what we were, we went for it. One of the stops was right across the square, you could hop on and off whenever you liked. It was about 100 Euros for all of us but suited us well. We saw all we knew we needed to see in Barcelona (although the blue section of the route at the north was a little tedious, but needed to be done to see Gaudi's cathedral which is a must). The pool was very welcome at the end of the day and was a great experience. We ate out that night at a restaurant just up from the hotel. It wasn't particularly Spanish but very good food and by now we wanted something close and easy. We did previously take a wander to find a cheap and cheerful restaurant but I cannot face the ones that have a photograph of the food outside as they are one step too far in the wrong direction. Fabulous night's sleep but, boy, Barcelona is a happening place as the traffic was busy all night. Not enough to keep me awake but I did hear it occasionally. With reference to other comments here on Tripadvisor: 1) Yes, we did have to get the children to show us how the lights work. 2) The breakfast for us was included as I had booked so far in advance. It was perfectly good and, if you're on a tight budget maybe going out and finding a croissant and a coffee elsewhere is your thing. Personally, I like to just go downstairs to have breakfast and pay the extra 7 Euros! The staff were delightful and always full of advice and interested in your wellbeing. All in all, a great start to our holiday and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. My wife's sister's family (who were joining us for the cruise) stayed in a hotel in Las Ramblas.

The hotel has a great location. There's a cool-looking shopping mall right beside the hotel and several big attractions are in the area as well.

They actually provide you with a user manual to operate the lighting, and the blinds in the bathroom. The blinds are needed to block the view from the main room to the bathroom. There is no ironing possibilities. The hair dryer is difficult to use because of the design (the length of the cord). Free wireless internet is a huge plus, as is the safe in each room. The breakfast is very good, and open until 1100. The air condition is quite silent, and very effective. Sound proofing is not excellent, but I have experienced worse. The road workers outside did wake me up every morning, though. The best thing about the hotel is the semi-infinity pool on the roof. To shallow to swim properly in, but excellent for relaxation. There is a small bar there as well, but avoid the pre-mixed Mojito. The pool (and bar) closes at midnight. A nice place to stay if you are attending a conference or an exhibition close by.

From the airport to Plaza Espanya we took the regular bus 46 (eur1.45 pp) wich has Plaza Espanya as the final destination...so nobody can go wrong here! You can also take the Aero-Bus, for eur5.30 pp it will take you there also (will save you about 10-15min). Final destination of this bus is Plaza Catalunya. If you arrive early at BCN Airport, you can buy a T10 ticket at the Tabacco shop or at the entrance of the trainstation (Renfe). This T10 ticket (wich you can use with more people) costs eur8.25 for 10x trips with metro or bus. Please note...T10 not valid on the Aero-Bus only for regular buses. Its a great and cheap way for exploring Barcelona...and so easy! Location from B-hotel worked perfect for us. Next to Las Arenas shopping mall. On the groundfloor of this mall you can find several breakfast/coffee places. We loved the bakery called \"Enriche\", good coffee and fantastic croissants and sandwiches. We didn't take the breakfast in the hotel (eur14). Please note...if you arrive at the hotel you can get a eur5 pp discount for breakfast..but ONLY when you arrange this at check-in!! Small children will pay half the price from the adults. Several restaurants close to the hotel (we liked Tapa Tapa) and with the metro you are 3 stops away from Plaza Catalunya&Ramblas area. The big bonus is the swimmingpool! It's great to jump in a pool after a long day of sightseeing in the busy and hot city. It was also nice to have a drink there with some nibbles, before going to dinner. The Negatives: Its difficult to get in the (deep) bath (very high step) and I can imagine that this would be a problem for older people or anyone who has physical problems. As the shower is also in the bath, this could be a problem too. It was not possible to leave a small bed lamp turned on during the night...its all on or all off. So, we had to leave the bathroom light on during the night...no big deal. No rooms available in this hotel for a family of four people! The maximum in one room is 3people.

Eventually they agreed to give us a double room which was immediately available so was this just homophobic behaviour? I can cope with homophobic behaviour having had to for most of my life, however, we booked into a hotel that is showing on a Barcelona website as 'gay-friendly'!!!

Very close in proximity to Espanya station and the new shopping mall. Go to the top of the mall and you can see your friends at the hotel sitting by the rooftop pool! I'd say the pool is a tad bit small though but nevertheless, view is wonderful. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't have complimentary water bottles or shower caps. Safe deposit box was easy to operate but beware of the \"battery low\" sign. The bathroom and bedroom are separated by a sheet of glass but they have a blind that can be operated in the bathroom only. Great idea!!

The room was absolutely enormous with a very comfortable king size bed. The hotel is very modern and everything looked very new. The only issue we had was with the bath - it leaked water all over the floor everytime we showered so had to get new towels each day. It was also a bit noisy in the room because we were overlooking Place Espanya but didn't bother us too much. However if you're looking for a quiet room this might not be the place for you. The terrace and pool on the roof is really great and we found ourselves wishing it would warm up so we could swim. There is also a bar on the roof where you can order beers. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel so I'm not sure whether it was any good. Checkout time is only 12pm so if (like us) you're not early risers, this is a definite plus. And we could leave our bags at the hotel once we'd checked out so were able to enjoy our last day in Barcelona. The hotel is not located right in the center of Barcelona but we preferred it that way.

I found the room a bit too \"modern\" for my liking, as it was quite dark and the key and lighting system was a bit fiddly but it was clean with a really comfortable bed. The main downside of the hotel is it's location, as it is a way from the centre of the city. We did walk to Plaza de Catanlunya/Las Ramblas a couple of times. It was a good 30mins walk which is fine, but as the city isn't that compact it meant we ended up doing loads more walking on top of that. Having said that the hotel is right by a metro so it's easy to get around the city that way and I think staying near Las Ramblas is over-rated. But I would definitely recommend getting a T-10 ticket and using the metro if staying in this hotel! We didn't bother with the breakfast because the prices were so high (14 euros per person per day!) but found a good cafe (Bens) over the road.

The bed was really comfy and quiet - I heard no outside traffic and no noise for other rooms or corridors. The only little thing I would make a comment about was the lack of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner - due to the restrictions on airlines these days it makes it easier not to take your own for a 3 day break. Also, I think an ipod dock or something wouldn't have gone a miss. For a trendy hotel like this I think its a nice little touch instead of just a TV.

Came across this hotel randomly through Expedia as I was booking a last minute city break to Barcelona! I've never been before. I quickly checked Trip Advisor and all the reviews were great, and then checked the B Hotel website - where I discovered it was actually cheaper to book through their own website than Expedia! We got a 98euros a night rate, so for 3 nights came to \u00a380 a night. The hotel is in a great location, just off Plaza Espanya. The metro is right across the street, from which you can get anywhere in the city! You can also easily walk to the main tourist areas, like Las Ramblas, in about 20 minutes along Gran Via de Le Corts Catalanes. If you want to explore Mont Juic and the Olympic Stadium, you just walk right out the hotel and across the Plaza, it's only 5 mins walk away. The 'Aerobus' to and from the Airport stop right on Plaza Espanya across the plaza. Also the open top tour buses pick up and stop again just across the Plaza. The hotel itself is exceptionally clean, modern, and tidy. The hotel staff speak perfect English and are extremely helpful and kind. We seemed to be upgraded to their 'Executive' rooms on the 7th Floor. The room was large, air-conditioned, with a balcony, mini-bar, TV and ensuite bathroom. We were in a regular B-Room as opposed to a B-Corner Room. Although the Plaza is busy with traffic, the rooms are practically sound proof. Light sleepers need not worry! The roof pool is fantastic, with views right out across the city. They give you towels in recepion. And there's also a bar, where you can order any food or drink, cocktails, pizzas etc. There is also a bar in the foyer, and a breakfast room on the first floor - although we didn't opt to have breakfast here. On a side note - I'd hugely recommend the restaurant Cervecer\u00eda Catalana on C/ Mallorca, 236. It's a 10 minute metro ride away. We had this recommended, and loved it so much we went there 2 nights out of the 3 we stayed in Barca. Read the reviews on this site to find out why. Amazing tapas, bafflingly cheap, brilliant atmosphere. Exactly everything you'd want in an authentic Spanish tapas restaurant. You can't book, but we never waited more than 30 mins for a table - And it's lovely standing out in the street with a glass of wine whilst you wait :) Anyway - I'm really impressed with the rate we got on this hotel - i've stayed in much lower quality hotels and paid a lot more for them.

The rooftop lounge/pool area was great, although more loungers were needed. The lobby looked worn, and has a computer for internet access, but no printer. My only complaint is the noise. My room was on the second floor on the Grand Via side, and street noise could be heard all night long, from the cars coming out of the tunnel passing under the plaza and on the side streets, and when those were quiet for a while people could still be heard sometimes on the street. It's supposed to be soundproofed and check-in said it nosie wasn't a problem, but I have to disagree. I'm a fairly light sleeper to begin with and barely slept all night even after a sleeping pill.

The lighting controls are a little complicated, but that's the only issue we had in this very nice hotel.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGoing back to Barcelona this would B the place\u201d", "Author": "Sylvie-chouchoune", "ReviewID": "UR67179927", "Content": "We wanted to be there for 7 nigths, unfortunately for us they only have 5 nigths, we LOVED this hotel, an amazing staffs, who provided us with card of the city, explain to us everything we needed to know, the lady ( front desk) book for us a Flamenco show that we really liked, always as we were leaving or coming back were greeting us, we always feel that we were welcome back.....We love the space in the room with the view of the Plaza Espagne in was good because we could open the door , we did not feel trap.....the bathroom is amazing, but surprise when I see the privacy, because on some reviews peoples were complaining about that, and you have the windows that close and 2 doors, how much privacy does people wants. It is across the street of the Metro, and very good system in Spain, a police station in front, lots of restaurant near and always 3 to 4 stop of metro to everythings you have to see in Barcelona.The pool view is amazing, and every morning we have seen a man cleaning the pool, so a great roof to be to relax before or after a day.....My husband and I have buy on La Rambla 2 paintings that we loved as a souvenir of our trip, we had plan a wall in the house that we put pictures an souvenirs on it. My husband forgot the pictures....What an amazing, again services did we received from all of the peoples at the B- Hotel, sending e-mail, because in Canada the were charging us 190.00$ to pick up the pictures an bring in back to us, again with the help of the staffs the bubble our pictures put it in a box an mail it to us for 14.00$.

We arrived around 11pm from the airport and it was hardly welcoming when we stepped out of the taxi, the area was dark and the entrance to the hotel was sort of hidden but once we stepped inside, it was a very nice first impression. Snazzy and modern ableit a bit small and compact.. nice. Next day, pleasant surprise, the area looked clean, safe and sound to walk into town. There were some works going in the building next door but we havent heard much noise going on. Free Internet on the lounge and business/dining area. We didnt have breakfast as we opted for inexpensive basic breakfasts (coffee or orange juice plus croissants) in the surrounding area. There was a modern funky rooftop swimming pool which we did not have the time to use. Reception service was good and helpful especially when our luggage was a day late. While our room was modern and clean, the computerised buttons for lights, dimmers, blinds did take a bit of trail and error to work out (there was a brochure on how to use them but who on holidays is going to sit down and read thru!) so by the time we learnt to use them all, we were on our last day! We caught the airport bus from the bus stop about a few minutes walk from the hotel on the roundabout just adjacent to the hotel, very convenient. Also we used the HOHO bus from the same roundabout. We caught the train to Monserrat from the Metro at Espanya. i would definitely go back to this hotel again, provided they keep the competitive room rate we had.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barnehurst,Kent", "Title": "\u201cB-Hotel, Barcelona Baby!\u201d", "Author": "darrencotta", "ReviewID": "UR66857097", "Content": "My partner and me booked this hotel online in Feb 2010 after looking at many over the course of a few days as it came across as quite modern and pretty reasonable. It's quite confusing at first as there doesn't appear to be a door to enter until the big wooden lump of wood slides open and in you go. Checking in was quite painless, they take your passport and ask for a copy of your Visa/Master Card in case you run a bill up during your stay which is all pretty standard stuff. The people on the front desk are very helpful and polite, they will recommend things to you if you require. Like most cities we found quite early on its always best to go where the locals go, avoid the tourist traps and that will save you quite a few euros...we found some great resturants and bars in back streets which were amazing quality along with the price. If you decide have a beer in the more popular parts of Barcelona you can expect to pay \u00a310 for two pints of lager...find a locals bar and you can get bottled beer for under \u00a32 a bottle. Right back to the Hotel review, the rooftop has a bar and swimming pool along with a great view of Playa del Espanya...the pool is great for a dip in the summer but forget swimming in it. The lighting in the room takes a lot of getting used to but is quite fun to mess around with. The shower has a window blind which you can control for privacy, towels can be changed as much as you want. The room also contains a minibar which we found very expensive. There is a shop across the road that sells beers/wine etc for a decent price and you can bring that back to the room if required. There is WI-FI in the room which my laptop picked up quite easily which was very handy for checking out resturants/bars and things to do in Barca before you set off. The hotel is situated 3 mins walk to the nearest Metro (Espanya) therefore making everything very accessable, also you can pick up the Aero Bus close by which will take you directly to the Airport.

The location at first seemed to be out of the way, however we very quickly learned that we were just a block away from the metro tunnels. Also we were two blocks away from the double decked tour bus, which took us all over the city. I will be sure to write another review about this bus, I promise. Back to the room. This is an green hotel. So it is encouraged to use your towels for a couple days, if your green like us. This saves water. Also, as you walk down the halls, the lights basically follow you, and become dim as you pass. In the room, you can not leave your lights on because it takes your key card to actually turn them on. As you leave with your key card, things go dim. One night we ordered room service. This is a first for me, but the bill was actually the price of the food. There was no 'delivery fee' or gratuity added. So it is upon you to tip the server. Which of course we did, but it was just a shock to me not to see a hidden charge. Typical European hotels have two double beds. Our first night, we had this. As far as I am concerned, this is a no no when vacationing with you honey. So, we asked for a different room. To my wondering eyes, the beds actually zipped together. A key to sleeping though, the decorative bed spread is not comfortable at all. So find the extra blankets in the closet, they are nice and soft. Do not miss the rooftop pool / deck. There is an edgeless pool that over looks the central fountain of the nearby intersection. It just takes moments to be relaxed from the exploration of the day. There are plenty of tables and chairs so you can bring up a coffee and paper in the morning or bottle of wine for the evening. As mentioned the location is great. There are many sights if you turn right out of the front door, and if you turn left many shops, bakeries and restaurants. Which I will be writing about.

A couple of negatives is the shower...for some reason they only cover the tub/shower with half a plane of glass. When you take a shower at full blast, some water may spray onto the floor...not a major problem to deter you from staying at this hotel. Doors closing are pretty loud but if guests slowly close the doors, it's not much of a problem. Breakfast is very good - hot food, cold cuts, bread, yogurt, fresh juices, fruits and pastries. Good selection of food (as long as you're not picky) and great value if breakfast is included in the rate. Reception staff very friendly and helpful...they all speak decent English. Also have a roof-top pool and good view of Placa d'Espanya. Could easily walk to their National Museum (probably 10 minutes) and another 10 minutes will get you to the Olympic Park/Barcelona Stadium.

It was our first time in Barcelona and when booking the hotel I didn't really have any idea where we were staying (in terms of proximity to tourist attractions) and was swayed more by the price of the hotel and some of the other reviews on here. But I feel we struck gold! B-Hotel is in an excellent location. Some people claim it's too far from the hub of Barcelona, but that's nonsense - it's four stops on the metro from Placa d'Espanya (the metro / train station is just across the road from the hotel) to Placa de Catalunya. The hotel is also situated within walking distance of Montjuic. The reception area of the hotel is open and informal, with the bar to the right. Check-in was quick and easy, as was checking-out. Breakfast was offered to us at \u20ac10 each per day. I thought this was excessive and opted to eat out which was a lot cheaper. The room itself looks amazing - very stylish - but also comfortable. Both the bathroom and bedroom were spacious and clean. The room contained a safe and mini-bar. And yes the light switches did take a bit of getting used to, but we soon worked it out! The doors to the bathroom and toilet do not totally shut. There is a gap of around an inch and no locks on the doors. Not a problem for us, but some people may not like it. The bathroom contains (a very deep and slim) bath with a powerful shower. The shower was fantastic, but there is no shower curtain, just a wall of glass which wasn't sufficient enough to stop water from ending up on the bathroom floor. But this is a minor gripe which was easily dealt with a wipe of a towel. I should also point out that although the bathroom was very well lit, the toilet lighting was very poor. Why?! B-Hotel is a fabulous base that fits in perfectly with the ambience of Barcelona. I would stay here again, but if I could change one thing I would ask for an English speaking movie channel.

There's a supermarket just down the road which is very cheap so my advice to all is to get yourselves a few bottles of cheap cava (the rooms have fridges) and when you come back from a hard day's sightseeing, take your cava up onto the roof terrace and have a relaxing few hours whilst the sun goes down! Beware though, whilst the inifinity pool on the terrace is brilliant, it's also the coldest pool I've ever experienced! We ate tapas at the hotel a few evenings and it was delicious - they had a set tapas menu with a drink for 15 euros which we thought was very good value - there was plenty of it to feed two people.

You can also stroll up to the National Art Museum, which has beautiful views across the city -also another ideal stop to sit with a glass of cava and watch the world go by.

A piece of advice check out the switch for the WC first otherwise you will end up lighting up the whole room in the middle of the night. The TV was quite basic and had poor reception of channels. The bathroom is like a designer has gone mad, some will love it and some will hate it. There is glass between the bath and the main room but with blinds which can be used to block the views. You will need to find the controls in the bathroom for the blinds - we did by accident. The shower was great but the main problem was that as the sides of the bath tilted slightly outwards all the shower water ended up on the floor and flooded our bathroom. Just use lots of towels. There is a mini bar and well stocked which was nice as was a safe. For evening meals we ate out and found a selection of local restaurants in the area but liked a pizzeria we found only 2 mins from the hotel on the corner and square of Carrier d'Entenca and Carrier de la Diputacio. Cant recall the name but the food was excellent and great tapas. I guess the main downside for the hotel is the in the evening you are not in the centre so either you take the Metro or you try to seek out those locally used cafes. The metro is just round the corner from the hotel so easy to go straight to the centre for three euros and takes about 5-8 mins or to walk takes 25 mins but is nice early in the morning then get the metro back. Oh and something which is not that well advertised is round the corner is a massive magic fountain sound and light show which is free and quite magical \"la font Magica\" in Placa de Carles Bulgas and worth seeing. There is a big new police station right opposite which is handy when you get something stolen. Just a word of caution Barcelona is renowned for pick pockets so only take money you intent on using that day and minimal cards. At the metro don't flash your cash whilst buying tickets at the machines or show where you are putting you wallet. They tend to observe this and then easy pickings on the metro when busy. Regards airport the Aerobus stops in Place d'Espania which is next to the hotel and on return the stop is on the other side of the square and for Easyjet UK, London flights it T2 bus you want as there are two identical buses one for T1 and one for T2. All in all can't fault the hotel.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boy in UK", "Title": "\u201cContemporary and Modern with a Beautiful Pool\u201d", "Author": "LeicBoy", "ReviewID": "UR37505767", "Content": "Me and my partner spent 3 nights at this hotel and we would definitely recommend the hotel.

All washed down with coffee and juices. A very good selection. The pool area on the roof was a very pleasant area, but those who do not like heights may find the infinity pool a bit daunting.

I liked the location a lot, despite the fact that it was a cab or subway ride away from most of the action -- you could walk into the more happening parts of the city during the day if you don't mind a walk -- but if you have plans or something the metro is the best bet -- Plaza Espanya is a two minute walk away. The roof deck was also beautiful. We spent a few hours lounging by the pool, drinking Cava and relaxing. It was really romantic. And a great view. It wasn't warm enough to go swimming when we were there, but I imagine it would be great in the middle of the summer. The room service wasn't great.

A large inviting bed draped in plush linens and fabrics. A plasma TV freestanding in the middle of the room facing the bed. Glass walls that wrapped around the room, curving slightly with the face of the building and looking over Plaza Espana. (oh my, the view of the plaza bathed in the orange-pink light of dawn!!!!

I had read other reviews and was not sure but the staff were brilliant. We had a conference over two days and stayed for four nights. The reception staff were always proactive, really concerned about our well-being and very enthusiastic. The rooms are very design-led. They look good but -- as usual in design hotels -- are not always practical. The large, heavy doors bang loudly; the furniture and the cleaners can scrape across the bare, laminate floors; voices echo around the minimalist corridors. Don't try sleeping during the day, even with earplugs. You have to ask for an iron (there seems to be a shortage because they always want to know when they can come and take it back) and the ironing board is one of those small, table-top types. There are no drawers for clothes (and only three small shelves) and they have those annoying hangers that slot into an odd holder. The bedding is really not pleasant. The cheap sheets are a bit too small for the thick mattresses. If you want more than sheets, the hotel only offer acrylic blankets. The ones in my room were stained and smelled of stale sweat. I went to the department store and bought my own. The food is very disappointing. The tapas menu is ok (but not great) -- other food is really mediocre. The fruit salad, for example, comes from a tin, complete with artificial cherries. Still, Barcelona is one of Europe's great restaurant cities so, just plan to eat out or buy food from the supermarket (100 metres away and open from 9am to 2am every day, including Sunday). The food may be bad but the staff who serve it are always willing to help. The rooftop pool is a lovely place to sit out (great views and a nice atmosphere) but not a great place to swim laps. The nearest gym is a 15 minute walk -- check the various opening times of different branches but the Dir chain provide excellent gyms for 12Euro a day or 25 a week. The hotel staff are very helpful at pinpinting which branches are closest. The conference room is nice with a terrace for smokers and natural light.

The hotel is less than 10 euro away (plus 1 euro charge for baggage) from the port. The value is pretty unbeatable for what we got, a stylish, very hip hotel right out of Wallpaper magazine. Extremely minimalist but with good use of materials. However, much of boutique design is looking very generic using the same zebrano woods and concrete and industrial materials, etc. This could be any cool hotel in the world - I didn't expect Gaudi, but would be nice to see some Spanish boutique influence. But I'm quibbling here, because the design is executed extremely well, especially for the price, we paid only 100 euro per night for a standard room. While the price is right, and the accommations are great, the staff (at least some of the staff obviously think cool surroundings mean a cool - non welcoming attitude) In a tiny hotel staff attitude is really important, because it's like a little home away from home. (which is why you don't book a big tour bus hotel) We ended up going to the nearby Plaza hotel across the road to book two tours and ask for advice because the staff were so much friendlier, even though the plaza is ironically a very busy tour bus kind of hotel. Maybe we were spoiled. When we arrived in Barcelona the airport employees were incredibly helpful and friendly and when we got lost getting to the B, some Barcelonians helped us out of the blue, so we were overwhelmed at how warm and friendly the Spaniards were. When we got to the B the front desk folk were, I must stress, not rude, but definitely not warm or welcoming - but really quite indifferent would be the attitude. Which is OK, but not a great way to welcome guests. We have stayed at many boutique hotels all over the world (including all of the Ian Schrager group in New York) and I understand getting good staff is always a problem, and we also realize this is not the Four Seasons with their level of training or pricing. We were just spoiled because the average Barcelonian was so friendly, that the chilly atmosphere of the B staff was a bit of a shock. Also, the security guard at night (or I think he was, he wore a jacket and tie) could learn to smile more - he doesn't have to say hello to guests or even acknowledge them - but you really felt you were intruding in his space in the lobby. The security guard at the Plaza, on the other hand was quick to show us how to use the public telephone when he saw us struggling with it. To be fair we only met four different front desk staff in our two days. The two women were helpful, but the guys needed a bit of a reality check, no one (guy or gal) said hello or acknowledged guests as they came in and out of the hotel, which I guess is standard procedure. The guests may also have an attitude so maybe that's a reason? Front desk staff also didn't seem to know much about tours, attractions, etc. We also asked for a quiet room because of the construction and were given the standard line that all rooms are quiet. This isn't true, you can hear sirens going up and down the street and motorcyles going to work at 6 am, where we were on the fourth floor facing the street. Also you are sandwiched between two major construction sites. I grew up in a major urban area, so this didn't bug me all that much, but because it was my vacation, I really was hoping to sleep in. Overall, I would likely go back to the B because of the decent location and the extremely good price, but ask for a quieter room. I would also continue to use the staff at the Plaza for my tour bookings, etc. so you get the best of both worlds. Use the B for your room, but use the staff at the nearby hotel for your other needs. On a plus note, management does seem to care a lot about continuous improvement and feedback, which bodes well for the hotel group. A well priced, well located hotel that could use an attitude adjustment. cheers", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cB Hotel was the B-est!!\u201d", "Author": "MickyPa", "ReviewID": "UR22543878", "Content": "We spent two nights at the B Hotel and we absolutely enjoyed our stay.

Wi-fi is free, fast and reliable (and as a bonus works on the roof terrace which is stunning!). The buffet breakfast was absolutely excellent with a wide selection and staff that kept the food topped up, cleared/reset tables and actually seemed to take pride in their job.

Although it is slightly out of the city centre we found it a great location. It is easily accessible from the airport by the airport bus right outside the terminal. They will drop you at Plac Espanya and the hotel is right there. When you want to head into the city centre there is a metro station just across the road from the hotel. We found this the easiest way to get around and were in the city centre within 10 minutes of leaving the hotel. Within 10 minutes walk of the hotel is the hill of Montjuc and the Font Magic which are worth a look on weekend evenings when the fountains are set to music. Also next to this is Mies Van Der Rohe's Barcelona Pavillion, a mecca for architecture buffs. We carried on walking up the hill, helped by a series of very welcome outdoor escalators and after a half hours stroll with some beautifull views of the city, we were at the Joan Miro Museum. Carry on from here and you can get the Fununcular railway back to the metro system. We found the staff really helpfull and friendly. Breakfast very good with a great selection which definitely set us up for a day of sightseeing (sausage, bacon, eggs, tortilla, cereal, toast, croisants, pastries, fruit, tea, coffee, juices, cold meats, bread, cheese, tomato, boiled egg, etc.). General design of the hotel is cool and modern. It was clean and well maintained. Slightly form over function in some things but fun anyway. The rooms are pretty big and well laid out. Much bigger than you would get in some 3 stars. I'm guessing there are certain criteria you need to fulfill to get a higher star rating because this is way better than some 3 stars I have stayed in. Maybe the fact that they don't have a full restaurant hold it back. We booked through last minute and it didn't say whether they were twin or double beds on the booking. My wife added in the comments that we would like a double and they had a record of the comment at reception when we arrived. We were told we had been given a 'Matrimonial' bed. I don't know if this is the normal double size for this hotel but it was massive. The glass divider between bedroom and shower was an interesting concept although maybe not so good if you were travelling with a friend! There was a venetian blind between the panes of glass but we never managed to work out how to close it. The deck on the roof is great for a relaxing drink although it was a little too chilly to test the pool when we were there. One negative thing I have seen in other reviews is the fact thet there is a lot of building work around which spoils the view. True there are a lot of buliding going up and cranes nearby but we weren't disturbed by the noise at all. I guess it isn't the best view in Barcelona but from what I saw most of the upmarket hotels in the city centre were either on narrow lanes with no view at all or on fairly busy streets anyway. If you want a really nice modern hotel AND a beautiful view of the seafront or marina I think you probably need to up your budget. Unless someone knows different and I'd be glad of the reccomendation. I've also seen some people have mentioned that there is a sex shop across the road. Unless you have children who you don't want asking awkward questions or you are particularly sensitive I wouldn't worry about it. The windows are completely blacked out and there is nothing on display from outside.

It's always interesting when you return to a place because you take in more of the detail - and now that the whole 'Hip Hotel' concept is ubiquitous, it's the detail in such places that can often make a passable experience into a special one. So, a few things worth noting with the B as of May 2008: 1. The whole construction thing next door has taken on a nightmarish life of its own since last September. Our room looked out onto the skeleton of what is evidently going to be a multistorey carpark, blocking the view of a fabulous traditional bullring. These rooms are dimly lit anyway (it's what you expect in a hip place, right?) but this carpark monstrosity kills any natural light completely. 2. On the same subject, the rooftop terrace and chillout deck trough (it's only a metre wide so not a pool, but nice for a dip) loses most of its atmosphere when you have workers hanging off cranes just a short distance away. And as for the noise - well, forget any quiet meditative moments gazing towards Tibidabo.... 3. The bathrooms generally get rave reviews at this hotel, but we found a lot of the details pretentious and a triumph of style over substance. The deluge shower is literally that - poorly designed shower panel makes you flood the room in minutes. I just pity their chambermaids having to do the morning flood control! The downlighting makes the mirrors pretty useless - a small illuminated shaving mirror wouldn't be too uncool surely? There are no hooks anywhere. There is a venetian blind system between the bathroom and the bedroom, which we had to ask how to control at the front desk so that my friend and I could enjoy at least a bit of lavatorial privacy!! It really isn't too much nowadays to get the best of beautiful design and practical function in a hotel room, yet the B has way too much of the former. I'd say the place is due a rethink on updating some of its 'hip' features, in order to stay on top of an increasingly competitive market in Barcelona. One practical tip as a parting thought - to avoid minibar charges, there is a fab little kiosk opposite the hotel entrance on Gran Via (next to the sex shop...) and it (the kiosk, not the sex shop) sells everything you find in the minibar at a fraction of the price.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value and good location!\u201d", "Author": "Trish22", "ReviewID": "UR16356494", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the B Hotel for 4 days in March.

Before i forget, please keep in mind that easyjet is the best airline to fly with to Barcelona (as opposed to ryan air) if only because of the airports. Easyjet flies direct to the city centre, whilst Reus and Gerona airports are an hour away. When arriving we were a bit bemused as it is next door to an old bullring which is being made into a shopping centre, so consequently it was like a building site, well actually not LIKE one, it WAS one!! The entrance into the hotel is most impressive,in a very trendy way. A massive sliding wooden door welcomes you, a bright clean entrance,with a relaxed fashionable seating area and bar. The reception staff were very friendly and presentable,and made us feel most welcome. The lift and corridors were very up to date and fresh. The design concept of the hotel is most unusual and very sleek. The bedroom was outstanding,using unique fabrics and materials to create a stunning look. The bathroom was exceptional, the bedroom lovely, with some nice touches including nice accessories, a well stocked mini bar, tv with sky channels. The view was of a shanty town looking scene, but who cares, the hotel was outstanding. On the third floor is the breakfast room. Breakfast is buffet style, with everything you can think of, all freshly made and well presented. On this floor are 2 pcs with free internet access. On the top floor is a rooftop pool and sunbathing area. Again the furnishings were outsatnding, drinks can be ordered from the reception. Piped music is played, whilst looking out over a busy part of Barcelona, and also a crane and builders knocked away at the building site. All very surreal, but an amazing experience. The hotel is situated on a busy tree lined avenue, with lots of benches to stop and chillout. The road is packed with banks,shops and coffee bars. It is about a mile and a half from the main area, but its a lovely walk to and from the hustle and bustle. We felt safe walking home in the early hours, and there are many coffee bars on the way. The hotel is also very close to a major attraction, the art museum, which is placed at the end of a tree lined avenue, up what seems like a million stairs (escalators available). Its fantastic. In the evenings, it is spectacular. There is a massive fountain, which changes colours and performs somersaults in time to classical music. Its an amazing site. Most people ive spoken to since, never knew of its existence. We only found it by chance, but believe me it was fantastic. Even if you dont stay at the B Hotel,and believe me, you should,make sure you visit this monument. In summary, my words can never convey ow amazing our stay was at the B Hotel.

Overall we were very impressed with the hotel. It is within easy reach of the airport, especially if you pick up the Aeroport bus (4.5 euros single) from outside the terminal.

The design is very minimalist and modern, we asked for a quiet room at the back, although we were told all rooms were quiet due to double glazing but we didnt want to chance a room at the front as the road outside is very busy. Staff speak good english and were very helpful to us. We had a twin room , clean & spacious, with plenty of storage space for a short break. The bathroom is lovely but rather dark and it took us till the 3rd day of our stay to find the controls for the motorised blind when gives privacy to the shower/bath! Its on the wall next to the socket nr the sink if you want toknow what to look out for! Bed linen was good quality and 2 nice pillows were provided. Toiletries in bathroom, including, throw away toothbrush & razor with shaing cream, as well as other usual gles & potions. Buffet breakfast was 13 euros each which might sound expensive but we treated ourselves as it was our anniversary. This was served on 1st floor which doubled as business centre (2 pc's with printer - which was out of paper & ink when I wanted to use it to print out our checked in boarding passes!) Breakfast was very good, ranging from an assortment of juices, cereals, dried & fresh fruit, cold meats, cheeses, sausage, hardboiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber etc Also hot food, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, bacon and assorted tortillas. Plenty of different bread & rolls, croissants, including custard filled and chocolate ones. There was also a tart, apple/custard. Toast, jams, marmalades too if you were still hungry. Coffee and tea were brought to table by waiters. We filled up on breakfast so we only needed a snack lunch most days. There is a bar, for having a well earned drink, near to reception, which also serves tapas - if you're there at lunchtimes or early evenings. Placa Espanya Metro is located in the nearby square with at least 8 entrances. A single journey cost 1.30 euros, or a T-10 ticket with 10 journeys for 7.20 is better value, if you are travelling round the city. We found the Metro, clean, quick and efficient. very easy to navigate too. We used the Bus Touristic during the day, which stops in the square. It is a hop on/off bus which runs from 9am to 7pm. You buy the ticket on the bus. It costs 20 euros for 1 day or 26 euros for 2 days. We bought the 2 day tickets and found they were better than the Metro (which we only used for return journeys in the evenings when we went out to restaurants). It also saved our feet when we just wanted a rest and a ride round! There is a narrated description of the sites using free headphones in at least 8 languages! Just plug your phones in a choose your language. The bus has 3 routes, blue - north, red - south and green - east. The blue and red routes are the most useful, stopping at all the major sites. They run every 10 to 15 mins and there are changeover stops which cover blue/red routes. With your ticket you get a book of discount vouchers for the majority of the city sites - such as the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, Maritime Museum (excellent) Fundacion Joan Miro and many others. I booked restaurants for the 3 evenings we were there before I left the UK. I used www.toptable.co.uk a very useful site, which allows you to book restaurants by email in lots of cities around the world.

Overall, I would rate the hotel as being very good value for money. It is a modern hotel (opened 2005) with an interesting design. The rooms are quite large, with a large bathroom/WC area. Although I don\u2019t necessarily expect this in a hotel, on our visit, we always found English-speaking staff present (though some staff were not English speaking). The bar/breakfast manager was English, and very helpful. Breakfast was a buffet, with a variety of foods available (ham, cheese, tortillas, bacon, bread, croissants, cereals, fruit, juice etc.). Snacks/light meals were also available during the day/evening. We chose this hotel because other travellers said it was quiet (despite being on a large thoroughfare). Our room at the back was indeed quiet for three nights, and we slept well on the king-size bed. On the fourth night, a Saturday, some locals held a party nearby \u2013 but this was hardly the hotel\u2019s fault! Overall, the hotel was clean \u2013 bed linen, towels etc. I had one complaint here \u2013 our cleaner did not wipe the vertical surfaces in the bathroom, so that a stain on the side of the sink was not removed. A bit of staff training on cleaning surfaces would help. We didn\u2019t use the small swimming pool on the roof (it was November!) but it was surprisingly sunny and warm for the time of year, so we enjoyed spending half an hour there in the mornings to plan our day. If travelling to or from the airport, unless you have a lot of bags it is worth taking the A1 Aerobus \u2013 this costs less than 4 Euros, and stops at/near the Placa d\u2019 Espanya, just near the hotel. The journey time was around 15 minutes, off-peak. There is a very convenient metro stop at the Placa d\u2019Espanya \u2013 three lines run through it, which get you to the downtown areas in 10 minutes or so. The T-10 (10 journey) tickets are good value. One word of advice \u2013 many of the automatic ticket barriers (but not all!) are \u2018left-handed\u2019 so you need to hold the ticket in your left hand and pass to the right of the barrier. I saw many tourists trying to walk through the barrier to the left of the ticket-checker, and being puzzled that they could not advance \u2013 we did this ourselves, at first! Sights near the hotel include the Montjuic area, with a cable car up to the Castle \u2013 excellent views on clear days. The \u2018magic fountain\u2019 is very near, as is the National Palace \u2013 a very large art gallery. In town, queues for Gaudi\u2019s Sagrada Familia (cathedral) and \u2018La Pedrera\u2019 (town house) were very long \u2013 go early if you want to get inside these. It is easier to get in to the beautiful and highly original Casa Batllo, a short way down the road from La Pedrera. Another spectacular building is the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana (concert hall) \u2013 well worth a visit, with drinks and tapas available in the foyer \u2013 try to catch a concert, if you want to see the upstairs areas.

The hotel is on Plaza Espanya, you can see the metro station from the entrance, and using that, you get anywhere within minutes. We usually went out to eat in the Passeig De Gracia area, and walking back from there was no problem, it took us about 20 minutes, just following the Gran Via. The hotel decor is really something else, they've really made it look like something a lot more expensive than it really is. the bathrooms are quite something, we actually had to phone reception and get instructions on the shower taps. There were a few minor things like some scratches in the flooring and a couple of loose threads on the bedspread, but all in all the room was spacious, comfortable, well-presented and CLEAN. The overall feel of the hotel is that they do try to make an extra effort, for instance the toilets in the public areas all have real towels instead of paper tissues, and free internet access is provided. The rooftop pool is also quite something.

When we arrived at the hotel, we were not dissapointed. It is however important to note that this is not a full services hotel, for example, it has a bar by the rooftop pool but no barman behind it, there is a bar in the main lobby but it shuts at 10:00 in the evening & there is a room to take breakfast in should you so desire...but no restaurant to talk of that will serve dinner etc... For us, that was not a problem becuase if you in Barcelona, quite frankly, you are there to explore the streets anf find bars and restaurants either recommended to you or that you have researched already. This hotel is a design hotel first and foremost so what you will see everywhere are touches of minimalism and bespoke design pieces matched with your trademark design hotel mood lighting. Check-in was efficient and we were racing up to our room in no time at all. At this juncture I feel it necessary to point out that there are two categories of room. The first is your standard room which encompasses a king, queen or two twins together bed (important to specify upon booking) with a modern bath/shower, fun/complicated mood lighting, 20\" LCD television with limited channels and floor to ceiling windows spanning the width of the room with a half metre deep balcony in front. When booking, specify that you would like a room facing the Plaza Espana as the room are very well sound insulated with aircon so worrying about leaving the balcony door open is not an issue and you can wake up to a marvellous yet buzzing view. The second category of room is on the corner of the building and is substantially larger with a 32\" LCD television. My best advice to you is stick with the standard room and specify a high floor with a view of Plaza Espana as you cannot go wrong!!! The roof-top pool is a novelty for a three star hotel and is very attractive with enough loungers to keep you comfortable and some easy chairs and wicker sofas with tables for drinks the you may have. Dont expect to maintain your fitness regime while in the pool here as it is only small but is very refreshing (especially in March) and is wonderful after a hot day exploring Barcelona. We were happy with our room and the service we recieved and having researched many other hotels, I can assure you that you will be hard pressed to find better for the price and location. If you want the five star experience you will find 90% of the time that in a standard room you will be put in an interior facing room next to the aircon generator which is no fun. Here that is not a problem, of course you must remember that they are a 3 star hotel and not to expect the concierge to pull out rservations at \"el bulli\" (Restaurants Number 1 in the world) at a last minutes notice. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and am always irritated by the people that moan about the inpracticalities of the mood lighting, bathrooms and other aspects. You are staying in a design hotel so expect that sometimes the designer will have chosen aesthetics over ergonomics!!!

A couple of minus: 1) the constructions around the hotel really takes away the feeling of convenience and sphere of the hotel environment. I'm sure when the construction is over, the hotel will be more visible. 2) The hotel bar should offer fancy cocktails and the cardio-fitness facilities (in project) should be offered very soon!", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Minibreak\u201d", "Author": "whlsarah", "ReviewID": "UR8054369", "Content": "We went to Barcelona for a few days in May Half term and we were very very happy with our whole trip.

I decided that the brown and grey color scheme wasn't too cheerful and everything combined made the hotel feel to sterile. Also, the location sucks for tourists.

It is at least a 40 minute walk to place de catalunya and nothing that interesting along the way. 20 minutes will get you to Eixample.

Price was ok for the category, except for New Year\u2019s Eve, which was a whooping 85% above the hotel\u2019s low-season rate. Everything positive and negative has already been written by others. I can only add a little: - Location: scary at first sight, because it overlooks a massive traffic roundabout (Espa\u00f1a) which dwarfs the \u00c9toile in Paris and the nearby Arenas which are being rebuilt, the rooms are well insulated acoustically, and we got a good night\u2019s rest without earplugs.

Lesson to be learned: don\u2019t install fancy equipment in your own home. The bed cover looked, in some places, as if it had suffered a close encounter with a cat's claws, but the mattress and the pillows were soft as foam cream. A delight. - Bathroom: the glass cubicle is really not an issue, since you can \u201cclose\u201d it with shades, once you have found the switch! Part of the game, I guess. The sliding door to the loo (which is enclosed in the bathroom) was missing in our room! If privacy/intimacy is an issue for the room occupants, the bathroom is sub-par. Shame, because the design is very nice and pluming of superior quality. - Staff: very positive experience. On arrival, we were given a twin, which I didn\u2019t like.

I wanted to stay on design hotel, I had many choices, but I decided to stay in this hotel for the value they offered the moment I visited Barcelona. LOCATION PRO: This hotel located near Placa d' Espana (about 3 min walking), Montjuic area (the Olympic area), which is nice. The city itself is really worth the visit. The Metro station is near, the tourist info is also so close, the official tourist bus terminal is also on that location. Next to the hotel, I think they are building a matador arena. There are two OpenCor (grocery) nearby that open 24hr. CON: Being so close to the Metro station, you can feel the Metro running under you, even when you are at the 4th floor (this is where I was staying). Also, the area is not a very lively area (unlike Placa Cataluna). Everything is pretty much close, even restaurants are only open on a specific time (8pm -11pm). Even the hotel doesn't serve anything past 11pm. So, it's a bit hard to find food, although I did have a chance to dine at a very nice restaurant for a nice Paella nearby the area (ask the receptionist for advise). Another thing to consider, there is only 1 Money Exchange at the nearby hotel, so prepare to change your money first, since this hotel only accept euros. HOTEL & ROOM PRO: GREAT. Let me say it again GREAT design. It was spacious. The details are pleasently considered. You get the feel of modern art, and modern technology. The light switchs are hi-tech with stainless steel. They use a lot stainless steel in their design style, that makes this hotel a contemporary minimalis. I was awed with all the details they put in the design of the hotel. Even the bathroom blind uses switch to open and close. The placement of the lighting are perfect, gives you a soft, relaxing, and comfort environment. The Hotel itself has some unique nice smell. I got a room with a nice view, overlooking the Gran Via and Placa d'Espana from the little terrace in the room. The top floor supposed to have a terrace with a really nice view of the area, unfortunately it was closed for renovation when I stayed there. Overall impression of the room...WOW! CON: not much, just u can feel the vibration of the Metro going underground and the bathroom is not totally covered, they are only separated by a glass and there is a blind which you can close. And the side, there is a semi transparant green glass that separated the bathroom and the aisle. It was okay, just don't feel like there was total privacy when you take a bath. If you are couples this will be perfect. ;) SERVICE It was okay. Well, more than enough, the staffs were really nice and friendly. They were very helpful, and they speak English fluently. The only drawback was that I had to carry my bag myself as there was nobody from the staff offered to carry my bag to my room nor when I checked out. Other than that, it's good service. They are really good at advising their guest to get around Barcelona. VALUE I booked this hotel for \u20ac100/night include breakfast AND a welcome cava. THIS IS AMAZING, consider the kind of place you are staying and what you get by staying here. Can't get any better. OVERALL CONCLUSION I really recommend this hotel to anyone who visit Barcelona.

For a 3 star hotel in a central location of a major and trendy European city we got our money's worth and then some. The location is not too touristy but that\u2019s fine because of the proximity of the metro which is only few stops from the touristy center. And the connection to the airport via the Aerobus is easy, quick and cheap. The hotel's design is very modern and definitely not cheap looking. Sure it lacks the final finish but this is not a 5 star hotel. It has some cool gimmicks that you would never find in a hotel within the price range in Paris, London, and Amsterdam etc. Such as the automatic lights in the hall or the LEDs in the elevator. Not to mention the very cool pool on the top floor, room & bathroom design, LCD TV etc. The only drawbacks are views of the rooms, which are non-existent, the very late check-in (15:00) and the breakfast is definitely not worth the money. While the staff is not top-notch we did not have any problems with them. And the free Internet on the bottom and 1st floor is a major plus.

I think it was a pretty reasonable price at 130 euros per night for my wife and myself. Don't forget that you get charged an extra 7% tax on top of the room rate. CLEANLINESS Excellent throughout. It was spotless, although there was a slight smell of cigarette smoke in our room which was hardly noticeable. LOCATION / TRAVEL As the other reviewers have said the hotel location is at placa espanya. Easy to get to from the airport. Costs about 25 euros by taxi or about 4 euros by aerobus. The metro (underground / tube) is about 3 minutes walk away, just the other side of the old bull ring (the conversion from a bull ring to a shopping centre has been designed by a UK architect who also designed Madrid airport...). The tourist bus goes from just the other side of the roundabout which is about 3 minutes walk away. Get an all inclusive ticket from one of the official tourist stalls before you leave the airport. They cover travel by aerobus, metro, tourist bus and give discounts for entry to attractions. The hotel is next to a main road and construction is still going on at the bull ring so opt for an upper room. Make sure you get to see the fountain display just across the road which starts around 7pm - ask at reception. FOOD AND DRINK There is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Bummer. However there is a supermarket just down the street where you can get bits and bobs. The hotel offers breakfast at 12 euros, but no lunch or dinner. They have a pretty funky bar as well, but we didn't drink there. Try the maoz bars ([--]) for lunch as they are really tasty and keep you going at 4 euros a shot. FACILITIES There are eight floors to the hotel. If you can, stay on floor seven as they have larger rooms and are really comfortable. Floor eight is the pool area which is great! You can see around the placa from there. If you smoke try to stop, but failing that there is a balcony to each room where you can go to feed your desire. If you do, I hope you don't suffer from vertigo as the balcony is about 18 inches wide with a glass side. The rooms have flat screen TVs, but why would you want to watch TV in Barcelona? They also have mini bars and a fridge. The bathrooms are very \"X-Men - magneto\" like in their tiling but very well done. The shower sprays water over the back of the bath so watch out for that.

I read some great reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor and decided to book it for a few reasons. One, the room was fairly cheap and I heard that it wasn't too far from the city center to worry about transportation. But, BEWARE!... while the hotel itself is nice and modern there are a few setbacks. First, the severly non-chalant attitude of the front desk is particularly frustrating. British airways lost our luggage [do not fly this airline! They have lost thousands of bags since the terror scare and they are doing nothing to accomodate those who are without clothes, medication, toilettries, etc-my friend and I had to buy all that stuff in Barcelona when we should have been sightseeing and buying souvennairs] and we informed the front desk that we were expected our luggage-if found- to be dropped off at the hotel. They wrote this down and took note of our unfortunate situation. We spent FOUR nights at the hotel and on the morning we checked out- they forgot to give us a wake up call, therefor we almost missed our flight to Malaga AND when I told them that my luggage was still missing, they all of a sudden remembered that luggage HAD BEEN delivered- it's was my friend's. They had it for TWO days and did not tell us. Even after we specifically told them that we were expecting our luggage. What did we get for an apology....a shrug of the shoulder and a \"oh, sorry about that\". Totally not acceptable. Now, the hotel is located five minutes from the city center. The metro is a three minute walk and the airbus from the airport stops at the square where the hotel is located. Cabs are anywhere from 10-12 euro depending on where you're going. Oh, and the lights are -- to figure out and they don't believe is clocks. That is why we almost missed our flight besides the complete incompetance of the front desk.

We took a cruise on the Mediterranean so our first night was one night before the cruise and returned for an additional five nights after the cruise. The first night was not an impressive experience. Our flight got in late and when we arrived at 11pm, the receptionist told us there were no other rooms available except for the one that was given to us. I stated on my online reservation that we were on our honeymoon and found two single beds pushed together. The sheets were seperate, so as a honeymoon couple, we couldn't even snuggle up together. We also experienced a very hot and humid room with the toilet area smelling like urine. The only way we could cool down a bit, the AC was not working in our room, was to open the door to the outside, but there was a vent blowing from the outside and was loud. I was glad to be out of that room after one night. I could not stand it and had my doubts about returning. Oh, and the light switches are not easy to use in any of their rooms. They operate near the front door, even the bathroom lights, and you do not know if you have turned on the bathroom light until you go back and forth to check. It is not convenient for anybody who really has to use the bathroom in an emergency. Thankfully our experience on the second lag of our journey was better. We got to the hotel on the wee hours of 9:30am on a Sunday morning after our cruise. The room wasn't ready, which I was prepared for, so they asked us to come back around 2, as they stored our luggage in the back room. We went to Las Rambla, came back, and were told our room still wasn't ready. We previously told them we were on our honeymoon and we wanted to make sure we were going to be sleeping in the same bed. They upgraded us to room 705 which is one of the biggest rooms they have in the hotel, and the receptionist was very apologetic for their tardiness to get our room ready. It was definitely in a better condition than the one we were previously in. Though I still smelled urine in the bathtub and one night around our bed, I do not know if the housekeepers use the same towels to clean the toilet and the other areas of the room, but it was quite disgusting to experience this multiple times. Other than the few probems early on, I finally got situated into the room and became comfortable after the first day. I found the free internet access very accomodating for guests - there is one by the lobby and two in the business center which is available until 12am. The pool is open from 9-9 and is quite nice, very long, but we didn't have time to swim in it. The metro is ony 3 blocks away and is easy to use. We noticed that the colossium next door was under construction and was worked on during the night time which caused a little noise in our room. I was still able to sleep through it and it seemed like construction stopped once there was sun light. We found the staff to be curteous and we had an unexpected cancellation with our flight which forced us to stay an extra night. When we first spoke to the receptionists about staying an extra night, they informed us that we would have to move to another room. I was a bit surprised that we couldn't stay in our current room. My husband went back down the next morning to ask about staying in our room and this time the receptionist said it was fine. To our experience, the staff members in the morning time were more experienced. Forget the night time staff as they are newbies and really do not know what they are doing.

We were situated on the 6th floor in one of the corner rooms(by request at check in). The corner rooms are slightly larger than the normal room size giving a broader window view and a desk to put things on. The bedroom is nice and modern and spacious and is of the same style as the rest of the hotel. Lighting system in the room, is awkward and takes a few touches to get the right lights on and off etc. I can see why previous occupants have had trouble working the lights. The buttons are multi use, and their is a half second delay in lights coming on so can be confusing. Bathroom is nice and trendy....no locks on door though and transparent window with blinds(controlled thru switch by sink) can be un nerving if not sharing with your partner. Bath and shower are combined in one. The Double bed is two singles pushed together, quite often i found myself falling into the gap as i shifted to other side of bed to give the mrs a cuddle. A proper Double bed would have been better but from reading reviews two singles joined together are the norm in spain. Minibar fridge available in room which is also handy to store drinks bought from the local shop at cheap prices. Traffic noise is hearable from the room, due to the busy plaza espanya being 200metres away but is a low hum in background. If you like absolute silence in your room then this wont be the hotel for you. The double glazing windows do a good job of keeping majority of road noise out. Location of hotel is excellent. 200m from placa espanya, which is home to the national museum and the gorgeous nightly water fountain show. Very handy being right on your door step. Metro and bus stops are right nearby. Metro is very efficient. Buy a ten stop ticket and use this on your stay or a multi day pass. Much more economic than buying single tickets every time. Internet PCs are available for use on the 1st floor, including a inkjet printer, and usb ports. The breakfast service had a good variety (if your not vegetarian), but certainly not worth paying 12 euro extra for, if not included in your room price. Instead you could nip down to the local shop and get a much better selection for a much cheaper price. Only real negative i found with the hotel was the lack of an iron available. We did manage to get one delivered to the room for a short period of time. The hotel instead promotes their in house ironing/laundry service. A number of staff informed us (incorrectly) the ironing service was free but the order slip showed otherwise. Summary of hotel Pros : Location Cost Modern, Clean Hotel Good Staff Excellent Aircon Nice rooftop sunning area and small pool Free Internet PC's to use. Local shop nearby for COLD drinks and pastries, nibbles etc. Cons: No irons available (unless you are persistent), they promote their in-hotel ironing service (at cost) instead. A little traffic noise (this didnt bother me) Breakfast not worth asking money if not included with room. Only 2 english channels on the TV, Sky news and bbc world.

I decided against the Hotel Jazz (which is part of the same hotel group [----------]) because its in the noisy, busy central area. Prefer the peaceful life meeee! Stayed in room 711 on the very top floor (the roof infinity pool is on the 8th floor). Hotel review as follows: ADVANTAGES: 1. Location \u2013 superb location. -Close to the Espanya Metro Station (5 mins via Metro to La Rambles on L3 Green Line). -Close to the AeroBus stop (the A1 blue bus. 15 mins journey to airport. Every 8 mins. Cost 3.75 Euros per ticket). Much cheaper than taxi fare (25-30 euros) -Close to the MNAC, Pobla Espanyol and Water Fountain attractions (10 mins walk). These sites were the highlight of my trip despite seeing the Gaudi Attractions, Barcelona FC stadium and Port Guell areas. -Situated in a nice quiet residential area. Felt safe walking around even at 12am!! Close to shops toooo 2. Hotel Infinity Pool: - WOW \u2013 offers views of the Placa Espanya and wayyyy beyond. WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW - Opens 8am \u2013 8pm. Pretty busy in the afternoon but there is ample space for everyone. Water can be cold in the morning. - I think the hotel was building a BBQ on the rooftop when I was leaving. - Rooftop included pool, changing room with washing facilities and a trolley containing spare towels. 3. Room: -Room 711 was a very good size. -Only one of three rooms with a clear view window \u2013 check with hotel. -Very nice modern appearance with cracking fittings. -Check out the ceiling in the lift \u2013 changes colour as you move up and down. Nice touch. -Cleaning staff did a great job with the room. Sparkling bathroom every morning. 4. Staff - Staff very fluent in English. Very helpful when I was pickpocketed in Las Rambles area. Helped me contact Police and organised crime report. 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE. -Booked the Tablao Carmen Flamenco show for me. Located at the nearby Pobla Espanyol. Cracking show. Lovvvvved it!!!!! 5. Internet access: - 24HR Internet access in foyer was a godsend for checking work emails. DISADVANTAGES: 1. Room: -The shower has blinds which I couldn\u2019t close. Hence, shower is see-through. Shower maybe weird if you go with family or friends. (just close your eyes !!) -Electronic button lighting system can be tricky for some visitors. All in all, this is a feature packed, modern hotel which should have a 4-star status. Add to this a great location, helpful staff and beautiful views from the rooftop pool and you are definitely onto a winner. Simply superb!!!!!!!!!.

The bathroom is stylish with a super power shower. The glass panelling alongside the bath with the partially open venetian blind that cannot be adjusted did not bother us. Our only reservation is that an older person or someone who was not fully mobile may find it difficult to climb in and out of the bath as it was inset and there was a fairly wide ledge to negotiate. The lighting was entertaining - not sure we'd got the hang of the system even after 8 days but so what! It was brilliant to return to the hotel in the afternoon or evening to superb air conditioning - much needed in the 30 degree plus temperatures. The hotel is 200 metres from the first drop off stop for the airport bus - price 3.5 euros each. It's 3 metro stops from the Ramblas - or a 35 -40 minute walk. The nearest Starbucks is about a 20 minute walk away. The nearest convenience store is 100 metres away - ideal for water, cold drinks and alcohol. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would certainly stay at the hotel again and recommend it to others.

For the price (100 euros per night for a double room) we thought it was good value. Despite the building work going on at the bull ring nearby and the busy traffic on the roundabout, the room (which faced the Gran Via) was relatively quiet and we had no trouble with street noise at night. It was nice that the windows opened onto a little balcony. The beds were very comfortable - there were two singles pushed together rather than a double, but this is apparently quite common. We had read about the problems with the lights on Tripadvisor before we arrived but it still took a while to work out which buttons to press \u2013 I think that whoever designed the lighting was trying too hard to be clever and what could have been a quirky feature turns into something quite annoying especially if you want to use the bathroom in the night without waking your partner. The reception staff are very efficient and friendly but housekeeping leaves a lot to be desired. The range of toiletries is good when you first arrive (the usual shower gel, shampoo and soap, plus razor, toothbrush, comb, individual packs of tissues, bath sponge and more). Unfortunately, none of these were replaced during the stay and we had to ask every day for more. I know that most people would take some of these items, but does anyone take bars of soap for washing your hands? They are so tiny that I lost one down the plughole in the sink the first night, never to be seen again! The mini bar is a nice touch, but again, there were no replacements until we asked. To be fair, the receptionists seemed as baffled as we were with these housekeeping problems but resolved them very quickly. Room service was a bit hit and miss \u2013 we ordered \u2018Coffee Americano\u2019 twice. The first time was fine, the second, they delivered Espresso and we had to reorder. Check your bill if there are any errors, as they did try to charge for both. It would be useful if there were coffee making facilities in the room as with all UK and US hotels. The pool on the roof was very handy for a little rest after a busy day and was very quiet. There is a Metro station within a couple of minutes walk which connects you with the rest of the city (buy a ticket to cover you for the number of days you are there). There really aren\u2019t many places to eat or drink in the immediate vicinity, so this is very useful.

The view is really nice as well. We got a horrible view of the back of a dodgy building with clothes hanging in the balcony with our first room, but the reception was quick to change it to a more pleasant one. The location is a little rough. There arent any pleasant restraunts or cafes within a walking distance. Plaza Espania is a walk away and has the coolest musical fountain show on sundays though.

It is also within walking distance of Barcelona\u2019s main attractions if you don\u2019t mind long walks, which I enjoy.

The negatives are that the hotel is located on Gran Via, one of Barcelona\u2019s main thoroughfares and, at night, a drag strip for wanna-be Spanish Grand Prix drivers. All night long, drivers blared their car horns in sync in support of the Spanish Grand Prix driver, Fernando Alonso, who had just won the race. We hardly slept a wink. Even the night before the Grand Prix we couldn\u2019t sleep for all the traffic roaring just outside all night long \u2013 it was like sleeping on a motorway overpass.

However, when we asked the front desk if they could provide us with some replacement bottles of water, they said no! The hotel bar, such that it is, was already long closed at midnight, and they declined our practical suggestion of opening up one of the unoccupied rooms to give us bottles of water from an unused mini-bar. I had to make do with half a glass of warm water left over on my bedside table from the previous night (which fortunately the maid had neglected to take away when she cleaned the room), and my partner had to quaff a bottle of too-sweet tonic water. What possible excuse can there be not to be able to give guests some additional bottles of water, even if the request is made at midnight? Another disappointment was the character-less hotel bar. I had expected to enjoy a gin and tonic in the evening at the poolside bar on the roof, but in fact, there was no poolside bar anymore. Even the bar in the main lobby was non-existent after 9 p.m. and completely lacking in atmosphere. Breakfast at \u20ac25 for two was a modest continental-style buffet with a range of cereals, bread rolls, croissants, hams and cheese, which quickly ran out and weren\u2019t replaced. Hard boiled eggs were provided, but cooked breakfasts aren\u2019t offered. Coffee and hot water for tea are dispensed from push-top Thermos-type containers rather than freshly made to order. Although the hotel has a certain minimalist style that makes it more appealing than, say, a Holiday Inn, it has absolutely none of the buzzy atmosphere or style of the hotels it is apparently trying to emulate, such as The Mercer in NYC, or The Sanderson, One Aldwych and St Martins Lane in London. I have stayed in each of those hotels, and B-Hotel is nothing more than a cheap, Ikea-styled facsimile of those truly stylish hotels. The metallic bedspread had pulls and loose threads on it and the carpets in the hallways were stained. All in all, I would say if you're a light sleeper or looking for a truly stylish hotel, you should stay elsewhere. If you just want a change from the usual B&B and chain hotel experience and don't mind an absense of real style and atmosphere, soundproofing or bottles of water at midnight, then by all means stay at B-Hotel.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "gemybell", "ReviewID": "UR5015676", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and we were very happy.

The shower was excellent, as was the rest of the bathroom, although I could have done with a bit more light in the toilet. Actually, the room in general could have used a little more lighting. As others have mentioned, the lighting system is a somewhat quirky. Apparently our room was normally a twin, but with the 2 beds pushed together. To be honest, I would find the room a bit lacking in privacy if I was sharing it with someone I wasn't already intimate with - 1. there are no locks on the toilet door, and the bathroom has merely a sliding door that doesn't fully close & 2. you can see into the shower from the bedroom.......I was with my girlfriend, so it wasn't an issue for us, but business travellers should maybe take note. Breakfast was not included in our deal, so cannot comment on the food. The location however was good. It's just off Placa Espanya which is the first stop on the airport bus.

When we arrived they couldn't find our booking but after ten minutes or so of looking they did. When we went to our room we found they had given us a twin room and we had booked a double. We went back to reception to explain that we had booked a double not a twin and we were told that in Spain there is no word for twin and that a \"double\" just means it sleeps two whether it's two single beds or one double bed. The staff member who told us this was very abrupt. We were told that getting a double room was \"NOT POSSIBLE\" until the next day. We were disappointed but we agreed. The next day we went out early and when we came back we found that they had put double sheets and covers over the two single beds. We went back to reception and we were told that all their \"double beds\" were like this. We were given a different room that was slightly bigger but the beds were exactly the same. On the day we arrived we returned to the hotel at just after 11pm. There seemed to be a party in full swing in the bar area. I asked the barman for some drinks and he told me it was \"NOT POSSIBLE\" as the bar was closed. The loud noise from the party continued for three or four hours. The next night my boyfriend tried to call room service to order some food. It was before 10pm and room service is supposed to be available until 11pm. The phone rang out a number of times. I decided to phone reception. A member of staff answered and I said who I was and my room number and HE HUNG UP ON ME. At this point we decided not to deal with the hotel staff anymore. Besides the hotel staff being unbelievably rude I found the interior to be gimmicky. The lighting doesn't work very well and is pretentious. Although the light function buttons were the same in both rooms the buttons didn't work properly in the second room and we couldn't dim the lights. I think the finish in the rooms lacked attention to detail and that they cut corners where ever possible. I liked the showers but if you want to have a bath the taps are hard to reach (you have to climb into the bath to turn them on). Also there was no hot water after 11.30ish. The hotel building is quite nice overall the rooms are reasonably comfortable. It was great to have internet access in the rooms. It could have been a much more pleasant stay.

The lift doors actually open onto the roof, and the pool is breathtaking, like something out of a hip-hop video.

This hotel is of a VERY high standard for the money. The thing that stops it getting higher star rating is the absence of a restaurant. This is how the Star-rating system works. No restaurant means it can't get any higher. We stayed for 5 nights, in October - after the end of the main tourist season really. The room was great. Clean, crisp and modern. The double bed was two single's wedged together, but it was HUGE and hardly noticeable. The bath was lovely, although it took us 10 minutes to find the tap! (Modern fixtures!) The only slight 'quirk' was that the wall between the bed and the bath/shower was glass. No curtain or anything. So whether you wanted to or not, you got to watch your roommate soaping themselves! Fine if you're a couple, but if you're away sharing and on business or just friends, you might not be so keen! I'm guessing twin rooms must have a different arrangement. Room was missing things that you'd expect in the UK such as a tray of coffee/tea and a kettle, but apart from that was wonderfully appointed. Great views of Placa Espana from the room - particularly impressive at night. Room service was fine if you fancied a lazy night, and very well priced - cheaper than most of the restaurants in the vicinity. The Hotel was very easy to find - right outside Espana Metro stop and the first stop for the Aerobus from the Airport. I'd recommend getting a 'barcelonacard' - available with Expedia before you go, or at the main tourist office at Placa Catalunya (about 20mins walk if you feel like it). Free Metro travel and some freeby sightseeing trips/museum entry and a boat trip. Made the holiday SO easy. The swimming pool was open in Oct, but was ABSOLUTELY FREEZING! Couldn't believe it. It was lovely to stand/lounge on the roof by the pool though and enjoy the view. Especially in the rain, but I might just be odd.
