I never expected it to be even more than we saw what was in the pictures or the website. It was amazing and our experience here was extra ordinary, for a budget hotel as this one. The staff was excellent with us. Special thanks to Mr. Turgut Yazici and one more manager who was responsible for the day shift. The owner was very polite and helpful throughout my booking and stay at the hotel. Overall i loved the hospitality. They were always extra helpful to us for any questions or queries we put forward. The location is exactly what we wanted. Quiet and yet 1 min walk from the closest station (Gulhane). Walking distance from all the famous spots (Blue Mosque, Cistern, Haga Sophia, Spice Bazaar, etc).

The restaurant at the top of the building overlooks the Aya Sophia and the Bospherous so we moved up there for sessions on the laptop as well as for eating. My quality scores are based on what a small hotel should provide without swimming pool etc. and it is relief to be away from the large marbled type of hotel. The staff are very helpful and Reception understand English well. Opposite there is a pleasant restaurant called Turkish Kitchen, handy if you want to wear high heels one evening as Istanbul is not a city for anything but comfortable sensible shoes. My room lacked storage drawers and the wardrobe is very small. All the usual freebies are provided though. Rooms at the front suffer from road noise. Istanbul is truly one of the world's most interesting cities and highly recommended. On the negative side, I suggest an alcohol free holiday as even plonk is very expensive at up to \u00c2\u00a350 per bottle in an ordinary restaurant. There are lots of scams which you just come to expect. Lots of things are being quoted in euros now and we had to make some payments in euros. I have not seen any bad behaviour here and people give up their seats to women and the old. There are no drunks and no threatening yobs. Do not touch the cats. I was bitten by one being naturally drawn to felines. I decided to get rabies injections although it is very rare. If you do get it, it is fatal. The state hospital was tatty but quick and it was free. The private hospital I went to did not have the serum.

Collection went smoothly and registration on arrival was very quick. Rooms were simple affairs, nice and clean with en suites. TV only has one english speaking channel, the rest being in Turkish. Wifi access is available at no charge plus in the reception there is a computer also free to use. Beds were made each day and were comfy.

There is a nice roof restuarant which we didn't use but it had some nice views. The main tourist attractions are all within walking distance. The blue mosque and Ayia Sofia as si the tokapi palace, the Byzantine cistern and the Harbour. One irriatiting thing is the amount times you get propositioned to eat iin a restaurant whenever you so much as come within 50 yards of one. Tip - ask the price before you buy, we got ripped off eating at a place called Urfa' Live as we were shown menu's without all prices on them and then some imaginary tac was added on top. The harbour was pleasant and I would thorughly recommend a boat ride across the bosphorous. I cost us 10 lira each (\u00c2\u00a34.20)with my 7 year old going free as he did so in every attraction we went to. I used Lira to pay for most things, as often if you use Euros you get ripped off, i.e. the price for somethoing may be 5EURO but then when you say you want to pay in Lira they still say 5 which is about half the price. There is a MacDonalds and Burger king, although the service is not very fast and prices are somewhat dear.

It is walking distance to the Blue Mosque and a tram ride from the new City. The staff are friendly and the wireless internet access is free and fast enough. How the hotel ever got a 4* rating is beyond me... Ok, so it is clean enough and the staff are friendly, however, the rooms are little better than a glorified hostel. If you get a room at the back of the hotel (a 50-50 chance...) you will have no natural light to speak of, a tiny window you are better off leaving closed and a tiny space around your bed.. The rooms are noisy with paper thin walls and I ended up unplugging my mini-bar (only to hear the one in the room next to me!). Breakfast is ok... not great but ok. Buffet style but not a lot of choice. I guess I got what I paid for. If I had paid 4* prices and got the Sude Konak, I would NOT be happy at all!!! The Hotel is probably closer to 2* standard. Don't be tempted to pay 4* money - you will be dissapointed.

What you see on the website has nothing to do with what is in front of you when you are there. I got room 201 at Sude Konak. A box with walking space around the bed only. The only window that you could open is surrounded by 3 walls and water/sewerage pipes run all the way throuhg. The best solution, to close the window. On the first night, at 2.00 in the morning, there were teenagers making noise, I really mean noise, in their rooms and in the corridor, screaming. Nobody would tell them to remain quiet as decent guests are sleeping. At 04.00, there was a terrible noise in the breakfast room. Some were up for breakfast (it was Ramadan time) and the phone in the reception would ring very loud several times, nobody would pick it, you would hear cuttelry, plates, screaming until 06.30am, at which time I would be authorised to have some sleep, before others wake up and go for breakfast at 08.00am. There is a lack of respect over there. Everyone is free to follow his/her religion and do what he/she wants. But one has to make sure that this freedom doesn't intrude in other people's private life and intimacy.

This Hotel was wonderful in so many ways. I spent a good month trying to find the perfect hotel for our stay and budget. The way it is in Istanbul is that there are very few world-recognized brands and that the majority of hotels are small houses, buildings turned into hotels. Here are the reasons why I will be returning to the Sude Konak on my next trip to Istanbul: Location: Perfect! Its situated only a few meters from most attractions in sultan ahmet - So ther ewas never a shortage of things to do or see. (Ie. Taksim is great because of the square, isteklal street, but very modern and can get a bit borning for those looking to get the full Turkish experience, Aksary (whom our travel agent had offered to get us accomodations is a BAD idea for tourists, especially for safety, and lack of things to do or see, although it could be a bit more affordable its about 15min away from sultanahmet by tram (which stops operating at aruond midnight) Staff: Where phenomenal - Simply put helped us in every way. Yadigar was most helpful, well informed of the city, and was able to provide us with information needed for tours, recomendations, and even helped us plan a few out of the city excursions. Safety: We were three girls travelling, and Istanbul as great as it is, after 10pm streets tend to quiet down and Safety was a concern for us. The nice thing about Sude konak, is because its in a slightly busier area of the city, hence we were able to stay out until 11...12 MAX. Also, its a few steps away from the Tram stop of \"Guhlane\" making it easier and safer for us to come home late at night, without having to pass by roads less travelled. Cleanliness: I found our rooms to be very clean, well maintained, same with restaurant (beautiful Patio restaurant overlooking Aya Sofia) and Breakfast area. Breakfast: was delicious, a traditional turkish style breakfast. Price value: All included we got a great value for our money!! Sude Konak was definetly a great choice for us!", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cA very nice stay\u201d", "Author": "annbentsjord", "ReviewID": "UR17488804", "Content": "We were 3 persons staying for one week in a tripple room.

The food on the hotel is among the best. Spesial the food from the grill. Rooms and bathrooms are quite ok. They clean the rooms every day. We have absolutly nothing to complaine about the cleaning. A very big pluss is that the hotel is located in the middle of everything. You can walk to the most populare places.
